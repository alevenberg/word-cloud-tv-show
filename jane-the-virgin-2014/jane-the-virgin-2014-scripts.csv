"_ Our story begins 13 and a half years ago, when Jane Gloriana Villanueva was a mere ten years old. It should be noted that at a mere ten years old, Jane's passions include in no particular order her family, God, and grilled cheese sandwiches. _ This is Jane's grandmother, Alba Gloriana Villanueva. Her passions include God and Jane, in that particular order. _ _ _ _ Really, Mom? Shh. But this is so lame. Mommy, shh! This is Jane's mother, Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva. Her passions include Jane and Paulina Rubio. The order is not important. _ Bien. _ _ - I can't. - _ _ _ _ _ And Jane never did. Oh, Jane We should I know. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Stop. We should stop. Whew. Ah Don't forget this. Thanks for stopping by. Ay, ay, ay. At least you could turn it down. _ _ Mom, she doesn't have to watch if she doesn't want to. Of course I'm gonna watch. You guys got me hooked on these things. But you really have to know telenovelas have ruined romance for me. Shh, shh, shh. _ _ _ What? Nothing. Eat your grilled cheese. Meanwhile, 8.2 miles away from where Jane lives, but half a world away Raf? Babe. You all right? Yeah. Yeah. Just thinking. Worrying about the hotel. Look, if anything goes wrong, your father will help out. Stop. Do you know who feels bad about taking money? People who have too much. That's better. See? You just need to relax. You're starting to seem desperate, Petra. I do not blame you. Your husband does not love you anymore. - You're wrong, mother. - It's all right. Tomorrow will change everything. - I still haven't decided whether - Oh, you will. You will. Maybe Michael's gonna propose. My sisters say guys get all cheeseball before they propose. No way. We have a timeline, all right? I haven't gotten my teacher's degree yet. - We just merged our calendars - You've been dating for two years and you haven't boned. He might move up your timeline. Everybody decent? Who are you? Roman Zazo. But everyone calls me Zaz. I work for the, uh, management company that just bought the hotel. So you can think of me as your new boss. Pick a straw, please. Pick one, keeping in mind there's nothing to worry about as long as you're outstanding at your job. Pick one. Which benefits us all, seeing that we have the same goal, that goal being to make bank. Okay. Let's see those straws. What's your name? - Jane. - But everyone calls her Jaz. Okay, Jaz. Congratulations. You get the tail. I can't believe we have to do this. Do what? I don't know, Luisa. Raf, if you're not happy, end it. - It's hard. Petra stood by me. - I know. But that doesn't mean that you owe her your whole life. Look, you've changed. I mean, of course you did. If you didn't change, then I'd be worried about you. And you know what? It's a good thing, because you were so insufferable before. Hey! As your sister, I can say that. I loved you then, I love you now and if you do get a divorce, it doesn't make you our father. Thanks, Lu. Now go home to your wife. Say hi to Allison for me. Hey, do you remember a guy named Rafael Solano when we worked at the yacht club? He was, like, a member.. The jerk you had a monster crush on? I didn't have a monster crush on him. We talking about the same guy? You had a magical kiss. Who'd you have a magical kiss with? No one. I was young. It was nothing. What was nothing? Hey, I need someone to run champagne to cabana four ASAP. I got it. I'll hand out glasses. You look familiar. Really? Hmm. - I'm not sure. - No, I really think we've met. I don't usually wear clamshells. Oh. The strip club on Biscayne? Jerk. Please. A toast. To my husband. - Welcome back, babe. - Oh. Luisa. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Doctor's office Oh, there you are, Dr. Alver. You're running a little behind. Remember you're covering for Dr. Peters. You have an insemination in seven, then a pap in eight. Um, yeah, an-an insemination and a pap. I got it. - Should I - No, I got I got it. Luisa, I messed up. I messed up. I love you. I'm a screwed-up person. She means nothing to me, I swear. I don't even care Nice to meet you, Ms. Villanueva. Are you ready for your insemination? Hi. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm a little tired. I'm Jane. I usually see Dr. Peters? Oh, I'll be filling in for her while she's on her honeymoon Anyway, um, I'm Dr. Alver. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Um Can you can you just scoot down a little bit, please? Um, did you did you bring anyone with you? Here? No. Just me. Ah, you're doing it alone. Good for you. It's probably easiest that way. Dr. Alver, are you sure you're okay? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God, this is so unprofessional. I'm I'm-I'm I'm just going through some personal problems. I'm sorry. I'm sorry Hey, we all have 'em, right? Yeah, you know what? Like, if you want me to come back, maybe I can just Oh, okay. - You're starting. - No, because you'd have to wait a whole month, and that's not fair to you. Okay. All done. You should get your results in two weeks. That's it? That's it. Good luck, and again, I'm I'm so sorry for No. No, it's okay. And I hope that everything turns out okay for you. Yeah. I didn't know that you were coming. I had the nurse unfreeze Rafael's sperm. A surprise for him. That's why I didn't tell you. You guys are so close, I didn't want to put you in an awkward position. Oh. I Look, if you don't do it, someone else will. And I know from the Internet that you can't refreeze the sample, so unless you want the sperm to die And suddenly, just like that, Luisa realized what she'd done. But alas, it was too late. Jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas. Later, when asked about the so-called ""Immaculate Conception of Jane Gloriana Villanueva,"" Luisa Alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life. Come in. It wasn't. I didn't know who else to call. You said it was an emergency? I artificially inseminated the wrong woman, so I need a lawyer. I don't practice law anymore. You know that. I am scared. I need someone that I can talk to. Your wife, your brother. I walked in on Allison last night in bed with her assistant. I'm sorry that happened. And it was Raf's sperm. What?! Petra came in for an insemination, and I accidentally used his specimen on someone named Jane Gloriana Villanueva. Were you drinking? No. No. My God, no! I wasn't. What did you tell Petra? I didn't. I panicked. I walked into the room, and I inseminated her with saline. ""You might be a father."" We'll know in two weeks. I used your sample, baby. You what?! Without telling me? I wanted it to be romantic. I wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic. What are the chances this will take? Twenty percent. Don't say anything. You're already on probation. You could lose your license. But what about Raf? I mean, it was his only sample. And it's gone. How will telling him change that? Mom, stop staring. Come to my gig tomorrow night, boo. Ah. Don't you judge. The best way to get over a man is to get under a new man. Trust. Well, as long as you're not talking to Bruce, I'm happy. Oh, man, you know that guy Darrell who's dating slutty Crystal Well, he found out that she's been boning Mauricio, but she tried to deny it, but there was this text she sent him where she's, like, naked and grabbing her boobs. You want to see? Pass. I already sent it. You all right, baby? Fine. I'm just a little nauseous. Wait. Why are you talking to slutty Crystal? - I thought you hated her. - Yeah, I know, but I just found out her brother-in-law knows Paulina Rubio's bassist, so I got to kiss her ass. Hopefully, I don't get an STD. Oh, Mom, I did not need to see Crystal got fake boobs. - Those are her breakup boobs. - Hmm. Come on, let's get up. - But you're not feeling good. - Mom Jane! Nausea and fainting spell solved. You're pregnant. It's I'm sorry, but she's just not pregnant. No, I'm not pregnant. We tested your urine. Trust me, the test is wrong. False negatives are frequent, false positives are rare. Jane, did you and Michael? No, we didn't. And it may be rare, but it happened, 'cause I'm a virgin. - A virgin? - Yeah. Maybe we should talk in private. No. No, we don't need to talk in private. I think we do. Where did you get your degree from, the University of Dumb-ass? My daughter said that she is a freakin' virgin, so do another damn test! Pink means pregnant. But I've never had sex! Immaculata. You are immaculata. What? - No, Mom. - Clearly, she's not a virgin. Of course I am! That's a mistake. It's not a mistake. Or it's a hormonal thing. Exactly, pregnancy hormones. What?! I understand that this is unplanned. - Hail Jane, full of grace - Hi. Hello. This is Jane Villanueva. I need to talk to Dr. Alver, because I have a crazy doctor saying that I'm pregnant. - Blessed is the fruit of - Shh! Of the womb! I'm not pregnant. Just say it. No. You're not. - I'm sorry. - No, Lu. It's not your fault. Well, you see it is, actually. What do you mean? Two weeks ago, when I walked in on Allison with It doesn't matter. Two weeks ago, um I used your specimen on the wrong person. Excuse me? You what?! I inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly. She's here. I had sex with Bruce three days ago. What?! Why are you telling me this? I don't know. What if you're like a religious messiah? I can't lie to a religious messiah. - Hey, there. - Dr. Alver, hi. Thank you for seeing me. It's the craziest thing, right? These pregnancy tests keep coming back positive, and there's got to a reason. Right? Like some kind of hormonal thing or There is a reason, and the reason the tests came back positive is I accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago. What? You what?! It was a mistake. I made a mistake. And there was only a-a 20% chance that it would take, so I-I thought that you would never know, but things turned out differently. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ - I'm so sorry, Jane. - You're sorry?! You should be in jail, lady. You should be locked up. - Mom - There's options. This is a prescription for a pill that you could take. Um, of course, you are under no obligation to consult with the father, but he does know. The father. The father. Honey? - I have to go. - Wait. No. I have to go. One sec, babe. Hey. You're a little bit early. Yeah. Oh Hey, what's all this? I thought we were going out? I made dinner. Grilled cheese. That sounds perfect. Okay um, before we eat, I just want to give you fair warning that I'm about to say some pretty corny stuff. Okay, ground rules: Not allowed to freak out, 'cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about. Michael what are you doing? I'm proposing. But, I mean our timeline. Who cares about the timeline? Or that, you know, you don't have your teaching degree or that I haven't established my career, or that we have debts, or whatever other reasons we have for waiting. As of today, we've been together for two years. - Michael, just - Wait, wait, before you say anything I'm not doing this because I want to have sex with you, okay? I mean, I I do want to have sex with you, 'cause two years is a really, really long time, but that's not why I'm proposing, okay? I'm proposing because I want to spend my life with you. And raise children with you. And have sex with you. So, Jane Gloriana Villanueva, will will you Michael, I'm pregnant. What will serve Michael Cordero Jr. well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts. Okay, I need you to tell me again everything that happened, exactly as it happened. Going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened. I know. I know. I'm just I'm freaking out a little bit here, babe. I know. Me, too. And the fact was this sucked. I invited over our families. I was pretty sure you'd say yes. Michael, I would have. Should we just pretend like you did? For now? Yes. Probably shouldn't drink. I need another drink. I can't believe Luisa didn't tell you. Yeah. She's dead to me. I want it. The kid? An unexpected by-product of cancer. They should put that in the manual, right? Being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them. Petra'll never go for it. Dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo. I'm not gonna lie I thought she'd bolt. Look, I'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her. Thank you for coming. What are you doing here, man? Well, I got to admit I was hurt, you know? Not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party. Oh, well, I'm, uh, sorry I hurt your feelings, Billy. - Uh-uh. - Don't treat me like that. Like what? Like I'm a bomb that could go off. Which, uh we know that I could, right? I mean, everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy. Do not threaten me. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? Whoa, whoa, all right? Hey, look, I just came here to, uh, congratulate you on your engagement, that's all. So. Why don't you, um, introduce me around. I met Jane's mom. Seems like a handful. Where's her pops? Where's he? He's not a part of her life. Oh, really? Bet there's a story there. There's not a story. Jane has never met her father. In fact, Xiomara herself hadn't seen Jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant. The same day he told her to get rid of it. Until 16 months ago, when she walked into Carla's Croquetas and saw Jane's father again. Right there. In broad daylight. Let's talk, Janie. Mom, I'm not in the mood, all right? I got a big test coming up, I just want to study. But baby, I know how you feel. I was 16 when I got pregnant with you and I was so scared. You were irresponsible. You got pregnant because you were irresponsible. I don't even have a dad. And I've done everything right my whole life, I've tried to do everything right so that I'd So you won't turn out like me. I told you I didn't want to talk. I got the prescription. In case. You don't have to have a baby. Would you have had me? Huh? If Grandma hadn't made you? I'm glad I had you. That's not what I asked. Yeah, I know. Of course I want the baby. It's your child, so it's my child. You look so surprised. I guess I am. A little. My sister has to stop calling. I'll take care of it. Luisa, he really doesn't Slow down. Slow down. Who works here? Jane. The manager said you wanted to see me? Yeah. Look, I'm sorry that I called you a jerk the other night. I was just in this * I'm the father. What? Of the baby that you're carrying. And I'm sorry about the other day, too. I used to work at Golden Harbor Yacht Club. That's where we know each other from. - Oh, yes. - No. I mean, you don't have to act like you remember No, no, I do. I remember. I-I came in, after tennis, at the end of summer, and the restaurant was closed. You let me in anyways, and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich. One-third white cheddar, one-third yellow cheddar, one-third grated American. And then we talked. - Mm-hmm. - Well, it depends. Am I being practical or brave? Practical. I'm a teacher. Brave. I'm a writer? I have never said that out loud before. Be brave. And I never called. I was kind of a jerk back then. It was a long time ago. Still I'm sorry. I'm not ready to be a mom. We'd take it. And then what? I live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there? So You're not gonna have it? Look, I know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish, that I'm not ready, that this wasn't the plan, that I have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's. I was an accident, and I know my mom loves me. But I also know that in some ways, I derailed her life. I don't want my kid to feel like that. Ever. I want to be ready. Yeah. That makes sense. You didn't drop the cancer card? The-the cancer card? Oh, stop. You know what I mean. Did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child? She was upset. I'm not just gonna make her Oh, give me a break. Fine. Petra was always good at math. According to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement I'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about. No, no, it's not. You know what, don't do anything, don't say anything. I mean it. We'll talk later. _ Oh, abuela, it is not what you think. _ No, I didn't. I I got accidentally Oh, I don't even know how to say this in Spanish. _ No, no, I didn't. The doctor made a mistake. I went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me. _ _ Yes. From his Oh. _ _ - Abuela, please. - _ No, but I know how you feel _ _ _ _ What?! _ _ _ _ _ Luisa, it's Petra. I need your help. And in exchange, I'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board. You're early. Yeah, I just I got called into work. Yeah, so I just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick, in person, you know? Yeah, of course. Janie I want to say that I'll support you no matter what Oh. Wait, wait. That's that's what I want to say. But that's not how I feel. I want to start a life with you. And I don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid. And I'm sorry if that makes me a bad person, but that's how I feel. Please. For us. Don't have this baby. Okay. After her teenage boyfriend Rogelio told her not to have the baby, Xiomara had a real problem. She knew she wanted the baby, but she also knew she did not want Rogelio. It's true. I'm pregnant. _ Some Army guy. I didn't get his last name. And so Xiomara kept Jane's father's identity a secret. Yeah! Abuela asked me to never tell you what she said, and I I didn't want you to look at her differently. Look at you, being all selfless. But no more secrets. Okay? I-I just wanted you to know that you had a choice, because having one it helps, I think. Whatever you decide. I don't know what to do, Mom. Michael doesn't want it. And I get why, of of course I get why. But Dr. Alver called and said that the father Rafael, he had cancer. This is his only sample, and he and his wife, they're this great couple, loving and wonderful, and all they want is a child. You want a divorce? I do. I took care of you when you were sick. Which is why I didn't do this a year ago. And I think, if you're being honest, you knew that. I also think it's the reason you used my sample. And regardless I think we bring out an ugly side in each other. Don't you think? Nothing, sir. We had some girl come in there, she took off. Zazo's the contact. I'm positive. I.D. the girl. Already sent the images down to the station. Pink means pregnant. But I've never had sex. You don't have to have a baby. We'd take it. Please For us. Don't have this baby. _ Some guy's here to see you, Xo. If it's Bruce, tell him I'm serious, I don't want to see him. It's not Bruce. Could I get some help, here? Sorry. It's this new show. How could you keep my daughter a secret all these years? I wrote you 16 months ago! What took you so long? Babe what are you doing here? Trying to be brave. But before I propose you need to know all the facts. And the fact is, I'm having the baby. And we're giving it to the father. He and his wife, they really want it. And they're a really great couple. She's giving us the baby? Yes. She just called. She said she wants it to grow up in a happy home, where both parents want it. So, under the circumstances, I thought it best not to mention our previous conversation. Michael? Yeah. Okay. I'm okay with that. Okay. Oh That's not good. You can stand. Oh, can I? Great, thanks. Okay. All right. Oh I'm not good at this stuff. So instead of telling you the reasons why I love you, I'm gonna tell you the reasons why I don't. I don't love you because you're smart and kind. I don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive. I'm not defensive. I don't love you because you are incredibly sexy. Ooh! I love you because you're my best friend. And I want to grow old with you. And right now, I'm confused about every single thing in my life except you. Wow. I love you. And in that moment, in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well, Jane Gloriana Villanueva really believed that to be true. And then everything changed. _"
"Welcome back. Let's review what happened last. When Jane was young, her grandmother taught her to protect her flower. _ _ And so Jane waited which wasn't always easy. This is Jane's fiancÃ©. He's a detective. Their life was perfectly on track, until Oh, there you are, Dr. Alver. You have an insemination in seven and a pap in eight. Yeah, an insemination and a pap, yeah, I got it. Should I No, I-I got it. She does not ""got it."" Are you ready for your insemination? Hi. yes. I artificially inseminated the wrong woman. And the father, Dr. Alver's brother, Rafael, who Jane kissed once five years ago, only now he's married to Petra. Got all that? There's more. Jane did not know that her favorite telenovela star was actually her father, who her mother recently got back in touch with. And you are caught up. Jane's QuinceaÃ±era was, without a doubt, the worst party she'd ever been to. But not for lack of effort. In fact, Jane had planned the day down to a tee. The flowers. The entrance. The perfectly choreographed dance with the Superfly Date. What she didn't plan? That her mother would take over the mike and perform the number one hit currently sweeping the nation.  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard   And they're like, it's better than yours   It's better than yours  But to her credit, Jane did not panic. She simply moved on. Who wants cake? No, thank you, Abuela. I'm not hungry. _ And Jane was determined to move on now. Yes, I know, but that is not gonna be the focus of everything moving forward. I'm gonna I'm gonna get back to my life. In fact, that's the reason why I called this family meeting. Michael, welcome to your first family meeting. Happy to be here. Proud to be representing the male point of view. Ooh. Oh, see, I wouldn't lead with that, 'cause that's not gonna do well in our meetings. I'm mostly here to watch and observe. So, I just wanted to go over the plan. All right? The most important thing is that this event doesn't derail my life. Nothing else has changed. All right? I'm almost at the finish line with college. I got a good job. I'm engaged to a great guy. Sure, there are a few logistical things I'm gonna have to do to make sure it stays in good health, like I set up a sonogram, for instance. But other than that, nothing has changed. Got it? _ Yes. Go ahead. _ Abuela! _ She said that I should keep the baby. Oh! No, she's not keeping the baby. _ Stop, Abuela. I'm not gonna keep the baby. I-In fact, we're not gonna refer to it as a baby. We're gonna we're gonna call it something else. W We are going to call it, um  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard  a milkshake. And I can't wait to give that milkshake to its rightful owners good people who really want it. I want a divorce. Well, I don't. And Jane's not gonna give you that child on your own. Yeah. I know. Just like I know that you're trying to wait out our prenup to make money off me. So, tell me, sweetheart how are we gonna work through that? Hey, man, how you holding up? Good. Yeah? We're good. _ _ Catalina Creel? Seriously, Abuela? - Who is Catalina Creel? - This super psycho telenovela villain who wore an eye patch everywhere even though she wasn't really blind. Petra's not a super psycho. _ Okay, you know what? I am gonna meet with Petra. She's just texted me. She'd like to meet. Sounds lovely. Great. She is excited to set something up. Are you happy? And once I meet with her, I am going to think about this pregnancy as little as possible. I'm gonna get back to my life. Uh-uh. No way. After that, you sue the frickin' doctor. Ah, yes, the frickin' doctor. Okay. The frickin' doctor was trying to move forward as well. Mrs. Diana T. Gower. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you just say your name one more time, and this time would you mind also spelling it slowly? Twice you can never be too careful. The nurse said you were between patients. Well I'm sure the mistake will be dealt with through the appropriate channels, and since I haven't received the official notification that my license is suspended, I figured I should just keep practicing. Oh, okay, there's the official notification. My license is suspended. Luisa, you're not drinking are you? No. No, I'm not. What I'm doing is that I'm trying to be practical, which is why I called you. I mean, you were a pretty good lawyer before you gave it up to become a trophy wife. Take care of yourself. No, stop it. I'm sorry. I don't know why I said that. I'm going through a lot, and I'm lashing out. I I need your help. I called my insurance company, and there's this thing in my policy. It mentions my brother, and I'm not sure I understand it because of all the legal jargon. You put your shares of the hotel up as collateral? In case of a lawsuit, yeah. Look, no one would insure Luisa with her history of addiction. She's my sister. And I believed her when she said she'd changed. So if Jane sues me? Your brother's hotel could be on the line. I just don't want to spend the next year in a whole legal battle. I just want to keep moving forward with my life. Finish college, obsess about wedding dresses and who keeps calling you, Mom? Can you ask Rafael if I can sing at the hotel next month? I heard Paulina Rubio's producer might be in town, so Is it Bruce? - Yeah, it's Bruce. - Mom! It is important to note that Bruce is Xiomara's married ex-boyfriend. Stop calling! It is also important to note that that was not Bruce calling. In fact, it was Jane's father, who Xo saw out of the blue 16 months ago. Seeing her high school boyfriend on a telenovela was shocking. So Xiomara did the only sensible thing. She rushed home to Google him. Hey. Who's the hottie? _ But alas, Jane didn't know any of that. Yet. _ And so for a brief moment, as Jane went to work that morning, it truly felt like nothing had changed. Jane. Hi. I'm sorry to ambush you like this. I just wanted to talk really quickly about the uh the baby. Like I said, the moment was brief. Oh. Yes. Hi. Hey. - I actually texted your wife. - Yes, I heard. Yeah, I was just trying to put a name to the face and make sure she didn't have an eye patch. What? Nothing. That was a bad joke. sorry. I am really excited to meet her. And, you know, see the whole picture and the two-parent-home thing. Right. So, that's pretty important to you, huh? Yeah, it's the reason why I feel good about my decision. Sorry, what was it that you wanted to talk to me about? In truth, he decided to come clean to Jane and tell her his marriage is over. Just some lawsuit stuff, actually. But alas, plans change. You're suing? No. I'm not suing. Just Luisa, Dr. Alver, is my sister, so it's - What? - The doctor who inseminated you. She's your sister? She's your sister? Yes. But I mean, we're not on good terms, obviously. No, but she's, like, really your sister? I just wow. And not to make things more awkward but, Jane, you should really talk to a lawyer. Come up with an amount, present it to us, and that way I can pay you directly, and that way you'll make the most money. What makes you think that I want money? I don't know, I just assumed, because Because I'm a waitress? No. I I know you're not just a waitress. - ""Just a waitress."" - That's not what I meant. - Look, you're in college - So if I wasn't in college, I would be ""just a waitress."" Jane, I think you're taking this the wrong way. Yeah. Maybe I am. Except this huge thing just happened, and you're telling me that your sister did it, and then you're offering me money. I got to change. Seriously, what did you expect? He's a rich playboy. Rich playboy with an entitled attitude, missing a basic sensitivity chip. He was so much nicer in my head. That's because he's a good kisser. What?! You kissed him? - You slut! - When? It was five years ago. Not a big deal. What did Magic Mikey say when you told him? Did he freak out? No. Because I haven't actually told Michael yet. He just found out the news about my pregnancy, and I want it to settle I just don't want it to be weird. Or weirder. It's definitely weirder. I'm trying to find the right moment. Before he meets Rafael. Obviously. Whatever. I'm sure Rafael is a fine guy. We just had one bad interaction; I'm just gonna let it go. What? Nothing. Just heard some things about him over the years. What kind of things? Very bad things. Very, very bad things. Oh, my God. It is important to know that, right now, Jane is panicking. We're gonna have to keep it. I don't want to, and you don't want to, but we're gonna have to. W-Wait-wait, what's going on, Jane? I can't give Rafael the milkshake. It is important to note that Michael Cordero Jr. Is not a virgin. Well, it's important to him. I don't really care about it too much. But what is important to know is that Michael never planned to date a virgin. But when he met Jane, everything changed. Oh. Oh. Okay, okay. I thought about it. This doesn't mean that we ha to keep it, right? There has got to be some legal loophole that we can find. We'll declare him unfit, we'll find other good parents. - Okay, calm down, slow down. - Did you see what I sent you? - Did you click on the links? - Yeah. I wish you would've warned me before the Bora Bora series. Michael, don't you think that I have a moral obligation to make sure that the milkshake goes to a decent person? And that is not a decent person. What he did in Bora Bora is not decent. It literally is indecent, which is why he got arrested. And it was also a while ago. You said the guy had cancer, right? He obviously went through some major life-changing event. You know, he's marr.. He's happily married now. - He wants a baby. - Uh-huh. Trust me, Bora Bora guy doesn't want a baby. Yeah, I mean, that's definitely true. Look, I get why you're anxious, but, uh, you-you're gonna meet the wife, right? Mm-hmm. I bet you'll feel better when you do. Give this guy a real chance. Huh. So, I just stood there, talking to her about money and lying about my marriage. Well, Petra's trying at least. Driving my staff crazy, wanting everything to be perfect for the party tonight. She's trying to impress my father. Yeah, so you look good. It's his first time seeing the renovations. He's got to be blown away if he's gonna trust you to run things here. Petra knows how important this is to you. Yeah, maybe, or maybe she knows that if she gets my father on her side, it will be that much harder for me to leave her. Wow. So, you're pretty much done then, huh? Yeah. I am. Why did she order an ice sculpture of a wizard? I said marlin, not Merlin! A Marlin? Like the fish? Yes, like the fish! My father-in-law loves to fish. Does he also like magic? _ _ We got a leopard on the loose! _ _ _ We need to talk right now. You can't keep calling me! I said I'd tell her when the time is right, and I'll tell her! When? I want to be a part of my daughter's life. You kept her from me long enough. Yeah, well, you shouldn't have told me - to have an abortion. - Shh. I was just a kid. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, and I was just a kid when I told my mom you were some random army guy, and now it's been so long, and I Uh, I know it's hard, Xiomara. And I was a screw-up years ago, but I have changed. I want my daughter to have the pleasure of knowing me. I want to be a part of her life. Yeah okay, I'll tell her today. Good. What is she like? Jane? Oh. She's awesome. Smart, strong, determined. Pregnant. - I am to be a grandfather? - Kind of. It was a medical mistake. Long story. Who's the father? But I honestly hoped this baby would be a real chance for us. Because you might have stopped loving me, but I never stop loving you. Okay better, but I think you'd be more effective if you'd make yourself cry. Just, like, one tear. I haven't cried since I was a child, Zaz. God, I hate that I have to humiliate myself like this. I know, but this baby angle isn't gonna last. You're gonna have to make him love you again. What if I can't? Oh, please. With your arsenal of weapons, hmm? Hmm? Come on! You only have to last one more year. Then, you'll cash out of your prenup, and we can get the hell out of here. Girl's in there again. Don't need to watch this part. What a waste of time. Nothing's happening. We've only been here 48 hours. Cortes named Roman Zazo as a contact. If he's right, this is the first real lead we've had on Sin Rostro in four years. We haven't heard from Sin Rostro in four years because he's dead. You know what would be great? If partner wasn't always working against me. You don't go from the biggest drug game in town to radio silence, unless you're six feet under. Or regrouping, planning something big. Finally an I.D. on the woman. I don't know what took all damn day. Petra Solano. Oh, wow. Apparently, she's the wife of the guy who owns the hotel. Try to remember, later, that Michael's first thought in this moment was Jane. He had to tell Jane. Hey. I just wanted to apologize for what happened earlier. The truth is, I have no idea how to act around you. No, it's fine. So I should get back to work. You know, trying to get on with my life, not constantly think about it. - Yeah, that makes sense. - Mm-hmm. - Just one more thing. - What's that? I would love to come to any doctor's appointments? It should be noted that at this very moment, all Jane wanted to do was scream ""No!"" But alas, Michael said to give him another try. I actually have a sonogram scheduled for this afternoon. Why don't you and your wife come? - Really? - I mean, you definitely don't have to. - Great. - Great. What are you doing? Focusing on the bright side. Drinking will not solve anything. I know, but every time I don't drink, I feel good about myself, and I need something to feel good about, because my brother won't speak to me, my wife cheated on me, and I have nowhere to go, and I'm about to be slapped with a huge lawsuit. But I'm not drinking. At least I'm not drinking. You're crazy. You know that? Don't call me crazy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean Oh, we can't. I know. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry, baby. They're running late. Are you there? Yup, I am here. Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. Amy Nesson? Are you clo Michael? Hi. Come on in. Hey. Okay, thanks. Sorry. Hey, yeah. Sorry. This place is really weird. Um, are you close? Yes. Listen, is, uh, Rafael and Petra there yet? - No. - Okay, good, good. 'Cause I wanted to tell you something before you met him, which wasn't going to be today, but now it is, and it's so not a big deal, but you should know it before you meet him, or it might be a little strange when you do know. Know what? I kissed Rafael once, five years ago. What?! Yeah, way before I met you. Okay, and it was so not a big deal. It was nothing really, you know? I mean, nothing then; it means nothing now. You must be Michael. Hi. I'm Rafael. We'll talk about this later, Jane. I used to make out with Jane all the time. What? I asked if they're running on time? Oh, yes, I think so. Michael Cordero, Jane's fiancÃ©. Oh, I didn't know you two got engaged. Yeah, yeah. It just happened. We're, like, super happy. We're really in love, big time. Just trying to get through this crazy accident. Yes. Us, too. Petra Solano. Such a pleasure to meet you. What your fiancÃ©e is doing for us it's such a gift. Shut it, Mom. We wouldn't be late if you hadn't made me change out of my booty shorts. I didn't know you two were coming. Oh. Trust me, a girl needs her mom. Are you? The father, yes. Hi. I'm Rafael. I'm Jane's mom. And, yes, I had her very young. I'm so sorry. I I'm late. You must be Petra. Yes. It is so nice to finally meet you. You're making our dreams come true. Jane Villanueva? Hi. Hi. Come on in. Grams. This is my grandma. Great. Hi. Welcome. Oops. Sorry. Just gonna get in there. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Ma, back up. You know what? I'm gonna have to ask some of you to leave. - Oh, no, no, I can't leave. - _ Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Who are the parents? I'm the father. Just carrying the baby, so, I should probably stay. I'm supposed be the mother, technically. - My fiancÃ©. - I'm the fiancÃ©. - _ - Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go on biology. So you and you. Everyone else, out. - Thank you. - Good luck, baby. Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you. All right. This is gonna be cold, okay? You're about seven weeks along, is that right? Yes. Okay, I'm gonna get started. Will you be wanting pictures? - Yes. - No. So, what are you studying? Teaching. Just one more semester. Nice. - I Googled you. - Oh? - Mm. - That couldn't have gone well. No, it didn't. Hey, you see? Yup, mm-hmm. Oh, God. I was pretty lost a year and a half ago. And when I got sick, I just went to this really dark place, you know? So, what changed? My sister, actually. She came over one day and told me to stop feeling sorry for myself, and that I'd find the bright side. It's what I needed to hear, I guess. So, I started to focus on the things that I should change, which ended up pretty much being my entire life. So what made you so lost to begin with, do you think? Fear of failure. That's what it is. It's fear of failure. Which can be a pretty crippling thing. Yeah, I know. Is that why you're trying to be a teacher and not a writer? Well, it depends. Am I being practical or brave? Practical. I'm a teacher. Brave. I'm a writer? I have never said that out loud before. So what have you been writing? Not writing anything right now. What do you want to be writing? Romance. Romance? Mm-hmm. Really? Little early to hear the heartbeat. It was all a little early indeed. And now, I implore you to remember that Michael's first thought upon learning about Petra's affair, was Jane, he had to tell Jane. End the affair. I don't know what you're talking about. Then I'll be clear then. Stop sleeping with Roman Zazo. How? Came by the hotel, saw you together. - Where? - Doesn't matter. Do you even want this baby? Yes, of course I want this baby, I'm Then end it. Or I'll tell your husband. And, trust me, Jane's not giving that baby to him alone. And you don't want it. Fine. I'll end it. Who knows? Maybe I'll ask you for a favor at some point. Talked to Rafael. Everything's gonna be fine. Good. That's good. I want you to quit your job. What? I-It's, it's too much. You're carrying the guy's baby. You just told me you kissed him. Five years ago, it was nothing. Come on, baby. I've been there for four years. I really like it, I have all my friends there. It pays well, I have health care Michael Babe I don't want to start over. You know how much I don't want to start over. I can't help it it makes me uncomfortable. There are a million other hotels in South Beach. Just find another one. Janie? Did you forget your key? What are you doing here? Didn't you get my text? Oh, no, no. I didn't. I have too many phones. If it's important, the best way to reach me is through Twitter. Actually, today isn't a good day anymore. Jane seemed off after her sonogram, that's what I was texting you about. Oh, shoot! She's coming. Jane? Now? How's my hair? Come on, get in here quick. What kind of mother are you to keep a father from his daughter? She's going through a hard time, she had her f And I have been patient long enough. Tell her now, or I will. Okay, just stay here. Honey I wanted to talk with you. Oh, hang on, I'm gonna just finish filling something out. A job application? You like your job. Yeah, Michael wants me to quit. He's uncomfortable with Rafael. Which I get. Plus, the whole sonogram was kind of hard for him, so And how about you? Oh, honey We we heard the heartbeat, Mom. And I just started to think about it. I just didn't want this to take over my life and change everything. I know, baby. I know. But it's going to. Oh 'Cause it's not a stupid milkshake, it's a baby, and I'm gonna get attached to it. I mean, how can I not? And then I have to give it to them. And that's what I want to do. I do, but it's gonna be so hard. I mean, it just is. Even if Rafael and Petra are great. And I don't know how to prepare, or how to act, or what to do to not make it hurt. Honey, I don't think there's anything you can do. See this? This right here is why I keep saying to sue. Because you're gonna have a lot of pain. All because of this frickin' doctor. And your life is now hard and complicated in ways it shouldn't be. - Mom, don't you cry. - I'm not. I mean, me? I I'm a screw-up. I mean, I deserved to get knocked up, but you? This isn't fair. Stop, we can't go to that ""it's not fair"" place. We won't go there, then. Yeah. We can go to the ""it sucks"" place, right? Yeah, I think that's where I'm at right now. It sucks. All around. Yeah, it does. But it's gonna suck worse for you. And you got to remember that. That supposed to make me feel better? I'm just saying you get to be selfish now. You don't have to take care of anyone else, just yourself. Okay? Yeah. Thanks. You know, you're not a screw-up, Mom. I mean, the way you chase your singing dream. That's some brave stuff. I could use some of that right now. _ I guess it I guess it's just hitting me that I'm having a baby. And how much it totally sucks. In a way that doesn't offend God and whatever higher plan He has for us. _ _ Bueno. _ _ _ Where does that expression come from, anyway? You know, I really, I can't even remember. _ Abuela Mom. I'm sorry, okay? Don't be upset about that. But Xiomara was not upset at all. Because she remembered the events of the QuinceaÃ±era quite differently. Here's Jane's Superfly Date. And here is Jane's Superfly Date's superslutty hookup.  My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard   And damn right  And the memory that she was a good mom, that she knew when to protect her daughter's feelings, fortified Xiomara. I want to see her right now. No, you won't, because being a parent means that you put your kid's interest first, and right now, Jane's overwhelmed, and she needs some part of her life to not change, and so you're gonna back off until I tell you she's ready. And don't ever question me as a mother again, got it? Okay. I will wait. But not forever, right? No. Not forever. Her eyes are so bright and curious. Much like my own. Tell me, is she a singer like you? What? Nothing, I-I'm just I'm surprised you remembered. Your voice, Xiomara unforgettable. Yeah, well I know I'll have to give up trying at some point. Why? I became an international star just a few years ago. Imagine what a disservice it would have been to the world, if I had given up. Michael, it's me. Thought I could treat this pregnancy like it was nothing, like an inconvenience. But I can't, and I can't pretend that nothing's changed because everything's changed. Everything's different now. I'm gonna be different, after going through this, after carrying a baby, and having to give it up. So, I need some constants in my life right now, I really do. Which is why I'm gonna keep my job. And I love you, Michael, and I don't want to hurt you, but I get to be selfish now. Not you. I love you, and you love me. It's over, Roman. Let go of me. What? Good. You passed the test. I wanted to make sure you'd fight for me. Damn right I'd fight for you. Wha? Mmm! The party. I have to get ready. We'll sneak away later? I'll see you later. Uh-huh. Mmm But there would be no later. Not for them. Your father is going to love the renovations. He'll be so impressed with what you've done. They got the marlin right, finally. Can you imagine if he showed up to an ice sculpture of a wizard? You know what? I am so sick of this. Maybe you're right. Maybe this can't be salvaged. But I can't take this. You standing there, all sanctimonious. Uh-huh Yes, I did something terrible. But you know what? You did something terrible, too! And what did I do? What did I do? Tell me. You stopped loving me. I remember the day, actually. I'm sure it started happening earlier. I'm sure I just registered it on this day, but You were halfway through your chemo. And it seemed like you had a nice enough visit from your sister, but after she left, you came out, and you were looking around and and when you looked at me it felt as if everything had changed. But I honestly hoped that this baby would be a real chance for us. Because you might've stopped loving me. But I never stopped loving you. Turns out, it's easy to give a good performance when what you are saying is actually true. Can I come in? What's with the music? Well, I wanted to do something for you. Like some big telenovela gesture. Fill the whole room with flowers or leopards or something. But there are budget restrictions. So When the guy comes to the girl to say he screwed up, there's always this dramatic I-screwed-up music. So this is my dramatic I-screwed-up music. I listened to your message. And you're right. I made this about me and not you. Of course you should keep your job. You should do whatever you need to do. I'm really sorry. Wait. That that thing you said about everything changing? That's not fair. How much I love you? That is not changing. You got some good music to kiss to in there? Oh, yeah. I got the best music to kiss to. I wanted to give you this. Divorce papers I assume. It's the sonogram of the baby. Look, we've both made mistakes. And I don't know if we'll get past them. Let's give it a try. Well, you can't blame me for being a little jealous though, right? I mean, the guy's like Well, let's put it this way, your mom was drooling over him. First of all, my mom drools over everybody. And second? So not my type. Way too pretty, right? I mean just super pretty. - Super pretty. - Super. Hey. Trust me. You have nothing to be jealous of. Just be happy for me. I love him, Mother. I actually think we can fix this. But what about the other man you whored yourself to? You are a selfish girl. After I sacrificed everything for you? Stop, Mother. I'll figure it out. Oh, enough with the tarot cards already! Oh, don't be dramatic. I'm playing Solitaire. I already read the cards. I already know this outcome. Would you go back to your room, please? Shouldn't you be in there? Yeah, just kind of taking a moment, pre-game. Understood. So, you should know I'm gonna sue your sister. I went back and forth, but she screwed up. And she needs to permanently lose her license and admit her wrongdoings and You should sue. And don't worry, it's got nothing to do with me. Except that his hotel was on the line. I'm glad you understand. I also I wanted to thank you. What you said before about not avoiding something, due to fear I needed to hear it. Are you gonna start writing? Hey, if that's what I want to do, I gotta go for it, right? Like you, like my mom Like your mom? Yeah, you know, it's funny that you mention her. Did I mention her? Not really the point. She's a singer. And she's really good, and she just has never really gotten her big break, and she said that there was gonna be a huge producer in your hotel next month You want an introduction? I want her to perform here. I'm trying to look at the bright side, like you said. Of course. Cool. I should probably get to work. Yeah. I'll I'll walk with you. I am so sorry. I'll tell her to leave right now. What are you doing here? I invited her. Dad. I don't know if you know what's been going on here Of course I know. Your sister made a very unfortunate mistake. But she wasn't drinking and that's important. An ""unfortunate mistake""? Dad, I don't understand why you coddle her That's not true. You do understand. Luisa is family. And family is everything. And speaking of Hello, darling. Luisa. Xiomara! Xiomara! _ _ _ Ooh, Mommy! Ã¿El presidente? You could actually get really rich from this. You do realize that. I'm not doing this to get rich. I mean, I can handle rich. Rich wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. Okay, in the meantime, we've got some ideas. Changes we'd like to see at the hotel. Since it seems like you kind of have pull. Let me hear them. I'm all about embracing change. Zaz! On the bright side, Jane's QuinceaÃ±era was no longer the worst party she'd ever been to. _"
"- Ah, there you are again. _ Jane's grandmother raised her to believe that her virginity was sacred, that she should wait. This is Jane's fiancÃ©, Michael. Their life was perfectly on track until There you are, doctor. You have an insemination in seven and a Pap in eight. Yeah, an insemination and a Pap, yeah, I got it. - Should I - No, I-I got it. She does not ""got it."" Are you ready for your insemination? Hi. Yes. I artificially inseminated the wrong woman. And the father, Rafael, is married to Petra. Unfortunately, Petra was boning his best friend. And Michael knows this, because he's a detective. But that problem kind of took care of itself. Yep, that happened. Roman Zazo died. Meanwhile this is Jane's father, international telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega, who her mother is currently hooking up with. But Jane doesn't know he's her father yet. And now you are caught up. On the 27th of October, way, way back in the year 2000, young Jane Gloriana Villanueva caught a firefly in her hands. And so she made a very important wish. Actually, two. And when she was 16, both of those wishes were finally coming true. That is, until Just so you know, I'm gonna save myself. Until marriage. I can't believe he dumped me. Maybe next time just don't tell him about the whole virgin-until-marriage-thing. Xiomara! Relax. I don't mean ""have sex"" I just mean put off the conversation, let him think you like to take it slow. _ _ Really, Ma? Big balls of evil? _ But how will I know when I've met the right man? _ And that little tingly feeling between your legs. And so, that night, as Xo's favorite breakup song played, Jane made a final wish. That she'd meet the perfect guy, the one who would wait, and she'd know deep inside it was right. - Ma! - Shh, shh, shh. Mom, I need my wedges. Which I told you not to borrow. Hang on, honey, one minute! This is a great moment. Let's tell her - that I'm her father right now. - Shh, shh. Why are you up, honey? It's only 6:00. - You're not on breakfast on Mondays. - Yeah. I switched with Frankie so that I could have coffee with Petra later. I want to get to know her a little. Mama! I need my shoes! Come on! Why is this even locked? No reason, honey. - Here you go. - Thanks. Ma? Is everything okay? Jane! _ _ - Now? - Mm-hmm. My daughter is getting married? No, wait, I'm on tour in the fall. We'll need her to work around some dates Psst. Ooh Yeah, I think I think these arepas are plenty spicy. _ Mm-mm. I have to go to work now _ - Abuela? - Huh? Are you okay? _ Then again, we both ended up unmarried and pregnant, so you must have really pissed the Big Man off. I'm sorry, honey, I didn't mean it as an insult to you, just as an insult to her. But Jane wasn't insulted at all. In fact, she'd just had an epiphany. My whole life, I didn't want to end up an unmarried pregnant woman like my mom. But guess what. I'm an unmarried pregnant woman like my mom. The big bad thing, the thing I was most afraid of it happened. But I'm engaged to the man that I love and I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. I waited for you. And now that I'm pregnant, why should I wait another year, another week, another minute, even? Jane what are you saying? Let's have sex. Oh Are you nervous? Don't be nervous. That's easy for you to say. It'll be quick, I promise. In and out. Will you come with me? That's not really appropriate. Just tell them everything you saw, okay? Last night, before Roman Zazo fell. You never know what's important at the beginning of an investigation. No detail's too small. We're looking for the tiniest inconsistencies. What? Nothing. I just find it kind of sexy when you talk all cop. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. I've got a 15-minute break coming up. The seats in my car lean all the way back I'm not having sex with you for the first time in the backseat of your car. - I was totally kidding. - Mm-hmm. Jane? Your turn. - You ready? - Mm-hmm. Okay. Honey, stop reading those articles. They're just speculating and you're torturing yourself. I know. I know. Did you know that my dad wants me to cancel the memorial and issue a statement distancing the hotel from Zaz? Well, are you going to do it? What choice do I have? He's the majority owner. Whatever. I gotta find Zaz's brother and tell him what happened. - Yeah? - I don't even know where to find him, though, 'cause Zaz hadn't talked to the guy in ten years. I didn't even know he had a brother. Trust me, she definitely knew. But I really didn't know Zaz. Trust me, she definitely did. My necklace I, uh I had a-a necklace I wanted to wear tonight. I'm sorry. I think I'm just focusing on these silly, mundane things because I'm just I'm just in shock. This was absolutely true. Petra was in shock. And she knew exactly what she needed to do. We interviewed the employees, and nobody saw anything suspicious. It was clearly a crime of passion. Which is why we need to bring Petra Solano in for questioning. No way. No. No. Roman Zazo was an associate of Sin Rostro Think of Sin Rostro as ""the big bad wolf."" We're the closest we've been to this guy in four years. If we bring Petra in now, her lawyer's gonna start asking questions, it's gonna expose the whole investigation. No signs of struggle. It was someone he knew. Sir, she's not strong enough to push him through a window. What-what about the unregistered gun? What? It wasn't used, it wasn't even out. And whoever it was was having drinks with him. - Two glasses were found - One without fingerprints. - Because Petra wiped it down - Why would she wipe down a glass when she knows her prints are all over that apartment? So, her husband found out and he did it. We have no evidence he knew. Which is why we need to bring her in - and ask some questions - All right, enough. I need to think. FYI everything Michael said? Absolutely true. And yet he is absolutely lying about the real reason he needed to keep Petra's affair under wraps. See, he had made some calculations which would leave him If Sin Rostro took out Zaz and he doesn't know we're onto him well, we've got a real shot at the big bad wolf. But one piece of evidence comes to light against Petra, we're bringing her in. _ - Hey. - Hi. Did you know the guy? Who, uh Roman Zazo. Yeah. He was, he was my, um college roommate. And maybe it was the look in his eyes, but Jane felt compelled to touch Rafael's arm. Anyway if you need anything, I'm around. You little liar! You never told me you were going to have sex! Michael seems like a crier. What? No. He's not a crier. Oh, please, he's so totally in love with you, it's all been pent up. There's a good chance he cries on release. Where are you going, his place? No, Michael's brother who he cannot stand is crashing there. My first time was in a tanning bed. Ew. Ew. Ew. She does not want a tanning bed. She's gonna want it all fairy tale telenovela. That is not true. I just want it somewhere between fairy tale telenovela and the backseat of a car. You should take one of those 11th-floor suites. The cops closed the whole floor. Those are nice. So, are you nervous? Nervous? No. Yes. Yeah, maybe a little bit. - Mm-hmm. - Well, it's just it's such a big deal. And I want it to be good. You know? For me. For him Yeah, I changed my mind. You're both gonna cry. I'll take table eight. Hey, guys. Can I get you something to drink? Oh, hi. Rose, Dad this is Jane. The girl I accidentally impregnated who's suing me. Hello. Can we get three waters, please? Maybe I should get someone else. - Great idea. - Good idea, yeah. Well, that is one way to meet the mother of your grandchild. I'm going to leave you both. Thanks for helping my daughter with her legal woes. Luisa can be a bit of a handful. What are you doing? - Leave him. - What? Let's go somewhere. Together. You don't love him. What happened yesterday was a mistake. It's not gonna happen again. Meanwhile, Jane was trying to put Luisa far from her mind. Armed with a key to the 11th floor suites, she concentrated on what lay ahead. Specifically getting laid ahead. Because the truth is Jane did want the perfect fairy tale telenovela experience for her first time. Then again, perfect doesn't exist. Especially in telenovelas. Suddenly, Jane saw Petra lurking at the crime scene. Petra popping pills. And then her fiancÃ©. What took you so long? We're not talking here. You will recall we last left Jane witnessing something that left her more than mildly unsettled. - You don't go to the crime scene. - You didn't answer my text. I was with my boss, trying to keep you out of jail. They're looking for any reason to bring you in. - I left the necklace in there. - What?! When I went to end it, things got a little violent. He ripped it off. You have to go get it. Please? Where were you last night when Zazo was killed? What? You heard me. Where were you? I was in our suite. Look, I'm guilty of having an affair. That's all! I love my husband. If he finds out, he'll leave me. Jane? Hello. Hi. Hey. What are you guys up to? - Are you okay, honey? - Mm-hmm. I was just talking to your fiancÃ© about hotel security. You know, - after what happened. - Of course. Thank you. Uh, we're still on for coffee later, I hope. Yeah, yeah. Looking forward to it. - Great, good. - Uh-huh. - So, what was that all about? - What? Well, I was upstairs, trying to get us a room for tonight. - And - You got us a room? Yes, but listen. I saw Petra outside the crime scene and then I saw you meet her up there. So, what were you guys really talking about? Part of Michael wanted to tell Jane everything right then and there, not go any deeper, not let this thing snowball We were talking about hotel security. That's it. But instead he lied. Well, I think that you need to talk to her again because I saw her lurking outside the crime scene before you got there. ""Lurking""? Okay, you officially watch too many telenovelas. Michael, I'm saying ""lurking"" because she was lurking. She's standing there in front of the door. She wanted to go in. She changed her mind. She started to shake. And then she took a pill! Trust me. Something is off! Her friend was killed. She's upset. What's going on with you? - Nothing. - Then why are you dismissing me? I'm dismissing you 'cause you're not making any sense. You're, like, hormonal or something. I-I Mm-hmm. Jane? Mm. Hi. Hi. Are you done with work? No. No, I had a break. I had this really strong urge Actually ""urge"" is not the right word. I had a need. I needed a croquetta. I guess it's a pregnancy craving or something. I would offer you some, but I'm really enjoying it and if I give you a bite, I may resent you in a very serious way. Okay. So Petra? How is she doing? Uh, it must be really hard for her. Actually, she's been really strong. Good. I'm so glad. Because if she was struggling, I would understand. No, yeah, no. I You'd think she would be. But she's, she's been incredible. So, how are you? Uh is that, is that weird? I mean, am I allowed to ask you that? I think it's all weird, don't you think? - Yeah. - Yeah. But, yeah. I'm adjusting. What's that? Oh, it's a press release. Wait, you're a writer. - Can you help me with this? - You're the only one that calls me a writer. Do you know that? Well, are you writing? Good. So I have to issue a statement about what happened last night. And I don't know, maybe Is there a way to allude to the same thing but make it seem a little, uh nicer? Uh Say ""that your college roommate was a troubled young man who you and the hotel have nothing to do with"" nicer? My dad's trying to protect the hotel's reputation. What? Nothing. I'm sorry. I'm judgey. You should know that about me. You may end up having a really judgey kid. Okay, so what does ""judgey"" sound like? So that I can be prepared. You told me that you don't want to be anything like your dad, which is easy enough to say. But actions are what count. So, what are you doing about it? I hope the baby's judgey. But it happened again. That quickening in Jane's heart. Or maybe it was just the pregnancy hormones and not her heart at all. I should get back to work. Uh, good to see you. Uh, uh, okay. Hi. _ Some kind of gift from Rogelio, it looks like. _ I'm telling you, Ma, it was like electric between us! Oh. His headshot. Well, that's nice to have. _ His signature super spicy salad dressing. _ It's some kind of prepackaged gift. Bueno Whatever. He's a jerk. _ _ _ _ I know, Ma. And I was going to. But with the pregnancy, I just don't want to overwhelm her right now. _ Ma, relax. He agreed to stay away from her. Hi. I would like your biggest, most grandest room, please. I couldn't ask Rafael. He just kept going on and on about how great his marriage is. Rogelio de la Vega. De la Vega. Rogelio de la Vega. Maybe I am hormonal. Maybe she took that pill because she had a headache. Yeah, and maybe you picked a fight with Michael because you're still afraid to have sex. First of all, I'm not afraid to have sex. I've never been afraid to have sex! And I didn't pick a fight with him. There was something off with Petra. My gut is telling me. Oh, sure. Who should I make it out to? Oh, it's the, oh, it's Oh. Yes. Maybe she's got a pill problem and Zazo was her dealer. He was doing something bad. I heard they found a gun in his room. What? Are you serious? Carmen from dry cleaning saw the cops carrying it out of the room in one of those little baggies. Oh, my gosh. What if Petra has a real drug problem? Okay, here's what you do. You need to find a way to get Petra's urine so you can test it. Okay, really? That's your solution? Desperate times, desperate measures. Desperate times, desperate measures indeed. Which is why Michael was about to commit a federal offense. Michael? Hi. Rafael? - The father of the - Yes, I know. Right. Hi. Look, uh, you shouldn't be here. This is an active crime scene. Don't want anyone tampering with the evidence. Okay. Well, I'd like to speak with the lead detective then. That would be me. How can I help you? Why don't we start with you telling me what you think happened here. I'm sorry. I can't discuss the details - of an open investigation. - The press is all over this! I got to tell them something. The press is not my problem. Well, I have a right to know what's happening in my hotel! My crime scene trumps your hotel. Don't take it personally. He's frustrated. We don't have a lot of information yet. But, uh, between us? We are working on a few different theories. Accident, murder. Maybe crime of passion? Did you know his girlfriend? Zaz didn't have a girlfriend. That you know of. Thank you for covering for me. - I'll be right back. - You got it. Excuse me, Miss? Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. I know. Oh, my God! It is indeed me. No, no, no, please, please. Breathe, just, you know inhala. Exhala. Inhala. Exhala. It-it happens all the time. It is very hard for normal people like you to believe it when they see me in person. Oh! You know what? This is really embarrassing, but I am gonna hate myself after if I don't ask you. Can I get a selfie? Oh, yes. I will love that very much. Even though Rogelio knew he could get in trouble with Xiomara, he could not resist taking a picture with his daughter. Silly phone. Okay. Oh, I was just It's not on. Okay. Look. Okay. Okay. He-he couldn't have told her. She wouldn't have snapped a selfie. Wait. Stop. To say what exactly? Hello? Please note, this was not the sort of thing Jane usually did. - Anybody home? And in the event someone answered, she had an excuse clearly planned out. Hello? But no one did answer. Huh. Aah! Okay, good news. While Petra is washing off that ridiculous mask, Jane is concocting something relatively believable. Well, I knew we were meeting up for coffee later. I just didn't know it would be in my dressing room. There's only one problem. _ I saw you earlier outside the crime scene, and something seemed off, and then you took some sort of pill, so I checked your bathroom and then your dressing room. In case you had a problem. Well, you were right. I did take a pill. A Xanax. I got a prescription two years ago after I found out my husband had cancer. I've taken three. One after he was diagnosed, one when he had an eight-hour surgery and one today, after his best friend was murdered in our hotel. God. Of course. I'm so sorry. Don't be. You're giving a baby away to strangers. Of course you're gonna want to check up on us. Let me show you something. Well, I wanted to put the crib closer to the window so the baby could see the ocean, but then I read that could be dangerous, because window cords could be a choking hazard. Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm crying right now. I'm officially hormonal. It's beautiful. _ Uh _ Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. _ _ _ _ Ah. _ _ Porque SÃ­? _ _ _ _ _ What happened? _ _ He snowed you, Ma. He's an actor. _ _ _ _ No. It's too much for her to handle right now. _ _ _ The keycard log places Petra up in her penthouse, exactly where she said she was during the murder. Still think she's guilty? Sorry. I-I know you're working. It's just, I was up in Petra's penthouse, and Can I talk to you? Sure. So, apparently, I am hormonal because I snuck up into Petra's suite, and you were right and I was wrong. You snuck into her suite? Yeah. I know. I know I just I'm sorry that I was freaking out on you before. I was just so sure that there was something going on, but I was wrong, and she's lovely. And I promise I wasn't swayed by the fact that she gave us the Presidential Suite for tonight. You told her about tonight? No, not that not that it was our first time. Just that we needed some time to ourselves. Anyway, I'm sorry about before. I really am. Let me make it up to you tonight. Good. Good. Okay, I'll meet you at 8:00. And I'll come straight from church. Y-You're going to church first? Yeah. My grandma called, and she insisted for some reason. Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell her, obviously. God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. And when we are tempted, he will provide a way out so that we can endure. _ _ _ _ Mom! Shh. I'm trying to listen to the priest. _ _ God will deliver us from sin if we choose to follow him. Will you follow God, or will you choose instead to continue to lie to your abuela? Yes, Jane, I am talking to you. Abuela taught you that a lie by omission is still a lie.  Tonight's the night you'll lie in bed   You should tell the truth   But you'll lie instead   Don't have sex, Jane   Don't have sex   Can you really lie to my face?   Can you really lie   To her face?   Virginity for you and me   If you keep your legs closed   Keep them closed   Keep them closed  _ I'm gonna have sex with Michael tonight. Hallelujah! _ Come on. Relax, Ma. They're practically married already. _ _ _ Abuela, you can't forbid it. I told you because I didn't feel right not telling you. I wasn't asking for permission. _ _ _ _ And things changed. I'm pregnant and a virgin. And I'm I just don't think God will forsake me. I'm sorry, I just don't. I have to go. I'm sorry I disappointed you, Abuela. Honey? Did you wax? Clean everything up down there? I love you. This is some memorial. Trust me. It's very Zaz. How'd you get your dad to agree? I thought that he wanted to distance the hotel. Because he didn't want bad press. Oh. But then he realized he'd get even worse press if word got out that he forbid his own son from throwing a memorial for his college roommate. - Nice work. - Thank you. What? I just I love this song. And maybe it was the music, or the moment, or the vodka cranberry he had downed too quickly, but suddenly Rafael was extending his hand. Dance with me. What? No. What? You just said you love this song. No. Dance with me. Mmm Thank you. I have to I'm gonna go meet with Michael, so I, um I'll see you later. Jane told herself her heart could be racing for any number of reasons hormones, nerves, Alba's spicy chicken arepas. What was happening was nothing. This was who she wanted. Wow. You look So do you. Dance with me? Oh, no, no dancing. It's okay. You're sweating. Are you nervous? No. M-Maybe a little. Are you sure you want to do this? - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. Thank you for coming. If it's your first time, we hope it's an experience you never forget. Oh. Oh, my God. Let us fulfill your every need. Oh, here. I'm Rafael Solano Turn that off, actually. Okay, I'm trying! And your pleasure I - is my pleasure. - What if I? I'm This is off. - It doesn't - I got it. There it is. I guess Oh, my God. I did not expect you to call. I can't stay away from you. I try, but I can't. But, Lu, now this is important. Mmm. I'm not gonna leave him. And you I need you to understand that. This is just a temporary thing. Okay, well, then, let's let's just enjoy it while it lasts. Mmm. Do you remember what we got that first time that we were together in that, in that motel in Fort Lauderdale? Powdered doughnuts from the vending machine. Go  get them. Mmm. Baby, are you okay? Are you sure you want to do this? I want to. I do want to. You do? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Darling? What's going on? Um, I don't know. We should probably evacuate. It's probably just a drill. This is not a drill. Please evacuate into the hotel lobby. Come on, hurry! Think your grandma put in a call to the big guy? And the truth was, Jane couldn't be sure it wasn't divine intervention. Because suddenly, she was confused about everything. I should probably check it out. Of course. Yeah, go, go. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Excuse me. Sorry, everybody. It was a false alarm. It'll just be a few minutes. Thanks. I just saw my sister. And I know I need to forgive her, but I can't. And it's not the mistake, it's the fact that she lied. Hey, did you ever get in touch with Aaron? Aaron? Zazo's brother. You mentioned him this morning. He had not got in touch with Aaron. In fact, Rafael's search for Zazo's brother had been stymied by one simple fact. Until this moment, he never knew his name. I didn't even know he had a brother. No. Not yet. You know, the cops think that he was seeing someone. Zaz? Yeah. I had no idea. It makes me feel like I didn't really know him. Anyways I guess we'll find out who it was. So, can we talk? 'Cause upstairs, besides the fire alarm and the TV thing, something seemed off. Yeah, you're right. Jane thought about what her abuela said, how lies spiral. What is it? Really, what could Jane say? She was having feelings for another man? But what if it was just hormones, the result of a suddenly untrustworthy gut? It was my grandma. She was so upset about this, and I tried to push past it, but, um It's, it's okay. It's okay. I-I I understand. We'll wait, then. But what are we waiting for? I-I love you. You're the person I want to be with. So there's no reason why we can't move the wedding up, right? Nadine, is this important? What? You lied to me. We have proof your mother's keycard was used to access a back stairwell five minutes before the murder. A stairwell without cameras. And your mother, who is in a wheelchair, obviously didn't climb those stairs. Look, I'm telling you, I didn't kill him. Then why were you in the stairwell? I can't say. You could go to jail. Then I'll tell them you tampered with the crime scene. I won't go to jail, but you will. And, of course, you'd lose Jane. So, I'd figure out a way out of this if I were you. I'm proud of you, Mom. Calling Jane like that, I know it wasn't easy. I wonder if she already It's stupid. I barely even know the guy. Part of me thought maybe for a second with Jane's father, I'd get the fairy tale, too. Whatever. These pistachios suck. ""Always and forever, XO."" Huh. Maybe she'll get her fairy tale after all. _ I didn't have sex, Abuela. What happened? We decided to wait until we were married. Which is gonna be next week. And that night Jane made a final wish. That she would go to bed and wake up without feelings for Rafael. No fireflies were hurt in the making of this episode. _"
"Hola. It's me again. Let's review. By now you all know the deal Jane was accidentally - artificially inseminated. - But I've never had sex! You know who wasn't thrilled with this development Jane's detective boyfriend Michael. For us don't have this baby. But Jane decided to have it. And we're giving it to the father, he and his wife, and they're a really great couple. They weren't. In fact, Rafael had started to suspect his wife might be hiding something. You know the cops think that he was seeing someone? - Zaz? - Yeah. I guess we'll find out who it was. She was. An affair with the recently deceased Roman Zazo, which Jane's fiancÃ© Michael knew about. End the affair, or I'll tell your husband. And, trust me, Jane's not giving that baby to him alone. And you don't want it. And so he helped her cover up the fact that she was there the night of the murder. If it sounds straight out of a telenovela, it is. And speaking of telenovelas, Jane's mother was currently hooking up with her father, famous telenovela star Rogelio Da La Vega. __ Some kind of gift, from Rogelio, it looks like. ""Always and forever, Xo.""? though Jane doesn't know he's her father yet. And now we can start. Jane Gloriana Villanueva's first wedding went off without a hitch. In fact, walking down the aisle in her abuela's dress, Jane didn't feel nervous, not for a moment. Because she was marrying her very best friend. I promise to love you forever and ever. I promise to love you forever and ever. Alas Present-day wedding planning was slightly more complicated. For one thing, the wedding was only a week away. For another, way bigger thing, Jane was pregnant with another man's baby A man she'd been having feelings for. - ""Listen to your heart."" - What? The power ballad by Roxette. That's what I want to sing at the reception. Are you gonna have a band? I don't know. __ What do you guys think about getting a food truck? __ _ I made an appointment for the bridal shop. __ Pre-cana that's the, uh, wedding counseling thing? Yeah, and you need to order a cake. __ I love tres leches. Okay, that's enough! Are you okay, honey? The way I see it, __ _ Yeah, it's just all this crazy wedding planning. Maybe it's just too much to pull together in one week. Give us a minute? Mm-hmm. Babe, I know this is overwhelming. You've got a lot on your plate right now, but I'm here, too, okay? We merged our calendars. Your phone beeps, my phone beeps. And I love you. I love you, too. So that's all that matters, right? Everything else This super-religious carnival with power ballads Who cares! At the end of the day, it's just you and me. - And a food truck. - Uh I could live without the food truck. But I cannot live without you. And in that moment, Jane vowed to focus on the man she knew she loved. Unfortunately You never really see a broken heart coming. Our first sleepover here. Ooh Door's open, but I'll still take it. Open, closed Doesn't matter. Not doing anything not with your grandma down the hall. - No way. - Michael, she's so sweet. That's what she wants us to think. Are you sure I can't convince you to do anything? Okay. Okay. Ah, I just want you so badly. Are you okay? Yeah Okay. __ Well, when you hear something, will you please let me know? Thank you, officer. Was that about Zaz's case? Yeah. Any suspects? No. Well, do they have any leads on who he was seeing? I mean, maybe that person knows something. They're confident they'll find out who it was. I'm gonna take a shower. - Mm, mm - I'll see you at noon for the pre-cana. __ _ Yay! Okay. What's going on, baby? - What do you mean? - ""Yay""? Mom I had a dream. - Like a Martin Luther king kind of thing? - No. Like a sex dream kind of thing. Okay, honey, that's perfectly normal. Mom it wasn't Michael in it with me. It was Rafael. Oh Was it just a sex dream, or are you having feelings for him? I don't know. Maybe feelings. Do you think they're real feelings, or ""I'm having his baby and it's getting all muddled in my brain - but it doesn't really mean anything"" feeling? - That. Those. Definitely those. I mean, I love Michael. - And you still want to marry him? - Yes. Definitely yes. - I just - What? I don't know, it's been so different between us since the insemination. Well, you guys got to work through this, because it's gonna be a long pregnancy. But don't tell him about the dream. That's just fantasy stuff. There's no need to get him upset. I'm upset. What if this happens again? Okay, listen When I started having dreams about the convenience store guy, I started getting my slurpees somewhere else. - Hm! - You got to avoid Rafael. But if you can't, if you have to be in the same room as him, keep a safe physical distance, like, three feet. Actually, with that guy, better make it four. I'll try anything. __ I just ate. Thanks, mom. I love you, abuela. Love you, too. Bye, baby. __ _ __ _ Ma, get off my back. __ _ __ _ You know what? You're right. I should go see him. __ Ma, Ro and I need to get on the same page about what we'll say, you know? Coordinate our plan. Plus, he gave me a personalized gift. It would be rude of me not to thank him in person. Ay, dios mio. Let it be known that Jane went to work that morning determined to take her mother's advice. She would focus on her relationship with Michael, and she would avoid Rafael at all costs. Good morning. Hey. Uh Hi. - Oh, no. - Oh. - I have a cold. - Oh, okay. Are you okay? Have you seen a doctor? Oh, no, no. It's no big deal. Just contagious. So what's up? Uh, well, Ocean Drive is interviewing a couple of hotel owners for an article. - Mm-hmm. - Written questions that the magazine submits, but then we actually get to respond to. I've already done most of them, but there's one that I haven't done yet. I just thought that maybe our resident writer would want to give it a shot - Jane? - Yes? Yes? You'll-you'll write it? Sure. Yeah, I'll write it. I'll e-mail you the questions. Uh-huh. Thank you. Okay. Oh, and when you're writing it, if you could really try to focus on the fantasy of it. You know? Really Try to make it sexy. Really sexy, yes. I got it. Just wanted to drop off some ideas for the upgrade to the recovery spa. Less greens, more blues, as discussed, and I added the screening room, which was a good call. __ Great. I'll take a look later. Great, let me know. Hey, have you heard from your sister? I recommended a lawyer to her, but she didn't show. Pretty sure she's on some kind of bender. - What? - I checked the surveillance video to see who pulled the fire alarm the other night. It was Luisa, in a bathrobe, for no apparent reason. Of course, Rose knew the very apparent reason. __ Darling! She's had a lot on her mind. That doesn't mean that she's drinking again. What if something happened to her? Trust me, nothing happened to her. She disappears when she drinks. Rafael, there was just a murder here. I'm well aware. Is my father still upset about Zaz's memorial? I think it's safe to say yes. I got to go talk to him. Look, honestly, you've been great. The way you seem to care about my sister Well, it's way more than my other stepmothers did. Thanks. ""Murder at the Marbella.""? that's what I wake up to this morning. Which is we're going on a media blitz. We're gonna combat any negative mentions with We could've buried this whole thing. Instead, you had to have a memorial for the guy. We're at 50% capacity. Dad, I'm working on that. Clearly, I need to stick around to supervise things. Unfortunately, my schedule will not permit it, so I brought in the next best thing. Rafael. Lachlan. Oh, boy. This is not good at all. - Good to see you. - See, these two go way back. Don't be so moody; Ibiza can wait. Plus, my dad's about to give me the keys to the kingdom. Do you even work? Real work? No. That's not for me. My dad's whipping boy Lachlan gets it done. don't you, Lachlan? Ladies and gentlemen It's been a long time coming, but I would like to announce my appointment for senior VP of the Maracay Hotel Group. Lachlan Moore. The Marbella is my hotel, okay? I run this place. - I own 20%. - Yes, and it's part of my corporation. And I'm still the principal owner. I don't need someone overseeing me. Think of it more as a collaboration, Rafael. After all, we're on the same team here. Teamwork is key to a successful marriage. You'll hit bumps on the road, but you'll weather them together. You'll become an ATV All-terrain vehicle. You hit a bump? Bam! It jostles you, but you'll be okay because you'll have all these really stunning features, dual joint suspension, a reinforced steel frame It should be noted that the parish recently gave Father Ortega a pep talk about making himself more accessible to youth. See? Just because I'm a priest doesn't mean I don't get it. That was a line they suggested he use. The point is, things will get difficult over the course of your marriage. They just will. So, tell me, have you faced difficulties as a couple so far? - Well, there's one thing - Yeah, there's this one difficulty - Go ahead, babe. - Right. Okay. I'm pregnant with another man's baby. I know, you know, I was it was a fluke medical accident, and I was accidentally inseminated, but I'm actually still a virgin. Unfortunately, the parish pep talk did not prepare Father Ortega for this. So it's been difficult. So that's why we're just kind of trying to, you know Whoa. Ooh Ride past it in the ATV. And to be clear, you never had - a relationship with the father? - No. Well, I mean there was one kiss. But that was years ago. But there's no physical connection anymore? No. Wait, why did you hesitate? I didn't hesitate. Did something happen between you and Rafael? No. Not consciously. What does that mean? I had a dream about him. What kind of dream? It was the kind where It was like, um, - a sex dream. - What?! It was nothing, and I cannot lie in front of the Father. We're getting married in six days, and you're fantasizing about another guy. That doesn't feel like nothing. What? Michael Michael Michael, wait. I know you're upset. - Can you blame me? - I'm sorry. It didn't mean anything. I'm sure it's just because he's the father. It's Great. Uh __ I have to get to work. We'll talk about your Rafael fantasies later. Xiomara had certainly fantasized about her first time in Rogelio's trailer. The details varied, but it always ended with sex in front of the vanity, so they could admire each other's work from multiple angles. One detail she didn't imagine? Yeah. This. Can I help you? I'm looking for Rogelio De La Vega. He's not here. Maybe send a letter next time. That's what most fans do. There are stalker laws, you know. I'm not a stalker. I'm a friend. And who are you? His manager. Oh. And his ex-wife. My bracelet. It must have fallen off when I was packing last week's gift baskets. Listen, this is a personalized gift from Rogelio. See? Xo. My name. That's a ""X""and a ""O."" like a kiss and a hug? Honey, he gave that to me last year. Look harder. __ You're about 24 hours from being arrested. Okay, your prints were all over the room. You've got cause, motive It wasn't me, okay? I believe you. But I got no other suspects, okay? So, unless we find something that points to someone else. - But there isn't anything! - God. Look, you can't let them arrest me! I'll tell them you tampered with a crime scene. - I will! You don't believe me? - Yeah. I know! But I can't help you unless you tell me where you were - the night of the murder. - But I didn't do it! You need an alibi. Ah, but that was a secret Petra would protect at all costs. Look well These are all too small. It's hard to make out details. Maybe if I don't know, if I was actually in the room, it would be a different story. You should've seen Michael's face. It was awful. I'm sure it wasn't as bad as it seemed. Oh, look. Your telenovela boyfriend is here again. Honestly, I think he wants you. No, what he wants is iced tea. Hi. Beautifully poured. Thank you so much. You're welcome. So, when are you getting married? Huh? Uh, I-I-I noticed the ring. Oh, um, uh Soon, actually less than a week. A week?! Wow! That's too quick. I think it's okay. So, um, I'm gonna go now. No, I mean don't get me wrong. - I mean, I'm thrilled for you. - Hey, Jane! Observe Jane between a rock and hard place. The rock being a weirdly intrusive telenovela star. The hard place being Rafael's body. Uh hey! Look! It's the guy from The Passions of Santos. I just wanted to check in on the magazine article, see how it was coming. I'll be done soon. And I'll get it to you. Great! Um, but you know what? There was something else that I wanted to talk to you about. Okay. Oh, I-I just figured that, you know, with, um The lawsuit against your sister and everything, you know, it's probably best that we kept our distance. - Uh, what do you mean? - I just, you know, um Maybe, uh, maybe all the baby stuff can actually go through Petra! - Petra? - Yeah! Oh! Oh, God! Jane! Jane! - Are you okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine! It's four feet, Baywatch! I'm sorry. I didn't, I didn't know if you could swim. You know I can stand, right? My cousin can't. Thanks. Jane? Mi-Michael! Oh, no! Michael, Michael! Michael, please stop! Michael, please, just stop! It was not what it looked like back there with Raphael. I was backing up and I fell into the pool. And then he jumped in. - How chivalrous. - No, listen. I was just talking to him about putting up boundaries. From now on, all the baby stuff is gonna go through Petra. I am doing everything I can to minimize contact, baby. Is that supposed to make me feel better, Jane? That you have to go to these lengths to avoid this guy? Is the chemistry just that intense? No! No! I just I don't What do you, what am I supposed to do, Michael, huh? Okay, how do I fix this? I love you, Jane. I want to be with you forever. This was all true. And so it broke Michael's heart to have to say what he said next. But if you have feelings for another guy I don't think we should be getting married. No. I've been very patient. If my daughter is to be married in a week, the time has come. - Rogelio - Xiomara, she thinks her father is some soldier. And not this critically acclaimed international superstar. Should I also tell her that this international superstar has his ex-wife send gift baskets to women he's had sex with? I would ask that you not. You met Melissa then? - Are you sleeping with her? - She's my ex-wife! Besides you cannot expect to be the only woman to whom I give the carnal gift of Rogelio. You know what? I have to go. No, no! Wait, wait! I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Melissa and I were married. What you and I have is something else. A chemical spark. It's like an animal attraction. So, just sex then? Oh, don't say it like that. Excellent sex. Um, so, yeah, we're totally happy with our wi-fi speed, but thanks. Hey. How was your day? We're confirmed for the bridal shop tomorrow for 4:00. Mom, I don't know if there's even gonna be a wedding. You told him about the dream, huh? I had to! I mean, we were in counseling. Father Ortega was staring at me. I mean, I get it. You know, if this was the other way around, if he was fantasizing about some other girl, a girl that was pregnant with his baby I'd be devastated! Mm. And I love him, mom, but Man, I get this feeling when I'm around Rafael Honey, honestly I think it's just a chemical thing. I had that once with someone and, well, it's easy to mistake it for something more. Are you talking about my father? Come on. You know, I remember every detail you told me about him. And there he was in his army uniform. And the minute I saw him, honey, oh, it was like a chemical thing. Was he handsome? The most handsome man I'd ever seen. And then what happened? He gave me a very special hug which led to you. You always wanted to hear about him. I was I was little, so So what do I do, mom? I don't want to lose Michael, and I told him that. Yeah, but he has a mental picture of you getting busy with another man. Okay, so how do I get rid of that mental picture in his head? Oh, it's gonna be hard. If you were a regular person, I'd tell you to go bang him with gusto. Ma So what's your version of that? Come on. You know what I like. Jane did know what he liked. Let's be real. Jane was a virgin, but not a Saint. And so she started writing with gusto. __ _ __ _ __ Rafael, stop. Look, I know you're stressed. Of course I'm stressed. I have Lachlan breathing down my neck. Okay, so do something about it. Push through the expansion deal. Show your father that you have foresight - and business sense. - Enough, Petra! It's none of your business! __ - Oh, sorry. Looking for Michael. - You just missed him. Is his bag in there, because I want to stick something in it? Yeah, yeah, I'll-I'll grab it for you. Thanks. Everything all right? Yeah, fine. Petra You seem upset. I'm just concerned. Did I forget to mention? These two go way, way back. Uh, thank you. Thank you. I, um I'm very excited about this promotion. In fact, it's the second most exciting thing that's happened this evening. The first being my engagement. Chinchin? Chinchin. Oh, my gosh. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Wow. Unbelievable. You made a mistake back then. Maybe I did. I thought we were doing better. I mean, I really thought we'd make it through all this. The miscarriage, his cancer. I'm sorry. Oh, please. You expect me to believe that? After I ended our engagement and married him instead? Let's be straight with each other at least. All right, then. Karma's a bitch. Better. What do you want? I heard you talking to your husband about an expansion deal. Maybe I can help facilitate. Help? Or make the deal yourself? Does it matter? What's in it for me? I'll do all the things that I used to do for you. To you. I'll pass. If I'm going to put the final nail in the coffin of my marriage, I want to be cut into the deal. Fine. My way would have been so much more fun. __ What are you doing here? Melissa told me about the mix-up with the bracelet. Ma, get out of here. I brought you a gift. It's inscribed. __ _ Xiomara, you are very special to me. You're the mother of my only child. That I know of. - Mm. - Anyway, I have to go. We're shooting this fantasy sequence tonight. That's why I'm wearing this ridiculous outfit. Alba __ _ - Are you wearing perfume, ma? - Xiomara __ _ __ _ Ma, stop. __ I'm going to tell her! __ I'm just waiting for the right time. __ I know that! __ I just don't want her to hate me, okay? When she finds out that I knew who her father was, and hid it for so long I'm scared, ma. I I don't want to lose her. __ _ __ Board meeting this afternoon. What are you talking about? In fact, let's have it in here. Just give me some more time, sir. We must have missed something. That's ridiculous! There was no one else in that room. What about the drink with no prints? Huh? Petra wouldn't wipe down a glass when her prints - are already all over that room. - Enough! Cordero, you got one more hour. Then I'm arresting Petra. - This is not a good time, Jane. - Oh, okay. Sorry, it's just been a couple hours, and you didn't say anything. About what I left in the bag? You mean the article you wrote about the hotel? __ __ Excuse me - We should talk. - Hm - Rafael, let me just - No. I get it. - explain something really quickly. - I get it. We've been we've been getting closer, - Okay, but that's not what I - and I do. I feel very connected to you as the mother of my child, - Okay, but this is - and-and And you are clearly a talented writer, Jane. I mean, you have depicted things in remarkably vivid detail. But, uh, this caramel scenario It's not gonna happen, Jane. I wrote that for Michael my fiancÃ©. Oh. Yeah. Well, that makes that makes sense. Yeah. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's okay. I I got to be honest I was totally freaking out. I thought I was gonna have to explain to you how I just - see you like a sister. - Ouch. And I do. See, that's the thing about fantasies They can vanish as quickly as they appear. Can I get the letter back? Oh. Yes, of course. - Well, that's fine. - Oh, yeah. Just take that. Yeah. Officially, you were never here, okay? But just look around. Is there anything you see that's unusual, out of place? What are you doing here, Jane? I have, uh, something that I want to give you? This is not a good time. Yeah. You know what? It never is. - But it'll be quick. - I said it's not a good time, Jane. What do you not understand about that? You know what? That's enough. Yes, I had a sex dream about Rafael, but I realized that those strange feelings I was having They weren't real. And I think the only reason why I've been feeling them is because I feel so distant from you. Because you've been acting all I-I don't know, weird, since this pregnancy thing happened. Detached and preoccupied. This is not exactly an easy thing, Jane. Yeah, well, marriage isn't exactly an easy thing. Didn't you listen to the priest? There are gonna be bumps in the road, and we have to be able to get through them together. And so far, with this baby, it doesn't feel like we have. And that's heartbreaking, Michael. And it's really scary. Because I love you. And I really want to marry you. But only if things go back to the way they were. Did you find anything? No, nothing. Look harder! Stop yelling at me. I'm trying to help you. Oh, please. You're doing this for yourself. If my marriage ends, Jane won't give the baby to Rafael, and then you'll end up with it. Which is the last thing you want. This was true. Michael had thought that was absolutely the last thing he wanted. So, figure something out. You're the detective here, not me. And tell the brutes in your department, they'll be reimbursing us for all the damage they've done. __ __ Look, it's clear. A perfect fit. And the cart is coated in the same gold paint that's on the wall. Bellboys must bang into walls all the time. Sure, but in the surveillance shot, just minutes before the murder, the dent and the paint weren't there. Okay, so what about your glass with no prints? Bellboys wear gloves, Nadine. We need to look in to all the bellboys working that night. Good call. What's wrong with you? You should be making your damn gloating face. Why aren't you happy? I am. He's not. And here's why. Brown eyes or blue eyes? Beautiful brown. What was his favorite food? Grilled cheese, just like you. I wish I could meet him. I know, baby, I know. Are you okay? __ I just want things to go back to the way they were before. Yeah, I know the feeling. __ _ __ _ Huh? __ _ __ But what none of them knew was that someone else wanted to be part of the fun as well. In conclusion, it would be foolish to ignore this expansion opportunity. The upsides are tremendous. Any thoughts? Yes, actually. What Lachlan's proposing completely fails to account for zoning ordinances and environmental impact. Under my proposal, we can address these issues while maximizing tax incentive to triple our revenue. Please, turn your attention to the screen. Though Lachlan could think only of Petra Push through the expansion deal. Show your father that you have foresight and business savvy. Who had screwed him once again, and not the way he liked. A toast to watching Lachlan fumble his way through a proposal that you've been fine-tuning for weeks. No, no, no, no. To you, Petra. I don't know how you do it. How did you get him to trust you? He never suspected a thing. But it's a brilliant strategy. To make someone think that you're allies until you get what you want. I mean Mmm. So, how long were you sleeping with Zaz, anyway? What?! We're done, Petra. But thank you for helping with Lachlan. Uh, where's Jane? - Michael? - Michael, stop. - It's bad luck. - I'm not gonna look. I just need to talk to her, okay? - Hey, Jane, can I come in? - Wait, don't - Wait, don't look! - I'm not I'm walking in backwards. Not gonna look. Just walking in backwards. Coming in; Here we go Okay, I will, too. What are you doing here? I needed to talk to you. You're right, Jane. What you said. This baby has come between us, and I was thinking about why and the things I've done. And I realized that it-it all stemmed from one thing. I have just been so afraid that you would want to keep it. That I'd have to raise some other guy's kid, and that, seriously, that felt like worst-case scenario to me. But it's not. Worst-case scenario is losing you. Oh But it's not just some other guy's baby. It's yours, too, and if you want it, I am all in. We'll figure this out together. We're gonna, we're gonna do this together. Baby, I don't want to keep it. I know, but I'm just saying if you did. Whatever you want, Jane, I'm here, okay? Whatever you want. Can I just say How incredibly hard it is for me not to turn around and kiss you right now? Right. Man! I need some prize for my self-control. You know I do have a little prize for you. A letter that took a little detour, but Wait, let me just double-check. And, yep, that, yep, good. I love you. I love you. Luisa, it's me. Rose. Look, I don't know where you are, if you're drinking, if you're okay, but you need to come home. Look, I-I spoke to your lawyer, and there's gonna be a pre-trial motion in two weeks, and if you don't show up, Jane will get a default judgment. Rafael will lose his share of the hotel. __ _ __ I am sure the linguists among you have picked up on this, but they are speaking Czech. __ _ __ _ __ _ __ _ ""Natalia""? the secret she was protecting at all costs. Oh Oh Don't, ma. Stop, grandma. Gracias, si. Muchos gracias, gracias. Mucho gusto. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you and good-bye. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry to interrupt. Uh I-I didn't mean to cause a scene. I-I wanted to watch from a distance. Wait, why did you want to watch from a distance? How did you even know we were here? Foursquare. You check in everywhere. Wait, you guys know each other? Yes, we-we, um, did musical theater together. Tell her. Jane, uh, please, sit. Okay, mm-hmm. You're not gonna kidnap me and hold me for ransom in a cave quickly filling with water, are you? So you watch the Novela, then. Yeah of course you do. It's a spectacular hit. - Gotcha. - Excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry, I-I-I'm nervous. I'm nervous. It's a big moment, and now that it's here, I find myself unsure on how to proceed. Well, why don't you start by telling me why you're here? Yes, yes, I will do that. I-I-I I'm your father. What? I'm your father. No, I heard you. Yeah, but you said ""What,""? so I thought you didn't. It should be noted the when Xiomara told Jane her father was an army guy This is not what Jane had in mind. You're You're really my father? Yes, I-I went to school with your mother when we were young. You You knew You knew who my father was? I'm sorry, honey. All this time Oh! You knew who my father was, and you didn't tell me? Like I said, you never really see a broken heart coming. I want you guys to go. I want you to go! Go now! That night in bed, Jane lay awake, thinking about how she'd been betrayed. Soon, she prayed for sleep. But dreams betray, too, remember? And no one is immune."
"All right, here we go. As you know, - Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated. - But I've never had sex. Needless to say, her fiancÃ© was not pleased. Please, for us, don't have this baby. But Jane decided to have the baby. And we're giving it to the father. He and his wife they really want it. And they're a really great couple. They weren't. In fact, Michael realized Petra was having an affair with Roman Zazo, her husband's best friend. End the affair, or I'll tell your husband. And Jane's not giving that baby to him alone. - But that problem took care of itself. - _ And unfortunately, Rafael found out about the affair anyway. We're done, Petra. And Michael finally got on board with keeping the baby. It's not just some other guy's baby, it's yours, too. And if you want it, I am all in. Luckily, she didn't want it. And, speaking of complications, Jane has just learned that her dad is telenovela star Rogelio De La Vega. I'm your father. All this time you knew who my father was, and you didn't tell me? And now we'll begin. As we all know by now, when Jane Gloriana Villanueva came into this world, her father was already out of the picture. And though she sometimes fantasized about who her father was and what having two parents would be like - Hurry up. - Jane and her mom had a typical mother-daughter relationship. What do you think? With the role of the mother played by Jane. I know. The shoes are pushing it. What time are you coming home? You have an interview tomorrow. - Not till the afternoon. - 2:30. I know. I get it. I'll be home by midnight. Don't drink too much, don't kiss too much, and don't forget to call if you're gonna be late. Honey, don't worry. - Love you. - But Jane did worry. Because if she didn't, who would? Jane. _ _ It was times like these when young Jane wished especially hard for a father. Someone responsible and wise, someone who would take care of things so she wouldn't have to. Someone like Jimmy Smits. See, Jane held a secret suspicion that Jimmy Smits was her father. And she was equally sure he'd come home any minute. But, alas, Jane's father was not Jimmy Smits. He was, however, a star that burned just as bright. _ I do. I'm sorry, Abuela, but I do. _ She had 23 years to correct it, and she didn't. She just kept lying. _ Please, Abuela, stop, all right? I just need some space from her right now. Jane. Jane, come on. We need to talk. We don't. We do not have to. I made a mistake. A mistake? A mistake is losing your keys. - You kept my father from me. - I know. I'm sorry. _ _ _ _ _ _ Gracias. Stop. The water's for the fish. Mmm, mmm, mmm No. It needs to be grand. - Uh-huh? - Too peach. I don't pop in peach. I like it, but not for this. Make me bedsheets out of it. - When does the scene shoot? - Shooting? No, this is not make-believe, Roxanna. This is real life. My daughter is coming. So I must prepare to step into the role of father. Oh, yeah? _ How you been, Mike? It's been a while, huh? Yeah. Um, look, uh, this isn't it's not a good time right now. Ah. Got it. I'll be quick. Uh, I need money. Like, um, $2K should cover things. $2,000? - What-what do you think I do for a living? - Aw, come on. I'm sure you've been saving. You're the responsible brother, remember? Yeah, maybe dip into that big wedding fund. How is Jane, anyway? You stay away from her. Look, I'm trying, man. But $2,000 would probably help. $10,000 cash right now to move out of this apartment while we deal with the divorce settlement. Raf, stop. Look, I made a mistake. - A mistake? - Yes. A mistake is a parking ticket. - You're not thinking clearly. - In fact, Rafael was thinking quite clearly. I'm thinking about the fact that you screwed my best friend. Well stop thinking about that. - Think about Jane. - See, that was part of the problem as well. He had been thinking about Jane. Or dreaming about her, I should say. Raf, think about the baby. Good morning, you two. Good morning, Magda. We'll talk later. Listen, can you do me a favor? - Name it. - Cover my lunch? Can't do it. I'm seeing my father. Today? Oh, my God. Of course. Thank you. I love you. - I love you, too. - Sweet. Make-out time. You're disgusting, Tom. Hence his nickname _ You do realize her fiancÃ©'s the cop who's been interviewing everyone. Cool. Look forward to talking to him about all the blood splatters I saw and how hot his fiancÃ©e is. Okay, don't forget lunch, okay? You can be late to your shifts but not mine. I won't forget. It's my sister. _ I have to call her. What are you doing here? Look, I wanted to apologize for last night. You're right, okay? My issues with my brother shouldn't keep you from being honest with your best friend. - Yeah? - Yeah. Look, I think we should just tell Jane and Michael that we've been dating. Thanks, baby. Hi. I-I wanted to talk to you. Well, that's not all he wanted to do to her. It's about the-the baby. If it seems Rafael is nervous, it's only because he is. What's going on? Because he knows what he's about to say may change Jane's feelings about what to do with the baby. Petra cheated on me with my dead best friend, and our marriage isn't exactly in the best place. What was that? That's what I wanted to tell you. And also that no matter what happens, I still want to raise this baby. Just you? Alone? Yes. Sorry. I just I don't know. I It's just not what I pictured. I know. Me neither. But I still think it's the best option, and Jane, I want this baby. And I know your fiancÃ© doesn't, - so - No, he changed his mind about that, actually. Oh. But does that change what you want? Because I hope it doesn't. It might. I mean, I I just had this picture in my head, this thing I didn't have, a two-parent, happy, stable home. And now you're telling me that that's - not gonna happen. - Look, no decisions have been made yet. I mean, - Petra wants to go to therapy, and I might - Okay. Well, then we both have things to think about, I guess. Okay, so I'll see you later. Okay. See you later. And then he said the fact that he's getting a divorce - shouldn't affect me. - The guy's an idiot. Babe, stop. I mean, he is the father - of the child. - I know. I'm sorry. But whatever you want to do, if you want to keep the baby, we will. We got plenty of room. There's a walk-in closet. It's huge. We're not putting the baby in the closet. I was kidding. No, but, really, what are my options? I m I can let him raise it alone or the three of us share custody? Which is just hard and complicated. Yeah, it would be. I'll support whatever you decide. Just let me know which way you're learning towards baby, no baby. No closet. No closet. Got it. But, Michael Hmm? His wife and his best friend. Can you believe that? He could believe it. Michael has known this for a while, a fact he's kept hidden from Jane. Yeah. It's-it's crazy. It's crazy. But, come on, you're gonna be late. Okay. Wait, where's my envelope? Here. What's in it? Just some baby pictures and this Jimmy Smits thing. - Just in case I need a spontaneous icebreaker. - Always good to plan spontaneous icebreakers. No, be serious. I'm nervous, Michael. I'm going to get to know my dad. Which is really great timing because I'm not talking to my mom. I just want it to go well. I just really want it to look good, Michelle. What do you think we'll talk about? What shoes should I wear? He's gonna love you. She's gonna love me, right? How could anyone not? But is it the second door to the left? Sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late. Sorry, sorry, sorry I'm late. Sorry I'm late. Sorry. You must be Jane. My name is Nicholas - and I work for your wonderful father. - It should be noted that Nicholas had been prepared by Rogelio. He was also told to bow. Come. Follow me. Rogelio. Jane's here. Jane? Where is he? Understand that Rogelio had dreamed of this moment since he'd learned he had a daughter. He wanted to make a grand entrance. One his daughter would never forget. Unfortunately this was maybe a little too grand. Hi, Jane. It's good to see you again. - Hi, Rogelio. - Call me Dad. I think, Rogelio, for now. Okay, we'll go with Rogelio for now. May I hug you? - Yes. Oh. - Now. - All the records, meaning what? - Time cards punched, any HR incidents, tipping percentages, I don't care. We need everything you have on any employee - that was working the night of the murder. - Got it. Does that mean you think one of my employees killed him? We didn't say that. Well, what can you say? To you? At the moment nothing. Well I mean, it has to be. Otherwise, what is this really about, Detective? Well, actually, this is a really tricky question. On the surface, this is about the fact that a bellboy might connect Roman Zazo's murder to Sin Rostro, the notorious drug dealer known as The Man Without A Face. But underneath, their tension was actually about Jane. The woman with the beautiful face. Again. This is official police business. We really can't talk about it. I'll get you the records. So what? Suddenly you want the kid? I want what Jane wants. Got it. But sorry to hear about your marriage, man. Tough break. Honestly? I can't believe my mom kept you from me for so long. Yeah, I know. - It is a crime. - Mm. In many ways, a hate crime. I guess we're just gonna have to make up for lost time. - Yeah. - I'm moving out of the house. I know this is a lot to ask, but I was wondering if there was any way You could stay with me? I would love nothing more. Great. 'Cause I really hate my mom these days. You see? We have something in common, then. Oh, oh, that reminds me. I made this doll of her. Do you want to stick pins in it? No. We should set it aflame. And they'll sit there and laugh and watch as I explode. _ _ Maybe not exactly like that, fine. _ _ Yeah, and she hates me. _ _ _ _ _ _ This was good advice, because there's no way Xiomara could imagine their meeting. _ - No, thank you. - Please, have some. - I'm pregnant, so - Right, yeah, of course. I'm sorry. I will have some, Nick. It should be noted that Rogelio always liked a glass of wine when he was nervous. More. Nice. And he was very nervous. To my daughter, Jane Gloria Villanueva. Gloriana. Jane Gloriana. To you. Ah. So how do you like the set? I had the crew work on it around the clock. - Oh, you didn't have to do that. - It was no trouble. Actually, I didn't move a finger. So, um, where are we, exactly? ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡. Mayan temple. It's a quick fly from Mexico City. So this must mean something to you. - Indeed, it does. - Tell me. Well, as a younger man, at a very low point in my life, I climbed to the top of the temple and I prayed. It was a very spiritual moment for me. Wow. What did you pray for? Great fame. Jane, I'm sure you must have many questions about me. - Yes, I do, I -  And the best way to get those answers is by reading this. It says unauthorized biography, but, actually, one of my many publicists wrote it. Thank you. You're welcome. Now, tell me everything about yourself. I wonder what we have in common. Clearly, we have nothing in common. He's shallow and vain and not what I imagined him to be. I'm freaking out about this. I I just need to talk to my Oh, dear. She was about to say her mother. You could call her, Janie. No. Okay. I'll be your mom. First thing you say. What do I do? You should give him another try. And he's probably just really nervous. Maybe see him again but on your turf. Away from the Mexican ruins. Let's have him over for dinner, something casual, low-key. That sounds perfect. No. Perfect is tacos, beer, ESPN, you wearing nothing but my Ronaldo jersey. Yeah, I think that'd be a little weird for my dad. Maybe I can cook for him. Since when do you cook? I'm an honors student, Michael. I can follow a recipe. And I'll get a good one from my grandma. Why is it so messy in here? Oh, sorry, it's paperwork. Mm. Hey, why is my name on this list? Am I a suspect for something? It's the list of the people working the hotel the night of the murder. Well, it isn't right, because I know one bellboy that was definitely working and not on here. Disgusting Tom. Oh, my God. That's a clue, right? Easy, Veronica Mars. It's just an oversight. You trade shifts with people all the time and don't tell anyone. But I will let you know when you cracked the case. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I just did, babe. How difficult is it not to get caught cheating? Blaming me won't help, Mother. Petra, you promised. After what happened, you said you would always take care of me. I know, I know, and I will. I think I got through to him. A little bit. He wants that child. Petra. He must also want you. Darling. Your skin is so dry. You must take care of that. Your beauty is your weapon. One of your weapons. You understand what I'm saying? Jane? You're supposed to be at dance class. You think I can dance when my daughter won't speak to me? I just came for a recipe. How was your meeting with your father? How do you think it was? We're strangers. I don't know anything about him and he doesn't know anything about me. - I'm sorry, Jane. - Yeah. You know, you keep saying that, but it's hard to get to the âit's okayâ part. Because it's not okay. What you did to me what you took away from me it's not okay. And I just don't understand how you could've done it. Because you're not a mother yet. You know, when you were little, we'd go to the park and there'd be all these moms there, talking about their kids and how great they were. And I remember thinking they were crazy. Because it was so obvious that I got the best one. I loved you so much, and I just got scared. Of what? I don't know. What if he came and made some kind of claim on you? What if he wanted to make plans, what if he wanted to take you away? It was easier to pretend that he didn't exist. Easier for you. But now I have this man in my life my father and I don't even have a relationship with him. And that's not easy, Mom. I know it's not, and I'm sorry. And you don't have to say it's okay, now, I know, it's not, but we're gonna get through this eventually, right? I don't know. I really don't know. We have five plastic surgery recovery suites now. If we expand into the new site, we could have as many as 20. I would keep the interior hotel-like, but hospital grade, as we did with the others. - And carry through - Excuse me. As you might have noticed, when Rafael and Michael speak, it's often more about what is unspoken than spoken. - What can I do for you, Detective Cordero? - _ - Can we talk to you for a sec? - _ Apparently, there were some names missing from that employee list you gave us? - We want to make sure it's just an oversight. - _ - I have no idea what you're talking about. - _ - I know at least one bellboy who worked that night - _ - that wasn't on the list. - _ - Anything I can do to help. - _ - We need information on him. - _ - No problem. - _ - Great. - _ - Okay, I need to tell you something. - Mm-hmm. At first you're gonna be a little mad, but then you're gonna realize it's okay. Oh, yeah? Is that what's gonna happen? - I hope. - What is it? Well, you know I've been seeing this guy, right? - Mm-hmm. - It's Billy. Michael's brother, Billy. What? I know. - For how long? - Like, six weeks. What?! At my engagement party? We had sex in Michael's bathroom. Yeah. - Lina! - I know! Michael and his brother they don't get along. He doesn't even like to talk about him. And that's why Billy wanted to keep it on the down-low, because if it went away, it went away. But at this point, we want you to know. I mean, what if he's using you to piss off Michael? - Okay, first of all, thanks. - Well, no. Come on. I didn't mean it like that. You know I didn't mean it like that. I just don't want you to get hurt. And Michael says that he's been in a lot of trouble. I know, and he's been honest with me about it, but he's changed. Just ask Michael to give him a chance. Rafael? Petra, I'm Look what I found. You kept the Frisbee? Of course I kept it. A Frisbee, maybe, but not a hat. Of course it's a hat. How big is our kid's head going to be? I know. It's awful, okay? You see, I'm really not prepared to be a mom. Stop. You're gonna be great. Come here. And our kid will grow into the Frisbee. God, the service in this place is terrible. How long does it take to get a Margarita? Yeah. Beautiful location, though. It definitely has potential. What, as in a place to invest in? I mean, it needs a huge remodel. And I'd have to empty my trust fund, which would be a huge undertaking. I'd be risking a lot. Well, I think you should do it. I believe in you. We were so happy. And then we had all the well bad luck. The miscarriage, cancer. But we can get back to what we had. I wish it was that easy. But it can be. We have the best reason of all to stay together. A baby. And I know how much you want that. And I know how much I want you. - Just calm down, baby. - You don't understand. Billy's only dating Lina to piss me off. Yeah! I told her that, and got to be honest, didn't really go over great. Well, that's what's happening. He thinks that the closer he gets to you, the more uncomfortable I'll get, and I'll give him money. That's what he wants. It's what he always wants. $2,000, he asked me this time. - What?! - Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? Because I said no, because I'm saving for us, our future. And he knows I don't want him hanging around you, so he's hanging with Lina to get under my skin. Well, don't let him get under your skin, because I can handle myself with your brother. Jane, you don't understand. Okay. Well, just tell me then, Michael. Look, you know I was a bad kid. We talked about this. And I don't need him telling you stories. Okay. Is there a story in particular you don't want him telling me about? We used to do stupid things. What kind of stupid things? Mostly stealing cars and selling the parts. Oh, so, like, illegal stupid things. Yeah. We worked out of this old garage. The cops found it. He was only 16, no record. I already was in trouble. Billy took the blame. - What?! - I tried to come forward, but our-our lawyer said that if I did, he'd still be in jail for lying. Oh, my God. Yeah. After that, I-I I turned my life around. He went the other way. And I've been bailing him out ever since. I wish you'd told me about this a while ago, you know? I should have. But it's not something I'm-I'm proud of, so You don't have to be proud with me. Just honest. I can handle this stuff. Just be honest with me, okay, Michael? Especially now with my mom lying and everything that's happened. I just need it. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to just barge in like this, but I didn't know if you would want to see me. I really screwed things up with Jane, Xiomara. Oh, no. What happened? Oh, I'll turn that off. No. No, please. It relaxes me. Rogelio? Yes. What? And it was terrible, Xiomara. When I am nervous, I talk, and I was so nervous. Everything you told me about her how smart she was, and how she's going to be a teacher, and You know, I never did well in school, so, maybe I overcompensated a little. The Mayan ruins? It was actually quite beautiful, but, yes, in retrospect, a little over the top. Right. See, the thing is, Jane's not impressed with money or power. She likes going to the movies or shopping at Target. - That kind of thing, low-key stuff. - I see. I just want to get it right with her. And, anyway, she reached out again and invited me for dinner tonight. So, I thought, you know, maybe you could come to help make things less awkward. Oh. I would, but Jane and I well, we're not exactly on the greatest of terms right now. Because of me? No. Because of me. The last thing I wanted was to affect your relationship. I know, and you've been surprisingly understanding. She's just having a hard time with it, which I also understand. I'm sorry. This is so embarrassing. You'll be fine. Just be yourself. Jane just wants to get to know you. She wants to show you baby pictures, normal stuff like that. Okay, so, I tried to make one of my grandma's recipes, but Michael is right. I can't cook. But in your unauthorized bio it says that you were fond of takeout Thai. Oh, and sake bombs, it said. Yes. No, I-I-I No, I think I'll-I'll I will pass at the moment. Okay. In fact, things seemed to be going surprisingly well. - Should we get started? - Let's. Actually, there is something I did want to talk to you about. - Hmm? - It's about your mom. Pad Thai. - Well, hello. - What about her? You have to understand that she was not wrong. - Excuse me? - When I was 17, I was an idiot kicked out of school, smoking weed. - She wanted to protect you. - Look. I think it's really nice that you want to defend her, but I don't want to talk about it, okay? Mm. Right, that's between me and my mom. So, how did you get into telenovelas? Jane, well, she was terrible, but she was scared. - Rogelio, come on. - I just want you to see her side. - I know her side. - She was crying, Jane. And you don't think that I've cried? But you wouldn't know that because you don't know anything about me, not even my middle name. And that's because of her. And I guess for you, it is easy to forgive that because you've only know about me for 16 months. But I have thought about you every single day for the past 23 years. You know what? I'm-I'm sorry, I can't do this. Rogelio, you seem like a nice enough man, but we haven't been a part of each other's lives until now, and we've been fine, so let's not force it. So your dad left. I made him a little to-go box. Extra cashew chicken, for future reference. Thanks. It's funny. I kept telling myself going in, âNo expectations, no expectationsâ It's impossible not to have expectations. What were they? You know, the fantasy. Someone I could connect with immediately, someone who I can see myself in, who gets me. - Maybe someone who can help me figure out what to do right now. - Like the baby? Yeah. Rafael as a single father is not what I pictured. And I didn't picture us raising it with him. There's no perfect answer. But I'm in it with you, remember? I know. And I wouldn't be able to do it without you. I don't want to fight anymore. Neither do I. These are the divorce papers. You were about to have sex with me yesterday. - We stopped. - Yes. But I could tell you didn't want to. Petra, please, let's keep what little dignity we have left. Jane's going to change her mind. You're going to have to share custody of that baby. I'm hoping I won't. You will. You know you will. Rafael, we can work it out. Not if I don't love you anymore. You make me sick. I understand. So sign the divorce papers. You'll get your $250,000 and we'll be done with each other. Hi. What are you doing here? I heard what you said about not forcing things. This is not forcing things. This is apologizing. I think I was trying to make up for all these years in two hours. I was trying to impress you. But I went too far, so I'm sorry. No. It's okay. I think I was hard on you, and I had expectations that were totally unreasonable. Then let's begin again. Can we? Mm-hmm. Good. Your mother told me you brought baby pictures, so I brought you one as well. To celebrate our relationship. I-I don't know what to say. Say nothing. It's yours to keep. I was also thinking about what you said, how we haven't been a part of each other's life for 23 years. And that's true. But I didn't know about you all that time. But now that I know, I'm not walking away from you, Jane Gloriana Villanueva. Even if it's not perfect. Nothing's perfect. Perfect is a fantasy. And in this moment, Jane realized she had something in common with her father after all. I can't walk away from this baby. And I know that's not what you want to hear, but that's where I'm at. Whether you stay with Petra or get a divorce We're divorcing. I'm sorry. But, regardless, I can't walk away. And I wanted to be honest with you because you were honest with me. And you're okay with this? I am. Absolutely. So, what, I'm gonna get my kid on weekends? 'Cause I'll fight for more time. We'll have to work out custody. It's not gonna be easy. I know. But nothing is and nothing's perfect. We'll just have to make it work. Absolutely. Together. We'll figure this out. Okay. Are you okay? Not really. I'm freaking out. Well, just know that I am freaking out with you. I do. Thank you, Michael. And when you get home, be prepared for tacos, beer and me in your Ronaldo jersey. Yes. _ And now I must draw your attention back to Jane's plan. The one that involved tacos. Beer. And her in a Ronaldo jersey. The only problem? She could not find that jersey. I can get you the number of a few custody lawyers I know. Thanks. This whole thing is just messed up. A guy I can't stand is gonna be involved in raising my kid. I just don't know what Jane's doing with him. Rafael, do you have feelings for her? It's complicated. Not that complicated. He liked her. _ Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Oh, my God. - But, alas, dead bellboys tell no tales. Who did this? S-Sin Rostro. Anymore. I'm sorry, Mother. I really thought it was going to work out. I know you did, darling. But, eh it's done. No use worrying. You'll just ruin your skin. Come. Sit. Let's moisturize. We'll come up with a plan. Ooh. Moisturizer's not going to help that. But I don't understand. What is Sin Rostro? Not what, who. He's a big drug kingpin who disappeared for a few years and recently resurfaced. Connected to my hotel? Well, your friend Roman Zazo seemed to have had some sort of relationship with him. Wait, why am I just now hearing about this? We couldn't compromise the investigation. Zazo was waiting to be contacted by Sin Rostro just before he died. Wait, there have been two murders now. - In my hotel. - And we want to prevent any more. Which is why all of this needs to stay in this room. No one can know what the bellboy said. No one breathes the words âSin Rostro.â Do you understand? Jane. What's going on? Jane You knew. All this time, you knew and you didn't tell me. - I didn't want to compromise the investigation. - Oh, please. Who was I gonna tell? - It's complicated. - No, it's not. You lied to me. You stood there this morning when I was telling you that Petra cheated on Rafael with his best friend - and you pretended to be surprised. - I know. I-I felt I feel terrible. Are you kidding me? I didn't tell you about the affair because when I found out you were pregnant, I freaked out. I didn't want the baby. But I changed my mind. You know this. I changed my mind. You would've let me give that baby to a couple who may have been totally wrong. - I made a mistake. - A mistake? Yes, I made a mistake. - Wait. Jane. Jane. Please. Please. - I got to go. - Let go of me. - I'm sorry. Look, I screwed up. I was scared, I was stupid. But everything I did, I did because I love you. Jane. D-Don't leave. _ But Jane didn't know if she could forgive him. In fact, in that moment, betrayed by the man she thought she knew so well, Jane Gloriana Villanueva knew only one thing: she needed her mother. Honey. You could have warned me. You would have said no. And it was the only way to break that prenup. Mrs. Solano, - you sure you're feeling okay? - Yes, - much better. Thank you. - Good. So, can you tell me how this happened? My husband did it. And I'd like to file a police report. It's true. Sometimes you really do need your mother."
"All right, here we go. Jane the virgin got accidentally inseminated. But I've never had sex! And this created a lot of problems for a lot of people. First, there was Rafael, the sperm donor who found himself having feelings for Jane. But he first had to deal with his scheming, cheating wife. - We're done, Petra. - What? But Petra wasn't going down without a fight. - My husband did it. - Pretty dramatic stuff. Also dramatic Jane's father, international telenovela star, was back in her life. I was trying to impress you, but I went too far. I'm sorry. - And speaking of relationships Jane's mother was interested in her father. Very interested. Unfortunately, she had to deal with his ex-wife Melissa. Maybe send a letter next time. That's what most fans do. There are stalker laws, you know. But Xo was winning so far. And sadly, Jane's love life was now a mess. She pushed off any feelings for Rafael because she was engaged to Michael. You knew all this time. But she just found out Michael had been lying to her for a very long time. - Jane, please, please. - Let go of me. - D-don't leave. - And that's where we left off. Jane's 21st birthday party can be described in one word epic. _ Yeah! Yeah! It's your party. Take a drink. _ Yes! Oh, there's some more people coming. Excuse me. Hmm. In novelas, this is known as an encuentro significativo, or a ""significant encounter."" It's the moment when two people who are meant for each other have their first encounter. Excuse me, Miss. There's been a noise complaint from your neighbors. In this case, there was one slight miscalculation. _ You got me a stripper?! No, no, no, no. I'm a police officer. No, there's been a complaint. I have a complaint. Your clothes are still on. Oh, I am an I'm an actual cop. You are too hot to be a cop. But not too hot to be a naked cop! This looks like a real gun! You're a real cop. Mi Amor Oh. _ Hey, wait. Now it's snowing on the yacht. Snow makes everything more romantic. Well, I'm just saying, shouldn't they have coats on? I thought you weren't going to sit here and pick it apart. Sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, so What do you like about telenovelas? The idea that two people are destined to be together. And so, Jane explained to Michael why a man professing his love to a woman on a yacht in the snow in front of a semi-realistic background was the epitome of romance. So, what's the guy in the bolero jacket saying now? ""From our first meeting"" ""I knew it was you."" ""I just knew."" Kendall district station Uh-oh. - That's me. - Mm-hmm. Thanks for not arresting me. Thanks for asking me to stay. That's amazing. Like I said, it was epic. But that was then And this is now. You got a package. Oh, my my dress. What are you doing here? We need to talk. Can I can I come in? No. I'm not ready to talk, Michael. Come on, Baby. We just you know, we-we got to We got to get through this. I want to get married. I don't know if I want to. Jane please. What happened? Me not telling you that Petra cheated on Rafael it was it was awful. I know that. I-I am so sorry. I know you are. But I just keep thinking about how many times you lied to me since then. You're overreacting. You're, like, hormonal or something. Be honest with me. Okay, Michael? This is not a good time. You know what? It never is. And then I just start thinking about the baby and how you were gonna let me give it to this couple that had all these problems when you knew how much it meant to me for her to go to a stable family. I'm sorry. I just I need more time, Michael, to see if I can forgive you and get past this. Okay. You okay, Baby? All of a sudden, I just I I look at him differently, and I don't know if I can go back. _ Yeah, because taking it off feels so final. And you don't want it to be final? I don't want any of this. Oh, my God, enough! I want to stop crying! That's what I want! What time is dinner with Rogelio? Oh, honey, let me call him. We'll cancel. No, no, I don't want that. It means he's finally listening to me about toning down the over-the-top gestures. Besides, I think it's sweet he wants us to meet his stepdaughters. Former stepdaughters. Hopefully, they're not as bitchy as their mom. Xiomara Oh, no. Oh, no. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - What? There has to be a big mistake. _ They gave my student teaching placement, finally. Really? Where'd they assign you? That's the thing. That's where they made the mistake. _ They put you in a Catholic school! Mom. It's a high school. Hello? Hi. This is Jane Villanueva, and I'm in the teaching education program. Hi, Miranda. There's been a mistake. I just got my assignment and it says that I'm teaching at a high school, but I actually specified very specifically that I would like to teach middle schoolers. Yes, I do understand that the degree is in adolescent education, but again, I specified No, see, but, see, I feel like I can have the most impact on younger girls. No, I-I can't wait till next semester. This is my last requirement for graduation, and I'm pregnant. I should have planned better? Are you serious, Miranda? Wait, no, no, no, Miranda, Miranda, Miranda, Miranda. I'm sorry. I should not have snapped. Listen, here's the thing. I had a not-so-great experience in high school. You know, mean girls You get it, right? Okay? And but-but here's the thing: I want to use that experience to prevent younger girls, like middle schoolers, from becoming mean girls. That's a part of what being a teacher, for me, is all about. Okay. Thank you. Good-bye. Looks like I'll be teaching at a Catholic high school. Maybe you don't tell them you're a pregnant virgin. The Nuns or the high schoolers? _ Thanks, Grandma. Hello? Jane, hi. Hello? Sorry, I'm on the bus. I just wanted to apologize for what happened yesterday, when you You know, when you said that you wanted to raise the baby? I was kind of a jerk. Oh, you mean when you said that you would fight me for custody? Jane, I'm sorry. You know, I was shocked and I didn't mean it. It's just and being a father, like, a present father, it's just really It's important to me. And-and we'll work it out. You know? You, me and Michael. Yeah, thanks for saying that. There was so much more, of course, Rafael wanted to say to Jane. Words like ""I have feelings for you"" and ""let's be together."" Okay, so I'm almost home. I I'll call you later. Yeah, yeah. Uh, absolutely. We'll-we'll talk later. Bye, Jane. But alas, the time wasn't right. What are you doing here? These guys needed help finding your apartment. Rafael Solano, you have the right to remain silent. - Wait a whoa. - Anything you say can and will be used - against you in a court of law. - What are you talking about? - You have the right to an attorney. - Hey, what did you do? If you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Can someone tell me what the hell is going on? I'm sorry, Rafael. I had to tell them what you did. You have to breathe from deeper down, through your diaphragm. Always the gentleman, Rogelio had agreed to help Xiomara prepare for her singing debut at the hotel. Whoa. I feel really dizzy. - Oh. You do? - Yeah, could I sit down? Oh, of course. Of course, of course. - Do you need anything? - No, no. I'm fine. Oh. Just a little out of practice, I think. I hope my voice can fill the lounge. Well, you have your band. That's what they're for. I don't actually have a band. I've mostly sung with backing tracks. Do you think I need one? Yes, yes, you do. But you're in luck, because I have recorded over seven telenovela theme songs. Oh. So eight. Eight exactly. So I have wonderful musicians I can call. Really? You said this was a big shot for you. Thank you. Of course. Xiomara, I didn't know you were here. _ Rogelio was just helping me prepare my set. Oh, yes. Congratulations. I'm really glad you're here. I've been wanting to apologize. I was such a bitch when we first met. I'm sorry. I didn't know who you were to him. Oh. That's okay. Good, Melissa. You can make it up to Xiomara by booking her a band. My best musicians. Absolutely. Right away. Uh, you should go down to the lobby. The reporter from Telemasivo is waiting - to interview you. - Ah, yes, yes. Xiomara, I'll see you at dinner. Perfect. I really look forward to bringing our families together. Oh, thank you for saying that. Uh, me, too. And I know Jane's really looking forward to meeting your daughters. Stay away from him. Excuse me?! Do you think I don't know your type? My type?! You didn't want a relationship with Rogelio until you realized he was famous. I had lost track of him. There's a word for that, honey. Starts with ""gold."" Ends with ""digging."" Oh, yeah? Well, there's a word for you, too. Starts with nasty. Ends with Smile! #Awkwardfamilydinner. That was funny, Valeria. I'm gonna tweet that to my 6.3 million followers. _ To my former stepdaughters. You will always be stepdaughters in my heart. And I'm so happy you chose to relocate to Miami. Mom made us 'cause she's managing your career, and you wanted to be closer to Jane. Well, that's not entirely true. We moved to Miami because production of my show moved here permanently. Because you told them you wanted to be closer to Jane. Details are not important. _ What's important is you are here now. And you get to meet the brilliant Jane. My daughter. Who tomorrow will be a teacher. Just, like, a student teacher. I believe teaching is one of the most noble professions in the world. So, are you really a pregnant virgin? Well, they were asking about the circumstance, and I did not want them to get the wrong idea about you. Or your incredible purity. Why haven't you swiped your ""V"" card? Can't find someone to have sex with you? Don't let those girls get to you. They're mean like their mom. I kind of felt bad for them actually. Rogelio really went overboard again. And I just need to tell him to tone it down a little more. Jane, this is for you. You got me a car? Or a lot more. What the hell is your problem? Our drug investigation turned into a double homicide. And the latest victim named Sin Rostro one of the biggest drug lords around as his assailant, and we don't have any leads. This is the dead bellboy's locker, right? Hey, what's this? Now we're talking. Well, call it. It could be one of Sin Rostro's contacts. Nothing. It's disconnected. We'll run a history. Good eye. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Which brings us here. Now, with Jane back in high school. And, of course, we do have a code of conduct required for all our teachers. Of course, I understand. You will have no conduct issues with me. Good. And really, how bad could a group of teenagers really be? And here's your classroom. Oh. Girls, Sister, please welcome your new Teacher Ms. Villanueva. Oh, uh, those girls in the back, I know them actually. Valeria and Victoria? - Mm-hmm. - They just transferred. Apparently their father heard we had a wonderful faculty. Oh, my God This is, this is really awkward. But we thought this was a Catholic school. Oh, it is. Of course. Then, why are we being taught by an unmarried pregnant woman? Maybe we can talk in private? It should be noted that this was the first time Jane Gloriana Villanueva had ever been called to the Principal's office. A pregnant virgin? Due to a medical mistake. And I absolutely should've disclosed it. But I'm sure you can understand it's a pretty unconventional situation. Yes. It really is. The problem, Ms. Villanueva, is that what just happened will be repeated by students to their parents. And I will explain how I took an unfortunate incident and turned it into a thoughtful choice. That's certainly true. I-I believe that I have a lot to offer these girls. Just give me a chance, please. No more drama? You have my word. No more drama. Victoria, Valeria, please come in. Say hi to your slutty mom for us. I am so not slutty! You asked me to tell you exactly what they said. She's right. I heard. Yeah, yeah. Whatever. You got to put those girls in their place. You want me to help? I can go after their mom. No, stop. No one's going after anyone. The girls are clearly acting out because they're jealous. I'll talk to Rogelio, and he can deal with them. And, you, do not engage with their mom. Be the bigger person. That's so not her style. It is too my style. It was definitely not her style. But still, Xiomara was determined to take Jane's advice. I really appreciate you arranging the band. I know this situation must be hard for you. Thank you, Xiomara. I appreciate it. Meet the girls in your band. And yes. Rogelio has slept with every single one of them. - Oh, wait, Rogelio! - Oh, Jane! I was so excited when you tweeted you wanted to meet up. Unfortunately, I'm on my way to the set. Maybe you could come by since you have the car? No, no, actually I can't. I have to work. But this won't take any time. I wanted to talk to you about the twins. They're in your school! Because Melissa wanted them under your influence. - How could I argue? No? - Right. Well, here's the thing. Um, you know, they're a little disruptive. - What? - Yeah, I mean, it's fine now. But I wanted to talk to you about where it's coming from. Oh, yes. Yes, good. Because I've been trying to help with their behavior, but Rogelio, clearly they're jealous, which I get. You know, you've been going a little overboard on the attention again. In in what way? - The car. - Oh! Yes, well, thank you for alerting me to the problem, Jane. I will take care of it right away. Okay, great, great. Thanks. Hey! You okay? Well, not great. Considering I spent the night in jail. Why were you in jail?! She said you hit her? Yes, and I didn't. She just wants leverage. More money in the divorce settlement. And just so you know, I would never lay a hand on her. And I can't even believe I have to say that. You don't. I believe you. I I thought my life was complicated. What's going on with you? I have evil stepsisters suddenly Who are enrolled in the school that I'm teaching at, which is totally taking me back to high school, which was not the happiest place for me. Wait, what happened in high school? My mom dated this popular girl's dad, and it ended badly. And she turned everyone against me. I can't imagine anyone intimidating you. Well I-I, I was different in high school. Kind of quiet and shy. And you wouldn't have noticed me. Of course I would've noticed you. Anyway, uh, there's nothing like spending the night in jail. Yeah, yeah. Um I can't believe Michael didn't tell you about the arrest. Well, uh, we Are actually having problems, so Oh? And there it was Yeah. Briefly. An opening. Anyway I should get back to work. Yes. Yeah, okay. Well, uh, - we'll-we'll talk later? - Mm-hmm. All right. Xiomara? Can we talk? You have to understand, when Jane looks at you, she just keeps remembering this sequence of events in her head the pregnancy, the lying. How do I get that out of her head? I don't know. Maybe with time? Is she still wearing her ring? Seriously, did you punch yourself? Rafael, stop. You and I both know what happened. No. We don't. But we know what's happening. Oh, good! Then we both know the solution. _ Fine. Get the hell out. I'm not going anywhere. What's yours is mine, remember? Hey, I got a delivery. A Roman Zazo. Roman Zazo's dead. No, this is Roman Zazo. Want to sign? Here. It's your problem now. Excuse me. Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing? Ro gave us cars because he felt bad. What? Thanks for talking to him. Oh Okay. Oh, my gosh. All right, that's right. Why don't you guys erase that picture? No, no, come on, ser-seriously, guys. Okay, all right. Stop, erase that photo. No way. It's perfect for our web site. What web site? You haven't seen it? Show her. People are posting the most hilarious comments about you. Okay, just take that down. No! Help! - What are you doing?! - What happened? This crazy Teacher smashed my sister's tablet. - I did not. - Yes, she did. The Teacher's going psycho. I-I did not smash it. That is not true. Leave my sister alone! She smashed it. That is a lie! You're a liar. What is going on here? I'm sorry, Sister Margaret. I-I didn't mean to raise my voice. This is exactly the kind of drama I warned you not to bring to this school. Girls, report to my office. And you, Ms. Villanueva Though not a math teacher, Jane unfortunately knew the answer to this problem. _ This just isn't working out. I cannot put off graduation. I have been in school for six years while working, and this is my last requirement. I have to finish now because I have a baby coming, and I would really like Miranda, I'm just gonna say it. You really don't have a lot of compassion. I can't believe this. Okay, Jane, listen up. I took your advice, right? With Melissa? I stayed above the fray. And-and you were right. I mean, it's not the band that I would have chosen, but it's working. What's your point, ma? Now it's your turn to listen to me. Because I know how to take down 16-year-old bitches. Back off he clearly smiled at me. Hey, girls. Want to go for a swim? Yeah, definitely. You hate getting your hair wet. Shut up, I do not. Come on, I'll race you. All right, all right. Tell her you love her already. Oh, he's got to be kidding me. Petra. I can live without air and water. But not the power. Well, what do you want me to do, huh? If we move out of here, we're abandoning the property. And it's all we have left. He's frozen my accounts. Where are you going? I have to use the commode; Lunch isn't sitting well with me. Mother, they've turned off the water, you can't flush. Ugh. Hello. Look, Ivan, I'm working on it. I'm Rafael and I are having some problems. I don't have access to cash Yes. Don't worry, you'll have it by tomorrow night. Did you get some good stuff? Oh, yeah. My mom is right. The secrets of these teenagers' lives are in these phones. Ah, I should have listened to her in high school and stood up to those mean girls. Mmm you know, if I was in high school with you, I would have set them straight. Like I said, you wouldn't have noticed me. Yes, I would have. No, you wouldn't. Okay, you're probably right, I wouldn't. But look at what I would have been missing. Everything okay? Mm-hmm, yeah. Mike wants to talk. Oh. Um How are you, uh, you feeling about everything? I don't know. There's just so much to consider. And there it was again, an opening. Yeah Including the fact that I have feelings for you. What? Look, I know this is a horrible time, but it just in case it In case it means anything or if it changes anything. Uh I don't understand. You said you see me as a sister. We talked about this. I-I know, and I did. But then something changed. I've never felt this type of connection with anyone in my entire life. A-and we're having a baby, you know? Look, Jane, this-this is crazy, I know. But I've never been the type of guy that believes in fate or destiny. What are the chances, huh? I mean, we kissed five years ago, and now we're-we're-we're here. It sounds crazy, but doesn't this just all kind of feel meant to be? I know it's a lot, a-and you need to think, but I just, I had to tell you. And so Rafael left Jane with a terrifying thought. A thought she couldn't even say aloud. _ You came so soon. Must be a good sign. Look, I meant it, Rafael. Half my original ask, and I'll be out of your hair for good. I don't think so. Can we come in? Do you know Olivia? I don't think so, no. We do know each other, Mrs. Solano. Olivia's one of the many women who changes our sheets and cleans our bathrooms. In any case, Olivia saw you leaving my office the day that you claim I hit you. And she's ready and willing to testify that you left without a scratch. You know what the penalty is for making a false assault claim, Petra? Hmm? You could go to prison. I don't remember seeing you there. Apparently. Then again, you didn't even recognize me just now. I guess it's her word against yours. Drop the charges, get out of my suite now. I have to pack. Oh. And don't forget your boyfriend. Hi there. Hey, Jane. Your web site's really taking off. I know. It-it actually inspired me. Yeah, I decided to make a web site of my own. About you two. And I've got plenty of material. Ooh. Unflattering selfies, pre-nose-job shots. And what seem to appear as some personal pictures meant for, I don't know, boyfriends? How'd you get those? Doesn't matter. You're gonna take down that web site. Then you're gonna go to Sister Margaret Frances and tell her what happened yesterday and get me my job back now. Stop crying. But mom's gonna kill us. Look, you should have thought about that before. Easy for you to say. You have these amazing parents. Our mom is horrible. And we don't know where our dad is. - Stop crying. - I'm sorry, I can't. It was one of those moments. Stop it, Vic. When you see someone differently. We weren't telling the truth. We smashed our own tablet and started yelling. Ms. Villanueva didn't do anything. Excuse me? But, like you said teachers must be role models. And the Church teaches forgiveness. And I forgive them. And I ask that you forgive me, as well, for all the drama because I know, I just know I can be a real asset here. I think she can, too. You're not off the hook, girls. We understand. We're sorry. Well, there's nothing we can do about the past, so let's just move forward. Report back to work Monday. And so Jane the virgin left with her job intact and her heart full of forgiveness. _ _ _ I didn't think you'd let her stay. But I'm glad you did. She really seems like a good girl. She does, doesn't she? Also there's this. Hundreds of comments. They want to meet her. This might help bring people to the Church. Why the Marina? Because this is now ours for the evening. I know it's not a yacht. It's just a patrol boat, so we may have to pick up a couple, uh - Drunk boaters along the way - Michael, - Michael - I tried to make it snow, but those machines are ridiculously expensive. You shouldn't have done this. I had to. Because when you You think about me now, you're just thinking about what happened, all the mistakes I've made And you need to stop thinking about that. You need to remember the important stuff. I know you, Jane. You believe in ""meant to be."" We just have to find our way back. Please, Jane, forgive me. I do. I forgive you. But I-I I can't be with you. I can't go back. I'm sorry, Michael. I don't under Uh, I don't - Something's changed. - Nothing's changed. I just, I can't explain it, - but something it-it is - Jane, Jane, Jane. Jane. This this This doesn't make sense. I mean, what What, is it Because I lied? Of course, it wasn't just that. There was also _ But Jane would never say that aloud. Ever. I'm so sorry, Michael. I'm sorry. Jane! How lucky. I was waiting for you. I hoped I'd see you drive up in your car. Right. Um I actually took the bus. - I'm sorry, I can't keep the car. - Why? Because it's completely inappropriate. And giving the twins cars was completely inappropriate. But you said they were jealous of yours. Yeah, that's the point. Nobody should have a car. They're just big, meaningless gestures, and we talked about how you weren't going to be doing any big, meaningless gestures. A car isn't meaningless to me, Jane. I know this is very, very hard to believe, but up until five years ago, I was barely getting by. I could only afford to buy myself a car when I was 35. And then I met you, and, well You have your life set. You're a grown-up. Engaged, working, getting your degree Pregnant. I missed all the big things, so I wanted to do something, as a father, so I thought A car. You have so much going on. That way, you won't have to spend time waiting for the bus. So A little misguided, yes, but it wasn't meaningless. Well, I can actually use a car now that I don't have Michael driving me around. Oh, no, what happened? It turns out you didn't miss all the big things. Hi, mom. What's up? Uh, Xiomara, we must have gotten our signals crossed. _ - What? - I thought you weren't comfortable with the girls. You liar. You set me up. Jane, sometimes, you know, things happen, and afterwards we see people differently. Yes, exactly. Rogelio? You ex-wife told the band not to come. It was a miscommunication. A miscommunication? Are you serious? - I'm gonna let you handle this one. - Uh Break a leg, mom. Well? You two just ruined a beautiful moment between me and my daughter, so what's this about? It was a simple misunderstanding that Xiomara's blown completely And Xiomara had come between them. It was one of those moments when you see everything differently. How will we live in this tiny room? I don't have any cash, mother. We're very lucky Rafael let us stay the night. Our toilet paper. Ivan - You are switching rooms? - No. - What, you thought I would not find you? - No, no, no, no. Please, keep your voice down. I-I like I told you, I'm having some trouble with my husband. I just need a little bit more time. You have no more time! - Okay. - My daughter is not getting shot tonight. I saw it in the cards. Oh! Now what? Bravo! Thank you all for coming tonight. We've had a glitch, unfortunately, no band. But hey, I haven't performed with a band before tonight So here goes. You got this! Nadine. It's me. Eli isn't a person, it's a shipping company. Sin Rostro must be expecting a big shipment of drugs. That number that you found is not a phone number; it is the answer key. The slip, the crate, the dock number We're we're gonna get him, Nadine. Bravo! You were incredible. - Thanks. - Oh It was kind of surreal. I was so nervous. Well, you didn't look it. You belonged up there. Thank you, baby. So we didn't even get to talk. The twins really confessed? Yeah, they did. Probably should have taken your advice back in high school, when I was dealing with Stephanie Kovakovich. Or Maybe I shouldn't have dated her father to begin with. Well, yeah, yeah, that's for sure. Eh. I'll leave you two alone. Congrats, mom. Thank you. You were perfection. And I must apologize for Melissa. Xiomara, I owe her a lot and I tend to look the other way when she's possessive. But I won't do that. Not with you. You're too important to me. In a short time, you have become too important. We can't. You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way. No. No, you won't. I already did, when I interrupted you two earlier, right? Look, historically, my romances haven't always gone well, and that's affected Jane. If we don't work, there could be tension, it could be awkward, and that could end up complicating her relationship with you. I just can't risk that. Yeah, well That makes sense. But I wish it didn't. Yeah, I know. Me, too. Hey. Hey. I saw you come out here. You looked kind of upset. Yeah. Didn't want to ruin my mom's night, so What happened? And that's when Jane looked at Rafael and said the words she knew would change everything. Forever. I broke up with Michael. Jane knew in her heart that this was absolutely the last thing she should be doing. The absolute last thing."
"Okay, here's where we left off. - Jane got accidentally inseminated. - But I've never had sex! And this created a lot of problems for a lot of people. First, there's Rafael, the father of the baby. He recently found out his wife was cheating on him. - We're done, Petra. - What? But Petra had bigger problems. See, she was being blackmailed by a man named Ivan. And now she couldn't pay him. Yup, pretty dramatic. Also dramatic Jane recently reunited with her father. I'm not walking away from you, Jane Gloriana Villanueva. And her mother having grown closer to him, as well, until You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way. But Jane didn't know that. See, she was busy with her new job student teaching. Girls, please welcome your new teacher, Miss Villanueva. - Erase that photo. - No way. It's perfect for our web site. Have you seen this web site? Although teaching was going to get complicated, as well. This might might help bring people to the Church. And speaking of complicated, Jane just found out her fiancÃ© had been lying to her - for a very long time. - All this time, you knew, and you didn't tell me. And so, she ended it with him, but still, she never expected this to happen. And now, we'll continue. _ When Jane Villanueva was nearly 19, she kissed Rafael Solano for the very first time. It was magical, it was perfect. - He's amazing. - Shut up. The guy you've been after all summer? I thought he didn't know my name, and he did. Oh, my God, and I swear, the kiss wasn't even the best part. We had a talk. It was like one of those talks that lasts forever, and then he looked into my eyes Unfortunately, as Jane described their magical talk, Xo had the distinct impression that He sounds like a playboy, hon. I know. I know. He seemed like he would be, but he wasn't. He seemed so sincere. That's what makes a good playboy. You never feel like you're getting played. It's a good lesson. From now on, stay away from guys like that. And for four years, nine months and 23 days, Jane did stay away from guys like that. _ Sorry to interrupt. - We-we were just we-we had the - I was just looking for you because Abuela's waiting in the car. Okay, sure. Coming. Okay, I should go home. In truth, Jane's head was spinning. What just happened? She broke up with Michael hours ago. Jane! And yet, she had this feeling with Rafael. What kind of feeling? Like I'm meant to be with him or something, which I know sounds ridiculous. Yeah, it does. I'm sorry. I have to say it. If it were me, you would say it. You just broke up with Michael who you were with for two years. - Yeah, I know. - It's crazy to jump into something so fast. And Rafael isn't exactly a no-strings-attached rebound guy. And you're having a baby together. What if something goes wrong? It could get ugly. Not to mention the fact that we know he used to be a playboy. And you're from different worlds. He's still married. And his soon-to-be ex-wife seems crazy. Yeah, that's true. That is all true. Don't go there, Jane. You're too smart for that. - Mm. - And yet You're totally staring at your phone, waiting for it to ring. - No, I'm not. - She totally was. _ _ _ Now, how can I afford studio space? What do I look like, Paulina Rubio? OMG! It's him, it's him! Hello? Oh, hi. Hey. How are you? What? Hey. Hey. Hi. What are you doing here? I just really wanted to see you again. Jane, our kiss last night Well, it just kind of happened. Um, before things go further, I just I wanted to do things the right way and take you on a date. I also really want to kiss you again. I can't. Uh, what's wrong? Come on. I just ended things with Michael last night, and my head is spinning, and however I feel about you How do you feel about me? Just Give me some time, okay? I have a lot on my plate. No problem. I get it. Just, um, I don't know. Let me know when I can kiss you again. I'll see you later. Looking forward to it. Your phone was buzzing. _ _ Uh, I have to get ready for school, but I will see you at the hotel for dinner with Rogelio. Actually, I'm gonna skip it. Why don't you go, just the two of you? What happened? You're suddenly not into Rogelio? Here's the truth. Xo didn't want to complicate Jane's relationship with her father. Ugh, he's too dramatic. Petra, what are you doing? Petra, you'll recall, had two big problems. Ivan, I'm going to shoot you. _ _ I'm going to take off your pillowcase now, okay? So just stay calm. Okay. No, no, shh. Ivan, Ivan, keep your voice down. Get him back in the closet, Petra. Turn the television on. He's too loud! Shh. Shh. Stop it! Stop! Here's a bit of movie trivia for you. Did you know that Tom Selleck What is your plan, Petra? I don't know, mother. I've never held someone hostage before! We can't let him go. He'll tell Milos where we are. _ Well, we can't just leave him in there. - He just wants money, okay? - Uh-huh. $250,000 that's what this is about. You know, I think his price might just have gone up. Jane? These are the Flanagans. Hi. May I just give you a hug? A hug? Oh. You must be a parent of one of my students. No. We don't actually have kids yet. But we really, really want to. That's great. Really? You think so? Mm-hmm. That's-that's incredible. We're just so happy to hear that. Okay. Thank you, Jane. You're welcome. So I should go. Of course. God bless you! You, too. Thank you so much. Let's just hope her fertility rubs off on you. Oh, stop. A hug never hurt anyone. I just think it's wrong. Nonsense. I prayed long and hard about this, and I know God brought Jane to us for a purpose. To bring more people to our church. Here. Pass out more coins. It was just so weird, the way they were staring at me. Then they asked for a hug. Maybe they know you're my daughter. My fans do crazy things. You know, that could actually be it. You guys doing okay? - We're great. - I asked for my salad to be slightly dressed. This is just dressed. My potatoes are cold, there's a smudge on my knife, and - Oh. - He is fine. He's absolutely fine. So, Jane, how is your mother? She's fine. Oh, wonderful. I'm fine, too. Make sure she knows that. What happened to you two? Why? Did she say something? Just that it was complicated and you were being dramatic. She said that I was dramatic?! That's right! You're looking good! All right! Great job, girls. Good job. You were awesome! We'll see you next week. Now, get out! Miss Xo? My daughter really wanted to introduce us. Apparently, we both like pistachio ice cream and the color orange, so we're perfect for each other. Oh, so that's why Eva was asking. I'll give you two some privacy. So, here's the deal. My daughter really wants me to ask you out. I don't know how she knows this, but apparently you just ended things with someone? And one, two, three. One I'm sorry, guys. I just ended things with someone. Oh. So, what do you say? Want to get some pistachio ice cream? I'll wear orange. Sounds tempting. But I'm not looking to date right now. Gotcha. Well, for the record, I wasn't planning on doing this. But then I saw you, and I figured it was worth a try. Good-bye. Hey. Your watch. Thank you. And I was wondering if you hadn't seen my computer case. It was in the living room Jane, stop. Come on, Jane, I can't I can't do this. Do what? This. Returning each other's stuff. Like, what is happening here? Look, I lied. I know that. I-I didn't want the baby, and I panicked, and I am so sorry. But this is not the end for us, Jane. You don't go from marrying someone one day to breaking up it doesn't happen. I don't know what to say, Michael. Something's changed. I, uh - I'm sorry. - Is this about Rafael? No. Okay. I'm sorry. I just I just had to ask. I have to go to work. It was awful and awkward. Oh, that's terrible. Want to know what will help get your mind off of it? My birthday. Congratulations! You waited a whole ten seconds to work in your birthday. And it came up perfectly naturally. What's going on? Well, you know how we were supposed - to go to the opening of that club. - Mm-hmm. Well, I thought we were on the list, but it turns out we can't get on the list because the guy who was going to get us - on the list - She wants you to ask Rafael if he can get us back on the list. He's an investor in the club. Oh. _ And he's your baby daddy, so he kind of has to say yes, right? Yeah, I'll ask him next time I see him. Great. He's right over there. Have you had enough time? Ready to go on a date? No. I came to ask a favor, actually, which is totally unrelated to our current situation. And what is our current situation? Back to the favor. So, there's a club that you're apparently an investor in. - Viento. - Yes, exactly. And it's my friend's birthday. I was dispatched to ask if you could put a group of us on a list. I'd be happy to. Great. She'll be thrilled. But just so you know, I'm gonna be there, so - Huh? - Yeah, it's opening night, I have to make an appearance, so we'll be there, together. Not a problem. But just so you understand, it's not a date. Agreed. Definitely not a date. - No, seriously, it's not a date. - I know, it's not a date. No. You're smiling when you say that. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. Say it again, no teeth. It's not a date. So, you want to get frozen yogurt - and watch love actually tonight? - I can't. I have plans. It's Frankie's birthday, and we're going - to this club. - What club? - I think Viento. - Really? I've read about that place. How'd you get in? Rafael's an investor, actually, so Ah. So he'll be there. Yes, but we're not going together. - Yeah, but he will be there. - Enough, mom. Next stop, Biscayne Boulevard. _ Rogelio was asking about you. Way to change the subject. So what'd he say? Well, he said that you were the one that was actually being melodramatic. Me?! What you are about to witness is two creatures who are inherently dramatic attempt to behave like they are - not dramatic. - Hey. Oh. Hi there. - How have you been? - Great, actually. - Me, too. Really great. - Happier than ever. Life is beautiful. I'm having fun. - I'm having so much fun. - In fact, - I have a date tonight. - Me, too. You also have a date tonight? - Yeah, that's right. - So, I tell you I have a date, and suddenly you have a date, too? No, not suddenly. I already had a date. You just suddenly know about it. Well, great. Wonderful. If we both have dates, we should do it together, you know? Double date for two people who both have dates. I can't wait! - Great. - Great. And now you are witnessing two creatures who both need to find dates. Look, I'm I'm here because I'm desperate, Lachlan. I-I've never been desperate before. What do you want? Money. $350,000. I'll pay it all back as soon as I get my divorce I'll get more than enough out of the prenup. Look, I know you have no reason to trust me or help me after what I did, leaving you for Rafael and making you look to trust bad in that meeting. You're right. I have no reason to trust you or help you. Now what? I don't know. We can't keep him here forever. We might have to consider What? I know people from the old country. They could take care of him for us. Mother, that's crazy! It is realistic. Now, here are your options: You kill him or let him go, and risk Milos finding you and then you'll wish you were dead. Your choice. What are these? They're not from me. I just came by to drop off your computer case. They came while I was here. You're not the person I thought you were. _ - Hi. - We have to talk. Michael saw the flowers you sent, and he was so hurt it was awful. Jane, that wasn't my intention. I know. But that's why I'm saying it's too soon. - What, because of Michael? - Yes, because of Michael. We were engaged. I was I was about to marry him. I'm sorry. But, Jane, he's kind of been a jerk to me. And you don't think that's justified? I mean, whatever jealousy he was feeling, clearly he was right in feeling it, because there's something here. That's exactly my point, was that there's something here. Don't you understand there are other people's feelings involved? We can't just do whatever we want. Just stop all of this. Okay. Jane. I'm Nora. This is my husband Ben. We are just so excited to meet you. Can I just get one hug? I'll be quick. I swear. Uh oh. Oh! Do you by any chance know my father? Of course. Ah. Everyone knows him. Thank you again. My wife took the coin home, and we so want a baby, so we thought it's worth a try. Sorry, what coin are you talking about exactly? You're selling coins with my face on it? No, not selling distributing. This is crazy! This is hope,  Miss Villanueva. This is already bringing more people to the Church. Why didn't you tell me about this? Well, many people like you, and like St. Theresa, are humble about publicizing their gifts. I am not a saint. Yes. We made that clear in the web site. You are, however, a pregnant virgin. Medical mistake or not, it is a miracle. I mean, think of the moments that had to happen to lead you up to your pregnancy. And think of the hope that you are giving others who believe in your extraordinary fertility. I'm sorry. I'm just not comfortable with this. Anything? My contact in Ecuador confirmed that Sin Rostro's shipping container is coming in two days. _ Okay. Okay, this is big. We intercept a huge drug shipment, we're heroes. What is up with you? This case is your baby; You should be celebrating. I'll celebrate when we intercept the drugs and catch Sin Rostro. Hi. We're on the list. Jane Villanueva, party of four. We're gonna have so much fun. I promise. - You doing okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. She was not fine. Follow me, please. Shh. Saint Jane the Virgin was in no mood to be in a nightclub tonight. And she was certainly in no mood to see Rafael. Ooh, I knew your baby daddy was gonna be surrounded by women all night. Look, our drinks are here. - Happy Birthday. - Thank you. At least Rafael was heeding Jane's warning and staying away. I mean, sure, I like the stage, but the thing about television is that you get to touch so many lives, all at once. That's so true. Plus, plays are so boring. That is also true. Welcome to the worst double date in the world. So what do you do for work, Marco? Though we can't all be international superstars, we all must make a living, right? I'm kind of in-between jobs. Oh, so you're unemployed. Currently, yeah. Hmm. I played professional soccer for a few years. Just retired. You were a professional soccer player? In Europe for seven years and the last five here in the States with the New York Red Bulls. Wait, you're Marco Esquivel? - Yeah. - You're really awesome. Oh, I was all right. Now I feel stupid for not knowing. No, I'm sorry. I-I usually never lead with it, because people tend to treat me differently. Uh, I agree completely. I wish people would treat me - like a normal person. - And here is the bottle we special ordered for you, Mr. De La Vega. Please, take it away. I'll be happy to drink normal people wine. So, why-why did you stop? Too old? My daughter, actually. I was just traveling too much. I can't miss all these important moments, you know? You know, my daughter can't stop talking about how much she loves your class. Come here, you. Well, I'm not supposed to have favorites, but Between you and me, she's my favorite. Mine, too. Meanwhile, it should be known that Frankie was having the most fun she'd had since Well, her last birthday. You know what's not fun? Being the sober pregnant girl in a noisy nightclub. Hey, you guys want to go grab some food? - No. You, Jane, dance. - No, no, no, no. - Jane, let me explain. - Oh, no. You don't have to explain anything. - She's an old friend. That was weird. It meant nothing. - No, no, no. It's fine. We're gonna go dance anyway, so I'll see you later. - Jane - Take care! Come on, guys, let's go dance. On the bright side, Xiomara's night was going much better than expected. So, I had a lot of fun tonight. Yeah. Me, too. All that remained was the romantic kiss good night. And so, with nothing in their way I apologize, but my beautiful date is going dancing, whereas I must work tomorrow. Great. Thanks for the announcement. Yes. Oh, and I might need a ride home because I had too much normal people's wine. It's okay. I have to wake up early with my daughter anyway. Good night. Let's go. You have to eat something or you'll die. I'm going to take off your gag, but one kick Good. Don't let him have that fork. I'm not stupid, mother. Is that peanut sauce? I don't know. I just ordered chicken from room service. I have peanut allergy. Oh, my mother, go! Get your medicine pen! My mother's allergic to shellfish. Mother, now! We should let him die. What? He dies, our problem is over. Can't breathe. Oh, my God. Mother, where is it?! Now! What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Thank you. Uh, wait. I was just trying to get some water. - That's vodka. - Ah, thank you. Here you go. Thanks. Jane, come on, this is ridiculous. - You want to be with me. - Stop. I-I can't do that to Michael. We were together for two years. You broke up for a reason. Look, he doesn't have to know. And I get that you don't want to hurt his feelings, but if that's all it is, then-then we can be discreet. That's not all it is. Then what? We're having a baby. What-what if something goes wrong? - It can get more complicated. - It's true. It can. But we won't let that happen because we'll put the baby first. And if we work Can you imagine anything better for a baby than its parents actually together? You're still married. - I filed for divorce. - But Petra's crazy. She filed assault charges against you. What if she does something else? Jane, she just wants money. You say the word, I settle. We're from different worlds. This isn't my world, Jane. Maybe it used to be, but it's not anymore. Look, I just want to be with you. I want to get to know you; I want to get ready for our baby. And I get the timing isn't perfect, but that's just the way it is. But the baby's not waiting. Let's take advantage of this time now, before there are three of us. Jane, I want to get to know you. I'm going outside. No one has to know we're leaving together. Just meet me. Jane knew that to go with Rafael would be to undo everything she's said, every signal she's given, every single thing her mother had warned her about. But there was a baby coming. _ They didn't have all the time in the world. And so, for the first time in her life, Jane threw caution to the wind. Wait, popcorn and fruit strips? Don't judge me. I have cravings. Ooh, and cookies. What's your flavor? Anything with chocolate. Good man. All right, anything else you want? Mm-hmm. Mmm. What happened to being discreet? We're the only people in the popcorn and fruit strips aisle right now. Mmm. I'm sorry I got too drunk. It's okay. Did I do anything I'm gonna be embarrassed about tomorrow? I don't think you're gonna remember anything tomorrow. In that case I'm going to tell you why I got so drunk. I was very, very jealous of Marco the soccer player. Luckily, Xiomara knew he would remember none of this tomorrow. Meanwhile, Jane and Rafael would remember every moment of this night. _ - Ducks? - Yes. You're scared of ducks? I am. Look, I was nine years old. Uh-huh. - And there was an incident. - Mm-hmm. I ran out of bread, and then they all attacked me. Look okay, you One duck might be cute, but six or seven ducks is terrifying. Your turn strangest fear now. Because there in the moonlight, they were having one of those talks. You know, the kind that goes on forever. Why'd your mom leave? I don't know, to be honest. - I was four. - Mm. And I woke up the morning after my birthday, and she was gone. My God. What did your dad tell you? He said she was gone, she was selfish, and that we had to move on. Least favorite food. Now. Caviar. I can't stand it. You're ridiculous that you just said caviar right now. But I was being honest. Okay, most surprising thing about you. Now. Oh, oh, uh I can rap. Like presents? No, like my mom was really into ""8 Mile"" for a hot minute. Turns out, I have a knack. - Do it. - No. Then I don't believe you.  You asked me to rap so I'll ask for the map   To your heart, let's take it slow just to start  Oh, too deep. Too deep! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - You asked me to rap! - You have to keep going. - Your fault! Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! No! That's all you get. Is there anything you can't do? My turn. My question. Okay. You know, I was thinking the name Gini was cute. Yeah, if you want her to be a stripper. What? You hate the name Gini, too? Totally hate it. Fine. Let's move on to boys' names. No, no need. We are having a girl. My family only has girls. My grandmother, she had six sisters. All of them had daughters. True story. Wow. It was, in short, the most romantic night ever. _ _ _ _ _ Thank you. I appreciate. Sure. That was smart. Seeing his bracelet. You've earned his trust. Ah, yes, the classic ""poison your hostage and then save him to earn he trusts"" technique. Works every time. I hope the rest of your plan works as smoothly. Wake up. Wake up. Ah, the leopard! What? What is it? Jane's missing! - What? - She didn't come home last night! Her bed hasn't been slept in. I've called Frankie, Lina, Luca. She's young, Xiomara. No, no, you don't understand. Jane always comes home or calls. Hi, Frankie? Um, it's Xo. I-I'm sorry to call you again, but have you heard anything? Okay. Thanks. What about Michael? M-maybe she's with him. B-but I shouldn't call him. You know what, I'm just gonna call him. I-I've called everyone else. Okay. I'm gonna tweet my 6.3 million followers with the hashtag ""please find Jane."" _ Uh, Michael? Xo? Is everything all right? Um, is Jane there, by any chance? Um, no, why? Um, I'm sorry, I just I'm a little worried. She-she didn't come home last night, and Oh. You know Jane, she doesn't do this. Um, yeah, you should you should, uh, - you should check with Rafael. - What? Yeah. I think they were planning on meeting up. I'm sorry. Yeah. So, anyway, um, I got to go. Take care, Xo. Do not worry, Xiomara. My fans are on the hunt for Jane. Oh! Oh, oh! Wake up, wake up! I'm gonna be late! I got to get to work! Ay! Oh, oh. Mom, I know. I'm so sorry. I Yes, I fell asleep. But, yeah, I'm fine and I'm at school and I will call you later. Bye. Miss Villanueva? Sister Margaret. Good morning. How are you? What are you thinking, coming to school dressed like this? I overslept. And I was late, but I have a sweater inside and We do have a strict code of conduct, and this behavior cannot be tolerated. And as for your future here, I'm just not comfortable with teachers who arrive on campus like this. Would it make you more comfortable if I gave out a few hugs? That would certainly help. How did you get in here? My husband owns the hotel. What do you want? To help you take down Rafael. I have information that will ruin him. What's in it for you? Money. $350,000. Now, see last time, you set me up. So why should I trust you? Because I'm naked. Record us. You can expose it and humiliate me any time you want. Ruin my life with one click of a button. I'll never be able to show my face in Miami society again. I'm interested. Was he ever. You must be Rafael Solano, are you not? I am. Who are you? I am Jane's father. Oh, uh Oh, uh, it's nice to meet you, Sir. I wish I could say the same. Jane's mother was worried all night. Oh, I am so sorry. We-we just kind of No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I know your game. I used to be just like you. Ridiculously good-looking, with charisma, with swagger, notching girls onto my belt. No, that's-that's not what's happening I have had sex with a lot of women. Way more than you, I'm sure! I am sure that that's true. Mm-hmm. But Jane is different. Jane is special. Remember that. Or face the consequences. Uh uh, got it. Jane? I think I just met your father. I want you to know how much this means to me. Thank you. My pleasure. Of course, I don't have access to the money yet, but I'm not a Solano. So, what? You lied to me? Think of it as a deferred payment plan. Once I take control of the hotel, you'll get your money. So what's this information that's gonna ruin Rafael? What the hell were you thinking, yelling at Rafael? What were you thinking? You didn't call. I was out. My phone died, I lost track of time. Exactly. Which is not like you. See, Rafael is already a bad influence on you. You're being ridiculous. No, I'm not. You just don't want to hear it. Because you're wrong, mom, all right? He's totally different; He's a great guy. I just don't have a good feeling. Well, you're not exactly the greatest judge of men. Hey. And you're not me, Jane. You make smart choices, sensible choices. Exactly. Because I was always scared of repeating your mistakes. And, mom, I'm just realizing, because of that, I've been afraid to take risks. Real risks. You've been smart. I've been safe. And I'm gonna be a mom. And moms put their kids first. You know that better than anyone. So this is my last chance I get to follow my heart. Do what I want. And, yeah, maybe the timing isn't perfect, but I want to be with Rafael. He's a good guy. I hope you're right. I am. You can't protect her from everything, Xiomara. You did a fantastic job raising a daughter who was gifted with extraordinary DNA. At some point, you have to trust that you and I prepared her well. Must be my driver. Hi. I just came by to drop off my daughter's fee. Six more classes. It's not due for a week. Well, I know. I-I just didn't want to forget. I also wanted to ask you something. Rogelio. Good to see you. Jane needed to talk to him, so Gotcha. Please? Please, can you leave? Oh! Sorry, I thought you were asking my permission to speak. I'm very sorry. I'm just gonna go, okay? Good day, Marco. Good day. Okay, I've given it a lot of thought, and I don't want to tell the captain about the drug shipment until after we make the bust. If we tell him, he's gonna call in the DEA, they'll take all the credit. And if we don't, w-we violate, like, a hundred regulations. Oh, come on. Since when are you a boy scout? Forget it, Nadine. It's not happening! What is it, Michael? What is going on with you? You can't shut your mouth for more than five seconds! I bet you'd like to try. You don't want to take that bet. What are you gonna do, huh? Meanwhile, the wind was in the trees, the air was balmy. It had all the makings of another romantic night. _ _ We've got to talk. Dad, not right now. You're fired. What? Why? Hey. Where are you? I'm on my way to the airport. I have to go to Mexico City. _"
"Glad you're back. Here we go. As you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. I accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago. Oh, and the doctor? She was Rafael's sister. And Rafael underwrote her medical malpractice insurance. No one would insure Luisa with her history of addiction. But Jane didn't know that, and Rafael wasn't about to tell her. And from there, things got complicated. See, Jane was with Michael, but now she's not. - And Rafael was with Petra. - We're done, Petra. And despite Jane's reservations What's better for a baby than its parents actually together? Jane and Rafael were falling for each other. Unfortunately, Jane's mother, Xo, did not approve. - Rafael is already a bad influence on you. - He's a good guy. For the record, Xiomara's love life was complicated as well. See, she was falling for Jane's father, telenovela star Rogelio De La Vega. But she broke it off. You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way. And she was currently distracting herself - with a new man. - Good to see you. And speaking of complicated, Dr. Luisa had been hooking up with her stepmother, Rose. That is, until she fell off the wagon and disappeared. I don't know where you are. Oh, and Michael was currently on the hunt for the notorious drug dealer known as Sin Rostro. And honestly, there are a gazillion other things going on. But we should just get started, right? As a young girl, Jane Gloriana Villanueva loved to hear stories. Okay, so tell me what happened. From the very beginning. Well, first the producer said he loved my voice. Then he said I had great energy up there. _ Oh, sorry, ma. I didn't mean to wake you. _ _ Oh, shoot. I thought I paid this. _ Mom, it's a parking ticket. I'll pay the fine. _ _ So what is it about? _ I like long stories. _ _ _ _ _ So what does that have to do with mom's parking ticket? _ _ How can I be patient? I haven't seen you in two weeks. I know, I know. I-I miss you, too. I'm hurrying. Do you know what? I'm gonna stop right here. _ I should really set the stage. Fill in some gaps. Ah, yes. This is where we left off. Rafael, you'll remember, was about to meet Jane, when We've got to talk. Dad, not right now. - You're fired. - What? Why? And here's what you didn't see. I'm sorry. I felt obligated to tell your father. You're jeopardizing the hotel. What the hell are you talking about? The fact that you put up your shares of the hotel for Luisa's medical malpractice insurance. I did that, dad, but come on. You're the one who always says family comes first, right? The problem is, Luisa needs to answer to this lawsuit in two weeks. If she doesn't, this waitress Jane. Right. Jane. Jane could get a default judgment and then lay claim to your 20% of the Marbella. And that led to this. Hey. Where are you? I'm on my way to the airport. I have to go to Mexico City. What? Why? It has to do with your lawsuit and my sister. But, Jane, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. Oh. Uh church and state, we separate everything. Don't tell me why you're going to Mexico City as someone who's suing your sister. Tell me as Someone who cares about you and wants to know why the hell you're going to Mexico City. If Luisa doesn't come back in two weeks, then you get a default judgment against her. I should pause to point out that Jane had no idea that Rafael's hotel was on the line. And he wasn't about to tell her. We have a Hacienda in Mexico City. I've been tracking her credit cards. Just to make sure she's alive. I really hope you find her. And that brings us _ I'm sorry you didn't find her. It was like chasing a ghost. A drunk ghost. San Miguel, Mexico City, Tulum She probably figures her insurance will take care of my lawsuit. So how was teaching? Oh, you know uneventful. A lot of grading papers. There was one other thing. She also spent a great deal of time hugging churchgoers who thought she could grant miracles because she was a pregnant virgin. But Jane wasn't about to tell him that. I just want to see you. I've really missed you. I'm here. Hi. Hi. What? You're showing. Yeah, I am, a little, right? Are you still feeling good? Yeah. Yeah. So This is my place. Yeah, I've been here, actually. With Petra. Ah, yes. Petra. I'm not gonna lie. The last two weeks have been tough for Petra. You can't keep ordering room service. When I settle my divorce, I'm going to have to pay it off. Oh, Petra, stop. We are cooped up in this tiny room. Yeah. Oh, stop. You're no better. Having a hostage was turning into a major headache. Who needs lobster every night? Hello? Rafael's back. Here we go. No more leaving, okay? Okay. I missed you so much, Jane. Should we move to the bedroom? Ah. Now it's time for Jane to tell him she's a virgin. I should probably go home. I have court tomorrow, so Oh. Uh okay. Um well, can I take you to dinner? To celebrate your victory? Winning a default judgment against your sister? Church and state. Maybe afterwards, you could even Sleep over. Okay, tell him right now. _ _ And speaking of sleeping over, remember Marco, Xo's soccer-playing hottie? The past few weeks had been pretty good for them. Less good, however, for Rogelio. Oh. Rogelio. Again. Ugh, it's so annoying. He's trying to get close to Jane, so I should probably head in. Oh. But first, Eva would like you to come over - _ - for an official family dinner. Like with place mats and everything. Sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, hello, Xiomara. Finished with your date so soon? What are you even doing here again? I was actually helping Jane prepare for court. I have played many lawyers, so I was giving her lots of tips. Ah. Got it. Avoiding Rogelio and his legal tips? Yeah, something about Putting hand sanitizer under my eyes, so that I can cry. Oh So how was the big reunion with Rafael? It was good. Uh-oh. - What happened? - We Had a moment in his penthouse where I could have told him that I'm not having sex, but I didn't. Makes sense. I don't know how a guy like that responds. - Seriously? - What? ""A guy like that""? I'm sorry. I-I just don't really see you two together. I mean, you're so different. You just are. Great. Thanks for the talk. I feel so much better now. Jane, I'm just being honest, just like you're honest with me when you don't like someone. Rafael's not ""someone."" I'm having his baby. You're right. I heard you were back. I live here. The question is, why are you still here? Well, I don't really have any money, do I? Till we settle our divorce, anyway. Of course, for the right price, I would move on now. Were you always a monster? Or did you become one along the way? Should we Review our courtship? I was engaged to a man I loved. Who loved me. You were passed over for a promotion and so, to get back at Lachlan, you set your sights on me. So tell me, Rafael, who's the monster? But you see, I had the advantage, because I always knew you were an entitled playboy with a tendency to self-sabotage. And Jane will find out soon enough. Don't you dare mention Jane. How chivalrous. Let's be real. You two won't last. She's a good girl. And well We've already established what you are. _ Mom, hurry up! We can't be late to court! Are you not coming, Abuela? _ Okay, okay, I'm ready. One more button, ma. Got it. Okay, so, what's the procedure? The lawyer said it should be easy. Since Luisa's not here, we'll request a default judgment. A default judgment is ridiculous, your honor. With all due respect, a week is all we're asking. _ Another week? Your honor, no. _ That's another week into my client's unwanted pregnancy. This event has derailed her life. And Dr. Alver is exhibiting that same recklessness now by not answering this claim. Actually, no, I'm here. Hi! I am so sorry that I'm late. Dr. Alver, I presume? You're probably wondering where Luisa has been. Until a week ago, Luisa was drinking tequila, kissing strange women, and dancing naked. I was lost, but, your honor, I stand before you here today, ready to accept any punishment that you deem necessary. This isn't a sentencing. You just have to answer the petition. Oh. Well, then I answer it. I'm here. Your honor, I do need to consult with my client. Absolutely not. This is ridiculous. She's here to answer the petition. There's no default judgment. Dr. Alver, this is your last chance. Don't worry, your honor. I'm back. Where the hell were you? I chased you all over Mexico. Yes, I know. I was in Peru on an yahuasca retreat. What the hell is a yahuasca? _ Is that the psychedelic drink that makes you constantly vomit? Exactly, but But it's like you're vomiting out everything that's wrong with your life. It's, it's really difficult to describe, but I had a shaman, and I was guided through this journey, and in my journey, I saw everything so clearly. Full disclosure, I tried it. Did nothing for me. What's clear is that you are an addict. Yes. Exactly. But why? Why? What was I trying to escape? And then it dawned on me. Money is the root of all my problems. Well, money and the fact that she inseminated the wrong woman with Rafael's sperm. We're gonna talk about this later. I'm glad you're home. Thanks, daddy. We should talk. I would really like that. I should stop here, catch you up on Jane and Michael. Yep, it's been that awkward. - You okay? - Don't even have time to think about her. We're hours away from the biggest moment of our career. You sure the shipment's coming in today? You confident in your contact at the coast guard? Yeah. Michael I get that seeing Jane around every day is hard. Nadine, stop. We agreed we're just having fun, right? And by fun, he means this. Let's just hope the drugs come in and lead us to Sin Rostro. Lemonade? In high school, you only drank lemonade when you were feeling sad. Well, things aren't going very well at the moment. With Marco, please say with Marco. I came by here to see if they needed me to fill any spots in the lounge, but they said they were all full. Once again, I'm back to square one. Don't worry. I believe in you almost as much as I believe in myself. Thanks, Rogelio. Ow! Must be my shoes. Finest Italian leather. I'm worried. Dad, Luisa actually doesn't seem crazy. A psychedelic drink, and she has a spiritual awakening? Idiotic, yes, but not clinically crazy. I agree with Rafael. For what it's worth. In any case, she's back. So I would really like my job back as well. I'll toe the line. Fine. But you'll answer to Lachlan. Okay, got it. Hey, Lachlan. So, I just got an interesting call from your father. Yeah. I answer to you now. Well, to me, - actually. - What the hell are you doing here? Petra has some connections in Miami society. She agreed to help us bounce back from your mishaps. I'm not working for Petra. Oh. Hmm. I thought your father was pretty clear about it. You answer to me, and Well this is what I want. Screw you both. Okay, but why would Lachlan want to hire Petra? 'Cause he wants to get under my skin. - Why? - He was actually engaged to Petra at one point. What? I kind of Stole her from him. Oh. Look, I was a different guy back then. I'm reacting. At least let me react. Your scotch. - Thank you. - And some chips and our spinach-artichoke dip. Oh, we didn't actually order anything. They're from that couple over there. They said it was for Jane the Virgin. Uh-oh. I'm s uh, J Jane the Virgin? Thank you. Jane the Virgin? What does that mean? Well It's, um It's a web site. Do you remember Rogelio's stepdaughters? Yeah. They started it to be making fun of me. Just say it. And the fact that I'm a virgin. Which I am. And now a pregnant virgin. Huh. So, the web site it went viral, and Now, you know, some people believe, because I'm a pregnant virgin, that I can grant miracles. Wait, what? I can't, just to be clear. Uh, wow. - A virgin? - Yeah. Wait, so you and Michael never - No. - Not even after you got engaged? No. Really? No! Not even Rafael? I made a promise to my grandma when I was young that I would wait till marriage. That's what I've done. And that's still your plan? Yes. Definitely. That's that's That's great. Oh, yeah. Excuse me. You need another drink? I'm reacting. I can react, right? Yeah, you're allowed to react. - Another scotch? - Uh, yes, please. It should be noted that Michael did not react like this when she told him she was a virgin. But that's neither here nor there. Check that number. Yeah, that's it. You realize this could be huge for us, right? We follow this shipment, learn where Sin Rostro has been hiding. Huge. Okay, we got to stay focused. - We got to stay focused. - Yeah. - Yeah, you're right. - Here we go. Look, I'm sorry I freaked out, okay? I'm over it. It's fine. Fine? Uh, you just surprised me, that's all. Yeah, I definitely got that. It's just, it's not something that you normally hear. Not no, not that you're not normal. It's fine. I get it. Fine? Yeah, fine. Look, it's been a long day I just think - we should call it a night. - Jane Rafael, I'm tired. Fine. What? Oh! Get down, get down. _ Is that Sin Rostro? No way. Sin Rostro's already in Miami, and we've got intel to back that up. Okay, so maybe it's his new contact, whoever's taking over for Roman Zazo. We got to go. - Hi, babe. - Hey. You'll never guess who called here tonight. Elliot Lantana. He's an actual legitimate record producer. He heard me sing at the club, and he wants to record a demo with me! - That's amazing, ma. - I know, right? Watch out, Paulina Rubio! - Hon? - Hmm? How'd it go with Rafael? Did you tell him you're waiting? Come on. I got your message loud and clear. I'm on board. Did you tell him? - How did he take it? - Well. He took it well. Good. Mm-hmm. I was just so worried. About you. I know. I'm sorry. But how I felt about you that's part of what I was running from. No, I get that. Look, here's the thing. When I was in the sweat lodge, drinking my tea, throwing up, being guided by my shaman, I kept seeing your face. It was a little distorted, but it was you. Luisa. I came here to be truthful and honest. And if I'm being truthful and honest I still want to be with you. I want us to tell everyone what happened and just Run away together. We can't do that. It's over. For real, this time. Ah I had a feeling you might say that. Regardless, we still have to tell my father what happened between us. - What? - My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean about all my lies. Your shaman doesn't understand the situation. - No, he really does. - Luisa, it will destroy my marriage. Or make it stronger. - What are you talking about? - Rose I know this is gonna be hard, but trust me, once you do it, you're gonna feel so much better. Healthier. Don't worry. I'll give you time to To figure out how to break it to him. Tell my father. Or I will. _ Long day? Oh, yeah. Me, too. The longest. Oh, here, have mine. I haven't touched it, I swear. No, that's It's fine, thank you. Come on, I paid 17 bucks for this thing. I swear, this place is such a rip-off. Thank you. Cheers. Oh. What's he doing? Well, considering he's at the front desk getting a key _ - I'm gonna go with checking in. - Thanks, wiseass. Makes sense that he's here; this is the hub of the Sin Rostro operation. Did you get the picture? Yep. Great. I'll get it to my friend at the FBI to run face recognition. - You trust this friend? - Yeah, absolutely. _  This is my life and this is my turn   Chasing the dreams that I long for   I know that love, it will conquer  Stop, stop, stop. Stop, stop. _ _ Here is the problem. While you were singing, I kept wishing I was singing. So I need you to get me out of my head. How do I do that? Dig deeper, Xiomara. Dig deeper. Oh, just one second, one second.  Dig deeper, deeper, deeper.  Sorry, song idea. Get me out of my head. Understand? Okay, let's go from the top again. Jane, can you take some mimosas up to room 467? I don't do room service. Well, you served one of our VIP guests the other day, and apparently he's taken a liking to you. To be clear, that's creepy, uh, and I'm not going into the room. Just deliver the mimosas. Come on in. Uh, where can I put this? Oh my God. Jane. Jane. Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Listen, stop. Let me explain. You don't have to, I get it. I told you I was a virgin, and you had sex with the first girl you could find. That is not true. Okay, so then what happened? I'm not sure. What? I don't remember anything from last night. Yeah, that's not a good explanation. What happened last night? Oh, you know, the usual. Had a couple drinks, came back here. D-did we, uh, did we have sex? Come on, yeah. Of course we did. They're fake, if that's what you're wondering. No, actually wondering what my girlfriend is doing between them. Well, thank you so much. This has been such a thrill. I don't know how I can ever pay you back. You don't need to pay me back. When a friend asks me for a favor, I cannot refuse. What friend? Rogelio. Why else do you think we did not make love in the sound booth? It was embarrassing. Had he even heard me sing? Did he even see my Youtube videos? No, he hadn't. - But I knew once he heard you, he'd be a fan. - Ugh. Oh, come on. A spark. Don't be angry. It was a nice thing I did. Wasn't it? Yeah, it was. So, what's our problem? The fact that she desperately did not want to have feelings for him. Nothing. There's no problem. Hey, aren't you teaching this afternoon? Yeah, I have a few more minutes before I have to leave. Oh, no. What happened? You were right about Rafael, okay? Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry. I didn't want to be right. I don't even know what I was thinking. I mean, we're so different. Trust me, hon, I get it. Especially because it would have been so perfect, if it had worked out. Yeah, it really would have. I need to talk to you. Is everything okay? I don't know. I don't know if I should say something - or not say something. - About what? Your sister. Well, then you should definitely say something. She is having a sort of breakdown. And I hate saying this. But, given her history and her mother Rose, what happened? I went to go see her. To check in. Rafael, it was awful. The things that she was saying to me, all these sexual things. And I didn't know how to respond. I didn't know what to do. It's okay. You did the right thing by coming to me. Ooh, not nice, Rose. All right, you know the reading assignment the taming of the shrew. Enjoy, and I know Who are you? It's really you. Jane the Virgin. All right, that's enough. Keep it moving! We met this morning. Yes, I recall. Right. Look, uh What you think happened, it didn't. Yeah, I was there. Something obviously happened. No, I was paid to drug him and make it seem like we had sex. Oh, is that all? What? I'm an escort. Uh, my manager got me the gig. It was all online, I don't even know who set it up. Oh my God. Look, I only did it because it was easy money. But then your boyfriend told me that you're Jane the Virgin, and I'm a really religious woman. Which I know is hard to believe given, you know, what I do. Anyway, I'm really sorry. Okay. Thank you for telling me that. Yeah. So Can I have a hug? Excuse me? I could really use a miracle. I have a son. And I haven't seen him in a while due to a-a couple of circumstances. I've been in some bad situations, but I really want to see him. And maybe if I hug you I don't want to give you false hope. I am not a religious messiah. What happened to me was a medical mistake. But can I give you a hug anyway? Yeah. I really hope you get to see your son. They don't actually give awards out to shows like this, do they? Well, y-you can't tell anything from just one scene, okay? There's a There's a larger story. Anyway, they do give out awards, and I've actually booked the after-party here. In the hotel. How did you do that? One of the divas recovered from extensive plastic surgery in one of our medical recoveco suites. I promised that secret would never get out. And I thought you took this job just to make Rafael squirm. Well, the better the hotel does, the more money I make in my divorce. It's always about money with you, isn't it? Though setting Rafael up with that escort, that That seems personal. True. I also despise him. And leaving you for him was the biggest mistake of my life. Is that what you want to hear? Well, it's true. I should get back to my mother. It had to have been Petra. She's the only person crazy enough to set me up. - So crazy. - You know, I'm just gonna expedite her settlement. I don't want to deal with it anymore. I want it to end and I don't want it to get in the way of us. What ""us""? Come on. Last night, our dinner It was awful! I know and I'm sorry. I freaked out when you told me you'd never had sex. And I don't know. It was unexpected. And I acted like an idiot. And honestly, once I thought about it, it doesn't even matter. You know, I'll wait as long as I have to - I just -It's not only that. Now, look what happened when you lost your job and found out I was a virgin. You got to cut me some slack, Jane. - That was a tough moment. - Yeah. Life is full of tough moments. You have to fight for what you want. Look, I just think that maybe we read too much into things between us. We're having a baby. Let's focus on that. And speaking of not working out So, we should nail down a date for dinner with my daughter. Let it be known that at that moment, Xiomara prayed for a spark. I don't think I should. Why? Look, you're a great guy. And because you're a great guy, I wanted it to work out. So I've been ignoring the fact that there's something missing here. What's going on? Please sit down, Luisa. Who are you? My name is Dr. Perez. Try to stay calm, Luisa. What? What's going on? I'm so sorry, Luisa. I had to tell them what you were saying. Tell them what? About us? Ah you mean our affair? See? Luisa? You're having some sort of episode. Fantasizing about me. What?! What?! - Luisa, you got to stay calm. - We were, we were lovers! - I don't know what happened. - The doctor has - medications to give you. - She's lying! She's lying! Stop lying! I don't know what I did to trigger this - You didn't do anything. - Stop lying! The same thing happened with her mother a psychotic break. Stop lying! Stop lying! Why are you lying?! Why are you doing this?! Stop! Stop lying! Why are you doing this?! - Oh! - Stop lying! Please! Liar! I have no choice. I have to commit her. Abuela, you ready for the world premiere of mom's song? Oh, sorry. Whenever you're ready, we'll head to the hotel. Mom. Is everything okay with Abuela? She's in there with the rosary again. - Oh. - What is it? It's your lawsuit. Remember that time I forgot to pay my parking ticket? I wasn't even thinking about how she feels about court. If grandpa's family was so rich, why aren't we rich? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Why? _ Stupid immigration laws. _ _ _ And I get that, ma. And I'll be more careful. It should be noted that was the last ticket Xiomara ever got. Oh, I didn't even think. It's just a civil procedure. Yeah, and she knows that. And she's fine with it. But then Petra started acting all crazy, and the family's so powerful She's just nervous, that's all. Wanted to see me? Yeah, go ahead and shut that. So, I've been thinking About how you said you made a mistake. And I agree. You did. _ Lachlan, I-I don't Wait. I'm deleting it. I never stopped missing you. I got an ID on the picture I sent. The guy's a possible Serbian war criminal. What? What the hell does a Serbian have to do with Sin Rostro? I don't know. The guy's been awfully quiet in there. I don't like this. Hello? Uh, no. Yeah, this is Rafael. What? All right, I'm gonna go have Luca put this on and you guys grab a seat. - Okay. - Oh, Rogelio's here. I invited him to hear it. Since he's the one who set up the recording session. Mm-hmm. - Come on, ma. - Okay. _ _ Xiomara. So, where's Mark? You mean Marco? Is that not what I said? We broke up. But in case you were thinking it had anything - to do with you - It did. And he was. It didn't. Just because he wasn't right doesn't mean you are. Of course. I agree 100%. Ah. Is that your song? Just beautiful. Hmm. I guess he didn't delete it after all. Housekeeping. Thank you. Thank you. He's gone. What the hell? Where'd he go? Jane. Did Petra talk to you? - Is that why you withdrew the lawsuit? - What? No, I just got a I got a call from my lawyer saying that you withdrew. I did, but that wasn't because of Petra. It was it was It was for my grandma. She's not a legal resident in this country, and the whole thing was making her nervous. And it's not only that. I was thinking about what my lawyer said in court, about how this baby was not wanted. And I don't feel like that anymore. So what am I doing this for, really for the money? 'Cause that just feels ugly. Especially because you are absolutely going to take care of your child, financially. Of course I am. I'm gonna need that in writing. Done. Wait, wh what was it that you thought Petra told me? And so Rafael finally told Jane the truth. I underwrote my sister's medical malpractice insurance. So your lawsuit You were actually suing me. What? _ _ _ I-I just didn't want to affect your decision to sue. I had no idea. I know. I've also been thinking about what you told me. About how I need to fight for things. And you're right. I do. So I'm gonna work for Lachlan. And Petra, as long as she's here. And I'm gonna fight for you, too. Jane, this-this is This is hard. Look, we're doing everything backwards. I mean, we're having a baby and-and then we're going on our first date? But I want to be with you. And I'm not giving up. Oh, if only it were that easy. _"
"All right, let's dive in. As you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael sperm. - But I've never had sex. - This created some ups and some downs. On the bright side - I'm here - Jane felt herself falling - for her baby daddy. - Hi. - On the downside - I mean, we're so different. We're having a baby. Let's focus on that. But Rafael wouldn't take no for an answer. - And I'm gonna fight for you too. - Unfortunately, Rafael's soon-to-be - ex-wife wasn't going down without a fight. - We're done, Petra. Jane's got to change her mind. You guys have to share custody of that baby. But Petra had bigger problems. See, she was being blackmailed by Ivan, - the man who knew her secret identity. - Natalia. And she had accidentally taken him hostage. Stop it! Oh, and Jane's ex-fiancÃ©e Michael he was on the hunt for the notorious drug dealer - Sin Rostro. - I don't like this. - And he was getting closer. - He's gone. - And now, let's start. - Where'd he go? They say you never forget your first Short story. Certainly, young Jane Gloriana Villanueva remembered everything about the night she wrote hers. It was as though something opened inside her. Suddenly, her world became magical. Keep going. You're good at this. You're awesome, Jane. You're doing great. Suddenly, she let herself dream. I think you've found your calling. Your mommy's gonna be so proud of you. Keep going. _ Show your mom. _ No. Mommy, this is what I'm good at. It's my dream. _ _ _ It's okay. Don't cry, ma. Like I said, Jane never forgot the night she wrote her first short story. It was the same night she learned dreams weren't practical. And so Jane kept hers a secret. But she never stopped dreaming. See, for years, Jane had been submitting stories to online magazines. And she had the archived rejection letters to prove it. So she assumed she had just received another one. But at this particular moment, she was wrong, and thrilled to be so. _ _ _ _ Hallelujah! I told you you were good at this. _ _ Morning, everyone. Is it the pregnancy hormones or did something really good just happen? Something really, really good just happened. Just excited about your big meeting with your record label guy. _ I'm not nervous. He heard my demo and he liked it, and so we're meeting. It's not a big deal. Just because this is my lifelong dream doesn't mean I'm so suddenly freaking nervous. And then excited, and then back to nervous. - You'll be great, mom. - You're absolutely sure - you don't need me today at your sonogram? - I'm sure. And you can take the car. I'm going with Rafael, and we're taking the bus. It's his first time. - Aw. - Cute, right? - Muy cute. - So, so cute. Uh, so-so where do I You just slide it. Like a credit card. Oh. Got it, like a credit card. Great. So we can just sit anywhere? It's nice. Hey, no, no, no, no. - No, WebMD. No - Oh. You're right. But can't I just look up the nuchal fold so that I know what they're looking for? No, no. It's a wormhole. It's gonna make you nervous. We talked about this. Huh? You're right. So, just to be clear, I know we had a rough official first date, but we are back on, right? Back on? What are you, like, 14 years old? Will you just indulge my Are we? We're taking it slow. As long as we're taking it somewhere. And as long As I can kiss you. What no. Less kissing, more talking. We got to start to get to know each other, right? Right. Okay. Tell me something about you that I don't know. Well, I've been submitting short stories to online magazines for years. And this morning, I found out from the Cincinnati review that they want to publish one. What? Th-that's great. So when does it go up? Oh, I'm not gonna let them publish it, actually. - Why? - The main character in the story, Lucy, is a feisty, single mom that wears booty shorts and entertains a revolving door of guys.   Ah. Well, I'm sure your mom's got a sense of humor about herself, right? There's a line in it that says she puts the ""loose"" in Lucy. I-I I mean I took some creative license, but it is based on her, and I shouldn't have sent it in. It was just my favorite story, and I wanted to see what it Anyway it's an honor just to get the recognized, right? The recognition is nothing. Only the award matters. To win my second consecutive Paloma - _ - it would be unheard of. I'm gonna live-tweet the show. #GoRo. #RogelioMyBrogelio. #VivadelaVega. Excuse me. _ Rogelio. _ Hello. Esteban. Hello to yourself. I was just seeing where I sit For when I win. _ - How funny. I was just seeing where I sit for when I win - Well, we can't both win. No, we can't. Unless we tie. Which we won't. I suppose we'll see who wins then. Let the biggest star shine. He's so cocky. Okay, let's practice my acceptance speech. I would like to thank God, for giving me all this talent. And while Rogelio was thanking his God, Xiomara was praying to hers. Please, please, please let today's meeting go well. The one and only Paulina Rubio. My entire life I've been hoping for a chance like this. Today is the day, Xo. You're gonna step into your destiny. In different shoes, of course. You're sexy, you're not a stripper. And pump up the lipstick a shade. Perfect. Yes. Go, go, go. We're screwed. - We are, we're screwed. - We are not screwed. - We lost a Serbian war criminal. - No one even knows he was here. Yeah, because we didn't report our lead. But this this is crazy. What is the connection - between Sin Rostro and the Serbian? - I don't know. - And where the hell is the Serbian? - I don't know. - _ - Exactly. Which is why we have to report it. We don't have to report it, we have to solve it. Listen, I have a theory, okay? - Sin Rostro went underground, right? - Mm-hmm. Around the same time Rafael got cancer. - What? - As soon as Rafael's better and takes over the hotel Sin Rostro resurfaces and there are two murders. That's your theory? That Rafael is Sin Rostro? It can't all be a coincidence. Where's your evidence? Well, that was a problem. As he had none. Yet. I like you, Michael. But I am not risking my badge so you can indulge in your Rafael vendetta. You got to let go of Jane. This is not about Jane. Less than 2.5 millimeters. We want the nuchal fold to be less than 2.5 millimeters. _ I'm confused. When did you go on WebMD? In the bathroom. It just needs to be under 2.5. If it's over, that can signal genetic abnormality. Can you just maybe give me a ballpark? I'm not allowed to say anything. Only a doctor can give results. Right. I'm sorry. You said that several times. It's gonna be okay. Do you believe in God? What? I was just praying, and I wondered. _ Uh _ I-I I don't know. I-I've just never been one for organized religion. But you were raised Catholic though, right? Yes. Sorry, it Just seems like the kind of thing you talk about before a sonogram. I was accidentally artificially inseminated. I'll get the doctor. - Mm. - Thank you. I just Well, I imagined that My kids would be baptized and go to Sunday school. Sunday school? Kids hate Sunday school. Doesn't mean they shouldn't go. Okay, compromise. Prep school with a religious component. Private school? Are you serious? Are you kidding? Have you seen the state of public education today? - It's horrible. - Yeah, sure, there are problems. But there are great upsides, like more diversity. Means less of a chance of being an entitled snob. Percentage-wise. Not you. Okay. Everything looks great. The fetus is around three inches long right now about the size of a peach. And in that moment, all their differences faded away, and Jane and Rafael were perfectly and completely happy. I'm so sorry I'm late. Come on. Did you think it would last? What the hell are you doing here? What do you mean? This is my baby, too. - What? - Oh, no, no. Excuse me, what's going on? I'm sorry, my ex-wife is crazy. You have zero claim on this baby. You sure about that? Do you remember after the, uh the miscarriage, when you and I were talking about maybe using a surrogate? We drew up a pre-planned adoption contract, which stipulated that you and I would be the legal parents of the surrogate's child. And Jane is now serving as a surrogate. - I am not a surrogate. - She's not a surrogate. Oh, I'm sorry, did you want this baby? Because there's a pretty clear record of the fact that you didn't, starting with your lawsuit against his sister. Which I withdrew. Ah. Not from the public records. Hey, hey. So I'm pretty sure this contract will hold up in court. Especially since we haven't reached a divorce settlement yet. Why are you doing this? For the money? I'm are you suggesting that I'm not genuinely invested in the well-being of this baby? Because that's offensive. No, I want to be a part of this child's life. And I'm willing to fight for that right. - Jane, are you okay? - Yeah. Just trying not to stress. It's important not to stress. At least, according to WebMD. I e-mailed my dad's lawyers. We'll talk to them. What if she does have a claim on our kid? She doesn't. Believe me, all Petra wants is money. I'll pay her off if I have to. Is that really the way to go? To just give her money? In this case, yes. But she doesn't deserve it. But that might be the only way to shut this down. You're probably wondering why I'm here. As you may have heard through social media, I've been nominated for my second consecutive Paloma. Congratulations. Thanks. It's an honor just to get the recognition. And I would love to have all three Villanueva women with me at the awards ceremony. I'd say that's a yes. _ _ The man is a fraud. He cannot make a proper ""I'm longing for you but cannot have you"" face. Like this. I should point out that right at this moment Rogelio is not acting. He is, in fact, longing for Xiomara. But, alas, these two had agreed not to date, so as to not complicate Jane's relationship with her father. I have to run. Meeting with a record producer. - Wish me luck. - Come. A hug from Rogelio is like a rabbit's foot. Lucky, rare, and soft to the touch. Bye. Bye. Walk tall, Xo. Class. Confidence. And shake that ass just a tiny bit. The producers are gonna love you. What's wrong? Those stupid pirates, they have Santos tied up in dungeon. No, I mean what's wrong with the way I look? I need to be downstairs, and Something's not right. More red around your eyes. Like you've been crying. Put your hair up. Makes you look more serious. _ Okay. Better. Come on, mother. I need you for the sympathy vote. _ _ _ _ Seriously, baby? This is how you thank me for the job, a gambling ring? If we have to work this telenovela after party, might as well make it fun. Best actor, Jane's dad or Esteban? Oh, Esteban. He's everything. And your brother is here. Well, here we go. Seriously? It's like an Oscar pool. You gonna arrest me? I'm not gonna arrest you. I need your help. Look, if you think Rafael Solano's a drug dealer, - arrest him. - That's the thing. I need some proof. I got to be sure before I bring him in. You know, 'cause he's Jane's The father of Jane's baby. So you're going rogue. Dig around. See what you can find out. $350. _ _ It was awful. I walked in, and I could literally see his face fall. He said he thought from my song I'd be younger. _ I don't know. Maybe it's a sign. Maybe I should focus on my dance school, try to really grow it. There's got to be lots of studio space in the city. Jane got a story published? Why didn't she say anything? Pay attention. This is important. Not only for my client, Petra Solano, but for all women who enter into non-biological birth contracts. We are pioneering a new frontier - in reproductive rights. - Enough. Okay, so she hired a big shot lawyer. That doesn't make her case more valid. No, it doesn't. Unfortunately, it does make the prospect of shutting it down more challenging. Okay, that's it. We'll offer her a payout. - Oh. - Hi. Hi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? What's going on? No, Michael, I'm okay. It's not your responsibility. I don't care. What-what is it? Jane, please. I just you seem really upset. Tell me why. Please. It's Petra. She's making a play at custody for the baby. - What? - I know. - That doesn't make any sense. - I know. She probably won't win, but it's just this idea of being in a long, drawn-out court case. What does she want, money? It has to be. She doesn't want a kid. Okay. Maybe I can help. Aren't you nervous? I mean, putting her on TV? What if Milos sees her? Please. Milos isn't watching local Miami news. And it's the only way to get Rafael to settle. My God, it smells like a kielbasa factory in here. _ Ivan realized the matches were a sign. He could escape just like Santos. _ _ As soon as he saw the next episode. Magda, I am so hungry. Could I have some more pretzels? You'd never guess I was the one in the wheelchair and you were the hostage. Wait, what are you talking about? Zaz's murder is still unsolved, and, officially, Petra is still a person of interest. I can work as an informant and gather information for the ongoing investigation. So, what, you're just gonna wear a wire - when you talk to her? - Yes. Official police business. And Michael can And you can listen in and record everything. If I can get her on tape admitting that she will drop the custody claim for the right price, we can get this thrown out for good. I just I don't know if we should involve Michael. The guy's got it out for me. He's just trying to help. It's a it's a little naive. I think this is a legitimate solution. It could shut it down. Look, I already worked out a number with my lawyer. I'm gonna make her an offer, okay? Maybe she'll accept it, maybe she'll sign the papers, - and then she'll leave us alone. - And what if she says no? - Then we'll go a little higher. - Yeah, and then this will just drag on. You know it will. There's no guarantee that she's gonna say yes. And, honestly, I just think that throwing money at the problem is not the answer. Did you just say ""throwing money at it""Â? It's a band-aid. It's not a permanent solution. Okay, just to be clear, money is not some evil thing. All right? It can be very helpful. And to say that it's not, again, is just naive. Okay, you need to stop calling me naive. Because you're the one that married Petra. That's the reason why we're in this situation. All right, I asked around. If Rafael's in the drug trade, he's deep, deep underground because no one's heard of him. Damn it. On the upside, here's his wallet. What the hell are you doing? I didn't ask you - to steal this. - It's no big deal. He lost it. He'll Find it again tomorrow. In the meantime, check it out, huh? There's a key sewn in here. Hmm? You don't sew a key into a wallet unless you're hiding something. _ _ And I'm sending professional hair and makeup here. - My gift to you. - Ay. You will likely be on camera when I win. You don't look excited. Why are you not excited? So how was your meeting at the record label? _ _ Â¿QuÃ©? That is ridiculous. I don't know. Maybe it's time to get realistic. Face the fact that I missed my window.  Libre, como el mismo aire, vive libre   Como lo hace el viento, vuela libre  - Alba. - Hmm? _ Mm-hmm. _ _ Thanks, ma, but I think it's time to let it go. Ay, mi Amor. _ Oh, no. Did the meeting not go well? Don't worry. I'm fine. Easy. Loose. You know. You read my story. I borrowed your computer, and I saw it. And I'm sorry for clicking. I shouldn't have done that. And I first want to say that I am really proud of you that they are publishing it. Mom But wow. ""She puts the 'loose' in Lucy""? You might as well have called her ""Xo the Ho"". Mom, I I exaggerated for comic effect. - But, I mean, is this what you really think about me? - No. - Mom, just please, listen - Do you wish that I was somebody else? The kind of mom that-that wears bulky Christmas sweaters and bakes a lot? No. Of course not. Lucy's daughter Jen seems to feel differently. Look I get the exaggeration. But underneath it all, is that how you feel? I did sometimes, growing up. You were always dating different guys. I didn't bring them home. Doesn't mean I didn't know about them. And, you know, except for Anthony, no one ever really stuck. What do you remember about Anthony? I liked him. He was funny, he made me laugh. Yeah, he did. And after he broke up with me, you were very sad. Do you remember that? I didn't want that to happen again, so after I kept things casual. To protect me? Yeah. That was really nice, mom. But enough already. All right, with with all the sacrificing. I'm-I'm a grown-up, okay? And-and you deserve to have a happy, long-term relationship. That's what I want for you. Thanks, Jane. And don't worry. I'm not going to sign that publishing consent form anyway. Oh. I signed it for you. What?! I am not gonna be the reason that you miss your window. Oh. If only all mothers were this unselfish. Hand me my red nail polish. The blood red. _ _ It is amazing the two of you can still be so civil after everything that happened with Milos. We don't talk about Milos. It is easier for you, no? You don't have horrible scar. You can still walk. He's right, Petra. It is not easy for me. I'm sorry about Milos, mother. - I should have listened to you. - Yes. You should have. _ Okay, that seems a little dramatic. It was only five years ago. _ _ _ Yup, you guessed it. Milos. _ _ The breakup did not go well, to say the least. As luck would have it, Petra saw a koruna on the street at that very moment, and ducked down to pick it up. Her mother, on the other hand, was not as lucky. Mother! I will never forgive myself for that. - Never. - I know. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Passports, cash, a burner phone. I knew it. I knew something was going on. Now I just got to find it all again with a warrant. _ _ Can you imagine if you actually got the baby? _ _ - Enough. - No! - I've been dealing with telenovelas all day - No, the show. I am watching show. - For the after party. I need a break. - I am watching this show! - Jane wants to meet. - Please. Turn TV on. I need to see Santos. Okay, geez, relax. _ I have to go meet Jane, mother. Thanks for meeting me. I was thrilled you reached out. I really think we can solve this in a civil way. I do, too. Do you want to order food, or? No, thank you. I'm really not hungry. Thanks for letting me listen in. I just want what's best for Jane. Me, too. I can see why you'd be concerned. There's a lot of criminal activity in this hotel. Because I want to facilitate a solution. I'm just trying to focus on Jane. Fantastic. - A solution sounds great. - Agreed. So, what is it you're looking for? Uh, in terms of visitation? No, not in terms of visitation. Look, I can talk to Rafael, I can convince him to give you whatever you want. Well, that's-that's fantastic. 'Cause what I really, truly want is this baby. Well, that's not gonna happen, but I can assure you that the baby is going to be just fine with me. Are you sure you can learn to love a child that you never even wanted? I am sure. I love this child my child. But what's wrong with more people loving it? More people will love it, like Rafael. And me. See, I'm already attached to it. I don't believe you. You don't really know anything about me, do you? We're actually alike, you and I. I really, really don't think so. You think I don't know what it means to struggle? Just like you, it's always been me and my mother. My father was trapped behind the iron curtain during the cold war. When I was a baby, he sent me and my mother off to west Germany. He was meant to follow. For five years, we waited for him. But he couldn't get out. And he died one week one week before the wall fell. I'll never forget that feeling. Losing someone, never getting the chance to know them. That's why I'm fighting for this baby. Nothing. Nothing. I know. I'm sorry. Where's Rafael? Uh, he took-took off. What? Why? Uh, honestly, I don't know. He just kind of stood up and left. But, um, listen, I-I I do want to talk to you about him. Something's going on with him, something shady. What? What are you talking about? I can't say. But trust me, Jane. I only want what's best for you. Rafael said that you had it in for him. I said no. Well, there you go. You see, he said that to cover himself in case I said something. - Michael, stop. - Jane. - Jane, listen. - No, just stop. Something's off with this guy. It's-it's open. What's going on? Why'd you run off? When Petra was talking about her father, did she seem like she was lying? No. That was the one moment - I thought she was telling the truth. - Exactly. Me, too. So I came up here to check some facts. What facts? The iron curtain divided Europe into two separate areas from 1945 until the Berlin wall fell in November of 1989. - _ - Why am I getting a history lesson? - _ - Because Petra said that her father died one week before the Berlin wall fell, but according to everything she ever told me and her passport, Petra was born in December - _ - of 1989. So either she can miraculously recall events from before she was born And we're live from the red carpet of the 14th annual Paloma awards. For the first time ever, we're hosting them in beautiful downtown Miami. All your favorite telenovela stars are swarming the red carpet as we speak. And of course, one of the fiercest rivalries of the night centers around the best actor category. I have the two front-runners here with me tonight Rogelio De La Vega and Esteban Santiago. How are the two of you feeling tonight? Wonderful. Many may think we are rivals, - but we're actually very close friends. - Oh, yes? Yes, in fact, Rogelio is like a father to me. Which is remarkable, since we're actually the same age. I feel for Esteban. He's tremendously overrated. There's nowhere for him to go but down. _ Sorry I'm late. There's dramatic stuff going on at the house. Please make your way inside. The show is about to begin. I need you to dig up as much as you can as quickly as you can. Oh, there There, a storm coming. You see that? We should probably go to basement. You could take off my cuffs. I would not run. Nice try. And now, best villain in a telenovela. Get back to work. The guests will be here soon. And now, the award we've all been waiting for, best actor in a dramatic series. The nominees are: Mateo Alvarado, ""The Boldness of Love"". Enrique Maldonado, ""Beautiful Forever"". Esteban Santiago, ""The Glory and the Temptation"". And Rogelio De La Vega, ""The Passions of Santos"". And the winner is Esteban Santiago! I meant to do that. It'll go viral. One of those memes. Thank you so much to God for creating me in his image. _ But though the award show was over, the drama was just getting started at the after party. What's so important? I organized this party. I need to be out there. We hired a private investigator. What? The best one money could buy. Turns out the real Petra, the one whose passport you've been carrying around well, she died in the Czech Republic in 2008. So that leaves us with a big question. Who the hell are you? Natalia. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ We'll keep digging until we uncover exactly who you are and what you're hiding, unless you sign the divorce papers and agree to stay the hell away from us and our baby. Okay. Yes. It should be noted that at this moment God or no God it felt like a miracle. Indeed, there was something in the air that night, and it was not just the strong wind mixed with the smell of mushroom croquettes. It was something more magical. I'm sorry. I've had a little too much champagne, but you look just like Paulina Rubio. I get that a lot. 'Cause I am Paulina Rubio. Oh, my God. You're just I'm a singer, and you're just pretty much God to me, so Thank you. Thank you. What's your name? - Um, Xiomara. - Xiomara. Or you can call me Xo. Or, you know, whatever you want, really. What type of music do you sing? I sing pop, mostly. Well, no, I-I did. Uh Things never really took off for me. I actually think it's best I I let it go, you know. I missed my window. If it's your calling, if it's what you're meant to do, there's no window. Lots of people tried to tell me to give up. What if I'd listened? No, chica. If you have it, if you really want it, you do it. I got to go. I have a big concert tonight, but you You have something special. Stick to it, okay? So, you were right to go to Michael, and I was right to throw money at an expensive P.I. Lesson learned. Yeah? What is that lesson? We're better together. Really? Because I think the lesson is, is that we're very different, and there are a lot of things that are gonna come up because of that. No. Refer back to my lesson. We are better together. And we'll figure it out, Jane. Whatever comes up school, religion, or the other hundred things that we haven't thought about yet we will figure it out. Okay? Why don't you tell your 14-year-old self that we're cleared for kissing, okay? Oh, thank you. I've lost everything. We need to start over. Again. Maybe we should just stop running, just go home, and if Milos finds us, then so be it. Don't say that. Never say that. You took care of me then. I will take care of you now. Hey. Sorry you didn't win. I don't have the shelf space, anyway. I-I didn't win either. We made this wager at work about who would win best actor. I bet on you. - You did? - Of course. And for a brief moment, Rogelio felt like he had won. You're not gonna believe this. I just met Paulina Rubio! - Are you serious? - Just now. _ Outside. It was magical. She told me not to give up on my dream. Oh, my God, that's awesome. _ I'm very happy for you, Xiomara. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ah. You didn't tell Xiomara I sent you, right? Oh, of course not, Rogelio. Don't worry about that. I mean, this is not you. Doing something nice for someone and not willing to take the credit? She is. Thank you for helping me. Whatever you want. You know that, okay? Really? Will you do an appearance on one of my telenovelas? You're so funny. Yeah. Uh I love you. No. - Oh. - That's not gonna happen ever. 'Cause you could be whatever you want. You could be a pirate. _ _ Uh, ma, why don't you have a seat. - Hmm? - Yeah, maybe we should get you some water. She's drunk. She's the best. Can I have some water, please? Hey, uh, what's going on with you and Rogelio? What do you mean? Come on. You guys obviously like each other. I saw all the googly eyes. Why don't you go for it? We're over that commitment-phobia, remember? Okay, I am not gonna let go of this, so you might as well tell me. The truth is, I've been staying away from Rogelio so that he can focus on his relationship with you. I don't want it to get complicated if things don't work out with us romantically. Again, super sweet, mom, but enough with the sacrifices. Not that I buy that it was completely about me, anyway. What do you mean? Maybe sometimes you use me as an excuse. Because one thing I do remember about your breakup with Anthony was how sad you were. Yeah, well, getting hurt sucks. I know. But that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take a shot at doing something that might make you really happy. What is this about? Mr. Solano, we have a warrant to search a safe in this office. A warrant? Based on what? Based on a statement from a hotel employee who said the safe contains criminal material. I was passing by, and I saw what looked like a stack of passports. - _ - Latin lover narrator: And just like that, Billy's $350 became $500. No. No. No. No way. I'm gonna go now. No! What are you doing? - _ - A man vanishes from the room, things are disappearing from safes. Michael, calm down. How am I so far behind? - Hey, hey, hey! - What am I missing? - Hey, stop! - What am I What is going on? I don't know, but you need a break. Nadine what are you doing? What is that? What the hell? Oh, wow. An unexpected twist. Meanwhile, a tipsy Alba had decided to give Petra a piece of her mind after all. _ - Get out! - Please! Please call the police! I need help! I'm tied up! Get out! Get out! Go get help! I told you the drama was just getting started. _"
"Is this thing on? Okay, good. Hi, friends. Let's jump right in. As you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. But I've never had sex. And, wow, a lot has happened since then. First, Jane and Rafael discovered the truth about his ex-wife Petra's identity. She's not who she says she is. - Natalia. - Turns out the real Petra, well, she died in the Czech Republic in 2008. Meanwhile, tensions between Jane's ex-fiancé Michael and her current flame Rafael were at an all-time high, and Jane was caught in the middle. Something's going on with him something shady. See, Michael was convinced Rafael was involved with Sin Rostro, a big, bad drug dealer. He thought he had a lead, but it evaporated. We lost a Serbian war criminal. Listen, I have a theory. Sin Rostro went underground around the same time Rafael got cancer. As soon as Rafael's better and takes over the hotel, Sin Rostro resurfaces and there are two murders. - Where's your evidence? - So he broke Rafael's office, where he found this. Unfortunately, when he went back, with a warrant, the safe was empty. And then this happened. It was an OMG moment, trust me! And to make matters worse, a tropical storm is heading their way. It should be noted that at an early age, Jane Gloriana Villanueva was already a quick learner with many skills. but that's because I used the British spelling of ""amphitheater"", so I think I can argue that tomorrow. - Great job, hon. - It should be noted that Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva was also a very quick learner with many skills. Unfortunately, cooking was not one of them. Thank you. ""Ask your parent to cook a dish from the country you're from."" Hey, Honey, why didn't you tell me about this? Because she was going to ask Alba to cook for Heritage Day. I forgot. It'll be fun. Maybe I'll make, like, a chicken empanada or an arepa? Abuela? Can you teach me how to pray? Like, the right way, with your rosary? _ _ _ _ _ I just want Heritage Day to go well. Mom's cooking, and I don't want anyone to get seriously sick. _ _ _ _ And from that moment on, when Jane felt especially desperate, she would often turn to prayer. _ And Jane needed the power of prayer now more than ever. Hi, Ms. Villanueva? - Yes. - Yes. She's my mother, her grandma. What's going on? How is she? Well, the good news is she's stable. And she gives every indication that she will wake up. Okay, so what's the bad news? We don't know when that will be. There was some internal bleeding caused by the head injury. And until she does wake up, we won't know whether there will be any long-term ramifications. Like, you mean her memory? Or That, among other things speech, certain skills. All we can do is wait. Okay. Thank you. Thanks. She would want us to pray. What? Abuela. Where's her rosary? I don't know. No, I saw her put it in her purse before we went to the Awards Show. It must've fallen out when she fell. Okay, I'm gonna go to the hotel to get it. Come on, Jane. There's a tropical storm outside. Mom, do you remember when I was applying to get my teaching degree and she prayed with the rosary that I'd get in? Two days later, I got in. Because you're smart, not because of some beads she got at a Church Flea market. Mom, I can't just sit around and do nothing. Okay? I'll take the car ten minutes there, ten minutes back. Please? Okay, let me know if anything changes. _ _ You'll recall we last left Michael and Nadine in a rather exciting position. Not that one, you perv. They had discovered Sin Rostro's secret tunnel beneath the hotel. _ You sure we shouldn't call for backup? The Serbian could still be down here. We don't even know where this tunnel leads. - Hold up. - Whoa. It's a retinal scanner. This must be where Sin Rostro keeps the drugs. We got to get inside. Agreed. Let's call for backup and bust through this thing. Lachlan is stuck in Key Largo. - Oh, that's too bad. - Yes, it is, because I have to head out. The storm's really picking up, darling. Maybe you shouldn't fly. I have to. It's-it's important. Then don't worry. I can handle the Marbella in your absence. Come on, dad. I've done it before. And your tenure wasn't that successful. And I've learned from my mistakes. Come on, you have proven your point. Just give me a chance. There's a lot to do right now. The storm is picking up. We got to prepare the hotel, we have to relocate patients from their recovery suites to hospital in case our generators fail. Just let me get started. Please. All right. One thing. Lachlan was about to institute to offset our losses. Now you can do it. It's only fair, since it was your mistakes that put us in this spot in the first place. Will that be a problem? No. Not at all. It should be noted that, despite the unpleasant task, Rafael found himself briefly optimistic. - Hello, Rafael. - Yup. Briefly. What do you want, Petra? Or whatever your name is. Natalia, actually. Look, I didn't come here to fight. The divorce papers. I signed them. You won. And I'll leave as soon as you pay out my prenup. Ah, yes, her prenup. Petra's golden ticket. Here's the thing about the prenup. Petra Andel signed it. You're not Petra Andel. Rafael, please. I have nothing. - And you deserve nothing. - Yes, I know. You're right. Let me at least tell you the truth about everything. I lied about my identity because I've been running for a very long time from a very evil man. Yeah, so here's the problem. I don't believe you. It's the truth. Should we go over all the crazy lies and the things you've done just in the last six months? 'Cause we can. Ooh, yes, let's. _ _ _ _ Rafael, listen Attention guests and staff. Tropical storm Florentina has gained speed and is now a category 2 hurricane. Authorities tell us the roads will soon be closed. For your own safety, please stay indoors. Oh dear. Jane still hadn't found Alba's rosary. Jane? I found this when I was cleaning up. I heard you were looking for it. It felt like a miracle. Oh, my God. Thank you, Regina. I owe you big-time. Hey, you taught my Gaby how to make the best grilled cheese on the planet. It's the least I could do. Please stay off the roads and in your homes. The National Weather Service has upgraded this Wow! I have to say, the wind is really picking up out here! I told you, I have no choice. I'm getting out before the storm hits. The move is next week. I'll need five million for Allegria. Darling. I didn't know you were awake. Oh, I couldn't sleep, with the wind. You sounded upset. Is everything all right? Yes, yes. It's my driver, he's just waiting for me downstairs. Ooh. That didn't sound like his driver. Do you really have to go tonight? Yes, I do. But I'm gonna call you as soon as I get to Prague. And next week, you and me, we're going away together. So you two found this hydraulic bathtub How, exactly? Just good old-fashioned detective work. Well, great job. Thank you. Hey. Okay, we're on our way. They got through the lock. What the hell? Maybe Sin Rostro kills people here from rival cartels. Looks more like a Surgical room. Yeah, but why the hell does Sin Rostro need a surgical room? Make sure all the outdoor furniture is moved inside. The wind will toss everything. And get those storm shutters up, and remember, first sign of flooding, we kill the main breaker. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are you going? I thought you were at the hospital. No, no, I I came to grab my grandmother's rosary. I have to get back. - No, the roads are really bad. - No, but it's close. You are pregnant. If something were to happen Hey, make an announcement. It's no longer safe for anyone to leave the hotel. The Marbella is now on lockdown. Look. I know you want to go, but it's not safe, okay? - Not until the road clears. - No, you're right. I'm gonna call my mom. I-I got to go talk to them. Do you want to wait out the storm in my penthouse? No, no, no. I'm gonna find my friends, see how I can help. Go. I'll figure it out. - Go, go, go, go. - Just-just text me if you need anything. Okay. Okay, so this room is also connected to the hotel's medical recovery suites. There were five patients registered there as of this afternoon. It should be noted that Michael and Nadine are thinking the same exact thing. _ Where are the patients? They were relocated to Holy Crown Hospital before the hurricane hit. - What? No. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Apparently, the guy that runs the hotel did it as a precaution. Rafael Solano? - Yeah. - Head over to Holy Crown. I don't care if those roads are closed. We need those patients identified immediately. Got it. - It's Rafael. I knew it. - Okay, just calm down - and let's think this through. - He ran this hotel. He knows everything that happens here. There's no way he didn't know about this place. Nadine, think about it. Roman Zazo, one of Sin Rostro's contacts, was Rafael's college roommate. Then there's the multiple passports from different countries, cash and burner phone inside his safe Which we never found. I know what I saw. You know me well enough to know I would not make that up. He must have moved them. Look, Rafael is definitely a suspect, okay? But if he's involved, I got to think he's working for his father. I mean, Emilio is the one that financed the hotel. And Zazo was murdered the same night that Emilio got here. Either way, Rafael's involved. We should bring him down here. I bet the retinal scanner recognizes him. The tech had to break the scanner to get through the door. Then I'm gonna go rattle his cage. Okay, I've seen Titanic, like, a hundred times. Nobody cares about the third-class passengers. We're gonna get locked in here and drown. Okay, you do know we're not actually on a boat, right? Guys. What's wrong? Oh, my God, I knew it. I had a bad feeling. I just heard from housekeeping Carla, who's dating that bellboy whose sister works in HR, that people are getting fired. Like, a lot of people. During a hurricane?! Oh! Jane, Jane, Jane, come here. Sorry, I was just changing. I've been looking for you guys. Frankie heard cuts are coming. Will you ask Rafael if it's true and who's getting fired? Oh, I-I don't think that's a good idea. Oh, please, Jane? I need this job. I drink for free, and it's so close to my gym. Yeah, I don't think I can use that argument with Rafael. - Why? - I-I don't want to take advantage of our relationship. Come on, Jane. I just moved into a new place. If I can't pay rent, I will literally - be homeless. - You guys, it's fine. Don't pressure her. We just need a heads up. Okay. All right. I'll talk to him. But he's been busy, so I-I'll just wait till I see him later. Okay, well, he's over there talking to your ex-fiancé, right there. I told you, I don't know anything about secret tunnels - and I want to see them. - And I told you I don't believe you. And you can't see them it's a potential crime scene. Hey. Hey there. What are you guys talking about? Uh, we're actually discussing police business. I assume you don't want her to stay. She can absolutely stay. Okay, so what am I staying for exactly? We discovered a secret tunnel underneath the Marbella. It leads to a surgical room, connecting to the recovery suites, which we believe is connected to a criminal enterprise. What kind of criminal enterprise? There's a big drug dealer. He's known as Sin Rostro. - The man without a face? - Yes. No one's I.D.'d him, but we have reason to believe he's based here. The most obvious reason being that two of his known associates were murdered in the Marbella. Exactly. The police should have solved it. Do your job. I am. Right now. For the record, you're claiming you have no connection to any of this? For the record? Of course not. For the record, Michael is really enjoying this. Just like those passports and the burner phone weren't inside your safe? Listen, I've already told you everything I know, which is nothing. And this is all very upsetting. And now I'm gonna have to hire my own security firm until you figure out how to catch this guy. Jane. Excuse me, Detective. What was all that about? That was your ex-fiancé trying to make me look bad. Mother, enough. Look, it's bad enough my whole life is falling apart. You don't have to ride me every second of the day, okay? Look, we have to move on. And I have a plan. Oh. I'm all ears. I'll sell my wedding ring, the rest of my jewelry. I'll be able to afford a little place, a one-bedroom. Oh, yeah. Well, what about him? _ Look, h-how about we let the bygones be bygones? You all have been very nice to me. You could let me go. I will not tell Milos. I promise. Would make things easier. Petra, don't be idiot. We'd need two-bedroom. Wait, what? I can't hear you. I know. The reception is spotty. How's grandma? The same. I'm just sitting here with a big pile of forms that I wish you could fill out. I know. I'll be there as soon as I can. Yeah, because Damn it. El Presidente. How did you even get here with the storm? I pulled some strings. I got a police escort. What's that? Oh. It's a swag bag. _ From the after-after party. I'm so glad you're here. Of course I'm here. We're family, and nothing is more important. I'm sorry. So many designer gifts. It's hard to find what you're looking for. Oh, no. What's wrong? - We're all getting fired. - That's it, isn't it? You can tell us the truth. The truth was Jane had completely forgotten about the layoffs. I totally flaked. I'm sorry. There's a lot going on. Jane was about to tell them about her grandmother. - Right. - But then Lina did that. Did you just roll your eyes at me, dude? It just seems like maybe you're not in a big rush to find out if we're getting fired because obviously you're not getting fired. Wait, what does that mean? I could be. Really? Your boyfriend's gonna fire you? You know, probably not. But that's because I've taken three sick days in four years, and I've been twice voted employee of the month. You keep telling yourself that. Look, all Lina's saying is you're in a slightly different situation now. You've got a rich dad suddenly and a rich baby daddy. We just don't have the same kind of safety net. Yeah, I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Bad time? No, come in. I was just getting an update from our maintenance department. Is everything okay? Yeah. It's just, uh my friends heard that there are gonna be layoffs, and they're freaking out. And I hate to ask this, but is it true? Yes. Unfortunately. My dad wants to Institute a 15% cut across the board. So I've just been up here trying to make a list. A list which Jane absolutely did not want to see. Can I see it? You really think that's appropriate? Probably not. Yes. Good answer, Jane. But I feel like I have to because of my friends. Oy. Okay. If it's that important to you. _ _ _ _ _ _ Ms. Villanueva, there's no easy way to say this. Oh, no. - Did the test results - No, no. Her condition remains unchanged. Look, the hospital's cracking down on what? Your mother is in this country illegally. She has no insurance. And the hospital cannot afford to absorb the cost of her care. I-I don't understand. What does that mean? That when the hurricane lifts, we will have to notify ICE, and they will deport her to Venezuela, where she can continue to receive care if she needs. What? That can't be legal. _ _ _ It's called medical repatriation. No. I can't lose this job. I don't have anything saved. Can't you ask Rafael to not fire me? Frankie, I I really can't. When you were tired and needed someone to cover those shifts, I did it. And you know I hate this. I fought for you to get this job. You did. But now you can't even fight to help me keep it? It's not my place. Wow. You have changed. The truth is, Jane didn't know quite what to do. But she figured she could talk to Rafael about it, to clear her conscience and get back to normal. Hold the elevator! Okay. Hey. Are you following me? I am in the middle of an investigation, Jane. And, yes, I am following you. But only because I'm worried. Something bad's going on here, and it has to be connected to Rafael. - Michael, what are you doing? - I saw the passports and phone - inside his safe myself. - Stop. Can you just stop? - What was that? - That, my dear, is the classic telenovela trope known as the ""stuck in the elevator"" scenario, in which two characters at odds are stuck in an elevator. Seriously? What? I did not do this. This cannot be happening right now. Oh, it's happening. In the dark. Please note, Michael was usually very good at breaking the tension in awkward situations. So, does this qualify as mood lighting? I said ""usually"". Nope. Well, I radioed Nadine. She's letting maintenance know. Wow. Impressed you even made it up that hill. I'm here to see Luisa Alver. I'm her stepmother. That's one way to put it. We have a visitor here for Luisa. You know what? It's been a while. I should stop and catch you up on Luisa. Surprisingly, Luisa had actually been enjoying her time in the mental hospital. She got three balanced meals a day, plus dessert. She thrived under the stability of a regular routine. And best of all, her roommate was a really great listener. And then my shaman was like, ""you're finally seeing the world through your third eye"". _ _ Luisa. Hi. What are you doing here? It's Rose. I need to see you. I feel so terribly about what happened. What I did. That was true. Rose did feel terrible about what happened. It was not, however, the real reason she came. Look, you were threatening to tell about our affair, and I panicked. I just panicked, and I feel so ashamed. I mean, I'm an adult, and it's 2015, and I'm not ready to admit that I want to be with a woman. That I want to be with you. I just have such a nice life with your father. Good. Go back to it. Luisa, please. I I haven't been able to sleep. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm in a mental institution. Do you realize what your father would put us through if he found out? You could have broken up with me. You didn't have to commit me! - Luisa, please - Get out of here! Now! Petra? Are you back yet with the T.P.? Rafael must know that the elevators are stuck. He'll send someone. Right. Nothing ever happens in this hotel without Rafael knowing about it. - Stop. - The tunnels, the murders. Please, stop, please! I'm just done. Between my friends and my grandma unconscious in the hospital What? Yeah. She fell. Is it bad? They say she may wake up, but they don't know If she'll have permanent damage. I am so sorry. Is, um Is your mom Is your mom with her? But the last time I talked to them, I lost reception, and I haven't heard from them in a while. Um, there's a cop in the hospital. I'll see if I can reach him on the radio and get your mom on the line. Really? Thank you. She hasn't even opened her eyes yet, and they want to deport her? I mean, how can they do this? Xiomara, I will figure this out. If my fame and money cannot help keep your mother in this country, then what is it all for? Back off, buddy! You're not taking my mother anywhere! You have a call. Push to talk. Hello? Mom, it's me. How is she? Physically, no change. What is it? What's going on? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Okay, yeah. I love you, mom. What's going on? The hospital knows that my grandma doesn't have papers. She can be deported. How dare she? How dare she? You know what I mean? How dare she just Just come in here and expect me Mother? Mother?! Mother?! Mother?! Hello, Petra. Let us talk. You give me the rest of your jewelry, and I will not kill your mother. Petra knew that Ivan's gun was inside that drawer. What she didn't know was if she could get to it in time. Go ahead. I know you're probably going - to kill her anyway. - Petra! You would rather me kill your mother than part with your jewelry? I need to start over. And you've seen the way she speaks to me. Kill him, Petra. _ Now what? It's my grandma's rosary. Oh. The one you used before Heritage Day? Dear God, please, please, let Heritage Day go well. And a few days later Mom, these are amazing. Jane knew her prayer had worked. I forgot I told you that story. Yeah. I haven't been around as much. With everything going on the pregnancy and the teaching job I just haven't been around as much. She knows you love her. I'm sorry. Come here. Come here. It's okay. Are-are you okay? Mm-hmm. Um, let me know if you hear anything about your Abuela. Uh, I got to get back. I will. Thank you. Okay. I left word with the US Ambassador and Gloria Estefan. One of them will stop the deportation. Most probably Gloria Estefan. I should hear back shortly. Thank you. I wasn't the daughter she wanted, you know? I wasn't good or religious. She loves you very much, Xiomara. I'm certain of that. Oh, God, I must look like a mess right now. Here. Have some concealer. Wow. That swag bag really does have everything. This is mine. I always carry it, just in case. Everything okay? I wanted to talk to you about Frankie. Look, I looked up your friend. She's a new hire. And she's been late a lot. It's just We go way back, and she's got nothing saved. And I just got my job back, and I have to get the books in order, and what you're asking me to do is It-it's out of line. I know. And I wouldn't be asking if it wasn't important. The next person on the list is Regina Johnson. Oh, no, no, no, no. She's got two kids, and she's always so sweet. It's either Frankie or it's Regina. These things are never easy, but they have to be done. - Mr. Solano? - Coming. Check the circuit breaker. I would have left, but the roads are closed. - Get out! - Luisa, please just let me say one thing to you. I'm sorry. And I love you. And here. You'll recall, Powdered Sugar Donuts are Rose and Luisa's post-coital go-to snack. You think this makes up for you locking me up? No, no. I can't I can't make that up to you. But I can do other things. Look, I'm gonna tell your father the truth about us. I will. It's just Now is not a good time. He's been so on edge lately. Have you ever heard of somebody named Allegria? That's my grandmother on my mom's side. My dad really loved her. Rose wondered why Emilio would be spending money on a dead woman. He even named his house in Croatia after her. Ah, yes. You see, this is the information Rose came for. God It's me, Xo. Yeah, I know it's been a while. Jane's not here. She went to get her rosary, the one she used to pray that I wouldn't mess up Heritage Day. So, I heard you and Jane talking about how she's scared I'll mess up the food. Can you make it? I don't want to embarrass her. _ But, ma! _ _ Mom, these are amazing! See? That's my mom. She's always there. Even though I've made loads of mistakes, she's always there. Help her, please. And in exchange I'll live a better life. More godlike and all that. And maybe it was a coincidence, Alba waking up as Xo prayed. Or maybe it really was a miracle. I'll live a chaste life. But the facts remain Alba did wake up. And I won't let a man between these legs again without a ring. Not that she'd let Xiomara know that. Okay thanks for hearing me out. You're awake! Oh, my God! Because sometimes faith needs a little nudge. My mom! She's awake! Okay? Do you remember the accident, ma? _ _ All right, well, her vitals look good, and the swelling has gone down. Oh, thank God. _ _ I think it's safe to say that there's no sign of any long-term damage. But we will run tests to make certain. Now, as to the other matter Oh. Please Not here. Apparently, it has gone away. You must have friends in high places. Anyway, I was glad to hear it. In this moment, Xiomara wanted to kiss Rogelio for what he had done. But then she remembered her promise to God about keeping her legs closed and all. Thanks for everything. A-as much as I'd like to take credit, this wasn't my doing. Hi. Well, I guess I can finally say I ""stayed"" at the Marbella. So, look, I, uh I talked to Rafael. I'm sorry, Frankie, there's nothing I can do. Nothing you can do? - If it's not you, it's someone else. - Wow. - What's going on? - I'm fired. What? Come on, let's get some breakfast. Mom? How's Abuela? Thank God. Hey. Going home to crash? Mm, can't. I got to take the kids to school. I swear, they drain all the life out of you. Oh, um but they're worth it. - Oh - They are They are so worth it. Thank you. I owe you an apology. I put you in a terrible situation. Thank you. I appreciate that. Can I ask you a question? Sure. I wasn't on that list. Of course not. Because of my stellar record as a waitress? Uh, yes. Because we're having a baby? It would be weird if I fired you, don't you think? Probably. I just have to accept the fact that things have changed, that I've changed, just like my friends said. You have not changed. Okay? You would have never gotten someone else fired in Frankie's place. No, of course not. But, like, in other ways. I'm different now. You know, I go to stores and I see babies, and I find myself trying to guess their age. What? I-I I do that, too. And I am always so off, by the way. Me, too! Oh, my God, me, too! Come here. Rafael Solano's prints weren't found anywhere in that room. But here are the patient records from the recovery suites. # # _ _ _ They were performing plastic surgery on criminals in this room. Changing their faces. - What? - Microscopic bone fragments were found on the floor. That had to come from cutting into facial bones. If you're performing boob jobs or harvesting organs, you're not cutting through bone. Oh, my God. The silicone we found could have been for for chin or-or cheek implants. Exactly. Then I found this in the recovery suite. Patient 3-2-0. Look at the two x-rays. They were taken 12 hours apart. Same patient, but you can see their facial structure is slightly different post-surgery. _ These were taken the same day the Serbian disappeared. Could he be patient 3-2-0? Talk to me, talk to me. Is he there? He must have signed himself out when the roads reopened about an hour ago. We have his picture we can send out an APB with his face on it. Don't bother. That is not his face anymore. I'll sell my jewelry. We'll be okay. I'd say we got where we are, and then the real storm begins. The aluminum windows should have withstood the hurricane. If they need repairs, we'll have to talk to the contractor, but I went over every square inch of the renovation plans with him. Nothing ever happens in this hotel without Rafael knowing about it. - Hey. - Hi. Are you ready to go see your grandma? Yeah. Thanks for driving me. Of course. What's wrong? Look, I-I'm I'm sorry to even ask this, but the passports and the phone that Michael said he saw in your safe, did he just make that all up? No. Not all of it. I do keep cash in there, and I needed an international phone when I traveled to find Luisa. And I heard that Michael was snooping around, so I moved it. Look, the guy's got it in for me. He's trying to get in your head, and he clearly has, because you are standing in front of me thinking that I might be some kind of bad guy. That I might have something to do with this Crazy Sin Rostro. I know you don't. I'm sorry I even asked. Please don't let Michael get between us. No. I won't. Remember when I said Luisa had been enjoying her time in the mental hospital? That was certainly true. However, she enjoyed her freedom much, much more. # # Hey, Betty, do you know anything about picking locks? Rose? What's going on? You sounded upset. I am. Rafael, it's your father. I'm worried he's involved in something criminal. Wait, what? I heard him on the phone taking five million out of his account and secretly planning to move to Allegria, his house in Croatia. _ I think he's going to try to flee the country. Whoa, wait, wait, wait. Why do you think he would try to flee? What if your father is Sin Rostro? Detective Cordero. Michael, it's Xo. Oh, hey. How's Alba? Much better, thanks to you. What do you mean? Come on, you're the only one besides Jane and Rogelio who knew that Alba was in trouble with deportation. This is Detective Cordero with the Miami Police Department. We need a patient of yours, Alba Villanueva. She is a very important witness in an ongoing investigation. Well, please don't tell Jane. She'll think I did it just to try and win her back. You still love her, don't you? I'm not just gonna give up on us. You know? We belong together. And I'll never stop believing that. And for as long as Michael lived, until he drew his very last breath, he never did. _"
"Okay, let's skip over the fact that Jane's a pregnant virgin. Who cares? Lots of way more important stuff is going on. For one she discover her father is a famous telenovela star, and Jane's mom was falling for him. Meanwhile, Jane has been teaching at a Catholic High School. And despite some initial hurdles You're selling coins with my face on it? No. Not selling. Distributing. Jane was in a groove. Oh, and she recently broke off an engagement with Michael, and she's dating Rafael. But Rafael definitely has some baggage. For one, his ex-wife Petra. See, she recently teamed up with his archrival Lachlan to bring him down. See, she was being blackmailed by Ivan, the man who knew her secret identity. Natalia. And she had accidentally taken him hostage. Problem was Ivan escaped, leaving Petra in great danger. And Michael was convinced that Rafael was involved with Sin Rostro, a big, bad drug dealer. And evidence certainly pointed to the Solanos. Rafael is definitely a suspect, okay? But if he's involved, I gotta think he's working for his father. I mean, Emilio is the one that financed the hotel. In fact, even Emilio's wife was starting to suspect him. Rafael, what if your father is Sin Rostro? But at this rate, we'll have to recap the recap, so let's just dive in. From a very young age, - _ - Jane Gloriana Villanueva did her very best to avoid conflict. _ What? You'll kick me out? _ Alas, it was sometimes unavoidable. - Do it, and I'll take Jane with me. - No. _ Oh, no, she's not. I'm her mother! We'll leave tomorrow. Luckily, Jane had her writing to help her navigate these difficult moments. - _ - It's a letter, you see, which she would slip under her grandmother's door late at night. And then, in the morning Dear mom, as usual I'm too proud to apologize face-to-face. But I'm sorry, okay? I was totally disrespectful, and I love you, and I really appreciate everything you do for me and Jane. So can we just put it behind us and never talk about it again? You know me; I get embarrassed. Love, Xo. _ Unfortunately, a letter wouldn't solve Jane's current problem. - _ - I just really want you and Rafael to bond, and I think dinner together will help. Hey! Come on, last cookie. - I'm pregnant over here. - You asked me to get on board; I'm on board. I don't need to have dinner. You're, like, 40% on board. And don't get me wrong, that is an improvement from zero, but I want more. - How much more are you looking for? - Ma. This all just happened so quickly in a really un-Jane-like way. Yeah, and it happened, and we're having a baby. And I don't want the fact that you didn't have this textbook family to make you go after something that maybe isn't right. But I think it is right. What? Nothing. Fine, let's do dinner. It's on. Tomorrow night. That's great. Can I call you back? What do you mean, âthat's greatâ? That is not the right attitude. - You have to crush this. - I will crush it. - Say it with conviction. - I will crush it. I don't believe you. I will crush dinner with your mom, okay? And there's someone here. Oh oh, yeah, sorry. We can prep later. - Prep? - You have a lot to learn in a very short time. What is your study style? Like, flashcards? Practice tests? I-I don't know. Gotcha. We'll do both. _ Sorry about that. I am scared, Rafael. Your father transferred five million dollars to Croatia. _ It doesn't mean he's involved in anything criminal. But maybe he's trying to flee. I I think we should call the police. Tell them what exactly? I-I don't know. Maybe he's involved in whatever's going on here, with the tunnels or Sin Rostro or whatever. I mean, it is his hotel. Yeah, it is, and suspicions like yours could threaten his reputation and ruin his company. We can't go to the police. Not until we know for sure. So what do you want to do? Look, you said he's out of town for the next week, right? I called the contractor who did our renovations. Let me just see what I can find out, but give me until then. We got nothin'. We're no closer to Sin Rostro. The Serbian could be anywhere. Which is why we need to put a tail on Rafael. Armstrong said no. We got the audit. We just have to comb through the finances. - Which could take weeks. - Family's powerful. - We gotta go by the book. - Mm. Mongolian beef. More like Mongolian barf. Really? - Not even a little courtesy laugh on that one, huh? - Mm. When you say something that's funny, maybe. I will make you laugh, Nadine. Hm? We'll see. I'll do it. I don't know. - I will do it. - I don't think so. Mother - Yeah, what? What? - Mother! You're supposed to be awake. It's your shift. Mother of God. I'm so tired. I can't live like this. - The door is locked. - Yeah, but if Milos comes Then I'll be too tired to wheel away anyway. _ _ _ _ Try to get some sleep, huh? Once you get your paycheck, we'll buy the plane tickets, start over Okay. I was thinking Beijing. I'm not going to Beijing, mother. Look, please, just let me ask Lachlan for help. No. I do not trust him. And so, I will leave you with these last words. âParting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night till it be morrow.â from Romeo and Juliet? The play we just saw? Oh. Oh. Anyway I thought it was appropriate before finals week to take a moment to thank you. I have really enjoyed getting to know each and every one of you. And go forth and be good citizens of the world. Okay. That's all. Wait. We got you a present as a class. Oh, God. Don't cry. I knew she'd cry. I won't cry. Even though you're kind of a nerd who thinks it's okay to wear âsensible shoesâ"" the truth is, we really think you're a great teacher. So, here. Don't cry. I won't. It's, like, for the baby. Okay, you should get off the bus. Mm-hmm Yeah. Hello? Ms. Villanueva, this is sister Margaret. Oh, oh, is this about the gift? Because if I'm not allowed to accept gifts, - I will return it immediately. -  No, no. This is because I'd like to offer you a permanent job. What? Another teacher is pregnant. We thought you could trail her until you graduate and then cover her maternity leave. Then when she comes back, you can take yours with the promise of a permanent position in our Middle School when you return. Wait, is-is this about the Jane the Virgin coins? No, Ms. Villanueva. This is because the students gave you the highest score on your teacher evaluations. They did? Are you crying, Ms. Villanueva? Yes. But to be fair, it's been building up for a while. _ _ _ Okay, great, cut. You can say it next time, Diego. Santos is a priest? It's a flashback sequence. He has since left the cloth and made love to hundreds of women. Okay, everyone! Jane is here; Gather round, please. Gather round. Yes. Wait, wait, what are we gathering around for? You will see. Friends, workers, as you all know, like Kanye West, I have recently acquired a daughter. What you don't know is that my daughter, Jane, is the new writer's intern for the ""Passions of Santos"", yes! Yes. I don't know what to say. âThank youâ is fine. It's just, I didn't ask for the job, though. You don't have to. Everybody wants to work on television. Can I talk to you in private for a moment? Yeah, sure. Nicolas. Everyone out! See you later, my excellent teammates. - Jane? - Hm? I am an actor. I am trained to read emotions, and you don't seem Uh, I just didn't see it coming. I wanted to surprise you, you know? And you're gonna be done teaching in a week. No, they asked me to stay on. Oh! But don't you want to be a writer? Yeah, I-I just never thought about telenovelas. I mean, I don't know if I'm gonna be any good at it. You will be good. You are my daughter. Talent courses through your veins. _ It would be kind of cool to try it. Don't let yourself get swept up by glamor, Jane. I offered you a terrific position. Just think of all the fabulous scenes you will write. Think of all the lives you'll touch. But writing is her dream. Dreams don't pay the bills. Geez. At least her see if she likes it. She already knows she likes teaching. Trust me, she will like this much, much more. No, she won't, you silly actor. Jane, what'll it be? - Teaching. - Tell her, Jane. Writing. - Jane? - Huh? So, what do you think? You'll recall, our Jane has always avoided conflict. I think I can do them both, for now. I don't want to spoil things, but It should be noted that Rogelio was bursting with pride that Jane had decided to, as he put it, ""give the family business a try."" Aah! You moron! Oh, no. Maybe we should just wait. Okay. Hi. Dina, hello, hello! We are here! _ _ Jane, so nice to meet you. I will leave you to get to know my brilliant daughter. Kisses! Mwah! So, you know, if you need anything food runs, just let me know. Oh, we're actually in the middle of a story problem for tomorrow's episode. Please stay. Steven, recap. Go. Okay, uh, Santos has just escaped, but obviously, he's still the president, so he needs to find a way off the island without being recognized. Any ideas, Jane? Because there are no bad ideas here. What if he makes himself a mask out of, like, mud and twigs? Except for yours, Ricky. Jane? What do you think? Go ahead, Jane. It'll be brilliant. Um I don't know if this is what you were looking for, but maybe Santos could be dressed as a beggar? Huh! El Presidente would never dress as a beggar! Because it would be unexpected, see? No one would expect him to demean himself like that. Hmm. Not bad. Let's put it in the script and move on. Good work, Jane. It should be noted that at this very moment, Jane felt butterflies in her stomach. And I'm not going lie. It felt like a sign. And they're putting one of my lines in the script. - That's great! - I know! I can't believe it. Favorite movie? Dirty dancing. One topic not to bring up? Selena. Both the singer and J. Lo's portrayal of her in the movie. - Birth sign? - Come on! You seriously expect me to remember your mom's birth sign? If it was in the e-mail, I'm gonna need you to remember it. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so stressed. I just really want this to go well. I know, and it will. Parents love me. - Mm-hmm. - I rarely curse, and I have excellent table manners. Hmm. Mm You seem tired. Maybe you should slow down. No, I'm fine. All this running around between waitressing and teaching, and now the telenovela You can't keep this up forever. You got to make a decision before it catches up with you. And our peach. According to baby center, it is now an apple, rounding the corner to avocado. Mmm. Uh-uh. Let's not lose focus. Come on, we're in the home stretch. Look, what's my grandma's favorite TV show? - Sabado Gigante. - I'm just saying that if we cancel with Rafael, you'll get to watch ""Sabado Gigante"". _ _ Ah. _ _ Because he wants to make dinner plans, and I don't want to see him. Well, that's not exactly true. Xo really, really wanted to see him. _ I made a promise to God, okay? When you were hurt in the hospital Of course, Alba knew this already. I promise if you take care of ma, I won't let a man between these legs again without a ring. But Xo didn't know Alba knew that. _ I know, I know that's why I've been avoiding Rogelio. _ Mm. We're here. _ Don't worry. But Alba was worried. But, thanks to Jane's careful preparation, Rafael was performing brilliantly at dinner. As I was saying, I believe that hard work is the key to success. I mean, as a Taurus, you must know what I mean. Persistence is everything. Hmm. _ _ You look tired, Hon. Where are you at with your decision? Are you leaning more towards teaching or interning? I don't know. I'm going back and forth. _ Ma, don't pressure her. _ - I know. - But, Hon, you want to be a writer. You said you got butterflies. _ Ma, if she doesn't chase down her dream, she'll always regret it. I totally agree. Anyway, I have time to sort it out, so Your mom is right. Life is short. We spend all our time working. It should be spent doing something that you love. Besides, all the other stuff the baby and the bills you know I'll take care of that. What do you mean, you'll take care of it? Oh, I was I was just agreeing with you, that she should take the internship, and she shouldn't make a decision about money. Because I can help out there. To be fair, Jane had not told Rafael not to offer any money. But only because she never thought he'd do something so stupid. I don't think Jane's asking for your help. Uh, yeah, I-I know that. And I know she's not gonna take your money. Mom, just calm down. I am calm. I just don't like the idea that he thinks we'll take handouts. That's not what I meant. We work hard, all of us do. I understand that, but I'm still going to take care of the baby financially. Good. You should. And if Jane needs anything Her family will take care of her. And we are going to be family. I'm the father of her baby. Not on purpose. _ Okay, he's gone. What was all that about? I could ask you the same thing. You guys were actually agreeing. You both want me to make a decision. And that's your decision? To let him pay for everything? No, of course not. I mean, if I decide to take the internship, I'm gonna keep waitressing. I'm not afraid of hard work, you know that. Rafael doesn't. Stop, mom. He was trying to be supportive. And yeah, he said something stupid, but instead of letting it go, you drilled down. I mean, what is wrong with you? Why won't you give him a chance? You know why. I just don't see you guys together. Because you're not trying. Why can't you at least try? You still love her, don't you? We belong together. And I'll never stop believing that. Mom? What is it? I-it just feels like being disloyal to Michael. What? You were with him two years. Yeah. But I've moved on and he's moved on. No, he hasn't. What are you talking about? Nothing, it doesn't matter. The point is that Michael was like part of the family for a long time. And I get that everything has changed for you, but You gotta give me a second to catch up. I get it. But that doesn't mean that you can be rude to Rafael. You're right. I'll apologize tomorrow. She lives! _ _ I came in yesterday. I called you a couple of times. Yeah, I'm sorry, I've-I've been A little under the weather. - I'm in a hurry, actually. - Wait, wait. Where are you going? - Picking up my check. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Petra, what's what's going on? Please, tell me. Okay, so this guy, Ivan, he's been blackmailing you? Exactly. And when he learned that we wouldn't be able to pay him any longer Well, we, uh We had a misunderstanding. She took him hostage. He escaped. And I'm scared he'll tell Milos where I am. I know I know this all sounds crazy. It is crazy. I feel crazy. Cooped up in my room, scared, just waiting for yellow tulips to arrive Tulips? Yeah. Milos used to send me them before he'd come home from a trip. It was kind of his calling card. That's why I've been hiding out. And that's why I have to leave. Let me come with you. - What? - Listen to me. The Maracay Hotel Group has properties all over the world. I can ask to be transferred. Why? Petra, come on. You know how I feel about you. Okay, look, it's gonna take me a couple of days to work out the arrangements. In the meantime, I'm gonna have you moved up to one of our penthouses. They have state-of-the-art high-tech security systems, so you're gonna be safe, okay? Look at me. I promise you. _ _ _ Is this a bad time? Uh no. No, uh, come in. Wow. Incredible view. Yeah. It was kind of a selling point of the place. Uh, do you want to do you want to sit? Yeah, sure. Let's sit. I just wanted to apologize. I was really rude last night. I overreacted and I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. Things just escalated. - Exactly. - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much. - She doesn't. - Let's just be honest. So we can get to the root of it. - Never a good idea. - Okay. I wouldn't say it. I just don't think you're right for Jane. Why? It's just A character thing, if you really want to know the truth. You don't know my character. I know you kissed her and you didn't call her back and she was crushed. That was five years ago! Still speaks to character. You're not being fair, okay? People change. Not fundamentally. And you guys are different in every regard. You see the world differently I'm sorry, but you have no idea how I see the world. Maybe not. But I know that you see it from up here. With this incredible view. I have to go. - No problem. - Uh Let's just can we ? Can we talk about this later? _ El Presidente, uh _ _ Note that Jane had hurried to the stage so she could watch them film the scene idea she had come up with. Santos disguised as a beggar. _ A pirate beggar? That's weird. _ _ And Jane realized exactly what had happened. Did you tell the writers to act like they liked my idea? Uh are you enjoying your new job? Rogelio, did you? Yes, I did. But it was to give you confidence. You said you didn't know if you'd be any good at writing. And believing in yourself is the hardest part. I get that, and-and that's sweet. But I have this big life choice to make between teaching and writing. And I'm just really trying to figure out if I have talent because that matters. Say no more. I completely understand. Thank you. So, write me a scene. What? I can tell you if you have talent. I don't usually read unsolicited manuscripts, but since your my daughter, I'm gonna make an exception. - So, theses are the plans? - Yeah. Signed by me, signed by your dad. What's this about? It's about the fact that there was a tunnel found inside the hotel leading from here in the recovery suites to here under the hotel. What? You had nothing to do with it? No! This is news to me. All right. Look at those bathrooms. Is that your work? Yeah. Well, not this one. No. See how the tiling there is just a little different. - Maybe a subcontractor. - Who? Don't know. Your dad could've hired anyone. Hey. I know who did that other bathroom. And for a small fee, I'd be happy to give you his name and address. So, I hear you're writing a scene. _ Yup. About a pirate. Just not quite sure how to not make it sound ridiculous. Oh, you just got to find something you relate to. At least that's what I tell myself. Oh, you're a writer, too? An actor. You know, your dad, he's been, uh, he's been really helpful, actually. Haven't booked anything yet, but I'm sure you will. Yeah. I hope so. Anyway You have to find a way to empathize with your character. Relate to the pirate. And so, Jane tried her best to relate to the pirate. But that turned out to be ridiculous advice. However, Jane did manage to write a pretty cute scene anyway, in my entirely unbiased opinion. And as she wrote, the butterflies returned. And speaking of butterflies _ I look stupid. _ _ _ _ _ I've never seen you so Casual. Yeah. I'm keeping it casual tonight. Interesting. You know, I'm not usually a fan of the whole âless is moreâ thing. But looking at you right now? Less is just Estimulante. Right, so I thought maybe we could order pizza? Great. And after maybe we can make love. Let's start with a pizza. Wow. That's a lot of garlic you're putting on there. - I just love garlic. - Me, too. You know, it's funny. Some people don't like to kiss after garlic. I don't have that problem. Working up the courage to tell Rogelio about her vow of chastity was proving harder than Xiomara had anticipated. Yes, more wine. That will help. Let me grab another bottle. So, listen, I did want to talk to you about something. Do you remember when we first met, Xiomara? Yeah. In biology class. You kept making those dumb jokes. You laughed at those dumb jokes. Yeah, I did. You look exactly the same, Xiomara. I mean it. I look at you tonight and it's like no time has passed. _ Oh! Oh, me, too. _ You have to go! Why? Why? Why? ÿQue Paso? - ¿Que? - Oh, my God - ¿Que Paso? ¿Que? - Go. _ Yeah, but I didn't tell him the reason, Ma. I just freaked out. _ Because I really like him. And once he finds out that, you know my charms are off-limits I don't know if he'll be interested. _ I thought you loved Rogelio. _ _ I can't thank you enough. I finally feel safe. You should. No one gets on this floor unnoticed. - The windows are too big in here. - Mother! Draw the blinds, Magda. All right. Call me if you need anything. Don't be rude, mother. He's the only person who's helping us. And I still don't trust him. Well, I do. And You're my mother, so you just have to get on board. I am on board. ""I am completely on board"" Ah! Oh, I see. You brought that theme back. Plus, you know, it's, like, a play on words. Because you're ""on board"" the ship. Ah! Clever. Truth be told, this was the first time in Jane's life that she had sought her father's approval. All right, I'm finished. And she wanted it very badly. - I don't like it. - What? Well, I'm sorry. You asked me to be honest. You said it was important. Ye no. Yeah, yeah. It is, but what did you not like about it exactly? Well, a pirate would never say these things. Oh, okay. I mean, do you know a lot of pirates or ? And second and most importantly, telenovelas are all about drama. You know yelling, crying, scheming. And there's none of that in here. I'm sorry. Are you angry? No. I mean It stings, but I wanted you to tell me the truth. I have to make a decision. I just really loved writing it. I-I mean, I got butterflies. Well, that is important. You know, passion is important. - Yeah, but if I'm not talented - Oh, stop. Every new skill takes time. You can't expect to be an expert overnight. Hey. You sound tired. I'm not. Jane, come on. You can't keep up this schedule. I know. I'm trying to figure it out. Did my mom ever apologize to you, by the way? Kind of. - No. - It's fine. It's a process. We'll get there. No, I just hate it when people in my life don't get along. It just makes me all anxious. Anxious? Why? I don't know. My mom and my grandma fought a lot growing up. And I just always wanted to fix things. I get that. But some things just take time. Yeah. Giving things time is not my strong suit. Well, then you got to try, huh? And don't worry, we will get there. We have to. Because I am not going anywhere. Oh, that's so sweet. Can you say that again for my mom? Look, I'm gonna go. Just text me when you get home, okay? Okay. Bye. Truth be told, part of the reason Rafael's problems with Xiomara didn't phase him were that they seemed slightly insignificant compared to the fact that his father could be Sin Rostro. Can I help you? Yeah, I, uh, I know you were hired to do the bathroom work at the Marbella. Who the hell are you? Just hoping that maybe if you could tell me who hired you, I could make it worth your while. I'm only gonna say this once. Get the hell off my property. Someone was just here, asking questions. Call me back. Who the hell are you? Oh, I'm looking for Andy. Are you with that other guy? Wha ? It was just a little Fender Bender. Honestly, I wouldn't have even come to the hospital, - but my mom freaked out. - Because you're pregnant. Of course you needed to come. The heartbeat, good. That's a good sign. You see? I told you. Jane, I want to tell you something, and I am serious about it. Oh, maybe not now. No, now. You are taking on too much. Between waitressing and teaching and now this internship, it's too much you can't do it all. You gotta make a choice. I completely agree. Hey, look at you two friends. And just then, the butterflies came back. Do you feel the baby kicking? What? No, not yet. It's happening now. Sometimes it's hard to tell at first, but my wife said it felt like butterflies in her stomach. That's the baby kicking? I feel it. Wait, uh, where, where? My turn, my turn. What were you doing following Rafael? - I know he's involved. - And you were told specifically to back off. But, Nadine, right before I went in, there was a guy making a call I wrote down the number, and guess who picked up. Plastic surgeon. It's got to be the one working with Sin Rostro. Redoing the faces. I am on to something here, you gotta believe me. It's not enough to believe you, I'm also gonna have to lie for you. Armstrong called. He wanted to know what happened to you. Can't you just say you don't know? But I do know. Just tell me that this isn't about Jane, that you're not spiraling because of Jane. It's not about Jane. I promise you. Okay. Okay. Xiomara, how's Jane? She's fine, the baby's fine, everything's fine. Thank God. Xiomara, what is it? First last night, and now as we hug. Why are you so afraid to have your pelvis touch mine? Here's the thing: I took a vow of chastity. - What?! - Yeah. I-I'm gonna give it a try. And, well, anyway, I-I just wanted you to know. And I don't expect you to stick around, okay? Because this is my thing. Of course I'll stick around. You are worth waiting for. Any idea, like, you know, on a rough timeframe? I'll keep you posted. Tulips? Milos used to send me them before he'd come home from a trip. It was kind of his calling card. Hello? Yes, this is she. What kind of ? Okay, thank you. Is everything okay? It's Michael. Jane. What are you doing here? I'm still your emergency contact. I guess. And I was here, too, so Is everything okay? Yes, it was just a car accident. - What?! - A minor one. It was nothing, really. You're okay? The baby's okay? Yeah. Yeah, we're okay. Good. What happened to you? Bruised ribs. Small concussion. Occupational hazard. What? I don't know. This. Seems kind of like a sign, you know? You and me in the same hospital. At the same time. It felt like a sign to Jane as well. Only, a different one. Michael, you're not waiting for me, are you? For us? Of course I am. I love you, Jane. I love you now, and I'll love you forever. And whatever's going on with you and Rafael, it's not gonna last. You're wrong. Really? So you're trying to tell me that, at the end of the day, that's who you see yourself with? Rafael? Yes, that's who I see myself with. Perhaps if Nadine had heard the words Jane was saying, and not just seen the look in Michael's eyes, she wouldn't have done what she did next. But she did not hear. I'll change my emergency contact. Hi, Lieutenant Armstrong. I have some information on Detective Cordero that you need to hear. Ah, irony. He disobeyed your direct order. What a cruel mistress. Good morning, mom! Ah, buenos día. _ _ No, I didn't. But I talked to Rogelio about it last night, and he was sweet and understanding, and he said that he will wait until I decide it's the right time. _ _ I know, you were right. Uh-oh. How do you know exactly what I said to God? I won't let a man between these legs again without a ring. _ Uh-uh, those were my exact words. Bueno. _ _ You what?! _ _ Yeah. Maybe. But still it was wrong. _ An apology letter? Why? Hey, you two. _ So I, uh, just talked to Rafael. And I made a decision. I'm taking the teaching job. Look, if I had a talent for writing telenovelas, that'd be one thing. But I don't, so I made my choice. Well, those kids are lucky to have you. _ What apology letters are you talking about, mom? I haven't written you any. Remember It was for a good cause. Which brings us here, now, where Jane walks with a heavy heart, ready to say farewell to writing, for the time being. Jane! Hey, Dina. Do you need something? I wanted to just tell you I really enjoyed your scene. - What scene? - The one you wrote for Rogelio. Nicholas slipped it to me. For a first time, you show a lot of potential. Wow, really? But Rogelio said it wasn't very good. That's because there's not a lot of yelling and crying. Trust me. I get paid to know good writing. Keep working at it. I'm scared, Lachlan I don't know what to do. Those yellow tulips, it means that Milos is here. I just don't understand what happened. I posted a permanent private guard at your door. I promise I will keep you safe. So I made a decision. If you're quitting, you don't have to let me down easy. I understand. Teaching is Well, someone has to do it, right? I'm not quitting. I was going to, but Dina She thinks I have talent, and that's all I needed to hear. You know, the baby's coming. This is my chance. I'm glad you're staying. But, Jane, this is a tough business. You can't look to others to validate you. If you choose to make a living in the financial arts, you must believe in yourself. You know, that's really good advice, Rogelio. It really, really was. All right She's staying on here. Perfect. In fact, it was advice Rogelio would need himself, in the weeks to come. Rogelio won't know what hit him. _ _ I don't like this, not one bit."
"Okay, where were we? Ah, yes. Our heroine, Jane Villanueva, was accidentally inseminated with Rafael Solano's sperm. Oh, and the doctor who inseminated her, well, it was Rafael's sister, Luisa. - Hi. - And honestly, things were a little rocky for Luisa since then. For one, she started sleeping - with her father's wife. And when she threatened to tell, well, this happened. You're having some sort of episode. - Fantasizing. - Stop lying. I have no choice. I have to commit her. But the Solano family had bigger problems. See, Jane's ex-fiancé, Michael, is a detective, and he found secret tunnels underneath the Marbella, and the tunnels are connected to Sin Rostro. No one knows who he is, but they know he's really bad. They're performing plastic surgery on criminals in this room. And even worse, Rose was starting to suspect Sin Rostro might be Emilio. I am scared, Rafael. And Michael followed Rafael to his meeting with the hotel subcontractor. Straight out of a telenovela, right? And speaking of telenovelas, Jane's dad is a big star, and he got Jane a job working there. Jane is the new writer's intern for the passions of Santos! Yes! But, of course, the telenovela had drama of its own. Rogelio won't know what hit him. So, let's see how that plays out, shall we? Growing up, Jane Villanueva was a good girl. A very good girl. But when Jane was ten years old, she did something very, very bad. She borrowed her Abuela's favorite earrings when she was specifically told not to. And she lost them. after a vigorous search revealed nothing, and a hastily-considered escape plan failed Jane? Young Jane finally came clean to her grandmother and told her what happened. I lost them. _ I'm so sorry, Abuela. I know what I did is unforgivable. Shh. _ _ _ _ _ It was a lesson Jane never forgot. _ Of course I'm not gonna forgive her. - But she's your sister. - Yeah, exactly. And there's history here of lying, of using people, of making selfish decisions. Look, I am glad that she is doing well, but we do not need to sit in therapy with her. We? Hmm? You just said ""we."" Did she want me there? Why didn't you tell me this? Because I thought you might say yes. Not cool! I'm sorry. I was I was wrong. No, you were right. We're going. She's the baby's aunt, family now. She deserves a chance to explain. - But I can go alone if you don't want to go. - No, no, no. You are not going alone. I will go. Well played. Sorry. Got to work. Hello. Martin. What's up? Petra. You got to be kidding me. What the hell is wrong with her? Well, there's a lot wrong with Petra, if you want to know the truth. You'll recall she was currently hiding out in a high-security suite because she was sure Milos, her crazy acid-throwing ex-boyfriend, had found her. Did you hear that? I tooted. Let's not draw attention to it. I'm gonna call Lachlan, see if he landed in Spain. I don't trust Lachlan. Well, I do, mother. What do you want? I want you to do your job. And right now, your job is event coordinator. And I know that because I have your paycheck sitting on my desk. Yet, for some reason, I was just informed that you are refusing to take meetings. - I'm a little under the weather. - I don't care. The hotel needs to be booking events right now, and you apparently have an appointment. So if you don't show up, I don't sign your paycheck. I'll be at my appointment. Hmm. Okay, here we go. Hey. Target run complete. Ah, yes, Jane's glamorous job. And now for lunch. As an intern at the passions of Santos. Whoa, whoa, whoa. There are onions. I specifically asked for no onions. I can scrape them off. Yup. She's living the dream. Jane, good. You're here. I wanted to talk to you, actually. _ Did your salad come with croutons again? Let's hope not. Sit, please. I have some great news for you. - Do you like great news? - Sure. We'd like you to write the next episode of the passions of Santos. - Me? Why? - Mm-hmm. Because that scene you wrote showed a lot of promise, and we're always looking to develop new talent. Plus, we're required by the guild to give some scripts to outside writers. So are you in? Or would you rather scrape onions off Steven's chili? I would rather write the script. _ _ _ _ _ _ Oh. Hi, Jane. I was just running lines with Nicholas. He's a very talented scene actor, as well. Thanks, Rogelio. _ Were you looking for me? Yes. I was wondering Did you make the writers give me a script? You got a script? Come on, Rogelio. Stop acting. I swear I'm not acting. When I act, I suck in my gut and I stick out my chin. You know, like this. This is just me. You really got a script? You really didn't know? I had nothing to do with it. That means I got it because they think I'm good. I can't I can't believe it! Me, neither! I mean, I made a vision board, but I wouldn't think it would manifest so quickly. As father and daughter, we will conquer Hollywood together, - _ - much like Jon Voight and Angelina Jolie. Only we will not be estranged. And I will be the much more famous one. I'm so proud of you, Jane. Nadine? You went to the chief behind my back. You got me suspended. And you followed Rafael when you were told not to. Because I knew he was hiding something, and I was right. - _ - He went to see a subcontractor the one who probably built the tunnels under the Marbella and the subcontractor called the plastic surgeon -_ - right after Rafael left. We know a plastic surgeon is working for Sin Rostro, - _ - likely changing the faces of criminals. And we're looking into the lead. You need to arrest Rafael Solano. For what? Talking to a contractor? Besides, if he is involved, he's working for his father. He's the big fish here. - And maybe if you weren't taking this personally - What? - I'm not. - You are, and I'm not risking my career because of your Jane obsession. - What are you talking about? - I saw you, Michael, there with her in the hospital. I love you, Jane. I love you now, and I'll love you forever. Oh. I get it. - What? - You're jealous of Jane. - That's ridiculous. - No, it's not. And I'm the one making it personal? Sin Rostro's got to be Emilio Solano. -That's who we're focused on. - Okay. And it was not just Nadine who suspected Emilio. His wife, you'll remember, also suspected the worst. Rose? I imagined you'd be glad to see me. Yikes. She seems scared stiff. I am glad. You just, uh, weren't due back for two days. I thought I would surprise you. Well, you succeeded. I have some good news. We are going out of town, just the two of us. Oh. It's just, now is not a great time It's a perfect time. Just what we need. Pack for a long trip. Scott's made all the arrangements. Just got your passport renewed, Mrs. Solano, and I'm _ packing for Mr. Solano if you want me to pack for you, too. Where are we going? Now, why would I want to ruin the surprise? I just can't believe Jane gets to write a telenovela. I'm so freakin' proud of her. She's a wonderful girl. It's clear she gets her charms from you. Well, she's got your beautiful eyes. She's got your full lips. Your perfect skin. Your incredible legs. Okay, I don't think they're talking about Jane anymore. Yeah, we really made a great one. - We could probably make more great ones. - Hmm. But alas, Xo has made a vow not to have sex for the time being. And I won't let a man between these legs again without a ring. And they are both doing their best to respect it. So do you want to have sex? Still, no harm in asking. No. Me, neither. I was just testing you.  Mm. Which brings us here, now, to Jane arriving at the telenovela for her first day as an official writer. I'm not going to lie. It was frickin' thrilling! - Jane. - Good morning, Nicholas. Dina wanted me to give you the story document for your episode. Thank you! How exciting! Yeah, you shouldn't get too excited. Read the last paragraph. _ Wait. What?! _ Okay. Well, maybe he doesn't die. _ _ I don't understand. They're killing off Santos? Yeah, I can't believe it either. But he's the star of the show. He has been really difficult lately. He's refusing to come out of his dressing room, and he knows we're waiting for him! He rewrote every one of his lines. Who does he think he is? I am the star of this show! I was just voted people en español's sexiest man alive! Now give me that cruller! Apparently, the network's over it. First, he demanded they relocate the show to Miami. Now he's costing them tons in overtime. And That's why they had me write the episode, so that it can soften the blow. Does Rogelio know? No ! I think they just told him. Hmm. Calm down. Just calm down. How can I calm down? Emilio wants me to go away with him. - You don't have to go. - Of course I'm not going to, but I I feel like we have to do something. I mean, what if he's Sin Rostro? I have been through all of my father's books, I've talked to all of his accountants, and there is absolutely nothing tying my dad to those tunnels. Then let's go to the police, tell them that. Do that, you raise suspicions, you'll ruin him. Rumors fly, investors pull out, you destroy everything, a business that he's spent a lifetime building. Rose, if you care for my father at all, please don't go to the police. I know him, and he has a lot of flaws, but he is not a murderer. This is outrageous. It's crazy. They can't do this to me. Okay, well, thank you. Your agent? What'd he say? They're doing this to me. Rogelio, I'm so sorry. But I don't understand. You know? I love this role. I love playing Santos. I identify so deeply with El Presidente. Tell them that. Look, there are some real issues that need to be worked out. But maybe go to Dina to plead your case, kind of seem humble, and maybe they'll reconsider. Humble. Oh. Well, yes. Excellent, Jane. I mean, that will be easy. Considering my immense gifts, I'm one of the most humble men in the world. Dina, Ricky, Steven, writers I don't know, good to see you. Rogelio, how are you? How am I? I am well, all things considered. Oh, yes. This is for you. They are mini muffins from a very famous Miami bakery. They're mini, so you can eat as many as you like without gaining your fat back. Thank you, Rogelio. Was there something else? Mm. Yes, actually. I wanted to see if I could convince you, uh, not to kill me off. Look, it wasn't an easy decision. I have carried this show on my back for months. I am the only reason it became an international sensation loved by millions Uh, I think that what Rogelio is saying is that he is grateful for this role and he cherishes the success that you've experienced together. Did I not say exactly that? It's okay. Just keep going. Anyway, I think you should think twice about what you're doing, because my shoes are impossible to fill. Again, what Rogelio means is that he would love The opportunity to continue to explore this amazing character that you've created. Yes, precisely. I'm sorry, Rogelio. The decision has been made. You're sorry? You know what, you will be sorry Rogelio no, Jane. They don't care. They don't listen. You can't have ""The Passions of Santos"" without Santos! Then it's just passions, and that show failed! Are you okay? I'm sorry. I just I know. And I'm obviously not writing that script. Thank you so much. Bye. I'm here for my meeting. I'm still feeling under the weather, but I'm here. You are so brave. He's here. This guy's got big money, apparently. He wants to book a wedding, so try to close this deal. I'll do my best. Uh, Petra, this is Mr. Dvoracek. Hey, isn't that _ Uh, excuse me. _ It's Petra. I had to see you. Please, sit. And then I will leave here if you still want me to. I promise. I understand you are upset with me. - You threw acid at me. - At your mother. It hit my mother. Only because I bent over to pick up a koruna. - _ - There was no ""only"" about it. I threw that koruna. What? Your mother always went to the market alone. - _ - But for some reason, on that night you were with her. I had to think quickly. As you were in the habit of stopping to pick up coins on the street, I thought it just might work. I loved that about you, how you used to stop to pick up coins off the street. Is that supposed to make me feel better? That you meant to throw acid at my mother? Yes. A little. I would never have thrown it at you. You never should have thrown it. Period. That is true, too, yes. I know that now. Natal Petra, I mean. That moment, it was a very low point for me. For my mother, too. Listen, instead of jail, they sent me to a rehabilitation program. I don't know how to say in English _ So I'm here to apologize. I'm sorry I threw acid at your mother. But she lied to keep us apart! Looks like someone could use a little more time in anger management. Can you forgive me? Are you okay? I'm fine. It's just you don't look fine. You don't have to be here, Jane. I'm not such a monster that I expect you to be my shoulder to cry on. What is it, huh? I had this abusive ex-boyfriend, and now And so Petra told Jane all about Milos. The acid. The koruna. Magda's accident. The reason she Well, you know the details. Jane was moved. I had no idea. You're bleeding. Oh, no. It-it's fake blood. I work at a telenovela. Occupational hazard. You should have seen her. She was so scared. Do I have to remind you what she's done? No. You have to keep your eyes on the road. Will you just please keep your distance from Petra? She is crazy. Maybe focus on the crazy lady we're about to go sit in therapy with. Ah, yes. They were on their way to visit his sister. Come on. Don't go into this expecting the worst. I'm not. I'm expecting what's gonna happen. I've been here before with my sister. Every time's the same. She's gonna start first by apologizing. I'm so, so sorry for what I did. For my mistake, for not telling you when I made it. And then she's gonna start talking about how alcoholism is a disease. And it's one that I struggle with every day. I'm aware of that. Don't get me wrong. It's a good story. By the way, she's very convincing. And I know now that I have to Constantly be aware of it. And I'm committed to that. Just don't fall for it, Jane. Wow. - _ - Well - _ - Thanks for saying all that, Luisa. And Luisa has something more she wants to say. Uh-oh. A turn he didn't see coming. I'm hurt. You knew what it would feel like for me to be institutionalized. Like her. Sorry. ""Her""? Who? My mother had a psychotic break and killed herself. And that's why I put you in here. I didn't want anything to happen to you. And you were delusional and you were talking about Rose and how you two were lovers. - Yeah, well - It should be noted that they were lovers. A fact Luisa had never wavered on. Obviously I was delusional about that. It should also be noted that Luisa would say absolutely anything to get out of the asylum. But you knew how scared I'd be to be in here. I'm sorry. I've Just had a lot on my mind. And what is that? Excuse me? If you tell your sister what you've had on your mind, it might help her move past her hurt. Okay, fine. You want to know, Luisa, what's been on my mind? The Marbella is swarming with cops, because Sin Rostro, a big drug dealer, seems to be tied to my hotel. And just outside of our dad's suite, I found a dead bellboy with a corkscrew in his neck. A corkscrew? And the cops seem to think that dad is somehow involved. Call me crazy, but I think Luisa knows something big. _ _ _ _ Are you okay? If I was sexy enough, they wouldn't have fired me. Oh, stop. That's ridiculous. You're as sexy as you've ever been. Aging agrees with you. That is not true. At my peak, you would have never been able to resist having sex with me. Just look. So effortlessly sexy. I didn't wash my hair that day; Not a drop of makeup. Maybe a little eyeliner, but that's it. Okay, that's enough. Stop looking back. You have to look forward. This firing could be a blessing in disguise. This could be the start of a second career for you As a movie star. George Clooney didn't become a movie star until later in life. I have always wanted to do movies. Well, now's your chance. TV's too small. Your face needs to be 50 feet high. And in 3-D. I have been told I have the perfect features for 3-D. Of course you do. Yes. So get after that. And believe me I hate this stupid chastity thing. And it is so hard for me every day Not to pounce on you. Oh, God! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's okay. Whew. I wanted to ask you for a favor. And I know I know you have no reason to do me any favor, but I wanted you to give this to Rose. It's an apology. I'm I'm trying to make amends. It's so important for my recovery. Please? Give it to her? Jane knew Rafael would not approve. She knew that he thought she was way too trusting. And she also knew she'd be taking the letter. Lachlan, it's me. I need to sneak out of here without Milos finding out. Call me tonight after midnight. And if you don't hear from me Never mind, you will. Okay. Visit an asylum. Check that one off my bucket list. I need a drink. You want anything? No. I'm good. I'm gonna go change for my shift. Uh, your purse is ringing. Oh, could you check who that is, please? Hey. What's this? Your sister gave that to me. She wanted to apologize to Rose. I was gonna give it to you. Great. I have it. Are you gonna give it to Rose? Course not. You know, she just wants to apologize. What? What is it? I just think you're being too trusting, Jane. It's just a letter. It's never just anything with her, okay? Luisa's motives are usually selfish. Or maybe you're being a little hard on her. I mean, she did seem really hurt that you didn't visit. - Come on. You, too? - What? Look, I get that she's hurt. I'm hurt, too. I put up my hotel as collateral for her medical malpractice insurance. I believed in her. I was the only one. And I get that you're the kind of person who's, like, - full of forgiveness - Hmm. But There's history here. And for me There's just a lot to forgive. Yeah. Hey I get it. You're right. Let me go change for my shift. Hey. How are you feeling? Much better. I have had time to process things, and I realize that I'm destined for bigger things. And I want you to write the script, Jane. Oh. No. No, no, no, I couldn't. If I have to die, I want you to do it. Please. And I want you to write me the greatest death scene ever. Oh. Ah. Is that all? - I'm serious. - I know. Hello? Jane. Hi. It's Luisa. I was just wondering if you decided to give my letter to-to Rose. Oh. Ah. You gave it to Rafael. All right. Pick up, Rafael, pick up. You have reached Rafael Solano. Please leave a message. Can we take a walk? Raf, please, at least read the letter. Please. I'm scared. - I'm scared, Rafael. - I know. I understand. Your father wants me to leave with him in two days. And you won't. Don't worry. Look, if we don't go to the police, we could get into trouble. We could be seen as accessories. To what? There is nothing tying him to those tunnels. What? What is it? Who the hell are you? Just hoping that maybe if you could tell me who hired you Who is that talking to Emilio? And he didn't want to speak it aloud, but he knew he had to. I'm pretty sure that's the subcontractor who built the tunnels. _ And what's your name again? Michael Cordero. Oh, yes, there you are. Well, the doctor will be with you shortly. Uh, what is it you're looking to do exactly? Well, I'm not sure. Um, I guess I just kind of want to freshen up my looks a little bit. Weird. That's how Michael thinks - he'll get Jane back? - You know? What would you suggest? Surgery's not gonna fix your posture. But you could use pecs. There's nothing really wrong with my pecs. Oh. It's the plastic surgeon whose number he stole. You know, the guy who might have been doing surgery in the secret tunnels. Dr. Moncada, it's Mr. Meyer. He says it's an emergency. I'll be right back. Take your time. God. Slow down, Mr. Meyer. What's going on? It's like it's all-all red and infected. At the site of the injection? Oh, come on. Look, Mr. Meyer It's like my whole face is seizing up. - _ - Latin lover narrator: I should explain. Remember this? _ Look, Mr. Meyer Now-now my jaw's locking up. Come on! Go! I'm gonna put you on the phone with my nurse. Hello, Mr. Meyer? Come on. Come on. ""That was too close! That was way, way too close!"" Ah, yes. Jane, you'll remember, was currently at work - _ - on the greatest death scene ever written. Yes, I know. _ Oh. _ I'm sorry, this is not working for me at all. See, this is exactly why you got fired. You're really screwing the pooch here, Jane. And I don't even know what ""screwing the pooch"" means. That's how bad your dialogue is. I meant it ironically. Exactly. You have too much distance. You have to embrace a telenovela. Fine. I will. _ Ow! What the hell? _ What was that for? I'm embracing the telenovela. Mi Amor. _ Eh. Not so good. There's too much pressure. Rogelio asked me to write the greatest death scene ever written. Bueno. _ _ I couldn't afford gold earrings like the ones I lost, but I hope you still like them. _ Ah. Gracias. And suddenly, Jane knew exactly how she wanted Rogelio's last episode to end. Thank you, Abuela. Jane, remember to make me strong. But also vulnerable. And sexy. Always keep it sexy. I got it. I got it. Nadine. What are you doing here? Wait. You were right. I went to the plastic surgeon, Dr. Moncada - What? - I had to check him out. We were working on that. I'm getting a warrant. And you'll still get one, but listen, you were right. Sin Rostro's not Rafael, it's Emilio. I have evidence linking him to the plastic surgeon. It's a record of electronic payment transfers from an account in Emilio's name to the doctor. This connects Emilio to the plastic surgeon, who is connected to the subcontractor, who built the tunnels. We need to get an arrest warrant for Emilio. Right now. ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times."" - Charles Dickens said that. - Mm. And it might as well have been written for this moment. Or the French revolution. Perhaps. Jane, your scene is beautiful. Oh, I'm so glad you like it. I love it. And I wonder who's playing my son. That would be me. Surprising, I know. But this has actually been in the works for quite some time. They're running an hour behind. Keep tanning. Okay, thank you. He's refusing to come out of his dressing room, and he knows we're waiting for him! I'll get him here. I just need a few more minutes. Just three teeny weeny little lines I'd like them to change, please. Oh, my God. He rewrote every one of his lines. Who does he think he is? Let me talk to him. Okay, the script is great. I'll get him there. What? Nothing, it's nothing. It's just the writers were backstage last night making jokes about your weight. They said they were gonna hide the crullers. I am the star of this show! I was just voted people en español's sexiest man alive! Now give me that cruller! And how did he land such a prized role? He gave a great audition. But I don't understand. Even if you wanted a part, you didn't have to get me fired. Of course I did. You'd always see me as your assistant. Plus, I needed a spectacular entrance. You should be ashamed of yourself. Your father was the one who told me to keep my eyes on the prize. I think you missed the point. Well, I didn't want to wait until I was 39 to get famous. I'm 35. You're not. Go away, please. Mm. Fine. I'll see you out there. Dad. I can't believe him. What a horrible person. Jane, if you don't mind, I need a moment to prepare for my death, please. Well, you're officially right. I'm too trusting. But I just don't want to live in a world where people are this awful. Funny. I was just thinking about the fact that I like that you believe the best in people. I come from the world's most screwed-up family. I'm just glad you don't. Well, you know why it's so easy for me to forgive your sister? Why? Because her mistake gave me the two most important things in my life. So maybe just read the letter. And then decide. Well played. Again. And back to our other telenovela. Milos, please let me go. You're not going anywhere. Action. _ _ _ What do you want, Milos? - Anything. - I'm holding the only thing I want. It's the only thing I ever wanted. But she doesn't want me. _ _ _ _ _ _ You think you could hide from me forever? _ _ You think I would never find you? No. _ And now that we're here _ _ together again _ you will never leave me again. _ _ I don't care anymore. I'd rather die than be with you. _ - Suit yourself. - Oh! No! Monster! Petra! You can walk, mother? You-you you just Oh, stop. It's just fake blood. You can buy it at any Halloween store. I should explain. Remember the koruna? It always comes back to a koruna with these two. Shh. It's okay, it's okay. I need to tell you something. Your mother lied to keep us apart. - I never cheated on you. - Stop this. - She's a liar. - No, she's not. It's true, Petra. She can walk. I don't believe you. Please. Let me try and prove it to you. You've been lying to me? All these years? Why? Why? T-to manipulate me? Listen, Petra, I Get out! Just get out now! _ _ _ _ _ And so Santos said the words Alba said some 13 years ago. _ _ _ _ _ And scene. Thank you. Thank you, director. Thank you, cameraman. Thank you. Thank you, men in cargo shorts. Thank you all. You were incredible, dad. Did you just call me dad? I think I did. I have this feeling in my chest now. It feels kind of warm. But also it wants to explode or something. I don't quite understand what's Forget the worst of times. It was straight up the best of times. But not for Rafael, who knew he had to read Luisa's letter. ""Dear Rose, I need you to listen to me "" Wait, what am I doing? Luisa should be reading this. ""Dear Rose, I need to you to listen to me ""because you're the only one who knows I'm not crazy. ""I'm worried for your safety. ""I was in dad's apartment the night the bellboy died, ""and I was drinking. ""I used a corkscrew. I left for an hour, ""and when I came back, the corkscrew was gone. ""I thought it was very strange. ""But now I know a bellboy was murdered. ""I have a bad feeling, Rose, ""about my father. You need to get away, Rose, right now."" - Rose Mm -hmm? You have been acting so strange since I got back. I am not acting strange. Yes, you are. It makes me think you don't want to come away with me. I do. Of course I do. Good, because I have moved up our trip. We're leaving tonight. What? Is there a problem? Rafael. Oh, I wish you could've been there. Rogelio was amazing. And-and it was just incredible, because I felt like What's wrong? I think my dad is Sin Rostro. What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? Here? Why not? Mm. Inside here. No. No one will see. Come on. Come in. Not yet. Oh. Where are you going? Rafael, it's Rose. Call me back. I was supposed to meet your father, but he didn't show. I I think he's already left the country. _ I don't know what to say. I I'm as surprised as you are. _"
"All right, we're back. As you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm, and, man, things have been a little crazy since then. For one, her father, international star Rogelio de la Vega, was back in her life, and back in her mother's life as well. Unfortunately, he was fired from his telenovela. And speaking of telenovelas, remember Rafael's ex-wife Petra? Well, Milos, her acid-throwing ex-boyfriend, came back in her life. I feel crazy, cooped up in my room, scared, just waiting for yellow tulips to arrive. - Tulips? - It was kind of his calling card. But Milos had other plans. He proved to Petra that her mother could walk No! Monster! You've been lying to me? All these years? Why? Leaving Petra reeling, so she took comfort in Lachlan's arms. Little did she know, Lachlan was working against her as well. Oh, and there was a murder at the Marbella. Roman Zazo was impaled. See, he was working for Sin Rostro, the bad guy who built secret tunnels underneath the Marbella leading to a surgery suite. They were performing plastic surgery on criminals in this room, changing their faces. Jane's ex-fiancÃ©e Michael found evidence linking Rafael's father, Emilio, to the plastic surgeon working out of the hotel. And it certainly seemed like Emilio was Sin Rostro; that is, until this happened. Rafael, I was supposed to meet your father, but he didn't show. I think he's already left the country. But the police didn't know any of that. So let's see how this played out, shall we? Okay, let's just go through the procedure step by step. Like most children of ten, Jane Gloriana Villanueva was not a fan of shots. Number one: Will it hurt? A little, probably. For how long? A second. Maybe two. Hon, come on. It would've been over by now. Can you count down from three? I want to be prepared for the stinging. Absolutely. But you do have to let go. Oh. Ah, yes, letting go. Something Jane was never very good at. Okay. And three, two, one. _ Mom, seriously. - _ - let go. Come on, you're crushing the baby. _ I can't help it. She's hemming your graduation dress. - I mean, all your hard work. - I know, mom. And you are allowed to be as emotional as you want. In two days. You're too early. Okay, come on, Abuela, can we finish later? I'm gonna be late to my doctor's appointment. _ _ _ This one's cool though. We get to see the baby in 3-D. And we officially find out the sex. _ I have to go. I can't be late. I need to go deal with the catastrophe that is the Marbella finances, so then we can go to Spain at the end of the week. Lachlan, thank you. After what I did, leaving you for Rafael, it's not lost on me, the irony. That you're the only person I can trust. It should be noted that Petra should absolutely not trust Lachlan. - Go. Go. - Okay. I'm going to relax, order some room service, maybe watch some almodÃ³var, practice my Spanish. It's Milos. God, he's such a pest. _ And he wants to talk. Again. We're talking with you here again because it looks like your dad is Sin Rostro and has been running a plastic surgery ring for criminals inside your hotel. And it's really hard for me to believe that you knew nothing about it. You know, I liked it better when you were suspended. Look, if your father needs money or a place to hide, he might contact you. And if that happens, we need to know. And you will. Because I was the one who contacted you when he met with the shady subcontractor. I've given you everything that you've asked for: Access to his accounts, his e-mails, and even my crazy sister's letter about a missing corkscrew. Rafael, calm down. Ah, yes. You remember Rose, right? _ Detective Cordero, you need to understand that Rafael and I are in shock. _ We agree that it looks like my husband did this, that he's a criminal, that he's run off, gone underground. Ha! Classic Sin Rostro. She did always love a good play on words. But truly, we had no idea any of this was happening. Mr. Solano, you told me to come get you at 3:00. Yeah, thank you, Scott. I have an appointment. I really do need to go. Excuse me. Stay close by. In case we want to talk again. We will. Don't worry. Spit it out, Scott. So what are you doing today? Mmm. Look, not that I don't love having you around more, but it's been two weeks since you got Since You stopped playing Santos. Don't you think maybe it's time to move on? What do you think I'm doing? Eating a sandwich and shopping online? I happen to be in the middle of a heated bidding war on eBay to take my mind off the heated bidding war currently raging over my acting services. Oh. Good. I didn't know you had offers. - Of course I have offers. - What are they? My agent and I are trading calls. _ _ What's going on? I didn't realize you were so excited to go to physical therapy. _ _ Okay, you've been through the ultrasound drill. This is the same thing. We'll take measurements, take a closer look at the heart, all the chambers. Ooh! It's a little cold. Can I request lots of pictures in advance? You got it, lots of pictures. So are you two gonna find out the sex today? Yes. You know, I was thinking that maybe we should wait. - What? - You know, it'll be a fun surprise. Well, there's no surprise. It's definitely a girl. - Then why should we find out? -  Because I need confirmation. You know, I am a little obsessed with planning. I like to think ahead. Bedding, paint colors, layette. Now you're just making up words. I really want to know. Please? Fine. Thanks. The answer's yes. Everything okay? The doctor will go over all the results. So is that not a yes? Do you see something wrong? I'm just taking pictures. I'm not qualified to read the results. Yeah, but, I mean, you've read a lot of these, so does everything look normal? I'm really not able to say. Well, if everything was fine, you'd say everything is fine. So everything's obviously not fine. I'm sorry. Only Dr. Hillcroft can actually read the results. How about you go get Dr. Hillcroft. Okay? This bright spot on the baby's heart is called an echogenic focus. And there's another one on the bowel. Now, I know that probably sounds scary. But let me be clear, by itself, this has no effect on the baby's health or the heart. So what's the problem with it? Well, at the moment, there is no problem. But an echogenic focus can be a marker for possible chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. But like I said, it could also be nothing, a normal variant. And you can't tell which it is, whether it's nothing or something? Uh, not from an ultrasound, no. Jane? Sorry. How do we find out then? We can do an amniocentesis. It's a relatively common procedure where we remove and test fetal cells. After the procedure, we'll put you on bed rest for 48 hours. And after the risk has passed, you're back to your life. What's the risk? Miscarriage. Statistically, it occurs in about one in 300 of these procedures. Sorry. I think I'm just a little bit in shock. I know it's a lot of information. You guys should take some time, discuss it, and let me know what you want to do, okay? Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh, thank you, doctor. Of course. Now, I do get booked though, so if you're leaning toward having the procedure, call right away. Jane kept waiting for the doctor to turn around and say everything was going to be all right. I'll talk to you soon. It's okay. - Do you think that we should do the test? - I don't know. How did this even happen? I mean, we came to find out it was a girl and get some cute pictures. We don't have to decide right away. Okay, we can think about it. Mm-hmm. Look, it's gonna be okay. And exhale. - I'll see you next time, okay? - Okay. Good afternoon. _ Ah. Now we know why Alba was excited for her physical therapy. Uh, if you want to use this, I'm almost done. _ _ _ Well, a long time ago. I need to practice. Ma? You ready? _ _ Scott, you did originally confirm Emilio's statement that he was in his office the night of the bellboy's murder, correct? _ But now you're saying that he wasn't there, but he was out on his boat? We're just a little bit confused. Mr. Solano asked me to back up his story, because he didn't want anyone to know where he really was. Why not? Because he was with his girlfriend. And obviously he didn't want his wife to find out. And you're just telling us this now, why? I mean, you don't go around telling people your boss is having an affair. There's a guy code. Shh! Stop talking. But now there's rumors going all over this hotel, people saying you think he killed the bellboy. He's a lot of things, but he's not a murderer. He was with his girlfriend. And you can prove this? Yeah. Here. Her name, number, private e-mail account he used. Contact her. It's all right there. All right. You can go. But not too far. We'll have more questions later thank you. Can I just arrest him 'cause of the guy code comment? So, if this checks out, Emilio didn't kill the bellboy. Yeah, but according to Rose and Rafael, the bellboy named Sin Rostro as his killer. Sin Rostro. Could be someone working for him. Not him, necessarily. Mm. Let's talk to this girlfriend, see if she can corroborate his story. And then we have to talk to Rose, see if she knew about the affair. I doubt it. She thought Emilio was working the night the bellboy got killed. _ I will, after you tell me the Silver fox on the bike had nothing to do with your running out of physical therapy. _ Then why are you blushing? _ I personally think that any man would be blessed to have Alba as a lover. What's going on here? Are you becoming a traveling salesman? Telenovelas are a young man's game and this this is what the kids are wearing. I need to stay relevant, Xiomara. Oh, good, your agent. Here. - Let it go to voice mail. - Why? What if she has a job for you? - There is no job. - How do you know if you won't answer? Because I just hung up on her a minute ago. She only got me an audition. They want to hear if I can do an American accent. - And? - Do you think Tom Cruise auditioned for ""Mission Impossible"" and its sequels? I'm not sure that's quite the same thing. That's right. I have 1.4 million more followers than he does. Okay, so think about your followers, then. I mean, how long will they last, without the joy that you bring them. That is a fair point. And a sad one. I've been getting tweets filled with sad-faced emojis. Exactly. You're causing them real pain. So go to that audition, nail that American accent, and then, boom! End of story. You're back on TV. I will think about it. Meanwhile, it should be noted that after that crappy doctor's appointment, all Rafael wanted was some time to think, as well. The prodigal son returns. Yup. Not happening. You've been pretty hard to pin down. Yeah, well There's a lot going on. You know, this really isn't a good time, so, excuse me. Yeah, it's gonna have to be now, buddy. We have some pretty big decisions to make. Decisions that cannot wait, given the circumstances. Mm. Danielle, here, will walk you through it. Let's sit. _ I won't sugarcoat it. The Marbella's in real trouble. Since these murders, the hotel has been in a financial freefall. Occupancy is down a staggering 42%, and now the banks are nervous because we're so overextended, and well Your father's missing. What are you suggesting? Emilio was exploring options of selling part of the Marbella. - What? - Rafael The Marbella's losing money. This cannot be coming as a surprise to you. Clearly, those offers have gone away in light of what's happened. Except for one. Look, this is not what any of us want. We need to be realistic. The Marbella needs cash to stay afloat, your dad is gone This company can help us. And they agree to be hands off as long as we hit targets. I-I will do some due diligence on this, and I will think about it. Rafael certainly had a lot to consider. Yet all he could think about was Jane. And all Jane could think about was her decision. No. _ _ Would you have an abortion if something were seriously wrong? Xiomara! What? That's part of the question, at least, right? Yeah, it is. And no. No, I wouldn't. Not at this point. But on the other hand If something is wrong, and I have a child with special needs, shouldn't I know now? So I can plan? _ Nothing. You're right. Nothing. And the odds are Something isn't wrong. That's what the doctor said Honey No, it's It's okay. I'm okay. It's just fresh. I'm not gonna do the amnio. Doesn't make sense. It changes nothing. And if there's something wrong, then we'll deal with it then. _ As long as you can let go, Hon. I can. And speaking of letting go Petra. You look beautiful. Or not quite What do you want, Milos? _ Come on, Petra. You know now, your mother, she is liar. She lied about me cheating to break us up! Well, you didn't have to throw acid at her. Yes, I know. I burned her cheek a little. She is fine. What she did is much worse. Pretending she couldn't walk, in order to manipulate you to take care of her for the rest of her life! Milos stop. This isn't going to happen, okay? Why not?! Breathe in breathe out. What about couples therapy? I love you, Petra. Milos! Stop. You ruined my life. Your action that acid it set off a series of events that have left me here, now, with no husband, no mother, no home, no money I'm trying to fix that. Well, you can't. What you can do, is go back to Prague. And stay away from me. I've moved on. Good-bye, Milos. Breathe in breathe out. So you're okay with that? Not doing the amnio? Yeah. I am. We'll just try to put it out of our heads. Sure. So I'll come over tomorrow after I grab my cap and gown, okay? I can't wait. Jane knew there was only one way to get this out of her head. I meant, sleep, Jane. Not the computer. _   _ _ _ _ _     Hi.   Hey. You got your cap and gown. You gonna try it on, or is that bad luck, like a wedding dress? Jane? I was up all night and I think we should do the amnio. You know, this way, if there's something wrong, then I can research whatever it is, and we could get the best doctors, figure out a plan, prepare ourselves - Jane - Yeah? I get it. We'll do the test. You're okay with it? Yes. Because it's gonna be fine. They do amnios all the time. The odds are in our favor. And then we'll know. - Okay? - Mm. Okay, guys, new session starts next week, so don't forget to tell your parents how much you love Miss Xo. Oh! Are these your students, the future entertainers? Yes. If you don't mind. Of course I will speak to them. Hello, children. For those of you with parents who don't own a television, my name is Rogelio DE La Vega, and I would like to talk to you about show business. - Rogelio - It's terrible. One day you' on top, and the next, bam! They take it away! All right. New session starts next week. What is wrong with you? Those kids are ten! I apologize. I may have let my mood affect my advice. I will talk to them next class. Oh, you are done coming to class. What happened at the audition? Apparently they did not find My American accent believable. Okay, so you'll get 'em next time. What happened to the Rogelio who fought for 39 years to get famous? - He's still here. - Exactly. And he will persevere. And it was 34 years ago. Hmm? Good. So call your agent, tell her to keep looking. Open up the search. Oh, good, I need to talk to you guys. And Abuela. And I know this is not what you want or necessarily something you would do, but I need to know, so I can prepare and plan. And, yes, there are risks, but it's also a pretty common procedure. You just need to sign here and here. This is a waiver saying that you understand all the risks involved in the procedure. And I know myself. I know I won't let it go. How is this doctor? I trust him. How are you feeling, Dr. Hillcroft? Did you get enough sleep? Did you have breakfast? I'm great, Jane. I had an omelette. Mm. When will you do it? Tomorrow. Okay, you'll take it easy for the rest of the day, you'll be fine for graduation. Well, no, actually. I have to be on bed rest for So I will be missing the ceremony. What? _ I'm still graduating. It's just a ceremony. You can't do it after? No. Dr. Hillcroft is going out of town and he's booked solid, so they're squeezing me in. Just take a couple of deep breaths and relax, okay? Are you nervous? A little. You know I hate needles. I just need to have faith. And I do. But will you come with me? We got a full house today, huh? Do-do you mind counting down? I just like to be prepared. Okay. - Here we go. - Uh-huh. Three Two one. What? An affair? It should be noted that although Rose was only playing the part of a concerned wife, her surprise at the affair was 100% real. Mrs. Solano, are you okay? Sorry. It's just hard, finding out you don't know someone like you thought you did. - Hmm. - I assume you've talked to this woman? We're working on that, actually. So the night of the bellboy's death, you told us that Emilio was working all night at the office, correct? Yes. That's what he told me. I didn't see him again until the next morning. I mean, I had no reason to believe he was lying. Not to mention, if the police thought Emilio was in the hotel that night, they might also think Emilio was the one who killed the bellboy. Right. Well, we're gonna go talk to her. See what she has to say. And, uh, I'll probably be back with questions later. Thank you, Detective. Hey. We're gonna need to move up the timeline. All right. You doing okay? Yeah. Dr. Hillcroft said that it went well. Good. Can I get you anything? Maybe orange juice? I haven't felt the baby kick in a while. If I drink orange juice, it usually makes the baby move around. - Okay. - Okay. You got it. For for now, you just get comfy. Thank you. So, did you think about my plan? Yes. Did you think about what I said about your plan? Yes. And I think you're wrong. I think she'll love it. So you gonna help? Sure. I'll help. But she's not gonna love it. Why isn't the baby moving? _ You felt kicks earlier, when we were leaving. I'm sure it's fine. Babies need sleep, too. - I hope so. - Hey. You just need to relax and try to sleep. Yeah, I know. You're right. Ugh, but I can't. Can you talk to me about something? It'll help me get tired. I'll try to not take that as an insult. You know what I mean. Just get me to stop thinking about it, please. Okay. Um I can tell you that I made a decision about the hotel. - I'm going to sell part of it. - Really? The investor checks out, his company's hands-off, and we need the cash. And I think that's what my father would do. Sounds like a good call. That all you got? What? Come on, I need you to talk to me for, like, the next 42 hours. Just so you know, I think you made the right choice with the amnio. Just think about how stressed you would have been not knowing. And we've still got five months of this pregnancy left. That's a long time. He seems to really care about her. He's so excited about this thing tomorrow. He was in Target for two hours. _ _ Can I ask you a question? _ _ No. It's about dad. How come you never dated since he died? I mean, don't you ever get lonely? _ _ That's not what I mean, ma. _ But why? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mom That's not your fault. _ _ _ I get that, ma. But do you think that that's what he'd want? Because I don't. And remember, I knew dad pretty well. And what I remember What he wanted most, more than anything, was for you to be happy. Look you don't have to date the Exercycle guy, but maybe just be open to the idea of an Exercycle guy, okay? I made a mistake. What? With the amnio. I shouldn't have done it. If something goes wrong tonight, or in the next - It won't. - It could. And it would be my fault. Like you said, I would have stressed if we didn't take the test, and that was about me, not the baby. And that is not a reason. It's not the only reason. I just feel like this was my first parenting test and I failed. I made it about my needs, my own anxieties, not about the baby. You also gave up going to your own graduation without a thought. Look, Jane, there's no right or wrong answer. Maybe. But would you forgive me if something went wrong? Oh, yes. Of course. And it won't. It's going to be okay. I hope so. Look, we can't go back. We're here, now. We did the test. You gotta let it go. Yeah. That's not exactly my strong suit. I know. I know it's hard. What? Wait, what is it? It's good. The baby just kicked. Oh, that's great. Yes, it is. I feel like you're judging me. You have no right to judge me. Miss Devore, no one is judging you. - _ - Okay? We just want the truth. Can you tell us where Emilio Solano was the night of the bellboy's murder? Yeah. He was on his boat. With me. And you can actually prove that? Well, I have pictures with the date and time on them. Selfies. Can we see those? Um sure. They're a little NSFW, if you know what I mean. _ Regardless, we'll have to get them verified. Did you spend the whole night on the boat? Yeah. Until about 2:00. He called his wife and told her he would be out on the water late. Hold the phone. Rose told the police she thought Emilio was in his office all night. Wait, so he told Mrs. Solano he was on the boat? Yes. Only he said he was by himself. Don't judge us. He thought she may have been cheating on him, too. She was always disappearing and not telling him where she was. If a lightbulb could go on over Michael's head, it would. Sorry, it was kind of dark in here. Can you take Miss Devore to give her official statement? Have someone find Rose for us right away? Thank you so much. It was all coming together for Michael. Rose had all the same access as Emilio. The payment to the plastic surgeon from Emilio's account? Rose could have done that, too. Why didn't we go there? Look, look, the letter from Luisa to Rose that Rafael gave us. Luisa thought her father killed the bellboy because the corkscrew was missing from his room. But that was Rose's room, too. She designed the recovery suites. Just wanted to drop off some ideas for the upgrade to the Recovery Spa. She planned it from the beginning. What is ""Sin Rostro""? She was setting Emilio up. What if your father is Sin Rostro? She must have led Rafael to the construction site where he saw the subcontractor. What is it? I'm pretty sure that's the subcontractor who built the tunnels. Rafael told us the bellboy's last words were ""Sin Rostro"" he wasn't naming his killer, he was identifying her. Sin Rostro. You're not gonna believe this. Rose is gone, and the room's empty. Oh, my God. _ Oh You guys, this is so incredibly cheesy. See, I told you she'd say that. It's not cheesy, it's sweet. Mm. I warned him. _ Okay, stop it, stop it, it's not cheesy. And I think Rafael is right to want to mark this extraordinary occasion of Jane's graduation. And as your keynote speaker, I have prepared a few words. Jane, it is an honor and a privilege for me to be here today. It's a moment that I've waited for the two-and-a-half months I've known you. I myself never attended college, no. Preferring instead the school of hard knocks, where there are no weekends off I believe I asked you to turn off your phones. Oh, it's mine. Sorry, yeah. It's my agent. I'm gonna send it to voice mail. You do that. It's my turn to speak. - Mom. - What? You said to save it for graduation day. It's graduation day. Okay. First, of course, I'm so proud of you. But that's nothing new because I'm always proud of you, Jane. I am. Of the person you are and the choices you make and the way you live your life, it's inspiring, I swear. And I don't know how you do it. And now you're having a baby. And I really hope that you get to have a moment like this with your kid one day, so that you get to feel the way I'm feeling about you right now. Mom I love you. I love you, too. I thought you said it was cheesy. It is, shut up. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ All right, so what's the secret to being a great mom, huh? Uh, I didn't have to do much, Janey. You were the kind of kid that the best thing that I could do was just let go and watch you figure things out for yourself. _ _ _ Mommy Abuela, that's mean. _ Anything? Still checking entrances and exits. Nothing yet. Damn it. We swept the tunnels and the secret room. - Guest rooms? All of them? - Yeah, of course. Stop! Y-you, rewind, rewind. Okay, right there. That truck backs up all the way into the overhang. If someone were to get in the back of that, they wouldn't be on camera, would they? No, I guess not. Is that a normal hotel delivery truck? Does that say Cutler Linens? Yeah, but the trucks are usually shorter. That's got to be how Rose escaped. Send out an APB on that license plate right away. Here I am. Hey, would you excuse us? Sorry. My God, I'm so excited to leave, I can't even tell you. Yes, so here's the thing. Um You're not coming. What? You never were. And I want you out of the hotel. Good news you're already packed. I-I don't understand. Really? Because I warned you. Karma's a bitch. And then you screwed me over again. Are you surprised that you could be outmaneuvered? No. I'm surprised you could be this awful. I'm awful? The way you left me for Rafael? That was years ago. So get over it? Is that what you're saying? Great news I'm over it. Ah, Petra. She really knows how to pick 'em. Hey, do you want any more cereal? Or any water or anything? I'm good. Just enjoying this chair. Didn't realize how much I'd miss sitting in chairs. I am just happy that these 48 hours are over. They were stressful. And now we just have the stress of waiting two weeks for the results. Let's really try not to stress. Part of my new parenting philosophy letting go a little. All right. Mm-hmm. I'm in. - And I will raise you one. - Hmm. In the craziness of our appointment, we forgot to find out the sex. You're right. So are you willing to let it go and just be surprised? You trapped me. What's your answer? Fine, I'll let it go. Really? No biggie. Especially 'cause it's 99.9% a girl. - I don't know about that. - Mm. We'll have to wait and see. So how much was it per night? No. No ocean view. Hello, Petra. I'll call you back. What do you want, Milos? I have to talk to you about Lachlan. I don't trust him. So I had my people do some digging. What people? Important, expensive people, but that's not the point. Whatever, look, Lachlan and I, we We've broken up. Not that it's any of your business. But it is. Because Lachlan works at the Marbella, and I just bought into the hotel. What? Wait, Lachlan said that-that was a-a British company. Yes, a family corporation. My family. I had them buy it for you, Petra. You said I ruined your life, I need to make amends. And you're just what, giving this to me? No strings attached? I did not say there were no strings. We will own it together, so we will continue to be in each other's lives. So What do you think? Hey. How's Jane feeling? Great. She's resting, baby's still moving. Great day all-around. I'm happy to hear that. It was a great day for me, as well. Uh, I took your advice, and I put what little ego I have aside, and opened myself up for jobs I was not considering. And I got an offer, immediately. Oh, that's amazing. I'm so happy for you. It's for a brand-new telenovela. I will be playing the lead, obviously. See what happens when you let go of things a little? Good stuff happens. Can I say I told you so? Yes, you may. Though, there's a larger issue. This particular show shoots in-in Mexico. So if I were to take it, I-I would be gone. F-for a year and a half. Oh. I see. That's why I told them I would think about it. There's a lot to consider. Okay, well It's still great news, right? Congratulations. Come here, you got to see something. Nadine, I can't look at any more security footage. Humor me. It's footage from the night Roman Zazo died. I remember. The ice, the splat, the blood. Yeah, but look at This. It's Rose Solano. Seconds before Zazo was impaled. She couldn't have killed him. And Emilio is right there with her. So the bellboy did it. Then Rose stuck a corkscrew in his neck to make sure he didn't talk. That's what I thought. But look. Also seconds before. _ So who the hell killed Roman Zazo? A very good question. Hey! Did everything go okay? Yeah. Great. Next question? _"
"Narrator: Oh, boy. Lots to catch up on. We'll start with the basics. Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated with Rafael's sample. Oh, and the doctor who inseminated her? Well, that was his sister, Luisa. Bright side: They'd fall in love. But happily ever after? Not by a long shot. For one, Jane's ex-fiancé Michael is a detective, and he's made a shocking discovery. Rafael told us the bellboy's last words were ""Sin Rostro"" he wasn't naming his killer, he was identifying her. Rafael's stepmother, Rose, is Sin Rostro, the big, bad criminal he's been after. Oh And she killed his father. (Screams) But Rafael doesn't know that yet. Meanwhile, Luisa was sleeping with Rose. We still have to tell my father - what happened between us. - What? My shaman thinks it's really important for me to just come clean. Narrator: So Rose had her committed. You're having some sort of episode. - Fantasizing - Stop lying! Narrator: Oh, and even more scandalous, remember Roman Zazo, who was impaled? Well, this just happened: Did everything go okay? Yeah. So let's see what the hell is going on, shall we? Great. There's an old Woody Allen quote: ""If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans."" And though I have complicated feelings about Woody Allen, post Soon-Yi, it's still a very wise quote. Okay, I made a decision. - _ - Ready? - Lista. - We're ready. I'm going to go to the University of Miami. Wow. I thought you were leaning towards Iowa. - _ - Yeah, well, I weighed everything and Miami makes the most sense. I can write on the side while I'm getting my teaching degree, plus if I live at home, then I'll save money, which will put me a little ahead on my five-year plan. - _ - You don't even have a plan. - _ - Well, that's not true, dad. I plan to go to Bora Bora next week. Bora Bora? When are you going to get your life together? Look at your sister. Even she is on the right path. Luisa: No, thank you. I'm newly sober and they say alcoholics either end up in rehab, in jail or dead. I chose rehab. There is no need to give them every single detail, Luisa. In any case, you need a job. No, I really don't. Oh, yeah, I'm definitely working while I'm in college. I mean, it may take a little longer, but I don't want to graduate with debt. - Then I'm going to cut you off. - That's ridiculous. You're lazy. You're unmotivated. By 30, I see myself tenured at a school, my first novel about to be published _ Definitely married but no kids yet. I want my life set up first. You've done nothing with your life. You've accomplished nothing. Can I just say how proud I am of you, honey? You are such a disappointment. - Thanks, dad. - Thanks, mom. - It means a lot. - It means a lot. - _ - Rafael: Wow. Babies need a lot of gear. No, they don't. It's all marketing, all right? They act like you need all this stuff, when really, you just Oh, my God, do you see? That little snowsuit with the little ears. We live in Miami. I'm not gonna register for it. I was just saying that it was cute. Hey, tell me about the shower. Do I get to come in and make, like, a grand entrance and play cutesy games or whatever? I don't do games. You know what, I don't even know what half of these things are. And the other half, I'm not registering for them - until I read a review. - You read reviews? I read multiple reviews. And I review. - Of course you do. - (Laughs) Okay, come on. Let's look at something we know we need. - Cribs. - Cribs, okay. Cribs are cute. - Yes. Just definitely not that one. - Oh, I love that one. Really? What's wrong with this one? J it the bars It's just so prison-like. But they all have bars. Well, then, I want the Orange is the New Black version. A friendly prison, where one has a chance to explore their identity. Although, we could just get 'em both. One for your place, one for mine. Narrator: And just like that, a terrifying thought - occurred to them both. - _ Well, maybe not terrifying, but expensive. - (Knocking at door) - I got it. Narrator: Ah, yes, Michael. Hi. You'll recall that, up until recently, Michael had plans of his own. What's going on? Did you find my father? No. But I do need to talk to you. About Sin Rostro. _ Should I leave, or Depends how much you want her to hear. Everything. Anything. Stay. Sin Rostro is your stepmother, Rose. - _ - Wow. Um Let's let's sit down. So how do you know that it's Rose? Are you sure? Narrator: I don't want to interrupt, but I do think it's important that you know what Jane's thinking. - _ - Michael: All the evidence leads to her. She's been running an underground - plastic surgery ring. - _ She's been surgically changing the faces of criminals. _ We have reason to believe she may have - altered her own face. - _ - If Rose altered her own face, - _ she could look entirely different. She could be Anyone. At least you know my father's not involved. I don't know that at all. Sin Rostro had a network of associates, and your father could have been one of them. What are you implying? I'm implying exactly what you know I'm implying. (Grunts) Rose didn't kill Roman Zazo and your father is still at large. So if he contacts you, you let us know. You, too, Jane. - Rafael: Jane? - Huh? Sorry. Can you repeat the question? I'm gonna need to talk to your sister, too. How can I reach her? She's at Haven View Psychiatric Hospital. What's she doing there? Um she had a breakdown. Claimed she was having an affair with Rose. Michael: You mean Sin Rostro. Oh, my God, Rafael I-I gotta get her out of there. All right, Betty I'm breaking out of here. Narrator: Poor Luisa. Always one crucial step behind. I am. I've had it. No phone privileges, are you kidding me? Just because of one little incident? (Calmly): This is an emergency. I need you to go to the Marbella hotel. I think my father might be a criminal mastermind and I'm worried that my stepmother is in imminent danger. Yes, I am calling from the Haven View Psychiatric Hospital. This is the key to my escape. Don't tell anyone, Betty. - _ - I have to get out of here. As long as Rose is with my father, she's She's in danger. Look, I know what you're going to say. Why am I trying to help Rose, after what she did? Putting me in here I should hate her for that. I do hate her for that. Yeah, I know. I don't believe me either. Xiomara: Wait, so his stepmother's like a real-life criminal mastermind? - Yes. - Wow. That's like straight out of La Reina del Sur. - Right? - Like when Teresa Mendoza turns into this huge drug queen and she ends up killing Teo Exactly, that's exactly what I was thinking! But I couldn't tell Rafael that. So what did you say? Oh, something about I'm sure his father will turn up. So you think he knows where his father is? - What? No - It's not out of the question. You'd hide me if I were a criminal. - No, I wouldn't. - I'd hide you if you were a criminal. That's because I wouldn't do something that bad. And you think I would? Example ""A,"" you have a temper. Rogelio: Oh, hello. Please, don't let my mood interrupt your good times. Hey, Rogelio. Dad. You're locked into ""dad"" now. Dad. Got it. I wanted to talk to you both about my job offer in Mexico. I am being pressured by my publicist to take it. So you're leaving for Mexico? I don't know. I-I also got a job offer here. To play the second lead in Esteban's Telenovela. _ Their ratings need a boost. Normally, I would never consider it, but Well, we've just connected. And I don't want to lose that. We won't. Look, I selfishly want you to stay. But if you want to go for your career I get it. Anyway, I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to bed. I'll leave you guys to talk. - Night, hon. - Mm-hmm. - Good night. - Night. So, what are you going to do? I'm not sure. What do you think I should do? Narrator: Here's what he hoped she would say: Stay here. With me. And here's what she said: You should do whatever makes you happy. What would make you happy? Narrator: Here's what she hoped he would say: You, Xiomara. And here's what he said: Neither option is perfect. Take everything up to the presidential suite. I'll be staying there for a while. Gabriel: Mrs. Solano Mrs. Solano, wait. The thing is - Mr. Solano, well - _ He's banned you from the hotel, ma'am. Hmm. Did he? And what is your name? Gabriel. Excellent. Gabriel, can you tell me exactly what he said? Great, as long as he got the money, I want out of this whole mess. And clearly, use discretion when wiring the last of it so nothing can be traced. So you think he knows where his father is? Just let me know if anything changes. Yeah. So we're all good. All right. Bye-bye. Hey. Hey What was that all about? Uh, Luisa. I have to get her out of the hospital, but I need the power of attorney. Narrator: This was absolutely true. _ - _ - I have to make another call about it, actually. Yeah. I have to get to work. Yeah, uh, we have a meeting, so - Okay. - Okay. - I'll see you. - Mm-hmm. Hello, Jane. Oh, hi. I thought you left. Oh, I did. But I'm back. What are you doing here, Petra? I banned you from this hotel. Hmm, yes, I know. The manager, uh Gabriel was his name, right? Yeah, anyway, he told me. Then I fired him. Consider it my first act as co-owner of the Marbella. What? Oh, didn't you know? Yes, well The company that bought into the hotel, Stanwyk Investments It's a family company. My old boyfriend's family. And, well, he bought it for me. So we need to talk about some changes, hmm? The hotel's reputation has taken a hit. And I believe that the first step towards changing public perception is to distance ourselves from the Solano name. Meaning, stripping you from your day-to-day responsibilities. What are you talking about, Petra? I believe the term is ""silent partner."" Shh This man, Emilio Solano, is potentially armed and dangerous. If anyone sees or hears anything So listen, we need to have a meeting ASAP about your shower. Okay, don't make a big thing about it. I'm gonna make a big thing about it. That's it. Just keep your eyes open. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. Jane, I meant it before. Emilio might try to reach out to his son, and if he does, we need to know. Great, as long as he got the money, I want out of this mess. What is it? - Nothing. - Jane. This isn't about Rafael or you or me, okay? It's about this. Ugh. Roman Zazo was murdered. And his killer is still out there. So be careful, okay? Narrator: It should be noted that Jane's first thought was Rafael. She really needed to talk to him. - _ - But then this happened. No one knows you're here, okay? - _ - Get some rest. Okay, that absolutely did not mean he was hiding Emilio. (Elevator dings) And it's certainly not like Jane should get the master key and break in. That would be ridiculous. And dangerous. She should definitely leave. Right now. But there's no harm in knocking, right? Man: Did you forget something? Jane. Michael, hi. A-are you okay? What's wrong? Nothing. You always look away when you're not telling the truth. I just was I was looking for Rafael. And you look scared. Is this about his father, about the case? Jane. Roman Zazo's murderer is on the loose. But I just saw him. Hi, Michael. Hi, Jane. Hi. What the hell is going on? I'm Aaron Zazo. - Aaron? - Yeah. I'm Roman's twin brother. I'm so sorry I scared you. I figured you were someone who knew my brother, but I didn't know who you were. Oh, yeah, no big deal. I used to have sisters that are twins. One of them has a bigger dimple, I think, maybe. Look, start at the beginning. What is going on? After Zaz died, I knew I had to find his brother. But they hadn't spoken in years, and I didn't know where to start. So I hired a private investigator, and eventually I tracked Aaron down to an orphanage in Mexico where he volunteered. But he had just been kidnapped by a cartel. Aaron: It happens down there. - They grab you, demand cash. - I negotiated - with the cartel. - I owe this man my life. He's one of the good guys, Jane. Why didn't you tell me any of this? Because the kidnappers demanded secrecy. They said they were gonna kill him. I need to talk to you about your brother. Absolutely. Satya. It means, ""all in pursuit of truth."" It's a part of my religion. I'm a Jain. _ I just want to know what happened to my brother. I'm sorry. L-look, I I was looking for you. But I ran into Michael instead. I tried not to say anything, - but he just, he knows me so well. - God. And I was scared. I thought that I just saw a dead man. And what were you doing even knocking on the door in the first place, huh? I saw you come out, and you put a ""do not disturb"" sign on, and you had that weird call earlier, and I just I thought that maybe your father was in there. - What? - But I didn't really think that. I just I couldn't rule it out a hundred percent. Because you don't trust me. No, I do. Really? 'Cause it doesn't feel like it. (Phone buzzes) Can we just talk about this later? I have to get my sister out of the mental institution. All right, this is how I'm gonna bust out. You know Dan, the hot delivery guy? Yeah, I know, I don't see why everyone thinks he's so hot. - He's so basic. - Anyway, every other Friday, Dan delivers supplies to our floor. And Nurse Chelsea - _ - I know, she's so tragic, she just reeks of desperation. Anyway, she's always flirting with Dan. So all I have to do is sneak by them while Chelsea's distracted. And then I can use Rose's brooch to pick the lock by the back door and voilà I'm free. (Screams) (Sighs) Luisa? Hey, you. What are you doing here? I finally got power of attorney. I'm here to sign you out. Great. Let's go back in this way. It's a shortcut. Ah We're all responsible for our own baggage. At least that's what I learned in the mental hospital. - Luisa? - What? Look, I don't know what made you change your mind and decide to sign me out, - but I cannot believe that - Rose is Sin Rostro. Come again? Rose, our stepmother Is Sin Rostro. Sin Rostro, like, that crazy big drug-dealer person? Yeah, except she got out of drugs and now runs a plastic surgery ring that apparently changes criminals' faces. You don't say. Wow. Sin Rostro, like, killed people, right? Only those who really deserved it. Lu, I am so sorry. And I believe you now. That's good, that's great. Okay. I ran everything by your grandmother, and we both agreed that this will be a dry baby shower. Apparently, we feel very strongly about this. It's really sweet what you're doing for me, Lina. Are you kidding? Your best friend throws you your baby shower, - that's the rule. - I know, but, you know, it's been kind of weird with us. Since the whole Frankie thing. Yeah, I know. And I missed you. So I missed you, too. Okay, we'll hug it out later, but we have things to accomplish here. Okay, did you finish your Target registry? - No. - Jane. It's complicated. I mean, where are we gonna even live? Do we get two of everything or one of everything? Hmm, I didn't think about that. Okay, we'll just say ""cash."" next up Party game. - Oh, God, I hate party games. - I know you don't like party games. You'll just fill this out about each other. Where did you meet? That'll be funny. Um, what's your favorite song? Oh, and, um, this is a good one Which one of you will be the disciplinarian? Rose: Luisa, there is so much I want to say to you but can't. So let me say this. I'm sorry that you were hurt during all of this. And I know you have so many questions, so I want to answer one. Unfortunately, your father is where the lightning first struck, where there were fireworks. Narrator: Sounds like gibberish to me, but clearly it meant something to Luisa. Look, you were right. I shouldn't have knocked on that door, and I should have trusted you enough to wait and ask you what was going on. But, I mean, can you blame me, really? I mean, with everything that's going on I mean, the murders and twins and mastermind criminals, this is not normal stuff. It's pretty friggin' crazy. Yeah, you're right. But even with all that, I thought that you trusted me. And I do. For the most part. Ah, yeah, see, ""for the most part"" Doesn't feel great. Yeah, but how can it be anything more than that? I mea I mean, I don't even know what your favorite song is. What? Nothing, oh, it's just this silly question on a baby shower game. The-the point is, is that I didn't know any of the answers. And that's because we just met. And I know it doesn't feel that way because of everything we've been dealing with, but it's the truth. We did just meet. And trust takes time. And you could have told me about Aaron, but you didn't. No, and I know now That that was a matter of his safety, but I wasn't gonna say anything. That's fair. We'll get there. Yeah, we will. ""Livin' on a Prayer"" that's your favorite song? Really? Bon Jovi? - Mm-hmm. (Chuckling) - Oh, no, no. (Phone buzzes) Hold on. Hello. Luisa? Are you okay? Hmm, not great. Luisa, what are you doing out here? Rose Sin Rostro, I found this letter from her. Read the last sentence. I don't know when she left it. It might've been when she came to visit. ""Your father is where the lightning first struck. There were fireworks."" What does that mean? We made love for the first time in a pool. Rafael, I'm pretty sure right now I'm I'm sitting on dad. Narrator: You know that feeling when you've been up all night waiting to find out if your boyfriend's father was dug out of a reflecting pool? Sure you don't want to eat anything? No, no, no, I'm fine. Well, that's how Jane's feeling. (Phone rings) Hello. This is he. Okay, thank you. So, they found him. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I, um, I need to make funeral arrangements and, uh, call a board meeting. 'Cause Petra's gonna try to use this to take control. - So - You can do that later. No, I really can't. I know her; She's gonna pounce. I got to be prepared. Narrator: Speaking of prepared, Luisa was ready to share everything. Okay, I'm gonna need you to tell me everything that happened between you and Rose. No detail is too small. Finally, a chance to tell the truth about the greatest love story ever told. It all started about five years ago. I was sitting alone at a girl bar, and then I saw her. She was wearing this tight red dress that highlighted every curve of her body, her breasts, her hips, her Got it. Good. And then she sat down next to me. Hi. Luisa: We could both feel it, that instant attraction. Can I buy you a drink? Gotcha. I am just getting out of the drug world myself. Of course, when she was talking about the drug world, she was referring to her former half-billion-dollar-a-year business. Yeah. I didn't pick up on that. I mentioned the red dress, right? Yes. And what happened then? And then we left. We just wanted time to be alone. So how long are you in town? The weekend. I'm trying to close this deal, but my heart's not in it. Narrator: She was trying to close a deal, all right. She was dating a man so she could use his hotel for her illegal plastic surgery ring, and her heart wasn't in it because, well, Rose was a lesbian. I really did not expect this. I guess you never know when lightning is gonna strike. And then she kissed me. (Firework exploding) And then there were fireworks. Narrator: It was also the fourth of July. Luisa: And then we made love. Raw, passionate, desperate love. Okay, then what? We made love again. - Okay, after that? - And yet again. Michael: Okay, well, let's assume you guys had sex a bunch of times. Can we skip ahead? I thought I'd never see her again. And then I went to a family dinner that night. It was a horrible night. My dad was all over my brother. You are such a disappointment. Thanks, dad. It means a lot. Oh, my God. Oh, good, you made it. I am so sorry I'm late. Traffic was terrible. Narrator: Ah, yes, the deal Rose was trying to close, it was Emilio. You're dating my father? Please lower your voice. (Stammering) What about last night? It was a mistake. I really, I do have feelings for him. I (Groans) It's getting serious. Look, I just, I I think I needed to be with a woman one last time, you know? Just Get it out of my system. Yeah, I get it. I mean, I have a girlfriend anyway. Her name's Allison, and she loves to have sex in bathrooms. Good. I'm glad. You have some Mashed potatoes on your shirt. Can I get a glass of water, please? Is that allowed? Again, you're not under arrest. You can have anything you want. Jane: So if you can bring my black dress in the morning? Sure, no problem. Thanks. I just don't want to leave him alone tonight. Yeah, I get it. How's he holding up? He seems Okay right now. You know, he's just making arrangements for the funeral and talking to his lawyer about business. Well, people cope in different ways. Yeah, I know. I I just don't know what he needs or how to help him. Well, just be there for him, I think. That's all you can do. I just I did something really stupid today, and I-I'm just worried that he's not gonna trust me enough to open up, you know? For some of us, it's hard, talking about feelings and stuff. (Sighs) (Phone ringing) (Sniffles) Hello? Rose: Luisa? It's me. How are you? How am I? You put me in a mental institution. You killed my father! I know, and I'm sorry. Narrator: Why are we only seeing her back? But this plan, it's been in the works for years. Oh, maybe she's changed her face. Before we met. (Whispering): Why are you calling me? Because how I feel about you, what we have, that was the only thing in my life this past five years that was real. And you once said that you wanted to run away with me. Do you still? You okay? Yeah. Petra called a board meeting an hour from now. It's a power play. She's got no shame. I'm so sorry. It really was a beautiful service. I, um, I need to go talk to my sister. - Do you mind? - No, of course not. - _ - Mm-hmm. (Sniffling) (Sighs) You okay? Yeah, I just I can't believe he's gone. I know. I'm so sorry, Lu. For not believing you. For everything. Thank you. I appreciate that. And listen, I know this is the worst time in the world, and trust me, I don't want to be thinking about this. - What? - Business. I don't want anything to do with it. I know, I know, but now that dad is gone, we each own a third of the Marbella. And Petra, she owns the other third. So, if you assign your shares to me, I can overpower her. Is that why you apologized to me? Because you want my shares? No, I was just Petra's calling a board meeting in an hour. I have to think practically, that's it. No, you have to think about the fact that you and dad locked me up in a mental institution. I know. And when you were sick with cancer, I was there for you. Look, things got messed up. Yeah, they did. Want to know why? Because of money. I meant what I said when I got back from the ashram. Money is the root of all of our problems, and I want out. So, yeah. You can have my shares. And if you don't mind, I-I want to be alone now. Thanks for coming today. It really meant a lot. Of course. In such sad days, it helps people to see a celebrity. And like you said, we are a part of each other's lives now. No matter what happens. So does that mean you made a decision about Mexico? No. Not yet, but your mother thinks I should go. - Come on. - That's what she said. That I should do what makes me happy. Would it have made a difference if she said something else? Perhaps. Jane: Okay, you two, we were just at a funeral, and if that doesn't say that life is too short, I don't know what does. So you two are gonna tell each other how you feel honestly right now. Go. Okay, mom, you go first. Rogelio is Dad? Right. Dad is considering going to Mexico. How does that make you feel? You know. No, we don't. Tell us. I guess I'd be bummed. ""Bummed."" Okay, good. We can work with ""bummed."" Why? His turn. Okay. Mom said she would feel bummed. How would you feel if you were far away from her? I would feel like Santos felt when he was separated from Blanca. Okay, now real world version. - I'd be devastated. - Why? Because I have very strong feelings for your mother. And I would like to see where things go. Really? Of course. Go on, mom. Tell him how you feel. I have really strong feelings for you, too, and I don't want you to leave. Then I won't go. I will stay and work on Esteban's show. But you hate him. And what if you hate it? A-and if you do it for me and-and you don't like it, I don't know, you might blame me. Never. And I will shine on Esteban's show the way I always shine! Even brighter because you will be by my side. Man: There has been an awakening. Have you felt it? Bueno. _ Seriously, was it that difficult for them to tell each other how they feel? _ _ _ Yeah. I don't think Rafael feels safe with me. We got into a fight earlier and I didn't trust him. Which hurt. And I get that. Bueno _ _ - Hmm? - Yeah. Exactly. So, how do I fix it? Thank you all so much for meeting. Look, I know it's short notice, but I thought it would be a good time to talk about our game plan - moving forward. - That's great. Luisa's here to formally assign her shares over to me. Which means I am still in charge. Actually, Rafael, I've changed my mind about the shares. Uh I thought you didn't want to have anything to do with this hotel. I don't. I'm assigning my shares to Petra. What? Are you crazy?! No, actually, I'm not crazy. Narrator: Okay, I should probably explain. Remember when this happened? I meant what I said when I got back from the ashram. Money is the root of all of our problems. And I want out. So, yeah. You can have my shares. Luisa? I I saw you here. And I-I Well, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Your father was always good to me. Thank you. I appreciate that. I want to apologize to you. We never got along. And that's my fault. But a day like today It makes you reflect. That's what my shaman says, anyway. You have a shaman? Yes. Uh I went to an ashram a few weeks ago. I know, I know, I know it sounds silly. No. It doesn't. Really? I wish Rafael would consider an ashram. He's so Misguided, you know? Luisa: Money is destroying your life. You're not relating to people as people anymore. We're all just financial liabilities to you. Luisa, look. I get that you are mad, okay? But, please, do not give Petra your shares. I'm not giving them to her. I'm assigning her my voting rights while I go to my ashram to think. That is crazy. There you go with that word again. Uh Look Uh, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take off. Take care of yourself. Petra: Well, I guess that's settled. (Door closes) So, let's talk about some changes. Shall we? From now on I'm the face of the Marbella. Narrator: To say that Petra was on top of the world right now, well, that would be a gross understatement. Hi. How are you? Petra had just made the world her bitch. Man: Uh, what floor? And then she saw her dead ex-lover. Roman? No. I-I'm his brother Aaron. Yes. Oh. (Laughs) Yes, of course you are. I'm sorry. Excuse me. You just you look so much like him. What is your name? Oh, uh, Petra. Petra. Solano? It is so nice to finally meet you. My brother's told me so much about you. (Elevator bell dings) I look forward to getting to know you. I talked to my agent. I told her that I'm staying here, working on Esteban's show. What did she say? That I'm stupid. But, hey, you pay agents to give their opinion, then you threaten to fire them, then you hang up on them, and then you do whatever you want. You are what I want. Well, you know what I want? (Whispering indistinctly) But what about your vow of chastity? You said you wanted to wait to have sex. Yeah, but that was until there was a commitment. And you just decided to stay in town for me. That's a pretty good commitment from where I'm standing. - It is not the same as marriage. - Narrator: Why are you arguing, man? Why am I arguing? (Music starts playing) Michael. You've got to see this. Where's Luisa? How am I supposed to know? She took off after the meeting. Why? Okay. After Rose sent Luisa a letter, we started monitoring your sister's phone just in case she tried to reach out to her. Well, last night, she did. Rose asked Luisa to run away with her. Your sister said no. About an hour ago, she sent a text to an encoded number. (Phone ringing) Yes? Yup. She's gone. I got takeout Chinese. I don't know what you like to eat when you're upset. But egg rolls are my go-to. Egg rolls sound great. Good. And, look, you don't have to tell me the way you're feeling right now. I-I just want you to know that you can. That you can trust me with whatever you're feeling or thinking. Because I love you. I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. Narrator: And in that moment, it felt like a telenovela again. But for all the best reasons. And I am so, so sorry that your father is gone. I can't imagine what you're going through right now. It's, uh Just hard. 'Cause I was a huge disappointment. No No, I was 'cause he told me. And I'm fighting so hard to change that. Mm. Good morning. Good morning. Have you been up long? Mm, little bit. Oh, I filled this out. It's our baby shower questionnaire. So we can ace that test. Aw, that's sweet. ""Livin' on a Prayer""? Really? You don't want to rethink that one? That's a great song. But I do want to rethink something else. Caddyshack? (Laughs) Filling this out made me think about our whole registry thing. Jane, what are we doing, huh? I love you. You love me. We're having a baby. This is true. So let's move in together."
"Let's have some fun: You'll recall Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated with Rafael's sample. And guess what? They fell in love. You know who wasn't happy about this? Jane's ex-fiancÃ©, Michael. We belong together. Also unhappy: Rafael's ex-wife Petra. But she was rebounding since she gained control of the Marbella Hotel. From now on, I am the face - of the Marbella. - Unfortunately, Petra had made a few enemies in the hotel, including Lachlan. I warned you. And then you screwed me over again. Jane's mother had fallen in love with her father, international telenovela star Rogelio De La Vega. Sadly, he was fired from his telenovela. But he chose to stay in town for Xiomara, even though it meant working under his rival, Esteban. And Jane and Rafael just had a scary doctor's appointment. An echogenic focus can be a marker for abnormalities in the fetus. So they got an amnio and we're now waiting for the results and I think they're due any minute. As a young girl, Jane Gloriana Villanueva loved asking questions. What makes the sky blue? Did Jesus have a last name? What's the deal with the electoral college? Turns out this whole electoral college thing is crazy. We're not even actually voting for our president. I know. We're voting for electors who are then pledged to a candidate. What?! Then why'd you ask? Because you've voted in two elections. It was time you understood the process. Ha, ha. Mom What does love feel like? Why? Just curious. How do you know for sure you're in love? It sort of feels like Your heart is glowing, if that makes sense. It doesn't. See, for Jane, every question had to have a clear answer. Is there some sort of test you can run, to measure the amount of endorphins or something? But never did an answer mean more to Jane than the one she was waiting on today. _ And in this case, there was a very clear test. All right. It's 9:01. They said that we'd have the results by 9:00. The doctors are getting into their offices, they're getting their coffee, they have to listen - to their messages. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I'm just going to call anyway. You know? Hi, this is Jane Villanueva. I'm calling to get the results from my amniocentesis. Thank you. They're gonna get Dr. Hillcroft. Hello Paging Dr. Hillcroft Oh, hi, Dr. Hillcroft, sorry, sorry. I hi, how are you? Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Hillcroft. Of course. Thank you. And I'm so sorry again. Okay, bye. - The baby's healthy? - Mm-hmm. - Thank God. - Mm-hmm. - I love you. - I love you, too. It should be noted that if there were an endorphin test, these two would score through the roof. Oh Okay. Uh-huh. So now that we know our baby's healthy Uh-huh? It's time to unpin, right? I should explain _ Let's move in together. Can we put a pin in that? I've been thinking about this a lot. And I really want to say yes, but I can't. I just had this order, you know? How my life would lay out. Date, get engaged, get married, have a baby. And, yes, the baby thing happened first But I don't want to just throw out the whole order. Or-or or rather, I want to, but I can't. Despite the fact that it would make life much easier And despite the fact that I love you so much. I get it. Wow. Whoa. That was incredible. Thank you. But I can't take all the credit. - Rogelio - Mm Yeah. We talked about this. Oh yes, yes. I'm sorry. You were incredible, too. You're such a weirdo. It is the costumer from ""PasiÃ³n IntergalÃ¡ctica"". Hello. This is Rogelio De La Vega or should I say Juan Rodrigo Castillo, Interplanetary Detective? Yes, excellent. I'll be there. And don't worry, I'm very easy to dress. Everything looks good on me. Except peach. I don't pop in peach. Okay. Great. Thank you. They seem very excited to see me. So how do you feel about working under Esteban? Excellent. It's a great role. I mean, sure, it's not the lead, but my jurisdiction covers 147 planets in four different star systems. So you're not putting on a show just for me? No. I'm not. I must go. I'm late for a seaweed soak and sauna. - Care to join me? - Maybe another time. Okay. I will be live-tweeting from the Spa follow my feed. _ _ Oh, baby. - Jane. - Oh, hey. - Hi. So, listen Oh, sorry. - Okay. See you later. Oh. I just I wanted to tell you something. Um, I just saw Angelique Harper checking in. What?! Here?! - Yes. - Seriously? Like, five minutes ago. Oh, my God. _ Really? Frontier lust? You cannot judge it by its title. Or by its cover. Okay. Look at these two. Is this  Really how it's They're representing life on the Frontier? How would you know what life on the frontier was like? You weren't there. Just admit the books are cheesy. Angelique Harper is not cheesy, all right? She writes beautiful, sweeping, romantic, epic love stories Why are you laughing? Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that Angelique was here. And to remind you that stalking is a crime. Florida Penal Code section 784. Don't worry, Detective. I'm gonna play it cool. Angelique Harper is staying at the Marbella! You like her? I love her love, love, love her! And she's staying here, at this very hotel what are the odds? I mean, we do host a lot of authors, so Rhetorical question. Well She does have this private reading tonight. - Do you want to ? - Yes. I'm definitely going. And I'll ask her to read my first chapter. You know, just for advice. And maybe I'll get discovered because she's so blown away by my writing. Or not. - But maybe. - Okay. But I hear she's pretty private. So Maybe don't accost her. I would never. Okay, I would. I could. But I promise I won't. That's why I'm getting it out, here and now. I'm gonna meet Angelique Harper. That's gonna happen! Yes. Look at me. Look at my feet. They're doing them on their own. Okay, I'm leaving. Yes. Mwah. Yeah! - Oh. Hey. - Oh, uh, here. Scott, come in. _ How's life with Petra? _ Soul-crushing, frankly. - I'm sorry to hear that. - And, look, she would kill me if she knew I was here, but, uh, I wanted to tell you Lachlan's been calling. And I overheard Petra say that she's not returning his phone calls because she wanted to fire him in person. Petra. Petra, hold on. You can't fire Lachlan. Just Look at his contract. If you fire him, he gets a million dollar buyout. Don't worry. I know how to handle Lachlan. Petra, hold on. Wait, you need me. You can't run this hotel alone. Watch me. ""She slammed the door and pushed her lover against the wall "" Inspired by Angelique's arrival, - _ -Jane threw herself into her writing - _ - with a renewed energy and passion. _ And when Jane's writing was flowing, it was as if she had been transformed into another person a woman named Juana. I'd like to tell you what she'd written, but I'm feeling a little self-conscious. I will say this: She writes it very well. _   Thank you all so much for coming. I am very excited to be here. We love you, Angelique! I love you, too! Now zip it. So, tonight, I'd like to do a reading of a new novel I'm working on. A sneak peek, if you will. So, without further ado ""The night ""whistled with promise. ""Of music. Of romance. ""Of magic. ""At least, that's what Jane thought. ""As she sat in the crowd of the reading, ""Jane felt that she was on the cusp of something. ""Something that could change her life. ""And so without knowing why just yet, she stood up."" Stand up, Jane. Stand, Jane! This is not a fantasy thing. Jane? I'm serious! Get your butt up! ""Suddenly ""Jane saw him approaching. Her one true love."" What are you doing? I'm proposing. Jane I know that romance novels are all about fate and destiny. But I don't think there's ever been one written that could come anywhere close to our story. If there were ever two people who were just destined to be together It's us. Jane? Will you marry me? Can we talk in private? So, just to recap: Rafael has just proposed to Jane in the most romantic way, in front of a hundred people. And Jane's response was ""Can we talk in private?"" I'm sorry. I just didn't expect this. Yeah, proposals are usually surprises. I know that. But there are usually discussions first. Well, I mean, with all the hinting? What ""hinting""? Uh-oh. I think I know what's going on here. When we talked about moving in? You were hinting about getting engaged? See, I recently watched a few episodes of a premium cable drama that touches on subjectivity. _ I just have this order, you know? Date, engaged Get married, then have a baby. And just because this baby thing happened first, I don't want to throw out the whole order. Or rather, I do. I really, really want to. Yeah, guys hear what they want to hear. Okay. So I misinterpreted. But it got me here. And like I said in my proposal, it just feels meant to be. Doesn't it? Jane, life is short. And we found each other. So let's not waste time. Marry me. _ - I told him I would think about it. - Think about what? You've known each other for less than six months. I know. It's too quick, right? I mean, that-that's what I was thinking. _ _ I know. I was thinking about that, too. _ Really, ma? _ Because they hardly know each other? _ What do you mean what do I know? I know a lot of stuff! Petra. Lachlan. You look the same. And you wear money well, as always. Well, let's get on with it. We both know you wanted me back here, so you could fire me in person. No, I'm not gonna fire you. If I fire you, you get a payout. I brought you back here to work. Unless, of course, you'd like to quit. Someone's in there. Said you were expecting him? Aaron, hello. _ _ Look, this really isn't a great time. I know, and I'm sorry to bother you. I understand it's painful. But I'm just looking for a little res Don't move! Spider. You almost stepped on him. On the spider? Yes. I'm a Jain. ""A Jane""? What Jane? Our Jane? Jainism it's my faith. _ It's an Indian religion rooted in nonviolence. ""Nonviolence"""" to-to bugs? To all living creatures. Wow. You're Really different than your brother. Which is why we didn't speak for a long time. Petra, look. I know you were having an affair with him. Please. I hold no judgment. But I would like to hear more about his last days. I don't even know where his remains are. They're respectfully scattered. Hmm. Please, let's have a meal and talk about Roman. For closure. This is ridiculous. I play hard-boiled Interplanetary Detective Castillo. How is anyone going to take me seriously - if I wear these ridiculous ?! - I'm sorry. Is there a problem? _ Well, actually, there is. You see, my costume is peach. I don't pop in peach. That was a creative decision. I happen to pop against peach. _ Found what? _ _ Ma, you gotta be kidding. ""how to know if he's the one."" _ Ma, this thing is from the middle ages. _ _ _ ""Does he give you ample allowance?"" Mm-hmm. ""Does he ?"" ""does he eat what you serve him without complaint?"" Oh, my God, this is hilarious. I told you. So stupid. Oh does he help you clean the cave? Do you ride dinosaurs together? _ _ _ _ Yes, he is. Mm-hmm. _ _ - He's incredibly kind. - Mm. _ _ _ Gym's closed. Already worked out today chest and arms. I have a proposal for you. Not interested. You know the old saying, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend""? I thought for sure Petra would screw up and fire me, send me off into the sunset with my golden parachute. I assume you told her not to do it. It's in my best interest that the Marbella succeed. We can't afford to take a million-dollar hit. Then use me. I know this business better than anyone. Frankly, the Marbella stands a much better chance under our leadership than under Petra's. Petra has the controlling shares. Yes and I have this. Camera work's a little sloppy, but you get the idea. _ Turn-turn that off, man. What is wrong with you? My point is, I threaten to release this the Marbella Hotel has a board of conservatives who already doubt Petra's business savvy. If this got out, not only would it be humiliating, but it would also discredit her completely. What I'm proposing to you is that we use this to blackmail her into reinstating you. And once you're in power We release it anyway, and get her off the board for good. It should be noted that one question kept running through Jane's mind. _ Two questions, actually. _ Jane. Oh. Hi. _ Sorry. This was your food truck originally, so, you should have custody of it. - It's okay. - Good, 'cause I was having a craving. It's fine. It's fine. Uh, Alex, another Cubano. - Jane! - Hey, Alex. So this is why I haven't seen you! A baby! - Oh, yeah. - Now it's all making sense. This is why the wedding was postponed. Fiona, get over here! - Well, no, it's not exactly like that. - They're having a baby. - No, you - Oh, my Goodness - It's not really like that. - Hey, no, we're actually not. We're not And so, it's like We're not having a baby! I'm having a baby. Um, I'm just with somebody else. I'll get those Cubanos. So, did you attack Angelique and give her your manuscript? Not yet, and I take issue with ""attack."" ""as she watched him toss his cowboy hat on the floor - _ - ""and stride over, the feeling was overwhelming. She needed him."" - Oh. - ""she needed him in a way ""she had never needed anything. ""She needed his hands ""on her body, his lips on her mouth"""" Admit it. You're totally getting into this. Oh, I am most definitely into this But it is not because of the story. - Two Cubanos. -  Thank you. - Oh, here let me pay. - No, I got it. - It no, it's - I got it. Thank you. - No problem. - Oh. Uh oh Okay, I'll see you soon. Okay, see ya. Quite sad. Also sad Xiomara, because she still hadn't gotten a visit from Aunt Flo. Your door wasn't locked. It shouldn't be unlocked. Also sad Rogelio, after playing second fiddle to Esteban all day. Well, how'd it go? Not that he'd let Xiomara know that. In a word magnificent. Turns out I'm equally talented in outer space as I am here on Earth. What's the matter? It's nothing. Xiomara, I thought we're going to be honest about our feelings. I'm a little late. And I missed a pill or two this month. And I'm worried I might be pregnant. Wow. Is that all you have to say? No. No. While unexpected, it would be a blessing, Xiomara. Really? Is that how you feel? Gotcha! What?! You should have seen your face. Xiomara, are you serious? Holy crap! I was freaking out. Freaking thank Thank God, because this would have been a disaster. - I knew it! - What? I knew you didn't feel like it was a blessing. I actually might be pregnant. What?! You were testing me? I thought we were gonna be honest about our feelings. Going to be honest? You told me you were on the pill. Were you trying to trap me? Trap you? Are you serious? You are free to walk out that door any time you want. Good, then maybe I will. Great, then maybe you should. Maybe I will. You already said that. I'm repeating myself. For emphasis. Meanwhile, across town, another test was about to be administered. Oh, man, it's hard not to get all Carrie Bradshaw. Anyway, observe Jane and Rafael At the beach. Thanks for meeting me. I know you're busy today. Eh, it's just all normal hotel craziness. It can wait. - And you said you wanted to talk. - Yes. But not about the proposal. I know, I got your text. Just didn't want you coming and expecting That you had made a decision about whether or not you wanted to marry me? I get it. Still thinking. Yeah, I've been thinking about a lot of things, actually. _ I mean, like, what's my life gonna look like after the baby? What's my plan? And I really think I need to kind of take time off from everything else. You know, and just focus on being a great mom. And after a few years, I'll get back to writing and all that. What do you think? _ Of course, if that's what you want. _ - Hold on. - What? I was trying to be supportive, but that makes no sense to me. You've been dreaming about becoming a writer since the day that I met you. Why would you give that up? _ I'm really glad you said that. You passed the test. - The test? - Oy. Yeah, it was this quiz that my grandmother gave me. She took it before she decided to marry my grandfather. She thought it would help me out. Well, look, I know that it's silly, but it's you know, like, there's a lot of things I need to sort out. Gotcha. So you, uh Anything else that I can answer for you? - Like a blood test or urinalysis or something? - Stop. You know, there's also a question about overreacting. Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm hurt. I want to marry you. And I don't need a test to prove it. I'm sorry. This is just not the way that I saw my proposal going. We'll talk later. I'm gonna get back to work. In that moment, Jane wanted to toss her fears aside and fling herself into his arms. Stop! My love You are all I need. Of course I'll marry you. Juana you are the very air I breathe.   But, alas, that was the stuff of romance novels And not real life at all. Petra told herself that there was no need to be nervous. After all, it was just dinner with her murdered ex-lover's identical twin brother. I took the liberty of ordering a few dishes. Thank you. It's vegan. I really appreciate it. I'm, uh I'm just a bit hungry, so Oh. Are we supposed to pray or something first? Uh, no. I'm sorry, I don't eat root vegetables. When tubers are uprooted, the whole plant dies, along with countless microorganisms. But, please, you enjoy it. No, seriously. No judgment. One of Jainism'ÂÂs tenets. Mm. Thank you for sitting with me, Petra. It means a lot. I know Roman was closer to you than anyone. Look Our relationship, it, um Definitely wasn't perfect. I'd imagine. Since he wanted to marry you and you were already married. Your brother was there for me at a time when I needed him. I found myself falling for him. But in the end, when Rafael agreed to give it another try, well I just loved him more. Can I ask you a question? Yes, of course. I was going through some of Roman's belongings, and something is missing a family heirloom. Uh, my mother's necklace. It's all I have - of her and - I have it. Roman, uh, well, he gave it to me before he died. Really? I can get it to you. Oh, you should've seen Rafael's face, Luca. - He was so crushed. - Well, yeah. He poured his heart out, and you stomped all over it. - Not helping. - Um - I'm about to. - Hmm? Angelique Harper. Two o'clock. Hand it over. Go, go, go, go, go. Come on, Jane. You got this. For the hundredth time, the answer is no! Now you've put me in a foul mood. Tell them that I'm not talking to them again until after my massage. It's not a good time. - We need to talk. - Okay, what part of ""silent partner"" don't you understand? I have your sex tape. Hey, you're home. Uh, quick question, do you remember when you bought those blue shoes? Was it a Tuesday or a Wednesday? - I don't remember. - Think, though you schedule everything and I remember you brought them home around the time that I went to the movies with Slutty Crystal. Mom, what's going on? Nothing. - You have enough on your mind. - Okay, now you definitely have to tell me. I'm late. Late. For what? My period is late. But you're on the pill. I forgot one. Or two. - Mom - I know. I know. And I knew we should wait, but we got so caught up in the moment. Caught up in the moment? You're not 16. - It was an accident. - No. No, it wasn't. Me standing here pregnant that's an accident. You were reckless. I mean, what's your plan? Are we gonna be pregnant together? Did you want to raise these babies like sisters? - No. Look, I didn't have  a plan - Yeah, I know. Again. I'm sorry. I I just thought I don't know. I just thought that you would be more thoughtful if you thought about having another kid. Because of Well Me. Guys, put that away. _ No way. It gets good at 3:48. What is that? Tried to tell you. Hi, Rafael. Hang on. - Was that my ex-wife? - Uh, yes. And where'd they get that? I don't know. But It's everywhere. I didn't release the tape. It must have been Lachlan. I would never do something like that. Lachlan didn't release the tape. I did. What?! But why? Because as long as it existed, he could hold it over my head. - Now he has nothing. - I get that, - but the Marbella board, they're a bunch of conservatives. - Yes. And I'm about to meet with them. They're going to learn that my private files have been stolen. They're going to be righteously outraged on my behalf and they're going to release this statement, condemning this violation of my privacy. And what makes you think they're gonna sign this? You'll help me convince them. Because it will help the Marbella. I think we should work together. I would have fired Lachlan. And that would have cost us a million dollars. When's the board meeting? So I just found out I'm definitely not pregnant. Really? Look, I'm sorry I was harsh yesterday. I was Stressed. You were right. And I've been thinking about what you said. And maybe my missing a pill wasn't a complete accident. It's just hard, you know? 'Cause being your mom. Is the only thing I've been, like, successful at. And now it's - almost done. - No. No, it is not done. - But it's changing. - It's changing, definitely. And maybe for the better. Maybe it's time your life changes, too. I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right? In grandma's house? - No, I don't. - Exactly. So then date Rogelio and see where it goes. But go slowly. Take it step by step. You're, like, annoyingly smart sometimes. Then why can't I answer this proposal? Okay, I want to remind you about something, but I am afraid if I do, you're gonna think it's because I don't think you should marry Rafael, which is true, - but that's not why I'm reminding you. - Of what? The time you found Michael's list in the book. Can you turn off my phone, babe? I'm-I'm doing a practice test timed. Mm-hmm. Interesting. What? Nothing. That night the smile on your face you were so happy. Even though you'd only known each other a year, you didn't have any questions. But it wasn't right. That's not the point. You know what it's like to be sure. I'm sorry for testing you. It's not right, but I just I think I was afraid of the answer I knew in my gut. Which is I can't marry you. Not yet. A-and that look on your face I mean, that's why I didn't want to admit it. To myself, to you. Because I was scared that if I turned down your proposal that would mean that something would Break between us. That things would change. And I don't want that, because I love you and I want to get to marriage. I'm just not there yet. Because you're not sure about me. Because it's too fast. You think that life is short. Well, for me, I think it's long. - And that there are steps you have to take first. - Yeah, I get that. What's that? Nothing. It's stupid. I Planned on dropping off my chapter at Angelique's, once her massage was finished, because she'd be in a good mood. Go. No. Jane I just need a second, okay? To to be alone, to lick my wounds. Just Go. But we're okay? Yeah. We will be. As she headed toward Angelique's room, Jane tried to put Rafael's disappointment out of her head. Come in. Ms. Harper, hi, I, uh right on time. Thanks for pushing the massage an hour later. Hey, you're Jane from the proposal the other night, right? Um, yeah, that-that's me. Boy, that really went off the rails. Let me guess cute, rich, but dumb, right? Oh, for the love - Even my masseuse has a manuscript. - Oh, no, no. - I-I-I'm not - You don't want me to read that? Oh. - Well I-I do, but - Let's see how the massage goes first, okay, honey? Actually, Ms. Harper, - I am - Shh, shh. I like a quiet massage. Okay. I like it deep. The harder the better. Mm, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, just like that. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, I hate these book tours. I'm so glad I booked the extra half-hour. I'm gonna need every one of these 90 minutes. And I need you to really work my glutes. - What the hell is this? - We'd like you to double-check every dime spent in accounts receivable. That is Unless you'd like to quit. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And cut. Nailed it. Again. I came to tell you that I'm not pregnant. Are you testing me? No, I'm not. - Ah. - And I'm sorry about that. It was stupid, and I'm relieved, too, because we aren't ready. No. No, we're not. But Rogelio, why don'ÂÂt you tell me? That your job under Esteban pretty much sucks. Because I knew you'd feel bad that I stayed in Miami for you. You're right, I do. I don't want you to feel that way. I'm glad I stayed. You're worth it. Xiomara, I-I care for you a lot. And I want to see where this goes. Step by step. And maybe it was Rogelio's sweet words or Jane's scary ones I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right? In grandma's house? But Xo looked at Ro and said something she'd never said before to a man: Well should we move in together? Is that the next step? Why not? Let's do it. Hey! - Grabbing another Cubano - Oh, my God, Michael, I just gave Angelique Harper a massage. - What?! - I went to go give her my chapters, she pushed back her appointment. Michael, she stripped down butt-ass naked. And so they laughed, as old friends do. And how could Jane know that, at that very moment, - Rafael would walk by. Dude, I swear, I swear, for, like 90 min it was move my arms more than, like, this. - Past here. - And is she, is she gonna, is she gonna read is she gonna read your chapter? I don't know. She fell asleep by the time I was done. I snuck out. How could she know? - Hi. - Hi. And how could Petra know the value of what she held in her hand? Your mother's necklace. Thank you. I I appreciate it. Um, anyway, I-I should go. Like I said, how could she know? _"
"All right, let's hit it Jane, you'll recall, was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. But, really, that's old news because so much has happened since then. For one, she broke up with her detective fiancÃ©, Michael, - and fell for Rafael. - Why'd your mom leave? I don't know, to be honest. But he was going through a tough time. See? His dad had just been murdered by Sin Rostro, who turned out to be his stepmother, but she disappeared. Oh, and his ex-wife, Petra, was now the co-owner of the hotel. - You can't run this hotel alone. - Watch me. As for Jane, she wanted to be a romance writer, and she was pursuing her dream. Oh, and Jane's mother had fallen in love with her father, who was suddenly back in her life, Rogelio De La Vega. Unfortunately, he was fired from his telenovela and began working on a new one with his rival, Esteban. Nailed it. Oh, and before I forget, huge news Rafael proposed to Jane. Unfortunately, she said no. You think that life is short. For me, I think it's long. Leaving Rafael most unhappy. So let's see how that all plays out. When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was 11 years old, she first fell in love with salsa. It was during Calle Ocho, one of the Villanueva women's favorite days of the year. And as young Jane watched the dancers, she found herself swept up with the fantasy, the romance. They just seemed so in love. Didn't they seem so in love? Sure, if you say so. Geez, where is the churro guy? I'll find him. Unfortunately, at that moment, fantasy crashed into reality. _ _ _ Right, just like Regina a-and AimeÃ© in ""CorazÃ³n Salvaje"". And young Jane chose to believe that. Mostly. If I'm being honest, perhaps the fantasy cracked, just a little. _ But then again, it usually does. - So, should I ? - Uh, yes. Sorry, uh, go ahead. Uh, the tour starts at 1:00. Yes, right. And it's about two hours. Wait, what is? The tour. Can you just hang on one second, actually? - No problem. - Just _ I'm sorry. No, it's okay, I was kidding. - Mostly. - Sorry. It's just the Fontaine Blue, the Soho House, they're having these big performances to close out Calle Ocho. I know, I get it. The Marbella needs one, too. - Totally understand. - But you are right. Maybe we should just have lunch another time, then. Okay, no, n-n-n-no, I am here, okay? What were you saying? I just wanted you to know that the hospital tour's tomorrow from 1:00 to 3:00. Got it, I'm there. Okay, good. And, look I also just wanted to make sure everything was okay. With us. Everything's fine. Because you seem a little distant. No, I'm just busy. Work, Calle Ocho And again, Jane chose to believe that Okay, good. You can check your phone. Mostly. _ This is it. If we tear down that wall, we can double the size of my closet. I should mention, it had been weeks of house hunting for these two. So this is it, really? We finally agree on a place? I should also mention, Rogelio needed it to be perfect. As long as the square footage is over 5,200, I'm happy. Let me just double-check it is. In this case, ""perfect"" meaning - _ - larger than his rival Esteban's house. I would not normally be so petty, but when my Nemesis cares about the little things, so must I. And now the little thing will be his house. Great, so you'll let the realtor know? Already tweeted her. How did Alba take it? You know, when you said you were moving out. Surprisingly well. So Rogelio and I decided to move into a place together. _ I thought it was gonna be this big fight, but nothing. Well, she adores me. And who can blame her, no? What's going on? It's an alert. Like an Amber alert? What? No. Worse it's a Twitter alert. Apparently, I'm losing followers. Yeah, I-I don't think that's worse. Apparently, people aren't believing my performance as an Interplanetary Detective. Oh, nice. They even posted a gif of me holding my space gun incorrectly. Ooh, yeah. I saw that. Well, what are you doing? Going on the offensive. I'm posting pictures of me with my famous friends. I need to change the narrative. I'll leave you to that. I need a grilled cheese. Make that two. No, I was asking so you could make it. Oh, come on, yours are better. True. And I'll only get a few more before I move out. You found a place? We found a place. Aw, I'm so happy ish. Oh, we'll see each other all the time. Nothing's gonna change. Make the sandwich. So did you talk to Rafael? Kind of. He says there's nothing wrong, but things are different. He's different. He's hurt. You said no to his proposal. Yeah, I know. I just wish I knew how to fix it and get things back to the way they were before. It'll get better. - Try to be patient. - I know. Anyway, I can't keep obsessing. - Amen, you're not an obsesser. - Exactly. No more. No mÃ¡s. I made a decision. He's gonna focus on his work, I'm gonna focus on mine. If I want to get this draft of my book done before the baby comes, I need to get on it. You go, girl. Ah, yes, writing. Jane's salvation. And as promised, Jane threw herself in. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ She saw _ Oh, dear. It seems our Jane is suffering from writer's block. _ Just finishing up. Yep, you are blocked. And obsessing. Fantastic news. Ah, yes. You'll recall these two were once married and are now business partners. Please tell me you found a musician to play at the Marbella. Well, almost. I found a way to a musician. David Bisbal. And through your almost-father-in-law. - Wait, Rogelio? - Yes. He knows him. Look what he just tweeted. _ _ What? Why are you following my almost-father-in-law on Twitter? What? What's your agenda, Petra? Does it have to do with Jane? Here's my agenda. I want to drive people to this hotel so we stop hemorrhaging money. Your contacts have not panned out, so I started following Rogelio because I thought there was a chance he might know someone famous. And I was right. I'm sure you can understand why I asked, given our complicated history. Just make the call. And speaking of exes with complicated history Hey. I'm just meeting someone here. Okay. I was just leaving, actually. Well, also I have something. Okay, I've been meaning to give this to you since we saw each other last at the food truck. Okay, I'll see you soon. Right, see you. Here you go. Oh, did Jane leave? Uh, yeah. Shoot, I really wanted to give her this. These went up in my neighborhood. It's a writing workshop led by a romance writer that we both really like. I'm not going to lie. It felt like a sign. This is so weird, Michael. I've been having a little trouble writing, and I was literally wishing that I could find a workshop like the one I took in college. Meant to be, I guess. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want to interrupt. Everything okay? No. The gif is everywhere. Oh, you mean the gif with you holding the gun wrong? Who are you to say it was wrong? Well, I do hold guns for a living. You're a policeman. Detective, actually. I'm a lieutenant. In space. - I could shadow you. - What? To gain authenticity. Dad, this is his job. And acting is mine. This gif is embarrassing me because I take my craft very seriously. Which you can see by my use of the word ""craft."" Okay. Yeah, I'll have to clear it with my captain first. Beautiful, you're on! Are you sure ? But wait, there are rules. You can't drive. You can't pretend you're a real police officer. And you can't have a weapon. Of course. Except in case of emergencies, I'll just No. No. Okay, we'll talk about it later. You said yes. ""Say yes, Willa. Let yourself say yes."" Which brings us here, now, to Jane in her romance writers' group. And so far, it was pretty much a fantasy. Well, if you fantasize about writers' workshops. It was friendly, stimulating, inspiring. ""Willa wanted to say yes, ""but she knew there was something else ""she needed to say first. ""Something ""That could change Phillip's mind Forever."" _ _ Believe it or not, I used to finish with the sentence, ""but she didn't know if she could."" Which basically takes away all the suspense. Exactly, your ending just drives the story forward. Thrusts it forward. We use words like ""thrusts"" in here, Jane. Oh, hi, um, am I too late? Oh, no, no, please join us. We're very happy to have two new members today. Now, we were just talking about how, at the end of a chapter, it's really good to say something provocative. And then move on. Ah, yes, something along the lines of, ""little did Jane know one of these people would change her life."" Which, by the way, is true. Now, thrusting forward. - Thank you for coming. -  You'll recall Michael had a meeting at the Marbella. And you remember Aaron, right? I've meditated on this a bit, on what to do, and _ _ _ _ Sorry. Fortifying. Reminding myself that one of Jainism's basic tenets is satya, truth-seeking. Cool. I'm required to do what I can to find my brother's killer. The answers might be on this, but it's encrypted, so Where'd you get that? Your mother's necklace. I found it hidden in the pendant that belonged to my mother. My brother told me that it existed before he died. Said it was some sort of insurance policy. Interesting. Aaron's coming clean. Misread that situation. Great. I'll get a team together to decrypt it. And speaking of a gentle Jain, ours was living the dream. She was surrounded by people who would help her through her writer's block, just as she was sure her insights would help them. All right, everyone. Please pass your cards to Wendy. I'm so nervous. - I just hope I did it right. - Did what right? The compliment cards. - The what now? - Compliment cards. That's, like, Amanda's whole group philosophy. It was written on-on the back of the flyer. ""Compliment cards ""that help foster a sense of self followed by a gentle discussion on areas of improvement."" Mm-hmm. I thought it was supposed to be a critique. And why didn't they write it on the front on the flyer? I think we can safely assume Jane had not read the back of the flyer. Are you sure? We're really only supposed to say nice things? I think it is also safe to assume that Jane did not just say nice things. Well, first I want to thank Wendy for sharing her story with us. I know how hard it's been for you. Hey, it's only taken me a year and a half to get up the courage, so So, before we dive into our gentle discussion, why don't we shore you up with some compliments? Okay. Denise says, ""the characters ""were very well defined, ""and I love the twist when she realizes it's the same man."" Sorry, I'm just gonna grab my card. Oh. It's just the third one. - Right here. - No, what it is, it's that I just didn't do it right, so Jane, there is no right here. This is a safe place. Let her read your card. - No, see - Go ahead, Wendy. Go on. Um mm-hmm. ""Good dialogue, ""but I wasn't rooting ""for the couple. ""It's clear there's no real love there. They seem like they'd be better off without each other."" Oh. I'm so sorry. No, I-I just, I didn't understand. - Wendy. - I just want to say that Stop, please! You've done enough. You'll recall we just left Jane having made a member of the writers' workshop cry somewhat hysterically. I was trying to be helpful. In my creative writing class in college, we would do this kind of stuff all the time, critiquing. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable in that kind of a cutthroat environment. No, no, no, no, that is not what I'm looking for at all. We are builder-uppers, not tearer-downers. I'm a builder-upper. That's what I do all the time. I build up, up, up. New tactic, Jane. Look, I made a mistake. Just like Eleanor got into hot water with the dairy lobby the first time she was at the farm. If John Jr. hadn't given her a second chance You read ""Love Under the Bridge""? Of course! I just didn't read the back of the flyer. Please. Give me another chance. And speaking of second chances Uh, hello. I'm going to take your hand, because I'm a gentleman, and we're in public. Okay. All right. Uh, please, have a seat. Uh, look, I know you are very busy. Incredibly busy. Right, so I will Get to the point. I understand you're friends with David Bisbal? David? David Bisbal? _ Yes. Stars of our magnitude tend to gravitate to each other. Well, I was hoping to have him sing here after Calle Ocho. I would pay him, of course. I just, I need the intro. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Let me understand. You have not come here to apologize? Do I have that right? For what? Let me spell that out to you without actually spelling anything, you know? You have no trouble asking me for a meeting with a superstar, but when it comes to my most prized possession, whose hand you want in marriage Wait, you're mad that I didn't ask you before I proposed to Jane? Finally you understand! I'm sorry. Honestly, it didn't even occur to me, really, because, you know, I've known her longer than you. But that is not an excuse at all. I should've asked you, I'm very sorry. What's going on here? Rafael and I have buried our hatchets, and I'm gonna help him secure David Bisbal for a stay at the Marbella. Thank you, sir. No problem. Just, the next time you propose to Jane, remember to ask my permission beforehand. Rogelio. It's okay, it's okay. Won't happen again. Right. I'll see you all later. So Don't worry. I'm not gonna ask you anything. What? I wasn't thinking that. Just, uh, making sure. Rafael, is everything okay? - Yeah, I mean, that was pretty awkward. - With us? Because ever since the proposal Can we please stop talking about the proposal? Seriously, your father, now you. It didn't go well, you said no. I would like to stop reliving it and just move on. And so, Jane turned to her writing to make things better, with her writers' group, at least. So she reread Wendy's story and focused on the good. _ _ _ She was determined to focus on the good. Janey? I heard a lot of typing. No more writer's block? Nope, still have that. It's an apology. I messed up at my writers' workshop, - and I'm just trying to fix the problem. - You'll do it. Here. This'll make you feel better. I don't need this. Why? I thought you liked it. On you. Wow! This is you packing. Prepacking. - Sorting. - Hey! Those are my shoes. Sorry, my mistake. Hey, this is my jean jacket. All right, come on. I wear it more than you do. No! _ She's stealing! I'm sorting. _ My move in with Rogelio. _ Ma, I told you, I'm moving out. We talked about this last week. You said you were fine with it. _ What? _ _ Stay calm. I am not calling it off, ma! _ Okay, could you not call me stupid? Look, you both need to just relax. _ Don't mention the cow! _ Mom, what I think Abuela is trying to say is that she's just concerned for your relationship. _ I dot remember asking you for your opinion! Which doesn't mean that she doesn't respect it! Right, mom? _ Oh, seriously, you are giving me advice about dating? What's it been, like, 25 years? _ Well, you're the one who called me stupid! Okay, I think that you both have just said hurtful things, and it's just that we're sensitive to the fact that things are changing. _ I will not! Uh Guys The next morning, Jane was determined to fix things. _ _ With everyone. I'm leaving now, mom, but I want to see you later at Calle Ocho at 4:00. I'll see you at Calle Ocho. _ Meet you at 4:00. - Wendy - Aah! Oh! Sorry. You startled me. I'm sorry. I just wanted to give you this. It's everything I loved about your story. Oh, you don't have to do that. Please. No, please, I do. Jane yesterday, I wasn't upset because of what you said about my writing. It was what you said about my marriage. What? You know, the two people you thought were ""better off without each other."" That's basically me and my husband. And, uh Everything you said was true. You know, there-there is no connection, there There is no romance. Don't say that. Never say that. Romance can always be salvaged. You need to make a big romantic gesture. Something epic! Come on, it's a romance writers' group. What did you expect them to say? - A weekend getaway. - Maybe Tahiti. You can make love in those huts. We can't afford Tahiti. You can come stay at the Marbella for the weekend. The hotel with all the murders? Well, we don't really like to advertise it like that, but my boyfriend owns it and I can get you a suite. If you need time away. Uh, we'd love that. Thanks, Jane. See? Fixing problems, left and right. Hey, did you double-check his rider? Shh. He's here. _ _ Rafael Solano. I am David Bisbal. Anything you need, you just let me know. First, I hit up Calle Ocho, and then I'm back here, I don't know, about an hour before the show, okay? Of course. Anything, bro. No, guys. Thank you. Bye. Bro? Who will be taking care of Mr. Bisbal's dog? I'm sorry excuse me? David needs someone to watch his dog till after the show. Wait, we weren't told anything about a dog. Should I tell him no? Should we find another place to stay? - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. - No. We'll take the dog. Ah, we're good. This is Diablo. That's cute. Okay. Hi. Hi, Diablo. His diet needs to be closely monitored, as well as his assorted rashes. Here's his schedule. It's detailed. I expect you two to personally take care of him. Got it. Yeah. Here, take him. Oh, no, no! I am pretty sure I just heard you promise David Bisbal that you would personally handle everything. I'm not a dog person, Rafael. Come on, you know that. Wait, you just expect me to take care of this on my own? Nope, nope. Wh no. Nope. Nope. No. We share. Jane Would you like to share your work with us next session? Oh. You know, I don't I don't think so. Oh, we'll be kind. No, it's it's not that. I I'm actually having writer's block. I think I just need to listen, observe, absorb Well, that's not a problem. Just let us know when you're ready, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, and a word of advice. The problem isn't always where you think it is. It's often further back. Hmm. They find anything else on the flash drive? No. Just the name Tony Vaughn. Can't believe it. - Me neither. I mean - All right, you need to step back. You don't have to literally shadow me. If I step further back, I can't hear. Fine, I'll step back. Sorry about that. Okay So if Tony Vaughn's name is on the flash drive, he's gotta be involved with Sin Rostro. I know, but Vaughn's been off the grid forever. You think he's really back in town? Well, if he is, he's either at his mother's - or his girlfriend's. - Okay, I'm gonna drive by his girlfriend's. - Great, we'll swing by his mother's. - You're not coming. - Good luck with that. - Nadine Of course I'm coming. It could be dangerous. What do you think the ""D"" in De La Vega stands for? ""Danger."" Okay, what is going on here? He won't stop barking. _ Yeah, clearly. So how are they supposed to run a sound check when all they can hear is the stupid dog? _ Maybe he's hungry. _ Oh, no. No - What? - I have a problem with security. I have to go talk to Randy. Okay, fine. Leave the dog with me. - I'll deal with it. - Whoa. What? You're not gonna kill him or anything, are you? - _ - Very funny. No! I'm not gonna Really?! _ Ah, yes, Jane. Plied by a room full of romance writers and the half a glass of wine her ob assured her was fine, Jane's decided on her own romantic gesture, if you will. And you'll recall that ""Livin' on a Prayer"" is Rafael's favorite song. Ooh, that must be him.  Hold on  Oh, boy. _ I was expecting Rafael. Yes, I figured as much. Sorry. He said he forgot the dog bag. Here it is. I am so bored. - _ - And hungry. I am hungry and bored. Not a good cocktail for Rogelio. - Then Rogelio should go away. - Nope. I'm here for the long haul. _ Exactly how long do you stay? Usually? Oh could be hours. Doing nothing? We talk. - Co - Yep. Then, after about six hours, we start to get a little punchy. That's when I start busting out my impressions. What? Just saying, you should probably leave now. But I love impressions. What? Let me see one. You Mm. Really? All right. Okay. All righty, then! - Ace Ventura, Pet Detective! - Yep! Brilliant. All right, okay. Okay, here's a guy getting bit by a lizard and then he turns into one. Ready? - Okay. - Aah! - Lizard man. - Stop it! My laughter is gonna bring attention to ourselves! Man! I wish you'd tell Jane this, 'cause she told me these are the worst. While Jane is truly magnificent, she doesn't have the ear for comedy that I have. Ah oh, man. Let me ask you something, Rogelio. Is she happy? You know With Rafael? Well, look, I'm sure it's a little awkward because she said no to his proposal, but she loves him Wait. He proposed? And she said no? You did not know that? _ It's go time. I-I texted. I didn't get it. I'm sorry. I also can't stay. What? Yeah, it's a work thing. Something came up. Aw, come on. That's not all it is. You've been distracted - and distant - I'm-I'm busy, Jane. This is life. It's not all flowers and fantasy. - I know that. - Do you? That's not fair. I don't know what you want from me. I want for you to be present. I asked you to marry me. How much more present could I have been? And I said no. And I get it, you're hurt, you're mad. - And I'm allowed to be. - And so am I. The problem, she realized, was further back. Because you asked too early. Things things were great. We were moving forward. And then you got it into your head to ask me to marry you and I said no and I've been beating myself up for hurting you, but you know what? This is not my fault. You were impulsive. I mean, of course you didn't think to check in with Rogelio. If you'd stopped and had asked someone, anyone anyone who knows me, you wouldn't have asked. And I wouldn't had to have said no, and we wouldn't be here. So stop, please, stop putting this all on me. And in that moment, Jane felt unblocked, as it were. In any case, better. Rafael, not so much. He's headed south, away from the stage. Got it. We have two officers on foot heading over. Brother. I'm gonna grab a hot dog. You want something? We should assume he's armed. It's crowded. I'm at Calle Ocho. Ah, yes. Calle Ocho. Where our young Jane fell in love with salsa. It was the fantasy, really. All three of them, watching together. I told you Abuela wasn't coming. I-I-I don't see him. Where'd he go? Are you sure you're not hungry? - Jane? - Hey! Isn't that ? - Andie, right? - Yeah. Yeah. Hi. So, we were just heading out. Are you staying? Yeah. Met my ex-boyfriend here, so I like to walk around, eat a churro, obsess about him a little bit. No need to explain. - See you around. - Okay. Bye. Yes! Let me okay, selfie, selfie. Come on, selfie, come on, yes, closer. Hey! Stop! - _ - Police! Oh, that's the bad guy! Get him! Get him! The bad guy! Stop, don't move! All right! Enough! We got him! Wow! - We're quite a team. -  Petra? Please, just watch the dog during the concert. No way! You pawned him off all day. What is it? Nothing. It's just a It's just a headache. Rafael, come on. I know you. I proposed to you after five months. Just strolling down memory lane? Did you think it was too soon? Uh it was quick. Yeah. It also made sense. Because of who you are and how much you've always wanted a family. What? No barking. Let's move! Dog on the loose, people! - Hey! - Hey, boy! - Uh - That's a good boy. - Uh, heel, heel! - Stay, stay. - Oh, no! - No! No! No! No! - I'll get him! I'll get him! - Go get him! Go! - Diablo! Hey! - Hey, boy! Hey! Hey! What? Oh oh, no! Wait, Diablo! _ I'm just saying our first case together. And the last. And we caught the bad guy! We definitely did. Yeah. Okay, get a room, you two. Hello, Miami! How are you? Yeah. Just hoping Rafael shows up? No. _ Oh, if only it were that easy for her and Rafael. It's a pleasure being here tonight with all of you. Are you ready?! See, the truth is, Jane did hold out hope. Even though she knew she shouldn't. Jane, look. Even though she knew it was absolute fantasy. But alas Fantasies must come to an end. Petra, the concert's over. Bisbal's gonna want his dog. Relax. And look to your left. Oh, I-I could hug you! Where did you find him? In a service elevator humping a throw pillow. Oh, of course. And there you are! - Perfect timing. - Hi. You can tell David that his dog was perfect. - Yup. - Oh. David won't care. The dog's mine. - Excuse me? - I'm sorry, what? I just knew you two would take better care of him if you thought he was Mr. Bisbal's. Anyway, thanks! Oh, oh, wait. Uh You know, I was thinking about what you said earlier. And you're right. You do know me. I think it's gonna help with Jane. So, thank you. We'll double-check, but his alibi looks airtight. Okay, so Vaughn didn't kill Roman Zazo. He still might be connected to Sin Rostro. We'll nail him on drug charges, try to get him to flip and tell us what he knows. Sounds like a plan. Hi. _ What are you doing here? Uh just grabbing a churro. Yeah, you always, you always did like churros. _ It's, it-it's been a while. Yeah. Like three years. Three years. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. It's okay. No more writer's block? Took my teacher's advice. The problem was further back in my novel. Look, I get that big romantic gestures - won't fix whatever's broken. - Jane And that's not what I want, really. I just Need us to connect. You were right. I did propose too soon. And it's like what you said. About going back? For me it was all about family. And how badly I wanted a family. And so, I-I tried to rush it and I I tried to lock it down so that you wouldn't leave. I'm not gonna leave. That's the point. I'm here. We don't have to rush. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. You're right. You know, I never even looked for her. Who? My mom. I just took my dad's word and trusted that she didn't want to be found. I trusted my mom, too. About my dad and-and What she said about him. It was not true at all. Yeah, well, I Can't really ask my dad anymore. I know. But you can look for her. I mean, lives are complicated, people are complicated. But she may have a good reason for leaving. Or not. Yeah, yeah. Or not. But you'll never know unless you look. Sometimes the best romance is not the stuff of fantasy. You sure you're ready? It's the romance of small moments. Of intimate moments. I think so. You think I should do this, right? I would. Of reality. What's your mom's name? And in reality ""Elena Di Nola."" you should never search for something you are not prepared to find."
"- Okay, ready to roll? The basics. - Jane was artificially inseminated with Rafael's sample, and from there, a love story brewed and we even got a proposal! But Jane said no, which left Rafael pretty bummed. So he dove into work. You know who was super psyched she said no? Jane's ex-fiancé, Michael. Oh, by the way, Michael is a detective, and when he took Jane's father, Rogelio, on a ride-along, a bromance was born. And speaking of Rogelio, he and Jane's mother had gotten back together and they decided to move in. But Jane's grandmother disapproved and so the women were estranged. Oh, and Jane had joined a romance writers' group and made a new friend, Andie. But zoinks! Turns out they have the same ex-boyfriend, though Jane doesn't know that yet. Oh, and you remember Roman Zazo? He was having an affair with Petra, Rafael's ex-wife, but alas, Roman was impaled and now his twin brother Aaron is back in town and is growing closer to Petra. Juicy stuff, folks. So let's see what happens next with our star-crossed lovers. There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to becoming a parent. It's okay, Jane, sweetie. Here. _ _ There are, however, opinions. - Lots and lots of opinions. - She needs it to sleep. _ Back off. I'm her mother. _ Ah, yes. The age-old struggle. That doesn't matter anymore. Pacifiers? - _ - Not for now. Which is why it's not on the list. Ah. Stick to the list. Just tag what's on the list. Uh, sorry! Hey, no, I'm sorry that I can't be there to debate pacifiers in person. How's it going? Okay. I feel prepared. Did you take a look at the list? Uh, I didn't. I am sorry, but I am good with everything that you picked. Okay. Hello. Cute, huh? Lina, take that off. I gotta go. Okay. Love you. What is it for? You know, I'm not 100% sure. Pumping breast milk. Oh. Sorry, I overheard. I had mine six months ago. I remember being totally lost when I was registering. No, no, I appreciate it. What is that, um thing that your baby's in? It's the wrap, she loves the wrap. Are you going to wear your baby? Like an accessory? Is that legal? I was going to get a carrier. This one's the best. Wearing baby close to mommy's body promotes a healthy attachment, which leads to long-term benefits in behavior, intelligence, self-esteem Yes. Wow. I definitely want all those things. But does it, like, puke all over you? Any other tips? Well I guess it kind of depends on your parenting philosophy. Is the baby going to sleep in your room or in a nursery? Um, in a nursery. Okay, that's okay. - Doesn't sound okay. - Is it not? It's a choice. Everything's a choice. - Uh-huh. - Are you planning on nursing? Yes. Definitely. Good. It is the most important thing. Yeah, I did all the research. I know all the health benefits. Did you sign up for a lactation class? No. I didn't know that they even had that. It's an absolute necessity. The lactation emporium has the best ones. Are you working with a doula? No, I'm not. Primarily because she did not know what that was. But all that was about to change. _ Hey, so I just got the budget, and we did not agree on this number. We have a lot of buzz coming off the Bisbal concert. We have to seize that momentum. There's no reason why we can't be a brand-name hotel, like a Fontainebleau or a Delano. We were making up some deficits, Rafael. Exactly. So now is the time to reach a little. This party is going to make the Marbella a spring break destination. And you got a special events permit? Applied for it two weeks ago. Should be here any minute. Hey, come on. Trust me. I got this. _ It's a baby wrap. For baby-wearing. _ _ _ Seriously? How long are you guys going to keep this up? To recap: It has been one week since Xiomara and Alba last spoke. You both said some pretty hurtful things. _ And if she does, you'll move on? _ _ _ _ She's happy. In love _ You know that's not true. Their connection is not just physical. Well, maybe not just physical But it definitely was physical. So I take it your answer to my question is ""yes."" And the question? _ So, you two like living together so far? It's amazing. You are amazing. No, you are. I know. _ The answer is yes. A thousand times yes. Happy to hear it! Anyway, here you go your ""Interstellar Lieutenant"" badge. Thank you for dropping it off, Michael. The prop department is all over me. Apparently these things ""take time to make."" No worries. Oh, also I brought you this. _ To commemorate your time on the force. We usually give it to kids on field trips, but I love it. Thank you. Hey, you know, Jane's actually on her way over Hey. Hi. I'm here. We're here. You thought it was awkward when Michael stood there watching Xiomara and Rogelio kiss? I, I was actually just on my way out. Just wanted to drop that off. I-I'll walk you out, brother. They went on a ride-along. - I had no idea he'd be here. - I had no idea they were best friends. They're not. Why aren't you changed? Go changed. It'll take me two minutes. But can I just say it seems silly to go to a breast-feeding class before there's a baby? Then don't come. I'm coming. I'm just saying, how is that a thing? You have no idea how many ""things"" there are when you're having a baby. Hello, I have some idea. I mean nowadays. - I wish you could come. - I know. But this party and the budget we've sunk in There's so much to do. Less I can do at a lactation class. No, I get it. Actually, you both should come, you and Xo. - To the party. - Fine. I will provide the celebrity presence. You don't have to keep hinting. I'm eternally grateful. Good. Want to take the grand tour? Follow me, please. Your grandmother's going to ask about the house. Don't tell her anything. - Ma. - Don't. Just mention how big it is. You have to at least talk to her. Be the bigger person. And then what? Move back in with her? I'm happy. I know. That's what I told her. That you're in love. Yeah. I really am. So who said it first, by the way? Interesting question, Jane. You know what? We haven't actually said it yet. Is that weird? That we live together, but we haven't said I love you? Maybe slightly unconventional, but I'm not one to judge. Yeah, well, I'm not going to dwell on it. Should I just go ahead and say it? - _ - He shouldn't have to be the first to say it just 'cause he's the guy, right? That's not, like, feminist or whatever. Mom, shh. I'm trying to listen to this. - Sorry, sorry. - The cradle hold is one that can be used immediately after baby's birth. Good job. And if you opt for a hospital birth, do not let those doctors snatch that baby away before you have a chance to nurse. Snatch the baby away? Why would they snatch the baby away? Just to weigh it or give it a bath. Don't freak out, this woman is a drama queen. And this is the most important thing to remember. Breastfeeding isn't always easy. But if you decide you will nurse, you will nurse. I had a new mommy in here just the other day, and she was crying. She was painfully engorged, her nipples were so chafed, she was bleeding and blistered. But she persevered. Bottle-feeding is not the end of the world. Not the end of the world, but it could be the end of her baby's proper immune function. You've got to be kidding me. - Mom, shh. - I'm just saying, I bottle-fed you and you turned out great. Okay, well, it's 23 years later, and science says it's important. - Now be quiet. - Okay. Let's see your cradle hold. Mm-hmm. Oh, and Polly told me to ask you for a doula recommendation? If we decided to go with one. - When are you due? - June 1. Oh, dear, that's soon. The good doulas are likely booked. - All the good ones? - I'll have to dig around. Thank you. And are there other things I should know? That I don't know I should know? Probably. Which is why we have a wonderful online community called the Milky Madres. Women who are going through the same thing as you, giving each other advice, inside tips Just lean forward a bit. Otherwise baby will choke on the milk. We'll sign you up. Thank you. - Jane - Hmm? Just don't panic. But Jane was, indeed, panicking. And so she made a mistake we have all made during moments of panic She went down the Internet rabbit hole. Unfortunately, much of what Jane found seemed to be written in a secret code. D.D.? What's a D.D.? - _ - Even more unfortunately, the acronyms used - _ - in the online parenting community - _ - seem to number in the thousands - _ - As do the concerns of the mothers online. My D.S. got a PC for his birthday. Should I be concerned about ADHD? I'm scared that if I let my baby cry herself to sleep, she will be traumatized. What should I do? I just read about stress hormones in pregnant women being terrible for baby, so now I'm stressed about being stressed Your stress hormones are through the roof right now. _ Thanks to you, I have anxiety problems. - Who are you? - Your kid. You thought you were prepared for this? Well, you thought wrong. You're a terrible mom. - I hate you! - Oh! We all turn to different things in times of stress. Exercise. A glass of wine. The Real Housewives franchise. For Jane, it was studying. _ She's not here. Good. I've got a few more boxes to pick up. Hello, Jane. Hey, Rogelio. Dad. Hey, I wanted to talk to you, actually, about Michael. Man, I love that guy! I know. I You just need to tone it down, okay? 'Cause it's uncomfortable. For me, for Rafael. Who I'm having a baby with. I get what you're saying. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. It's nothing, I mean, I - I just like the guy. - Yeah, I get it. I mean, there's something, you know? He-he-he gets me! - He's funny, too - Rogelio, please! - Rogelio. - Look, I don't think it's good for Michael, either. You know? I mean, he He needs to move on. Okay, I'll talk to him later. When we get mani-pedis. He agreed to mani-pedis? It was a surprise. Now? A parting gift. Can you take care of the boxes? They're in my room. Yeah, sure. So Did you drop the ""L"" bomb? No. I changed my mind. He should say it first. I suggested that we move in together. It's his turn. So I brought something to show you. Just to remind you that even though I was only 16 and mommy blogs and nursing classes didn't exist - Mom. - I just don't want you to overthink this stuff. _ But I'm sleeping on my stomach. - _ - And the pacifier's probably chock full of BPA. - _ - Plus there's a blanket over me, mom. - _ - And there's a crib bumper in there! Look, Jane, all I'm saying is, you turned out great. And-and you can read all the books you want. But trust me, with an actual baby, everything's different. My childhood wasn't great, you know? I mean, Roman and I, we were exposed to some tough stuff early on. _ _ Anyway, he went one way and I went the other. Hmm. How'd you end up in India? Uh, well, it started off as the usual post-college soul searching. Mm. But the longer I stayed, I started to see the world differently. Jainism isn't just about nonviolence. It's about listening to multiple views. It's about being open and honest. Yeah. Well, well, I did a-a little research actually. Did you? I was curious. Um Do you mind if I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. Are you a strict practitioner? In all areas? It should be noted Petra was curious about one area in particular. _ No. Not in all areas. Oh. And, uh, which area are-aren't you strict about? The one you're asking about. Or else I wouldn't be here. _ Rafael. I have to call him. So, what's it like working with your ex-husband? Feels like a million years ago that we were married. I'm over all that. Ah! Just put your feet in. - Well, I, I feel silly. - Oh, come on. It's 2015. Men get pedicures. Or what was all this equal rights talk about? Thank you. Anyway, speaking of women. - Were we? - Why don't you come with me to the Marbella party tomorrow and try to meet a few of them? Rogelio, what's going on? Listen. I know you still care for Jane very much. And between you and me, I would like to declare myself #teammichael. But the first and foremost, I must remain #teamjane. That means I must encourage you to #moveon. - I've moved on. - Oh, have you? Well, I mean I'm not dating anyone right now. But you are getting busy knocking boots! Let's stop talking about that immediately. Oh, come on! Just consider coming out with me, please, bro. I mean, women will swarm. You will be lit by my glow. And perhaps, if you get a girlfriend, that will make Rafael less uncomfortable He's uncomfortable? You know, maybe I will come with you to that party. - No permit for the party? I don't understand! - They said the city got overwhelmed and our application got lost in the shuffle. Okay, so expedite a new application! We'll pay whatever fee You don't think that I tried that? They said no. So, what now? We go ahead as planned. We overextended ourselves on all the deposits. So if we cancel now, we're out the money with nothing to show for it. - If we get caught - We won't. - You can't guarantee that! - Let's keep a low profile. Crowd control, no bonfires. Petra, I guarantee you that we are not the only party happening tonight on south beach without their ducks in a row. We're too far down the road to back out now. So, have you talked to your ex since Calle Ocho? No, but it was so weird running into him like that. You remember Andie, right? Jane's new friend from her romance writers' group. Turns out they have a lot in common. _ _ Okay, it sounds so silly. Mm-hmm. But I can't help but think, I don't know, that it's like A sign? I get it, trust me. Which is maybe why Michael dated both of them. Just pour it into your writing. - You're sharing next week, right? - Mm. - I'm going to tell Amanda I can't. - Hmm? I just don't have the time. I promised my sister I'd babysit. You're babysitting? A real baby? Um, yeah. I'll do it! I need the practice. Really? Are you sure? You'd be doing me a favor. I had no idea where I was gonna get my hands on a real baby. - That sounded weird. - Mm-hmm. But I'll take care of it. - Her. - Her. Luna. That name is on my short list. - See? Sign. - Aw. And speaking of babies So, how do I look? Magnificent. My super fans can eat their hearts out. I love making people jealous. Speaking of love, I was unpacking and I-I found this. Ah, a frame that says ""love."" Subtle, Xiomara. Do you like it or too cutesy? No. It's sweet. Maybe a picture of my mother? Another one? It should be noted that Xiomara and Rogelio's mother met three times in 1991. All three times were epic disasters. So, you love the frame? Cool. What else do you love? Oh, are we playing a game? - I'm just curious. - Hot chocolate! Ah, so Rogelio loves hot chocolate. With the mini-marshmallows. With mini-marshmallows. Got it. Anything else? Well, I love my fans, of course. The human kinds. And the ones that blow air. And mirrors! I love mirrors Enough! My turn. Hmm. You know what I love? Sleeping on the left side of the bed. - But that's my side of the bed. - And you know what else I don't love? I don't love the photos of your mother around this house. Xiomara, that is very rude. As I mentioned before, I love my mother very much. What is wrong with you?! Okay, I only have an hour according to your assistant. - You called Rob? - Yup. And apparently, you have a window. I do have a window. Good. Hey! Mm-mm! We have things to accomplish. Some things need to be decided. Let's do it. First, a doula. Should I have one? Um, refresh me on what a doula is? You didn't read the e-mail? She's there to navigate the birth. She takes care of the mother as far as I can tell. Like, pain management - Downside? - Expensive. Fine, it's no problem, I know. But it's a consideration. Also there's another person in the room during the birth do you want that? Not really. Do you? I don't think so. Then why are we even talking about it? Honestly? I just think I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, you know? Hey. So The thought of someone in the room who knows what's going on, who's done this a lot is I am so sorry. Mm-hmm. It's-it's about the-the party. No, it's okay. I know. Please tell me this is important, Evan. No. Okay. All right. I'll handle it. Please don't kill me. I am sorry. Can't someone else handle it? They tried, they couldn't and they called me. Hey, hey. Just come back tonight, huh? After you babysit. Yeah, okay. Jane, look at me. We are in this together. And I love you. I love you, too. I come bearing babies. Or a baby. Luna. Oh. Is there anything sweeter than a sleeping baby? So peaceful. Party's great, huh? Party's great. What the hell? Unbelievable. - You see a girl you like? - Something better. I'm glad at least one of us is having a good night. Hey, what's going on? You okay? Xiomara's pissed at me for no reason. Really? Go back through it. Think of everything that happened, anything you said That's right, you're a detective! You can help me investigate what went wrong. Well, I don't know if ""investigate"" is the right word. I will take you back to the scene of the crime. Picture this: After a vigorous session of lovemaking Don't need to take me back quite that far. Got it. After lovemaking Mm-hmm. We took a very nice, long shower. No. Hmm-mm. - Is she okay? - Easy. Still sleeping. I need some action. How's it going in there? Oh, I got nothing. Really? I heard so much typing Oh, that was just me Internet-stalking the ex. You know, Instagram, Facebook, Vine - I get it. - Should I text him? Maybe. I mean, just to see. - But I've worked so hard to get over him. - Instagram, Facebook, Vine You know what? I'll do it. Good. Yes. Okay, so I'll just say, like Like ""Hey."" Okay. Hey ""Hey."" Oh, come on, you're a way better writer than me, let's go. Okay, let's see. Um ""It was so good running into you. ""Maybe we can grab some coffee sometime and catch up. Dot dot dot. Maybe something else will happen, too. Dot, dot, dot. Okay, send. Okay. You wanted action. Oh.Oh hi, Luna. Oh, Luna. Oh, it's okay. Oh, you're just all wet. We're gonna change your diaper. Here you go. - Yeah. - What? No, no, no. How could I forget diapers? Oh Oh, my God. Um I'll run out and get some. Uh or I can stay and give her her bottle. No, no, no. You go, I'll be fine. I'll just get her out of these wet clothes. Oh Okay. _ _ Okay, okay. Okay. Hey, uh, I know Abuela's at work. How's the babysitting going? - Not great! - What are you doing? - Trying to figure out this swaddle. - Just pick her up! - No, mom, she needs to be swaddled. - Honey the baby is crying. - Yes, mom, I'm aware of that. - I didn't swaddle you Don't you dare tell me how great I turned out! I'm just trying to help you. Well, you're not helping! You're just doing the opposite of helping! Oh, oh Oh, thank God! Well, looks like Little Miss Perfect has figured it out all on her own. Good for you. Worst. Mom. Ever. _ Peekaboo! You'll recall that when we last saw Jane and Luna, both were quite upset. But I'm happy to tell you that things have improved. And it turns out Jane's got a knack for babies. Peekaboo! Peekaboo! And she's actually having fun. Peekaboo! Perhaps it gets a bit repetitive after awhile. Really? Again? Are you sure you don't want to do - Peekaboo! - But really, how many times can a baby want to hear peekaboo anyway? _ Peekaboo! _ Is that the phone? It's Rafael! Rafael! Hello! Jane, are you okay? Yes. I'm just using the baby voice so that the baby doesn't cry. How's it going? What? Jane, I said how's it going? Oh, it's great! What? Jane, I'm sorry, I can't hear you. My grandmother is here, and I can't hear a thing that you're saying, so I'll be by later. Yes, yes, I'll see you later. _ It's going well. This is Luna. That's Abuela. _ _ Ah? _ Yep. Mm. _ _ We got into a fight. I'm not in a forgiving mood. Ah. _ She was relentless. Telling me everything I should be doing with the baby. Not to swaddle that she never swaddled me, and I turned out just fine. Back off. I'm her mother. _ That doesn't matter anymore. _ _ _ Bring me back to this game that you and Xo were playing tell me about it. It was harmless. She was asking me about things I liked Or loved, I guess. Loved? Yes. I could crush some hunan wok. - _ - Or ooh! Mansfield Cafe is right near their place, right? Or wait, did Deanna say that that was the place that Jacob hated? Doesn't Jacob hate every place? What if we blew them off and went to see a movie, just the two of us is that terrible? I'd love to. Mm I love you, too. What? Nothing. We've just never We've never said that to each other. You just did. Actually, I said ""I'd love to."" O-oh. But I do. I love you. Yeah? Of course I do. I just I-I I thought it was too soon. Too soon?! I've been waiting forever. - You have? - Mmhmm. Dropping hints all week. ""What do you love about soccer, Ronaldo?"" I'm pretty sure Xo wants you to say ""I love you."" Of course. Yes, you are right! I don't know how I missed it. Thank you. You are a true friend. So, can I ask you a question? Of course. Do you think they'll last? Jane and Rafael? 'Cause I don't think they will. Deep down, I-I don't. So, yeah, that's why I haven't moved on. 'Cause I think she's gonna wake up, she's gonna realize he's wrong for her. And even though he wasn't sure at all, Rogelio knew what his true friend needed to hear. I think they will last, Michael. And I think you need to #moveon. Speaking of moving on See? I don't believe you. - What? - That you're over Rafael. Because I've been watching you And you've been watching him. Excuse me for a minute. Found a whole bunch of underage drinkers - out on your beach. - Oh. I am so sorry, Officer. It must have been fake IDs. We try to be vigilant, but We'll talk to our bartenders right away. Pretty big party, though. You get the permits for this? We we did send them in, but the office misplaced them. You know, it is my understanding that you have the ability to overlook a mistake like this. Are you trying to bribe a uniformed officer, Mr. Solano? - Oh, no - 'Cause if you are, that would make a very bad situation even worse. No. No, no, no. Sir, I'm-I'm sorry. You know, we'll shut the party down right now. Yeah, you will. Or trust me That's the least of your problems. Thank you again. You were amazing. No. Of course. It's him. - Your ex? - Uhhuh. Go. Go outside I'll take care of Luna a little longer. And I'll remind you now that Andie and Jane share an ex. Michael. Hi. A fact Jane did not know. Hi. So, I just got your text, and I I thought, you know, why not give you a call? I'm glad you did. How have you been? Oh, it's, it's been a tough couple of months, to tell you the truth. Oh, I'm sorry. I heard you and Jane broke up. But Andie, apparently, did know. Can I come in? So, is it bad? We'll lose our liquor license. The question is, for how long? We'll lose weddings, conventions. And it's my fault. Because I let my feelings get in the way of business. I knew we shouldn't go this big without a permit. But I gave in. Because I'm not over him. Like you said. But I want to be. There is a famous saying: If you can't be with the one you love, love the identical twin of the guy you were cheating with. Sorry. I'm sorry, I-I shouldn't have Come here tonight. I've had too much to drink. So how was the party? Not good. Why? What happened? Whoa. We were shut down. Our liquor license is going to be suspended. And we are facing a huge fine. What? The cops came, and we didn't have the permits that we needed for the party. Oh, no. Why not? 'Cause I screwed up. Sorry, I was just asking. I really don't need any judgment right now, okay? It's not what I meant at all. Maybe you should slow down, buddy. Listen, I-I'm sorry about tonight. We can talk about the baby stuff tomorrow. Tomorrow I have to deal with the liquor license, Jane. Okay, so when can we? I don't know this stuff's time-sensitive. Yeah, and there's a timeline here, too. Don't make me feel guilty right now. - I'm not. - Well, you're clearly upset. Well, I'm allowed to be upset. I-I shouldn't be judged for working hard it's important. And so is our baby. Who I'm trying to provide for. And I get that, but there are other stuff, too, okay? I'm starting to get really frustrated that I have to do all of this on my own. Well, you know what I'm frustrated about? Huh? - Michael. - What does Michael have to do with this? Nothing. That's the point. He should have nothing to do with our lives right now, but yet here he is at my party with your father. He's trying to get you back, Jane. And you are too naive to even realize it. I'm not naive. But you're drunk. And I don't want to be here anymore. _ It's not good for children to grow up with parents who fight. We tend to become aggressive. _ Can we talk? Uh, Mike helped me figure out why you were mad. Who's Mike? Michael Cordero. Anyway, he thought you wanted to know if I love you. Is he right? Yes. He's so smart. Stay focused, Rogelio. Anyway, I feel silly I didn't understand, Xiomara. Though I wish you'd just told me. Yeah, I know. I just got it in my head that I wanted you to say it first. But what the hell? I do. I love you. And I Am getting there with you, as well. Got to be honest not the answer she was looking for. And ""getting there"" was enough for you to move in with me? To uproot both our lives? Well, it seemed sensible. I mean, you needed to get out of your mother's house, and I needed to make love to you somewhere that didn't feel like a convent. Unbelievable. No, no, don't be angry. What I mean is that, you know, I lived with women before. Many women. Is this supposed to be helping? No, I'm sorry, that did not come out right. Please sit down. Please. What I mean is that I-I've only said ""I love you"" to three women in my life. You know, my two ex-wives and my mother. Those words mean a lot to me. And, if I'm honest, there is one thing holding me back. What's that? The animosity that exists between you and my mother. Her approval, it means a lot. So I have invited her to visit. She arrives next week, and you two can mend fences. Great. I can't wait. And speaking of mending fences Jane, about last night I was drunk and pissed off and I took it out on you. And I am so sorry. Everything that I said came out wrong. It came out wrong, - but you meant what you said, right? - No. I was lashing out because I Felt guilty, like you said. Like I was letting you down. Look, I-I understand that you're mad, and you have every right to be. I'm not mad, Rafael. I'm scared. When this baby comes, I'm scared it's gonna all be on me, all the child care. No, it won't. We won't let it. What does that mean? Work is always gonna come up for you. It should be noted that at this moment, all Jane needed was for Rafael to say, ""I'll pitch in."" So we'll get a nanny to help. - That's your answer? - So that you can do what you need to do, and I can run the hotel. Will you be taking any time off to take care of the baby? Come on. My job is different. - We have different responsibilities. - So no? So I don't know. In an ideal world, yes, of course. Come on. You know how much this means to me. Jane, please, let's not fight. I don't want to. Good. I promise you we will figure it out. We will make this work. 'Cause I love you. Yeah. I love you, too. But suddenly, for the first time, she wasn't sure that was enough. Oh. I thought you were at church. _ I came to see Jane. _ _ _ _ Seriously, ma, I am not in the mood for a lecture. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Thanks. And the same goes for you, okay? What I do _ _ _ Hey. What's happening here? Just working things out. You okay? Eh. Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you. No, I-I need to let you do things your own way with the baby and not feel like you think I'm a bad mom if you don't take my advice. Mom, are you kidding? That's the last thing _ What if I don't like it? The baby? All of it. Being a mom. I mean, babysitting and playing peekaboo it was one night, and I was crawling out of my skin. _ That's what everybody says, but what if it isn't? What if I can't handle it? And what if Rafael is busy, working all the time? Then we'll pitch in. _ We're in this together. All of us. Thanks. _ Excuse me. I seem to have something in my eye. Just give me a moment. Keep it up. Hey. Come in. Thank you so much for coming. I wasn't sure you would. Petra I just want I-I I just wanted to apologize for last night. I thought I was ready for more, but I Well, I guess I'm just not there yet. Can we just Stick to friendship? Of course. Sorry. Thank you. We have a problem. A big problem. Ah, yes. Let's rewind a bit. I'm sure you thought Petra was falling for Aaron, but the truth was a little more complicated. Remember that moment? See, it felt very familiar to Petra. And that kiss? Also strangely familiar. And now the clincher. You guessed it: Also familiar. I don't know why, I don't know how, but I do know that is not Aaron. It's Roman. _"
"All righty as you know, Jane was accidentally inseminated by Rafael's sperm, and, man, so much has happened since then. First she broke up with her detective fiancé Michael because she fell for Rafael. Unfortunately things were a little rocky between them at the moment. See, Rafael proposed but Jane said no, because it was just too damn soon. For me, it was all about family and how badly I've wanted a family. And so Jane encouraged him to search for his mother, who left when he was four. Adding to Rafael's stress, the Marbella Hotel had just lost its liquor license. And as Rafael focused more on work, Jane started to get nervous. I'm scared it's gonna all be on me. All the child care. Meanwhile, Petra had been growing closer to Aaron, the twin brother of her ex-lover Roman. You remember Roman, right? I don't why, I don't know how, but I do know that is not Aaron. It's Roman. Wow, a mother of a twist. And speaking of mothers, Xo just learned what was holding Rogelio back - from saying ""I love you."" - The animosity that exists between - you and my mother. - And so he invited her to visit. Which means Jane's grandma is coming to town. Ah, Easter. The Villanuevas' favorite time of year. Young Jane looked forward to the chocolate eggs. Don't fill up. We have a huge meal to eat. Xiomara looked forward - to busting out her spring wardrobe. - Ah _ _ _ And Alba? Well, she looked forward to celebrating the resurrection of her Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that he should be holden of it. It should be noted that it wasn't just about chocolate eggs for Jane. She had been raised a devout Catholic as well. _ But one year, her natural curiosity combined with a penchant for overthinking resulted in: Really? - _ - He rose from the dead? And rolled a giant, heavy stone - all by himself? - Please kneel. Behold the Lamb of God, which take that away the sin of the world. Happy are those who are called to his supper. Seriously? That stale cracker from the deli is supposed to be the body of Christ? _ Don't get mad, but what if Jesus' disciples just thought he died, but he really didn't so he actually wasn't resurrected? He just kind of woke up. _ _ _ But what if he _ _ _ Which made sense to Jane. So she vowed to banish her doubts. _ But some doubts are more difficult to shake. Breathe, breathe. Oh, baby I am so sorry, I have to take this. Okay. I am so sorry. Hey, hold on, stepping outside now. Jane told herself that it was okay. That call was important. More important than your baby? She reminded herself the hotel was in trouble. - It was a one-time thing. - Yeah, right. Rafael had to get the liquor license back. - It's always gonna be something. - Now let's move on to the standing supported squat. Gonna take the squat position and let's really lean against our partners, ladies. Get ready, Jane. This is gonna be our life. _ Okay, you seem mad. I'm really not. Okay, disappointed, then. I just asked you to turn it off for an hour. I know, but hotels are 24-hour things, and, look, I couldn't miss that call. That was Graham Falco. He's a family friend, his wife's the city commissioner, and she could get our liquor license hearing moved up. Graham suggested we talk about it over dinner. - So I guess that's a good thing. - Good. So I'm going to go and meet - my other grandmother. - Hey. - Come over later? - Can't. We are 48 hours out and there is some hard-core Easter prep going down tonight. Well, I am excited for my first Villanueva - family Easter. - Me, too. He'll definitely have his phone on. I don't know if this is working. _ - What is it? - An aromatherapy diffuser. Rogelio wants the whole place to smell like lavender for his mom. - Seems slightly excessive. - Oh, no, excessive is his list. _ _ _ Are they displayed lovingly enough? Mom. It's gonna be okay. What happened well, it was a long time ago. I should probably explain. In 1991, Rogelio's mom walked in on them in flagrante, so to speak. And she was so shocked, she tripped on a lamp cord. The lamp fell, electrocuting her cat, Gordito. She's always gonna hate me. We're home. Mom. You can do this. Win her back. Yeah. Jane, Xiomara, here is my glorious mother. _ Oh, my beautiful granddaughter. Oh, let me look at you, no, I can't, I have to hug you first. Oh! If only there were a way to capture this moment and freeze it in time. Take a picture. Of course. You've got so much de la Vega in your face. Thank God. Oh, Xiomara. Hello. Did that offend you? That I thanked the Lord for my beautiful grandchild? Wh-What? No. No? Oh, well, you rolled your eyes. I was just looking to Heaven, to thank God for bringing you here. My mom and my other grandma would love to have you over for Easter, right, Mom? Yes. We'd love to have you. Perfect. That would be so wonderful. So, Rogelio, show me your enormous home. - Of course. - Stand up straight. You must really love living here, huh? Quite the upgrade, I'm sure. Stay calm, she's only here for a week. You're right. - I can handle it. - Mm-hmm. I can't handle it. - _ - Look, I agree, she took some cheap shots. No, she had Rogelio make a dinner reservation just for the two of them. And she called my singing career a little hobby. Screw her. If she doesn't like me, well, guess what. I don't like her. Okay, stop. Stop. You see, this is what you do. You get insulted and then - you self-sabotage. - No, I don't. _ _ _ - Jesus never met Liliana de la Vega. - Ma, if you feel yourself getting worked up, just take nice, slow, deep breaths. Learned that in childbirth class. Oh, yeah, that's right, I forgot about that. Did you and Rafael have fun? It should be noted that at this moment, Jane desperately wanted to talk to her mother, tell her about her doubts. But she also didn't want to hear ""I told you so."" Yeah. We did have fun. But still, Jane knew she had to talk to someone. _ Yeah. Not the greatest choice. You'll recall, when we last saw Andie, she was reconnecting with her ex-boyfriend I heard you and Jane broke up. Who was also Jane's ex-boyfriend, though Jane didn't know that yet. You look nice. - I just saw my ex. - Ooh! Tomorrow night he's taking me to Tresoro, that place by the beach. - Third night in a row? - Mm-hmm. - Ugh. -  Sorry. Can we talk, actually? I kind of need to vent. And it's hard to talk to people in my day-to-day life, because then it'll become a thing, and I just don't know if it's a thing yet. Okay, what's going on? I'm having all these doubts about Rafael. What kind of doubts? Like, high-level ones. Like, do we want the same things in life? Do we see our lives the same way? And with Michael my ex Anyway, this is not about him, except to say that we wanted the same things. And with Rafael, I don't I-I'm not sure that we do. It's probably hormones. Oh. My sister totally freaked out on my brother-in-law when she was pregnant. And once she had the baby, things went back to normal. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Just don't do anything rash. And so Jane did her best to ignore her doubts about Rafael. She blamed it on hormones. _ Even when this happened. _ Yup. Called that one. _ _ Excuse me. Excuse me, miss? Finally. I've been trying to get your attention forever, but you were too busy checking your phone. I'm sorry. It's just been one of those days. Oh, please. Pregnant and apparently unmarried is not an excuse for poor service. Excuse me? In any case, now that I have you here, my Arnold Palmer is too tart and my knife is dirty. Do you think you could take care of that or do you need to consult your phone first? Can you maybe just not be rude? Excuse me? I get it. I was on the phone, and I am really sorry. But I'm also a person, and it would be nice if you talked to me like one. I could get you fired. I'd like to see you try. Go, Jane. You okay? Yeah. I just had the rudest customer ever. I mean, seriously, this woman was the worst human being in the world. That sounds really bad. Oh. Hey. Uh, Jane, this is Graham Falco. He's the family friend that I'm having dinner with tonight. - _ - And, Graham, this is my girlfriend, Jane. Nice to meet you. - You, too. And I'm sorry you overheard - Oh, not at all. I'm sorry you had such a rude customer. There's Alexis. _ _ We might have a problem. This is Rafael and Jane. We've already met. I don't think I'm up for dinner tonight after all. Jane can explain. I'm so sorry. I had no idea. - No, I know. - How do I fix it? An apology letter. I write good apology letters. Let-let me think about it, okay? I'll figure something out. Not the answer he was looking for. But it was an answer, all the same. From a private investigator he hired. _ Why are you ignoring my calls? I've just I've just been busy working an angle to try to get this liquor license hearing moved up. Great. And in the meantime, Aaron tells me he's leaving to go back to India in three days. - We have to call the police. Now. - Petra, stop. - Aaron is not Roman. - Look, he obviously lured his brother out here somehow, killed him, and now he's taking his place. Are you even hearing yourself? - I know it sounds crazy - Look, you asked me to have a drink with him, and I did. Trust me, that is not the same guy that I shared a room with in college. It's not him. So finally I just had to get the operation, you know, because I couldn't take long walks anymore. Mmm. I mean, why live in Miami if you can't take long walks? Ah, yes. Remember Edward? _ _ I'll see you next Saturday, I hope? _ - Bye-bye. - Bye. So, did you drop the hint about the new Peruvian place on Ocean? _ _ _ - Okay. Got it. -  Maybe you could star in your own telenovela, Ma. Rehabilitated Love. _ Hey, wait, save some flour for my pan dulce. _ Lo haré, lo haré. The more food the better. Let's put Liliana in a food coma. Or, better yet, a real one. _ _ We got to tag-team, okay? Make sure that she stays calm. Mm. Hey, baby. So I hate to ask this Ask what? So, I talked to Graham, and there's this Easter thing where they all go to church and then they have brunch at the Golden Harbor Yacht Club. Where we met Yeah. I remember. Anyway, he invited me. Well, us. I know how important your Easter is and I would never ask, except that the Falcos are traveling overseas next week, and if you could just smooth things over with Mrs. Falco, then maybe they can move up the liquor license hearing. The hotel is struggling, Jane, - without our liquor license. - No, I get it. - I'll come, of course. - Oh, what a disappointment. _ I know. And I'm so sorry. It's just I really screwed up with this woman, and it's my only chance to smooth things over. No, I-I understand. And I think it's wonderful you're standing by your man. _ _ And speaking of Rogelio's looking thirsty. I'm slightly parched. Ah. Room temperature water. Two lemons. Alba, you are just as I remembered. Estás igualita Behave yourself. I won't be here, but I'll know. And Petra knew that she needed proof that Aaron was really Roman. Aaron. Hi. Where are you? Do you want to grab some lunch? Uh, I'm just on my way out. I won't be back for a few hours. Oh. Oh. That's too bad. - Dinner later? - Uh, in the lounge? Perfect. _ Wait. I thought he was leaving. Hi. Sorry. Yeah, I'll-I'll be down in a second. I, um I, uh, forgot my wallet. Okay. Whoa. He missed her by a hair. Michael. Hi. It's Petra. I need you to come meet me at the Marbella. It's important. - Hey, Jane. - Hey. Why aren't you at church with your family? Oh, I'm just going to a different church this year. With Rafael. What are you doing here? Oh, I have a meeting. Must be some meeting. You're wearing your date sweater. Oh. Okay. Well, first of all, this isn't just a date sweater. And second of all, I do have a date. With my ex. Andrea. Or Andie, I guess she goes by now. - Andie? - Yeah. Jane told herself that it was just a coincidence, that it couldn't be the same woman. Where-where are you going? Anywhere special? Uh, Tresoro. This new place by the beach. Tomorrow night he's taking me to Tresoro, that place by the beach. Um, she reached out to me after she saw you and I broke up on Facebook. I guess she's been lightly stalkin' me. Well, that's what she said, anyway, but Yeah, not so lightly. - Look, Michael, I - Hey. Are you ready to go? Mm-hmm. - Happy Easter, Michael. - Yeah, you, too. Look, if you're upset that Michael was at the hotel, I'm sorry. That No, no, no, no, no. That's not it. My private investigator found an e-mail address for my mother. - What? When? - Yesterday. It's kind of thrown me for a-a loop since then. Because I just keep going back, remembering the last time that I saw her. Anyway, uh I don't even know if she'd even respond. That would be awful. But I guess the question is is that worse than not knowing? I mean, for me, growing up without a dad, I never stopped wondering who he was. Yeah. I know. And I heard your voice in my head saying that when I was trying to decide what to do. So I e-mailed her. Really? Yeah. No response yet but I think it's good. I really do. There are the Falcos. Well, you look fantastic. It's good to see you. Welcome to Holy Trinity. Welcome to Holy Trinity. Wow. God really does work in mysterious ways. _ Fine. I'll apologize if you call rehab guy and ask him out. Okay. Really? Geez, I didn't think you'd say yes. _ - ÿTe gusta? - Muchísimo. Mrs. de la Vega, look, I-I just want to clear the air before we go. I'm really sorry about everything. Especially your cat. And I hope that we can start over and move on. That is a beautiful sentiment, Xiomara. Forgiveness is one of my mother's - many wonderful qualities. - It is. Look, I can forgive the cat. Even though the stench of Gordito's scorched fur will forever haunt me. But I cannot forgive the fact that you never told my son that you were pregnant. Wait. But she did. - Excuse me? - And as a result, you deprived me of my granddaughter. And Rogelio didn't get to raise his child. I am sorry, but I cannot get past that. Let's go! We shouldn't We'll be late for church, - especially on Easter. - Well, okay Why does she think I never told you I was pregnant? My mother sees me a certain way, and I don't want to disappoint her. You know how much her approval means. Well, what about her approval of me? You said that was the only thing holding you back from saying ""I love you."" You're sabotaging us. I meant to tell her. I mean, I will. I will. When? On her deathbed. Bad joke. I'm sorry. I'm very nervous. I'm sorry. I will. I promise I'll tell her. Tomorrow. Today is a holy day. I cannot say the word ""abortion"" on Easter. It seems that Rogelio can be very religious when it suits him. - _ - And also praying for a miracle Rafael, who needed Jane to make things right with Mrs. Falco. There she is. Uh now go smoke a cigar or whatever you do at a yacht club. - You got this? - Mm-hmm. Thank you. Mrs. Falco? - Hi. - Jane. I heard you were coming. I'm about to have lunch with my friends. Care to join? Ew. That looks like torture. I would love that. And-and I just wanted to say, about the other day I was having a moment, and I took it out on you, and I am really so sorry. Are you really so sorry? Or do you want me to help with your boyfriend's liquor license? Maybe a little of both? Please, just run the fingerprints. You've been investigating Roman's murder for months. I mean, maybe the reason you can't solve it - is because he isn't really dead. - Roman had a record. We have his prints on file. I'll run them. We're supposed to be having dinner tonight in the lounge. You'll be fine. I'll have eyes down there. But the second we get a positive match we'll move. Man, that is going to be one awkward meal. Much like this one. Ladies, this is Jane - What is your last name? - Villanueva. Mm. Are you related to the very famous Bolivian architect? Oh, no, not that I know of. Ladies, what have we missed? Just discussing the travesty that was Art Basel. I mean, it's become too much around the parties. No one's interested in the art. Well, unless Jay Jopling wants something. - Then everyone pounces. - Oh. Interesting. Jane, what do you think? Well, I've heard that the Art Berlin Contemporary is the place to be if you really want to talk art. Apparently, Berlin gets all the big ones Martin Eder, Christian Jankowski You're so right, Jane! But it was controversial to include James Moses as a judge at the Westminster Dog Show. New botanical garden is just breathtaking. I think an elegant piaffe is the most underrated movement in dressage. What? Did you doubt Jane? _ Remember, she was an ""A"" student. She always did her homework. What a wonderful lunch companion you've brought us, Alexis. Only one problem. It seems the more Jane charms these ladies, the more irritated Alexis is becoming. Which does make sense considering she's _ Xiomara may have had a different opinion on who deserved that title. So, Rogelio tells me that you do not like to cook. Of course at that moment, she wasn't sure which de la Vega it was. - _ - Though now, I guess you have my son's chef. Why would you need to? Okay, it's the mother. - Mom, that's enough. - ÿQué? Xiomara is not the person you should be angry at. You should be angry at me. Rogelio, what is it? Niño inhala. Exhala. _ Sí. Xiomara did tell me she was pregnant. And I told her she should get an abortion. And also a perm. But the abortion was a way worse part. So you cannot blame her for not wanting to get back in touch with me. How could you not tell me this? I was ashamed. And you know I don't want to disappoint you. Well you have. It's your daughter's birthday, Graham. It only happens once a year. I know, but we're closing on a tech deal in Palo Alto. Will your mistress be there? Yes. She will. Do you want a divorce? I didn't think so. How much of that did you hear? Well, um most all of it. I heard all of it. We have a reputation here at the club. Perhaps, in exchange for your silence, I will help your boyfriend with his liquor license. Regardless of the liquor license, I'd never say anything. I suppose I seem pathetic to you. No, you don't. And you should know, I grew up without a father. And the one thing I remember about my birthdays is, my mom was there. And that's what your daughter will remember, too. Thank you. And I, um I owe you an apology for lashing out at you the other day. I was having well a moment. And for the first time, Jane realized that Mrs. Falco wasn't the worst person in the world. She was just a person. But that knife was very filthy. Though clearly not a perfect one. - Xiomara, I want to apologize. - No, you don't. Oh, yes, I do. I was very rude to you. I blamed you for something that you did not even do. I wish you had told me sooner, but I understand I understand that you were scared, so - Thank you, Mother. I'm sorry, Mother. - Yes, thank you. You see? I'm very reasonable. Which is why I hope you'll both listen when I tell you to end this relationship. - What?! - Mother! You two are not suited to each other. You are both too headstrong and too proud. That is not true. I pride myself on not being too proud. Impetuous, then. You moved in together. What was the long-term plan? Did you talk about it? Well, not specifically. Xiomara, you had a little girl. You got to raise her. Don't you want that for Rogelio? I mean, if he wants it - More children? Of course I do. - You do? But not for a number of years. A number of years. Oh. I hate to bring this up but I-I really do but I have to. Xiomara how old are you? Excuse me? Don't you think, darling, that hearing what Rogelio wants, and when, maybe you're a little bit too old? You know what? I'm out of here. Xiomara, wait. Wait? You know what? I can't. Because otherwise, I'm gonna say something to your mother that neither of us wants me to say. - How could you talk to her like that?! - Listen. I was right about wife number one. I was right about wife number two. I know it's hard to hear, darling, but I want to spare you that pain of a third time. Oh. Did he just turn his phone back on? So he can turn it off. He just gets to choose the time. What? Nothing. It's just that you made such a big deal before about how you can't turn off your phone because the hotel's 24 hours. It was important. Important to you. But what about the stuff that's important to us? What's going on? It's just The life where the husband's always gone and work always comes first I don't want that. Me neither. You know how important family is to me. Okay, now you look disappointed again. Because I want to be successful. I'm being realistic. It comes with a cost. And I would be providing for our child. Like your father provided for you, except he was always gone, and I'd rather have you. I'm not like my father. I know. That's why I don't want you getting sucked into living his life. - It's not that simple. - I never said it was simple. Anyway, I should just go help my grandma clean up Easter. I'll see you later. Ah, yes, Xiomara. She was trying to get Rogelio out of her mind, which was easier said than done. Can you turn that off? Thanks. Another white wine, please. Xiomara? _ - Hi. - Hi. It's been A few months. Yeah. I've never seen you in here before. I-I just moved to the neighborhood. In with Rogelio. Wow. Well, congratulations. That's a big step. Yeah. Thanks. Things are going well, then? With Rogelio? Oh, yeah. So, why are you here? Alone? And Mom behaved? _ _ Abuela. Everything okay? _ Who? _ - Abuela? - Mm-hmm. Here's the thing. Um Edward's a priest. _ I saw him at Holy Trinity. He's a priest. _ _ Oh! I'm sorry, Abuela. Ay. _ _ Ooh. Rehabilitated Love, Thorn Birds edition. And it seems forbidden love is in the air. Rogelio should have made her leave. I'm serious. If someone had spoken to you like that in front of me, made you feel any less than the incredible woman that you are It should be noted that if Jane were here, she would tell Xo to stop, not to self-sabotage. Well, I'd never let that happen. But alas, Jane was not here. I shouldn't have done that. Xo I'm sorry. I should go. _ Not good. I just think we're so different, Abuela. And today I mean, it's, like, a extreme example but I just saw my life unfolding like that. You know, he's never around, I resent it, make compromises. _ Ah that he'll be there, that everything will work out. But I don't think I believe that. Because practically _ _ _ _ _ _ Who? Rafael. What are you doing here? I wanted to see your face. _ _ - About Rafael? - Yes. Like you predicted. But to her surprise, Xiomara said: Don't let doubts get in the way. You know how I self-sabotage and start getting all self-righteous and acting out? Well, this is how you do it. You start to doubt things. Because I see very clearly what's in front of me. And if you look at something through that doubting lens, well it will fall apart. Think about how quickly you ended things with Michael when you started to doubt him. That's true. But that's not the reason that I broke up with Michael. I broke up with Michael because I was falling in love with Rafael. That was before you really knew him. So think about those qualities the reason you fell for him. But are they enough? _ _ _ Well, that would be foolish, because You're right. Thank you. Thanks. And good news we got our hearing pushed up, so we should have our liquor license back by the end of next week. Rafael? Mom. I heard about your father's passing. I'm so sorry. Our relationship was, um complicated. He was very proud of you. He wrote me this letter. I thought you might want it. You were 18, graduating high school. It's full of all these hopes for you, really. Things he wanted you to accomplish. Sanibel Island? Is that where you live? Yes. That's less than three hours away. - I know. And I know you must have so many questions. - Yeah, I do. Like, why'd you leave? Why didn't you get in touch? Look, y-your father and I we were a mistake from the beginning. So different. It was a it was a whirlwind, falling in love. But after that, I-I wasn't happy. I'm not proud of it, but I cheated on him. And after he found out, he-he wanted me gone. Did you fight for me? He offered me $10 million to go away and I took it. What? What? He wanted I promised not to get in touch. And to survive I had to put you out of my head completely. Uh, I remarried. You actually have a half brother. You know, it's funny. When I would think about reaching out, I always thought that the worst-case scenario was that you just wouldn't respond. I was wrong. And speaking of worst-case scenarios So we need to talk. Yes, we do. I brought my mother to the airport. She's on her way home. What? No one disrespects the woman I love. You love me? I do. But what about all that stuff that she said? Who cares if your eggs are too old? We'll buy fresh ones. Combine my DNA with anyone, and the child will be extraordinary. I love you, Xiomara. I do. So, really, how could she tell him then about that one small kiss? I love you, too. When are the fingerprint results coming in? I'm supposed to be having dinner with Aaron downstairs in five minutes! I should get a call from the lab any minute, and I'll call you as soon as I hear. I'm already at the hotel. Got two guys in the lounge. Just try to relax. Okay. Hey. More business here? Oh, just waiting on a call. Cool. Don't forget to tell him about Andie. Hey, uh remember when we were talking about your date? Yeah. Yeah. - Um - It was really good, actually. It was probably the most fun I've had since you know, us. I know you've been worried about me moving on and all, and with Andie, I don't know, I just feel like I am. Finally. So, really, how could she tell him? I'm glad you're happy. Oh, no, the restaurant's on two. Oh, change of plans. I made a reservation at a new place. Detective Cordero. Petra? Where are you? Call me back. You were right it's Roman. - We're going a little fast, Aaron, don't you think? - Come on, baby. _ Uh-oh. I guess he didn't miss her by a hair. I know you know who I am. Hey. Why didn't you pick up your phone? I called, like, ten times. Because his mom just dropped a $10 million bomb on him. I just wasn't in a talking mood. And I'm definitely not in the mood for a lecture. No one's lecturing. I've-I've just been thinking about things. Overthinking. Letting my doubts get in the way instead of believing you. I know you're not your father. Well, maybe I am. And why is that a bad thing? He was there. He provided for me. - I know that. - No, you don't. We're different people. Jane, we come from different people. What are you talking about? I'm talking about who I am. Where I come from. I want to be successful. I want to leave something for my child like my father left something for me, and right now I can't seem to do that without disappointing you. - That's not true. - It is. I am, all the time. We just have to find a balance. Maybe you were right this whole time. Maybe we are just too different. Maybe we should stop trying to force this relationship. What are you saying? We have a baby coming. We both have to figure out how to be good parents. Maybe that's enough to focus on. So you want to break up. I think we should take a break. You want to break up. If that's what you want to call it. Maybe a leap of faith works with religion, but in real life, with real people, who have real sadness, and sin Maybe those doubts are there for a reason. _"
"Hi, friends. As a young girl, Jane was taught to protect her flower. _ _ _ _ And so Jane did, but then she was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm, and things got really crazy from there. First, Jane broke up with her detective fiancé, Michael, because she fell for Rafael, but Rafael was going through a lot. His father died, and his long-lost mother showed up and dropped a bomb. So Rafael cracked Maybe we should take a break. Leaving Jane devastated. And Petra realized her mom was a psycho who was pretending to be in a wheelchair to control her. Just get out now! On the bright side, Jane was pursuing her dream. See, Jane wanted to become a romance writer, so she joined a writers' group led by Amanda Elaine, and there she met a new friend, Andie. - Hi. - But then Jane found out Andie was only there to check her out, - because she used to date Michael. - Hi. Pretty dramatic stuff. Also dramatic, Jane's mother had fallen in love with her father, but unfortunately, his mother did not approve. Oh, and remember our criminal, Roman Zazo? Well, his twin brother, Aaron, showed up, only it wasn't Aaron; it was Roman. I know you know who I am. So let's dive in. Ah, yes. Sex education. A rite of passage, if you will. Alas, since Jane went to a Catholic school, the lesson was rather brief. Don't do it. Understand? Leaving the kids with questions. Questions that Jane knew she could help answer. Okay, good. Now take your flower and crumple it up. Now try to make it look new again. That's what happens when you have sex. Actually, that's not what happens. _ Trust me, I have four sisters. I know where everything goes and when and for how long. But Jane held on to her version, to what she knew was right, and she was determined to hold on now. So you know, it had been exactly since Rafael had broken up with Jane, and in that time, Jane had cycled rather quickly through the seven stages of grief. _ _ _ Nothing. _ He broke up with me, Mom! Can you believe it?! - _ - What a piece of Please, God, help him realize he made a mistake, - _ - and in exchange, I'll send our daughter to Catholic school. - _ - It's my fault. Why couldn't I just leave it alone? His father died. The hotel was his legacy. And I started to doubt him. _ _ I'm tired. All leading up to _ This is a mistake. Or in Jane's case _ Jane. We've been having some problems, yes, but we can fix this. First of all, what happened last night? - Nothing. - If you call seeing your mother for the first time in 27 years nothing. I don't believe you. Did I do something? - No. - Then what? Because you don't just go from asking someone to marry you to breaking up. That doesn't just happen. I realized that we were too different. We jumped in, and so much was good, but long-term it just wouldn't work. How do you know? Because I was constantly disappointing you. And you were having major doubts, too. And isn't it better for us to know now, for our baby? - No, better for the baby is us together. - Not if we're always fighting. Then we work on it; we don't just give up. Who's getting excited for a baby shower?! It's tomorrow; so much to set up! Which way to the kitchen? - I'm gonna throw onesies outside. - Over here, you guys. Okay, come on, I need a picture. I don't have any pictures with you together. Smile! Ah! You guys are the cutest couple ever. _ Ah, yes, here we are, - with our other cute couple. - Ow! You're hurting me, Roman! _ Move. - What is this place? - Everglades. So don't bother screaming, 'cause no one can hear you. You should know I killed my brother. I won't hesitate to kill you. Still no answer from Petra. I told her to act normal around Roman till the fingerprint results came in. Look, we have an APB out on his car. We're gonna find them. I'm surprised it hasn't been all over the news yet. I don't like to use the term ""triple threat,"" because it suggests that I'm limited to only three skills, but the fact is, in addition to acting and dancing, I'm a rather phenomenal singer. And now, at last, I have been offered a Las Vegas residency. Like Britney Spears. Though mine is only for one night. Well, congratulations. And to you, too, Xiomara. Because I told them I will only do it if you open for me, and they agreed. And they have arranged a photo shoot for us. You may wonder why Xiomara isn't jumping for joy. Well, remember this? _ So she was pretty much wracked with guilt. Xiomara, why are you not jumping for joy? I just I can't believe you did this for me. Also in disbelief Am I being practical or brave? Be brave. Oh! Oh, God! Jane? - Huh? - You know how I'm a little psychic? I can't agree with that. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I sensed something wrong between you and Rafael upstairs. Dude, you guys okay? I don't know. I mean, we've been having problems, but last night, he just kind of freaked out. Okay, I don't know if this has anything to do with it, but I did see him having a super intense conversation last night. With who? A woman, older. What time was it at? Oh, my God. Elena Di Nola? Who's that? His mother. This is what must have happened. It had to do with his mother. - _ - Something bad must have happened to her, and now he's pushing you away! - _ - Don't throw in the towel. He's pulling away because he's hurt, but now that you know what's going on, you can fix this. - _ - Fight for our love, Jane. Fight for our love. I will. Hmm? I have to talk to Rafael. Can I come in? Yeah, yeah, of course. Why didn't you tell me you saw your mom last night? Lina saw you with someone, and I checked the receipts. I would've been there for you. I know. Sh-She got my e-mail and came. Said she wanted to talk about what happened, why she left, so that I could decide whether or not I wanted to have a relationship with her. And what'd she say? That she took ten million dollars from my father to leave and never see me again. - I'm so sorry. - Jane, wait. I know that you think that that's why I'm doing this, that they're somehow related. - They are. - But they're not. And that's why I didn't tell you. Look, this is about the fact that we want different things, and that I am constantly disappointing you. Rafael, stop. I love you. Do you still love me? Yes. But that doesn't mean that I can make you happy. Or that we should be together. No, but it means that we can work on it. Please, don't just walk away. Work on it how? Maybe couple's therapy. I know people that swear by it. I'll find someone great. I'll drop the Solano name if I have to. Please? Sure, I'll hold. _ _ She has a cancellation? That's amazing. Yes, perfect. - We'll be there. - Where you going? Couple's therapist - with Rafael. - Seriously? Yeah, I mean, I don't know what else to do. I hope it helps. So, hey, if you have, like, five minutes at the end of your session to ask, like, a little question for me. What's going on? I-I kissed Marco last night. - You did what? - I know, I know, I know. What is the matter with you? Wh-Why would you do that? Ugh, Rogelio's mom was being so mean to me, and I thought that he was gonna listen to her - and break up with me, so I - Self-sabotaged? Why? Why do that? I don't know. It was stupid. I know what you're gonna say. I have to tell him, right? I don't know. I mean, normally, I would say yes, but this is Rogelio we're talking about. He's a very proud man with a very healthy ego. So you're saying don't tell him? I'm saying I don't know. And I'm gonna make a therapy appointment for you. Apparently, she's very good. She's got, like, seven letters after her name. - _ - It's nice to meet you. _ Thanks for squeezing us in. Of course. So why don't you give me a little backstory. Your relationship in a nutshell. Should I? Yeah, why don't you. Okay. Um Well, for starters, I was accidentally artificially inseminated with Rafael's sperm. Oh. Is that so? But we had met five years before that. My sister was the inseminator. I'm a virgin, actually. Boop. And then my ex-wife punched herself in the face so she could have me arrested. And then my ex-fiancé found secret plastic surgery tunnels in his hotel. And then my father was murdered. My father turned out to be the guy from The Passions of Santos. And my father's killer ended up being my stepmother, Sin Rostro. So that's us. In a nutshell. But we actually were coming here because we have, like, normal couple bumps, which we wanted to talk to you about. So what's been going on? Well we're very different. And we grew up very differently. And I think that we're just having trouble navigating through that. But we love each other. And we want to fix this. Mmm. - Do you? - Do I love her? Yes. Want to fix this. I just don't know if these are things that can be fixed. Well, let's dive in. So what's the plan? Sin Rostro's gone underground, so I'm gonna run things from Cuba. They're flailing down there. They need someone to step in. She'll come after you. Let her try. I've got all her contacts now and a lot of angry guys who were cut out when she started this plastic surgery crap. Well, it sounds like you got it all planned out, Roman. Down to killing his twin brother in order to fake his own death. Take me with you. Come on, I know you want to. You got the flash drive back weeks ago; why else did you stay? I was evaluating my options. Come on, we want the same things out of life. You know that. Money. Lots and lots of money. The kind of money you're talking about. Wow. So you're not gonna even try and pretend to be in love with me. You'd know I was lying. 'Cause you know me. Just like I know you. And I knew it was you from the moment you kissed me as Aaron. Well, it sounds like there's definitely a lot of love. You support each other's dreams. You're both committed to being good parents, although your ideas of that might be different. Good job! This was a great idea! I'm so proud of us for coming here. At the same time, you do have some differences, and they are not small ones, which means you're both going to have to be willing to make some big compromises. So think about that. Unfortunately, we're out of time. But I'm going to give you some exercises that help with intimacy, communication, reconnecting. Great, fantastic! I'm great at tests. Although I am sensing some reluctance from you, Rafael. When she said ""exercises,"" I thought she meant this. And your reluctance would make sense, hmm? After everything you've been through a divorce, the death of your father, the traumatic meeting with your mother you might not be emotionally available to give Jane what she needs. Yes, exactly. That's what I've been trying to say. - Who is this quack?! - We need a new therapist. So the question becomes: are you willing to do the work? Tell him he has to. And only you can answer that. Andie, hey. Hey. Been trying to reach you. You remember Andie, right? Used to date Michael, used to stalk Jane. Yeah, it's been crazy today. I-I'm sorry that I had to cancel tonight. Oh, no, I understand. Everything okay? Yes, I think. I like you, that's all. So I just wanted to check in before this goes any further. Are we having an official talk? So soon? I know. I know it's too soon. It just doesn't feel like it's too soon because of our history. Officially, I like you, too. In fact, I I even told my parents, a few friends, Jane Uh-oh. What? My ex, I ran into her. Um, recently? Hey, we got a tip on Roman's car. Hey, listen, uh, I got to go, okay? - I'll call you later. - Uh He was spotted northbound on the Tamiami Trail. It's one of only two roads that cuts through the Everglades. So that's where he's headed, then. Yep. Let's go. You know where you don't want to go after you've spent an emotionally and financially draining hour dissecting your relationship? Hi! Hey! Yep, this is pretty much it. Yay, you're here! Hey. This is great. Mama. - Come. - Wow. Lena, why is my romance writer's group here? I asked if I should invite them, and you said, ""Yeah"" I said, ""Yeah."" Oh, sorry, my bad. Hello, Jane. Hey. We're so touched you invited us. Oh, of course, how could I not? Oh, look, even Phil's here. Hey, Phil. What are you doing here? Oh, baby. Hey, can we talk real quick? So you know. That you stalked me. And are apparently still stalking me. I didn't mean to. I saw on Facebook that you and Michael broke up, and I had a mutual friend sort of feel him out. And she said he was still hung up on you. I was curious. Jane? Get in here. I have to ask. Would you maybe consider not telling Michael? Okay, so we are going to officially kick off the shower with a very special performance. Jane. Please accept my gift to you, the gift of music. This is a preview of a song you will be hearing very soon at my one-night-only Las Vegas residency. A song that my grandchild will hear at bedtime. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ That's for Tampa. Well, that certainly livened things up. Jane, I am so sorry, truly. I-I'm just No, it's okay. But how do you know my father? How do you know Jane's writing teacher? A few years ago, we were developing a screen adaptation of Love Under the Bridge, and he was interested in the lead. We were on a couch, talking about casting, so I assumed it was a casting couch situation. We fell for each other. We slept with each other. Uh, but he didn't get the role. And I didn't get the role. I didn't realize that sleeping with a writer was pointless. So he never showed up for our romantic getaway in Tampa. I didn't go to Tampa, but it seems she still holds a grudge. Of course, I still hold a grudge. You need to apologize right now. Okay, I sent her a Rogelio gift basket, and I included two varieties of smoked meats. Please, Dad. It's my writing teacher. So I wanted to make a little toast to Jane. Most of you know, but for those that don't, Jane and I met in the fifth grade when I hijacked her sex ed lesson. Anyway, I don't like all that sappy stuff, but I was just thinking about it, and that's just a really lucky baby to get you as a mom. Uh, anyway, that's it. Don't forget to put your guesses for the birth date in the jar. All right. Thank you. - For all of this. - Of course. And I'm so winning the birth date lottery. Guessed May 25, a week before your due date. Am I right? Well, I mean, I'm not sure yet. Really? When my sisters get C-sections, they schedule it a week before. I wasn't gonna have one. What? You're gonna lose your virginity to your baby? Well, I wasn't thinking about it like that. Well, you should! Hello. My name's Petra Solano. I've been kidnapped. I'm being held in the Everglades near mile marker 42. Please tell Detective Michael Cordero from the Miami By mile 42 she said. We're on it. Call for backup. Roman please You bitch. Run, Petra! Run! Petra! It's over, Petra. Where'd you go? Back here? Petra _ _ Petra? It's okay, it's okay. You're safe. We're gonna take you back. It's okay. It's right. It's okay. _ Yeah. I'm pretty showered out. Want to gently suggest to Lina that we call it? Oh, she's waiting for Rafael to show up with the flowers and stuff. Mom, we're not in a great place. I-I just I don't think Look who's here! Okay, one more activity. - I didn't know if you were - No. - Of course I'd be here. - Okay. So, Jane and Rafael filled these out a few weeks ago. Let's see how they did. What song is Rafael excited to play for the baby? Dad! No, no. Bon Jovi's ""Living on a Prayer"" Rafael, what does Jane want the baby's first word to be? - Uh, ""Abuela""? -  Kiss-ass. _ Yeah, but I'll be Abuela now. Jane? It's ""Daddy"" actually. Okay. Jane, what traits do you think Rafael wants the baby to get from you? My taste in music clearly. My professional level capacity for organization? Rafael? Uh everything. The more Jane the better. There's nothing I don't love about her. And hearing his own words reminded him how much he did. Let's try at least. Yeah? Yeah. Break out those exercises, huh? We're gonna get you checked out, and then we're gonna take you home, okay? Nadine. Look at this. Flash drive. Maybe the other one was a decoy. I just wanted to say that I'm truly sorry for not making love to you in Tampa. Thank you for saying that. You're so very welcome. So, uh, we'll just move on and, uh, chalk it up to youthful indiscretions. Yes. Although we-we shouldn't use the word ""youthful"" when retelling the story. Then people might think we are not youthful now. Oh, Rogelio. May I say that you are still as charming as I remember you? You may. Oh, time has been very kind to you. Well, I moisturize seven times a day, so.. Oh. Amanda, I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression, but I am officially a taken man. And I will not be led astray. I see. All right, well, let me know if they make any progress with the flash drive. Yeah, I'm hearing tomorrow, the earliest. Hey. Is this a bad time? I was just heading out actually. I'll see you later. What a nice surprise. So, um I have to tell you something. It's about Jane. So it's kind of just a staring contest? It's not a contest. It's an exercise. Three minutes, no talking. You ready? 'Cause I'm gonna crush this. Even though it's not a contest? I'm just saying, I'm bringing my ""A"" game you ready? I'm ready. Okay. Starting now. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Should we stop and just try another exercise? - That's a great idea. - Okay. Let's see. Um Here's a list of spontaneous activities to help foster intimacy. But doesn't a list of spontaneous activities kind of defeat the purpose? Yes. Screw the list. Let's go rogue. What are you thinking? Skinny dipping. What? Come on, you wouldn't. I have. Twice. In public? No. But I'm about to. Are you ? Are you serious? You like that, huh? Whoa! What? There is no splashing in the pool. That is hotel rules. There's a sign right there. Is that so? - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. God, I missed you. Me, too. So much. I love you. I love you. So maybe now it's the time. ""The time""? Yes. Let's have sex. Wait, what? We're having a baby. And I love you. Let's do it. I want to. Are you sure? I am. Okay. Okay. Hey, the pool area is closed! Oh, uh, sorry, Mr. Solano. - I didn't know it was you. - Hey, Nick. - I'm gonna - We were just, uh I'm sorry. And you almost had sex? Yes. I would've. Another minute oh. Well, what happened after the guard left? I don't know. The moment was over. Just kind of said I should go and I would talk to him tomorrow. Honey, what were you thinking? I don't know. It was a combination of things. I mean, definitely the moment. But it would be nice to have sex before the baby comes, right? And the therapist did talk about compromise. Well, honey, you can't compromise who you are. A virgin is not who I am. But it's important to you. So is Rafael. I love him. I want it to work. And you think having sex with him will make it work? What's your problem? You have been bugging me to lose it for years. Ah. You waited this long. No. Having sex with Rafael wouldn't change anything. Or solve any of our problems. So, maybe think of the kind of compromise that would. How much longer? Stop asking me. Right. Okay. I am sorry. Roman must've given us the other flash drive to set us up. This is the real deal. I can feel it. And here you go. This must be it. Sin Rostro's whole network. Look at this. These are known drug distributors. Sounds like you hit the mother lode. Thank you. Yep. No problem. Nadine! Hey. I heard they're getting closer down there. Any progress? You were working for her? What? Your name was on the list. Were you working for Sin Rostro? Yes. But you have to understand, she-she was threatening to kill my family; she knew where they lived. You were working against me. All this time, huh? We haven't heard from Sin Rostro in four years because he's dead. It was clearly a crime of passion, which is why we need to bring Petra Solano in for questioning. I don't want to tell the captain about the drug shipment until after we make the bust. - Did you know who she was?! - No! I just tipped off her people as to where we were in the investigation. Who? Who did you tip off? The bellboy. And then she killed him, Michael. And there were so many times that I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. Oh, my God. I have to tell Armstrong. Lot of names on that list though. Probably take me an hour to find yours. Two, tops. Xiomara, you look spectacular. Very de la Vegas, baby. Oh, they must be getting ready for the big photo shoot. Really? You don't think it's too big? No. Are you okay? Not really. My pores are closely connected to my emotions when one is clogged, the other is clogged. What are you talking about? I need to tell you something. It's been eating me up inside, and I won't be camera ready until I get it out. What's going on? Amanda kissed me. I didn't kiss her back, but I should have known better than to put myself in a situation with a woman who cannot resist me. Oh. No problem. - Really? - It happens. I forgive you. A kiss is nothing anyway. Of course! It was nothing. I mean, if the shoe were on the other foot and-and I were the one confessing to you, you would understand, right? But of course. I'm not a monster, Xiomara. Okay, well It's time! We need you on set right now. Great! Let's do this! Hello? Rafael. Hi. Look, I-I, uh I don't know if-if you heard about what happened. Uh, no, I didn't. But listen, uh, Jane just got here, so can I call you back? Yeah, sure. Okay. Mother? It's me. So, can we talk? Yeah. Yeah, let's talk. Last night what happened, or almost happened, I don't think it's the right move, for me. I agree. Because it's not about sex. I mean, that wouldn't change anything. But I was thinking about what the therapist said about compromise and meeting each other halfway, and I think we should move in together. I mean, it's initially what you wanted and it took me a second to get there, but it makes sense. This way, I'm not anxious about the time you spend at work, because the time you spend at home, we'll be together. Jane But that's not even the reason why. I genuinely want to live with you. To go to bed and wake up I can't. We can't. Why not? This is what you wanted. Look, last night, um got me thinking, too. And I realized that something has changed. What? I just don't love you the way that you love me. That's the problem. That's why this won't work. I don't believe you. Look, I know that this hurts to hear - Why are you saying this? - Because I thought that I did. But I guess I just got caught up in the idea of us being a family. Of you being the mother of my child. And I was just projecting so much onto that. But I am seeing things clearly now. I think that we should end it. Focus on how we can both be good parents. Wow. I guess I'm seeing things clearly, too. I know what you're thinking. Holy hell. That is not the Rafael we have come to know and love. Why on earth would he do that? Let me explain. You see, he went back to Dr. Stanbrook, PhD, MFCC, this morning. Alone. Yes, I love her, okay? Of course I love her, but that doesn't change the fact that we are different. Different people enter into relationships all the time. But I can't give her what she wants, not right now. Why not? Because my life is falling apart. Okay? My dad died, and because of my screwup, his hotel might go under. And, oh I just found out that my mother took ten million dollars to walk away from me when I was four. So there's there's just a lot. Yeah. It is a lot. And you might not be emotionally available right now. Is that what you're saying? I'm saying I'm in a dark place. And I don't want to drag her down with me. I can't. What makes you think you would? Because I almost did. Last night I would have had sex with her. If that security guard hadn't walked in, I would have done it, even though I I knew I knew how much that means to her. And she would have just regretted it, and If we keep going, somehow, someway, things are just gonna get bad. This will be cleaner. This will be better for the kid. We just need to focus on our kid. Well, if you're so sure, what's the problem? Jane. She's gonna hold on. How do you know? Because she believes in this almost magical power of love. It should be noted that Rafael really thought he was doing the right thing for Jane, for their child. And it should also be noted that that didn't make it any easier. Perfect, Mr. de la Vega. Xiomara, can I get a bigger smile? But Xiomara was having trouble smiling. Her emotional pores were clogged, too. I have something to tell you, Rogelio. It's important. Yeah, what is it? Xiomara? I kissed Marco the other night. I was upset about what happened with your mom, and I was feeling vulnerable. It-it was stupid and it didn't mean anything to me. Xiomara, get down. Ooh, back-to-back. I love it. Rogelio, come on. I forgave you. Amanda kissed me! You kissed Marco! It meant nothing to me. I shouldn't have even told you. Then you'd be a cheater and a liar! Rogelio, please I'm sorry, Xiomara. This is something I can simply not forgive! Do you have everything you need, Philipe? I'm good, yeah. Okay. Then this photo shoot, like our relationship, is over! Oh, dear. That makes two Villanueva hearts broken today. - Jane. - Michael, hi. You knew. I can't believe you knew. - What? - About Andie. When I told you about her the other day, you stood there, acting like you had no idea who she was. I just I didn't know what to say. Well, how about ""Michael, she's in my writer's group."" - I couldn't. - Why? Because you seemed happy. And I didn't want to ruin that. I should have. I'm sorry, okay? Jane, what's wrong? Rafael and I broke up. Are you okay? Which brings us back to the last stage of grief. _ Yeah. I am, actually. I have to be. Better to know now, you know? Before the baby comes. In the long run, it's better to know now. Anyway, I'm, um I'm heading home, so Do you need a ride or anything? No, thank you. My grandma's coming to get me. Okay. I'll see you later? _ Thanks for the ride. _ _ Thank you for coming. You know I'm always here for you. _ _ _"
"Okay, let's do this. Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. Oh, and the doctor, that happened to be Rafael's sister Luisa, and Luisa also happened to be embroiled in an affair with Rose, her stepmother. But Rose turned out to be crime lord Sin Rostro, and Luisa disappeared, perhaps with her. And you know who was on the case? Jane's ex-fiancé, Detective Michael Cordero. Meanwhile, Jane and Rafael fell in love, but unfortunately, Rafael's life was falling apart, so he spiraled and broke up with Jane. And speaking of breakups, Jane's mom was dating Jane's dad, telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega till this happened. I kissed Marco. Oh, and we can't forget Raf's ex-wife Petra. She's had some ups I'm assigning my shares to Petra. And some downs. See? She briefly had a hostage in her room. Oh, and then she realized her mother could walk, which made it easier for Magda to push Jane's grandmother down the stairs. But Alba couldn't remember what had happened until now. _ _ So let's see what happens, shall we? In October of 2000, the most amazing thing happened to young Jane Gloriana Villanueva. She watched her very first telenovela with her mother and grandmother. And from that very first moment, she was hooked. So by the time she was a young woman, - _ - she was well versed in the language of amnesia. And, of course, the concept of recovered memory. But that didn't make it any less incredible _ when it happened to her grandmother. You remember the accident? _ _ _ Abuela, you have to tell me everything. _ _ _ Yeah, I remember. _ _ _ _ Get out! _ Help! Please help! _ _ _ And you saw Petra's mother? _ _ _ _ _ Then we have to go to the police. _ _ I know you're scared about your immigration status, but this is different this is a crime! _ _ _ _ Abuela _ Come on, give her some credit. Mom? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. If he wants to be a big baby, well, two can play at that game. What are you talking about? Rogelio broke up with me. What? I told him that I kissed Marco, and Ma, don't say anything. I know. Anyway he dumped me. Oh, Mom, I'm so sorry. If it makes you feel any better, Rafael dumped me, too. Oh, my baby. _ _ Mmm Mmm A little comfort food. Kvasené uhorky. _ Thank you. Of course. I was so glad when you called. I knew you'd come back to me. A girl needs her matka. Mother, I just didn't want to be alone after the whole ordeal with Roman, but I haven't forgiven you. All those years of you pretending you couldn't walk just to manipulate me? It was to protect you. I was afraid you would go back to Milos. And that man, he is a monster! Petra please? Let me prove myself to you. How? How can I forgive you, Xiomara? I stayed in Miami for you. In this ridiculous job! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And what do you do? You betray me, Xiomara. I must go. I am being summoned to set to play a head! Can I come in? _ I'm afraid you cannot. I'll get to it, then. Since you've left, our ratings have plummeted. Have they? Rogelio, you've tweeted about it. Extensively. What is your point? We want you back. I happen to be very happy here at Galactica. It's quite a challenge to act only with your face - and hair. - Just consider it? How would you even bring me back? According to BuzzFeed, El Presidente's stabbing was one of the 17 most unforgettable death scenes of the past five years. We have a pitch. Not that old ""evil twin"" cliché. No. It involves a Kevlar vest, a burial at sea, amnesia and a super sexy scene where El Presidente emerges from the water in a soaking-wet shirt. - Button-down or pullover? - Button-down. - Mm. - We'd also offer you an executive producer credit, of course. I will think about it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get ready for work. Santos is back, baby ! And speaking of babies All righty, that's it. The doctor will be right in. - Thank you. - Thank you. _ I am so sorry, Jane. That you don't love me? Oh, but he did despite what he told her. That I hurt you. Rafael knew things between them would settle, get better with time. Look, I just want what's best for our baby. I'm sorry, can you just stop talking? You just broke up with me yesterday. - It's kind of hard I under - I get it. I just need some time. All right. Everything's looking good. _ _ - Mm. - But currently, the baby is breech. _ Uh, breech? What is that again? He didn't read the book. I mean, in his defense, I only asked him to do it three times. _ Head is up here, tush is down here, and the baby needs to be head-down for a natural delivery. - Let's get you measured. - So should I be concerned? Oh, no. Not yet. Breech babies often turn themselves. Let's check again in two weeks. _ _ _ _ All right, so the bigger the baby gets, the less space it has to flip. What can I do? I'd definitely like to avoid a C-section, if possible. And I'd like to avoid a version. That's a med A medical procedure to turn the baby. - _ - I read up when she said it was breech. Okay. Cool. These are a bunch of home technics you can try I can't promise they'll work, but give them a shot. And I'll see you in two weeks. - Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor. So, is there anything that I can help with? Oh, no. Looks like I have to do this stuff myself. Don't worry, when the baby comes, there will be plenty for you to do. _ But for now, well you can't exactly help me with elephant walk. What are you doing? To help turn the baby. Using gravity, right? You pull her down and then around, and then down. Well, I can't have a serious conversation with you like this. Fine. I needed a break, anyway. Your father won't answer my calls. _ _ He had his assistant move my stuff from our his house. He even blocked me on Twitter. I don't know what to do. Mom, he's angry. But it was one mistake. One stupid, meant-nothing mistake that I wish I could take back. _ I know, Mom. So can you tell him that? - What? - Maybe if he hears it from you, you know? How sorry I am. I wouldn't ask, but I'm out of options. It's a good option. Okay, look, time-shares would mean a cash influx now, - which is what we need. - No, what we need is time. We'll take out another loan to cover the balloon payment - until we ride this out. - Another risky move is not the answer. Neither is rebranding the hotel. Hey there. Maybe I can help. Ah, yes, you remember Rafael's sister Luisa, right? Luisa. _ _ Where have you been? The police have been looking for you. I know. I left them a voice mail the second I got back stateside. Uh, were you were you with Rose? Of course not. She's a murderer that killed our father. I went back to my Ashram in Peru to get over her, and I did. As a matter of fact Hey, Juice! Don't be shy. This is my new girlfriend, the one and only Juicy Jordan. Nice to meet you. Oh, you probably just don't recognize her outside of the ring. Out of the ring? I'm a pro wrestler. Yeah, you are. Wow, that's terrific. And, um how did you two meet? Oh, our first day in the sweat lodge, Juicy just she just got way too hot. And I mean that in the medical sense. Although  Look at her. - Look at you. - I can't. I'm too busy looking at you. So what brought you back? Well, the hotel is in trouble, so Juicy encouraged me to reach out to our accountant, and he told me that our profits are down and we lost our liquor license. So we discussed it and decided that it's about time that I help right this ship. - Right it? How, exactly? - I don't know yet. But I have an IQ of 152 and I basically got through med school drunk, so I'll figure it out. Oh, and obviously, I'm gonna take back control of my shares. - What, now? - Definitely. I mean, from what I heard, it looks like I'm the tiebreaking vote in this time-share versus new loan decision. Huh. That's a surprise. Also in for a surprise our Jane. What are you doing here? I work in the kitchen. Here. Clean glasses for the bar. I know what you did. - Excuse me? - You pushed my grandmother down the stairs. Well, if that were true, I would be in jail, no? And I am not. Take the glasses to the bar. Petra. I want your mother out of this hotel. - Excuse me? - She pushed my grandmother down the stairs and almost killed her. - What are you talking about? - Attempted murder. And I'm going to make sure that she pays for it. _ Abuela. I saw Magda today. _ She's working at the Marbella. _ Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Ma. Hi. What's going on? Nothing, just, like, a Rafael thing. _ _ Okay, you're scaring me what happened? Petra's mom pushed her down the stairs. - What? - Yeah, and now Abuela doesn't want to go to the police because she's undocumented. - That bitch needs to go to jail! - See? _ _ - I am calm! - She's calm. Come on, there's got to be something - we can do. - There is. Michael can help us. He's done it before. - What? - Mom, when you were in the hospital, some immigration stuff came up, and Michael made it go away. What? Why didn't you tell me? He asked me not to. He didn't want you to think that he did it to get you back or anything. Jane. What are you doing here? Sometimes there just aren't words to express the kind of gratitude one is feeling. Okay. You saved my grandmother. Thank you, thank you, thank you - so, so much. - Your mother wasn't supposed to tell you that. I know. But she did because we need your help again. I just got off the phone with the police. They want to bring us both in for questioning in relation to an attempted homicide. Uh, Mother? Mother. Did you have anything to do with this stair incident? Mother, did you push her? I would never do that. Okay. Unless, for example, that woman found out that there was a hostage in your room. Then I would have to try to keep her quiet to keep you out of prison, no? To protect you. Tell me your sins, my daughter. _ _ _ _ _ Is your back feeling any better? _ _ I'm sure this priest, uh, understood your invitation as a form of friendship. A friendship he would very much like. So go in peace and serve the Lord our God. And would you like to have lunch after physical therapy? Spirituality & Colonics. Trying to bribe my sister into voting your way? Seriously? Sloopy Sweets! My favorite. Oh, my God, Juicy, we used to eat these as kids. I've finished reading your proposals, _ and I still need more time weighing out the pros and the cons. But in the meantime, we have an idea for a short-term cash windfall. Well, actually, it was Juicy's idea. She has this incredible brain for business. Did you know she has her own line of velour sweatpants? Oh, okay. Well, they're not aren't actually hers, but still she looks amazing in them. So, Luisa, tell us about your idea. Melee at the Marbella. Professional wrestling match. - Here? - Right in the lounge. I'll face off in the ring against my Nemesis, Candy Crunch. People go nuts for a Juicy versus Candy matchup. And we can attract a whole new crowd, definitely make some extra cash what do you think? I love the idea. Aah! So much fun. Tell her this can't happen. No, you tell her. Oh, no, I'm not telling her anything. Well, neither am I. _ Looks like we'll be having a wrestling match at the Marbella, then. Perfect. Can't wait. _ Action. _ _ _ _ Cut! Jane. What a wonderful surprise. Wow, that was quite the entrance. - Isn't it? - Yeah. Would you like to go to my remodeled actor's dressing room or my new producer's corner office with a fantastic ocean view? Um, oh, you know, the quiet little corner right there by the dungeon's fine. - Dungeon's fine. - Okay. So it's about Mom. - What? - I've never seen her like this. And I know she messed up, got S-Stop, Jane, please. I thought you came here to support my triumphant return as Santos. Not to support your cheating mother's agenda to get me back. I'm sorry. She's just so upset. - As am I. - Dad. - It was just a kiss. - Just a kiss? It starts with just a kiss. And it ends with a tabloid photo of her sneaking out of a Rap Superstar's hotel room. Is that some kind of metaphor? No, it's not. My first wife did just that. So this is the baggage you're dealing with. Okay, well, this was a very different situation. He was humiliated. You obviously touched a nerve. But don't you think he should at least talk to me? Yes, but I also think you shouldn't have kissed Marco. Hang on. It's Rafael. _ _ _ How did you do it? What? Move on from Rafael. Because I can't with Rogelio. I mean, once he told me he didn't love me, I had no choice. The problem is, is you did not get closure. Exactly. Okay where is that music coming from? Oh, that's my pants. It's supposed to encourage the baby to turn towards the music. I just can't be in the middle, okay? - Carrying messages between you and Dad. - I I know. I just need to get in the same room with him so we can talk, face to face. Let's start with an easy question. Where were you after the Palomas? - In my room. - Were you alone? Just her and her hostage. No. I was with my daughter. I was resting with my mother. And then that woman, Alba, banged on the door. What'd she want? She was obviously quite drunk. Very drunk. My mother told her to go away. And that was that. Care to explain the man's voice crying out for help in your room? Must have been the TV. We were watching a telenovela. They can get very dramatic. They lied. They both lied, Michael. I know. Now we got them on record telling their version, so we just prove it's not true. Okay. How do we do that? Oh, I see you. We either prove Petra wasn't actually in the room, or we find the guy Abuela heard. I'll get room service records, - key card records - What? Uh, is there a wrestling match going on? I have no idea why that's happening. Rafael and I aren't exactly on chatty terms these days. Oh, I'm-I'm sorry to hear that. Are you? Yes. 'Cause he's the father of your child, and I'd imagine that'd be hard for you. Go to your shift. I'll let you know if I hear anything. Oh, if you see Magda, walk away. Okay. I'll see you later. Thank you. _ And speaking of mortal enemies Walk away, Jane. Just walk away. I talked to your policeman friend yesterday. I'm so sorry that your grandmother got so confused. She was not confused. We both know what you did. And we're gonna prove it and put you in jail. I looked your grandmother up on the Internet. No sign of her. That and the fact that she really does not speak English, it just got me thinking. Is your grandmother here legally? _ See, I don't mind either way. But those immigration authorities sure do. So both of you should maybe back off. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Melee at the Marbella! Please welcome our first fighter, coming down from the aisle to my right, the Pride of Pensacola, please welcome Candy Crunch! And in the opposite corner, everyone's favorite diva, hailing from the heavenly Hamlet of Santa Rosa, California, the one, the only Juicy Jordan! Jane. Hi. - I need your help. - Of course. Anything. It's about my grandmother. Remember the accident? Well, she didn't fall down the stairs she was pushed. Wait, what? By Petra's mother. - Magda? - Yes. And now she's working at the hotel, - and she's making threats. - Right. I heard about your little altercation. Your mother is threatening to get my grandmother deported. Your grandmother is trying to have my mother imprisoned. Because your mother belongs in prison! My mother had nothing to do with what happened to your grandmother. You're a liar! No, I'm not! _ It's the smackdown we've all been waiting for, as these two have had it out for one another all year. Oh, and the Pregnant Punisher comes out swinging! But the Cold Warrior denies her with the classic Eastern Block! She follows it up with the Brainwasher! Ooh, that one hurt. But the Cold Warrior's not giving her a maternity leave. She's looking to deliver this match right here, right now! Ladies and gentlemen, she pulls out the Belly Bump! The Punisher has just turned this cold war hot! - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! Jane! I want your mother out of this hotel! Okay, okay. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Jane. Hey, I'll handle this, okay? What the hell is going on? I have no idea. Those two suddenly started with these wild accusations. - Her grandmother wouldn't make that up. - No, of course not. But she's elderly. And she was drunk. And she sustained a head injury. Whatever it is, Jane can't work here with her. Rafael, I am not firing my mother to make your girlfriend happy. The truth was, Rafael hadn't told people he and Jane had broken up. She's not my girlfriend anymore. _ So you're trying to get her back? No. I broke up with her. But she's still the mother of my child. And even if her grandmother is confused, having Magda here is stressing her out, so please just find her a job somewhere else. Jane? Jane? I assume this parent trap was your doing. I love that movie, but it's not going to work. _ It's not a trap. I just want you guys to talk to each other, - and I want you to leave me out of it. - Fine. Talk. Ma. Now's your chance. I'm-I'm sorry I kissed Marco. It was stupid and immature, and-and I've replayed it, like, a million times in my head, and I wish you have no idea how hard I wish I could take it back. Because I love you. I really do. So please give me another chance. No. This is why I didn't want to see you, because I knew you'd argue with me What was that? My fans. I'm constantly being photographed. Apparently it's quite a get for the paparazzi. You know that feeling when a great idea comes to you? Okay, that's just a happy coincidence. But Jane was definitely having that feeling. I have to go. I should explain. See, Jane's looking for a picture of Petra at the after-party. If she can prove she was there, they can catch her in her lie. I should explain. Jane could not find a picture of Petra at the Paloma after-party and prove she wasn't in a room with Magda when Alba was pushed. But she did find something even better. _ _ Hi Jane what's going on? We've got them, Michael. So you're absolutely sure no one was in the room with you and your mother on the night of the Palomas? Yes, Michael, I'm sure, okay? Look, now, if you'll excuse me, I So who's this? Oh, I  I forgot. About the man you held hostage for over a month? - I called a plumber that night. -  Really? - That's the best you could do? - A plumber? So he must be an employee of the hotel, which means there's a record. Uh, no. He's-he's not an employee, actually. Rafael and I were in a bad place at the time, and he cut off the hotel's resources to our room, so I had to call someone else. Fine. - Can you give me his contact information? - I must have called a dozen plumbers that night. I mean I really don't think I can remember which one. Try hard. Look for the work order. I'll be looking, too. So we should definitely build out here. Got it. That's what I thought. _ No. He's not coming. _ You know things are strained between Mom and him. - I'm sorry, honey. - It's fine. I'm sure you guys will sort things out. Anyway, let's start. Okay, we need socket screws for the feet, three-inch head bolt with nut for the legs. _ Okay, we'll get started with the leg panels. _ You've reached Jane. Leave a message. Hey, Jane. It's me. Um I'm just calling 'cause I wanted to let you know that I asked Petra to fire Magda. So I'm doing everything I can. I just don't want you to worry. And I And briefly, she thought he'd say, ""I love you."" I'll talk to you later. But alas, he didn't. Even though he wanted to. Oh, Rafael! There you are. - _ - So? It went great, right? We should make this a monthly tradition. - What? - Wrestling. Monthly. Even weekly. I mean, if we play our cards right, we could make this Miami's premiere destination - for wrestling - Stop. Stop it! We are not turning the Marbella into a wrestling destination. - Well, Petra thinks it's a great idea. - That is because Petra is trying to get you to vote her way. We both are. Finally. A moment of honesty. I have an IQ of 152, remember? It's just you two were so eager to please, I figured why not just have some fun and let and let Juicy get some press? Okay. An honest conversation. Dad and I had a plan for this hotel. We were gonna give Ian Schrager a run for his money. What, by floating more loans? We can ride this out if we stay the course, but you have to trust me. I need this hotel to succeed. We all do. No, you don't understand, okay? I gave up everything for this hotel. What do you mean that you gave up everything? I gave up every I gave up Jane. What do you what do you mean? Look, you've been gone for a while, okay? A lot has happened. So, tell me. I mean, before all this stuff happened _ we used to talk. That's all I want. Don't coddle me, don't handle me. Just talk to me, please, and not about business. And so, Rafael told his sister everything. How he asked Jane to marry him. Dad died, but I had Jane. I'd never felt so sure about anything. Or anyone. How she said ""no."" I'm so sorry. How he'd reached out to his mother, how she took ten million dollars to walk away from him. If it helps, I always hated your mother. It does, actually. He even let her read the letter his father wrote to his mother. And, of course, I'm hard on Rafael. But what he doesn't understand is I am hard on him because I believe that he can be a success. So I can't let this hotel fail. I just can't. And it was failing, and I was disappointing Jane. So, something had to give. I get it. I just think you gave up the wrong thing. Which brings us back to Jane, who had a baby to turn. And she was about to burn moxa at her feet in order to turn it. _ Google it. It's a real thing. No partner, no problem. Because Jane, you'll remember, was handy. I get that the hotel's important, but this is also about you rejecting Jane before she rejects you, like your mom. No, no, no, that's not It's part of the reason since we're being honest. Look, the point is that I did it, okay? And this hotel this is my kid's legacy, so I need it to work. Yeah, but then what? What if it's successful? You're gonna be happy? Without Jane? Maybe, you know, after I get this stuff settled What? She's gonna wait? Raf, people don't wait. They move on. Jane? _ _ Burning moxa to turn the baby. I must have fallen asleep. _ I-I know. _ I don't know! _ _ I I just needed to prove I can do it myself, because I'm going to have to do things myself now! And I know you're here, but still, there are some things I need to do on my own. Okay? As a single mother. Because that's what I am. And I didn't see it coming, Abuela. And I'm just trying to get my bearings, and I just want to be able to do something. I just wanted to know I can do something on my own. _ _ And so, Jane went to bed that night alone, when suddenly and it should be noted, quite dramatically she woke up. Because the baby turned. She felt it turn. We did it. Can I get a fist bump? Pow. Also feeling victorious. So tell me, were you in Magda and Petra's room on the night in question? Yes, I was. What? I can't believe they found him already. What were you doing there? I was called in to help with a plumbing problem. What's the name of your employer? Oh, I am what you call, uh, self-employed. Here. You give me call you have problem. I give you ten percent off, friends and family discount. Thank you. Do not thank me. I would like nothing more than you and your miserable mother be rotting in prison. I did this so Milos wouldn't kill me. Say what you will about psychopath ex-boyfriends, but sometimes they buy you hotels and force former hostages to lie on your behalf. Can I go now? Passions of Santos is coming on. Santos is coming back from the dead. Apparently, I need tighter security. - Please leave. - Wait. I'm just here to say that I accept your decision. So you can come over, hang around Jane and not worry. I get it. It's over, okay? Yes. Okay. Jane, I'm so sorry. I wanted Ivan to be the answer. He is. He's lying. - My grandmother said he was yelling for help. - I know. So, then, what's going on? I'm sorry. I'm I'm just frustrated. I know. Jane? Listen, I want you to be careful. Just 'cause we haven't proven anything doesn't mean something shady isn't going on over there. Rafael's sister Luisa is back. She could still be in contact with Sin Rostro. And with Magda around, and Petra lying to cover for her, I just I want you to be careful. I will. Thank you. Yeah, of course. I should call my grandmother, let her know. Yeah. Everything all right? _ _ _ _ If this did not happen, I would not have my new friend. Alba I'm fooling myself to think we can just be friends. So I've been doing some thinking, and I've decided you're right. Let's take out another loan, ride out this period. So you're letting go of the whole time-share pitch? It's a betrayal to the Marbella brand that you and your father worked so hard to create. And I know what that means to you. So, why the sudden change of heart? I've just been thinking about our partnership and how I should probably compromise more to make it work. Which is why I've decided to find my mother a different job. Thank you, Petra. Oh, and for the record, Alba was confused about the accident. These are the medical records from my mother's surgery last month in the Czech Republic. _ My mother didn't push Alba downstairs. My mother couldn't walk back then. Anyway You want me to apologize? And you're firing me? You said you want what's best for me, Mother, right? - Uh-huh. - Well, I'm still in love with Rafael. And now, finally, there's an opening. And I'm gonna get him back. - Hey. - Oh, hi. Uh, how's it going? Any movement with the baby? Oh, yeah, she turned last night, actually. That's that's great. Mm-hmm. Why didn't you tell me? Oh. It happened in the middle of the night, and I knew I'd see you. Gotcha. Oh, um, so, Petra talked to her mother, and Magda is leaving the hotel. Good. What about Petra? Oh, yeah, she's she's apologetic. No, I mean, when is she leaving the hotel? She owns a third of the Marbella, Jane. And she's an accomplice to attempted murder. She lied to cover up the fact that her mother pushed my grandmother down the stairs. - Okay, look - What? It's just that there are two sides to every story. Excuse me? Your grandmother had a head injury. She might not remember. And Petra's mother couldn't walk back then. Of course she could! She obviously was faking her injury! - For three years? - Yes! I lived with her, Jane. - She has medical records. - Well, she's evil, and so is her daughter, and I don't want my kid around them. - End of story. - Okay, it's not end of story, because it's also my kid, and I can't just get rid of Petra. Well, I can't be around her. And I don't have to be. I quit. - Wait. - What? I'm removing myself from the situation. Hold on. Stop. Jane, stop! Look, this is ridiculous, okay? I live here, I work here. The baby is gonna be here. Quitting is not the answer. And he was right, she realized. I have enough saved for now. I'll get a new job after the baby comes. If I have to go back to work a few weeks earlier, I will. As long as you'll help me. _ Good. Because I thought co-parenting with Rafael was best for the baby, but I was wrong. His sister is connected to Sin Rostro, and his crazy ex-wife has a murderous mother. What are you saying, Jane? That what's best for the baby is to be as far from the Marbella and all those people as possible. So I'm calling a lawyer. I want full custody."
"Okay, let's do this. Jane, you'll recall, was engaged to Michael. And Rafael was married to Petra. But then, Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm, and the doctor who did it, well that was Raf's sister, Luisa. But on the plus side, Jane and Rafael fell in love, leaving Michael heartbroken and also Petra. But things were going great between Jane and Rafael. Until they weren't. See, Rafael's father died, and his hotel was failing, so he kind of freaked out and dumped Jane, leaving her miserable. Also heartbroken Jane's mother. See, she had gotten together with Jane's long-lost father, telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega. He even included her in his one-night Las Vegas residency. Only problem Xo kind of kissed her ex. So Rogelio dumped her, and now they're making a go of just being friends. Meanwhile, Jane was trying to focus on what was best for her baby, and you know what wasn't best? Petra and her devious mother Magda. Magda, you'll recall, pushed Jane's grandmother down the stairs. And Petra lied to cover it up. This led to a lot of tension between Jane and Rafael. So Jane quit her job and decided to file for sole custody of the baby. But Rafael doesn't know that, yet - _ - Knowing Jane as well as you do by now, it should come as no surprise that even back in high school, she was a planner. What? _ What the ? Unfortunately for young Jane, someone in high school knew her very well, too. Oh, did you miss the fair? Her personal tormentor. _ You know, you really shouldn't leave your planner lying around where everyone can see it. However, they say living well is the best revenge. And after high school, Jane was living very well indeed. - _ - Whereas Stephanie, according to gossip, had dropped out of college. So can we blame Jane for being eager to show her that nice girls finish first? _ May 9th, put it in your calendar. Well, you are my calendar. Just tell me where to be and when. - Seriously? - I'll write it down. In the new date book that I gave you. In the new date book that you gave me. But now, one year, two break-ups, _ and an accidental pregnancy later, Jane was no longer so eager to show off anything. Put that Post-it back right now. I'm not going. Having this five-year reunion was your idea. You were on the planning committee. Before I got pregnant. I have too much writing to do before the baby comes. And I'm not working right now, so I need to make the most of it. - You can take off one night. - I really can't. I'm on a schedule ten pages a day. Can you tell her she has to go? To the reunion? I tried she's crazy with this schedule. You were supposed to give a speech, Jane. I'm pretty sure the class of Come on. Alex Mendez RSVP'd yes. So? So you had a huge crush on him. And remember, you two were vibing at the graduation party? You two vibed? You didn't tell me. Yeah, because nothing happened. And I'm not exactly looking to meet a guy. We were vibing that one time, though. It's Janet, right? ""Janet."" Did he just call you Janet? That's hilarious. Stephanie Kovakovich, one more reason I shouldn't go. Are you kidding? She dropped off of Instagram last year. Which means she looks terrible. Which means seeing her will make you feel better. Just like seeing all the teachers who worshipped you. - Aw Mr. Baird. - Aw Jane, I can't wait to hear what you've been up to. Look, this isn't exactly the triumphant return I was hoping to make, you know? I'm single, unemployed, pregnant. I'm not exactly accomplished. Okay, first of all, you are going to have one of the best stories there. And you're very accomplished. You graduated college, you wrote an episode for a telenovela, and you were offered a teaching job which you turned down to write your novel. Come on, how ballsy is that? There was a reason you were on the planning committee. Because you wanted to go to that reunion. So be proud of where you're at. I know I am. You guys are so cheesy. Shut up, Lina, you're getting what you want. You guys are right. I'm overthinking. It'll be fun. _ _ Okay, Target run which look are you going for? I'll be giving ""accidentally sexy Bohemian."" Not that, but can you get me some lip gloss? Okay. Thank you. Your custody lawyer. He just wants to know if I told Rafael that I wanted primary custody. Well, why haven't you? I just It's not an easy thing to say. I know he'll be upset. But I'm gonna do it today. - _ - See? So here is the situation. The Maracay Board is calling a vote in Madrid. _ _ _ _ There's a push to sell off the properties, settle the debt and dissolve the company. Sounds reasonable. It's not reasonable, Luisa. I'm going there to change their mind. Dad had multiple offers through the years, and he turned them all down. He didn't want to sell his company it was his legacy. Yeah that's a tough call. _ _ You think so? Really? Because, to me, it sounds like a no-brainer. We unload and divide the money. You keep the Marbella that's outside of the Maracay Group. Dad didn't want that. Raf, Dad's dead. We have to move on. Respectfully I'm gonna let you two hash this out. Bye, babe. Bye, you. Mmm, bye, you. _ You see, Rafael had a calendar too. And he knew it had been two weeks since Jane quit. _ Two weeks since he had seen her. _ Raf. Sorry. Look, I've been thinking about what you said. - About selling? - No, about Jane. And whether or not I'd be happy without her, long-term and I wouldn't. I mean, I'm not. Luisa I think I made a mistake. I shouldn't have broken up with Jane. I'll just be firm with Rafael. I'll tell him it's for the baby's safety. Dad's here. Good. You okay, Mom? You ready to see him? Oh, yeah. I'm fine. Don't worry, I'm over him. Rogelio and Xo were trying out friendship, you'll recall only they hadn't exactly tried it yet. - Jane! - Hey! - I've missed you. - Oh Okay! - Be careful, there's a baby in there. - Yes. Oh, yeah, sorry. Yes. - How was Playa Del Carmen? - Incredible. Santos had to find a cursed booby-trapped diamond - in an underwater cave. I had to kill four sharks. - Whoa. Oh. They were animatronic, but still quite fierce. Here's a little something for you. I saw it and I thought, - ""That's so Jane."" - That's Oh, wow. _ - That is striking. - Yeah. And heavy. Yes. Put it on. - I will. - Yes. Alba. _ Xiomara Okay. Bye, guys. Wow. - Go, go, we'll catch up later. - Uh-huh. Enjoy the necklace. I will. Yes. Xiomara, I've been eager to see you. - Really? - Yes. We need to talk about our Vegas show. The stakes have been raised, because Mitchell Murray has agreed to direct. Mitchell Murray? The theater genius. He is directing a Broadway revival of Jesus Christ Superstar. - I've always wanted to play Jesus. - I thought you hated plays. No, it's different. Cool people like Bradley Cooper do Broadway now. Anyway, this is my first step towards achieving an EGOT. Once I secure my Tony, all that remains is an EGO. _ _ Xiomara, this is serious. We start rehearsals immediately. Our act must be perfect. Perfectly paced, perfectly timed. And speaking of perfectly timed, Jane was on her way to talk to Rafael, when Oh, dear. Jane. Hi. Uh, we were just on our way out. Um, some returns. You pushed my grandmother down the stairs. You should be in jail. Ugh, enough already. Stop harassing me. Well that was well-timed, hmm? Yeah, well Rafael really shouldn't leave his calendar open on his computer like that. Now Jane'll be in a terrible mood for their meeting. Anyway, these past two weeks with Rafael have been really good. We've been growing closer. This is true, FYI. Now I just need to make sure Jane doesn't get in my way. - Hey, Jane. - Hi. Uh, how are you? Look, I wanted to talk to you. - Uh, me, too. - Oh. - Okay. - Yeah, I b mm. Come on, Solano, spit it out. Tell her how you feel. I met with a lawyer and I'm filing for primary custody. - What? - That doesn't mean that you won't see the baby you'll get visitation. But it'll live with me. - Wait, why? - Because I don't want the baby around the hotel your sister, Petra, Magda But what about me? Look, I can't separate that. You have to! My sister hasn't been in touch with Sin Rostro. And for the past two weeks, she sat down with the police three times. You can check with Michael. I will, but I just saw Petra with her mother, right in the lobby. - Well, then we'll ban Magda from the hotel. - You can't ban Petra. - You work with her. - I won't bring the baby here. - You live here. - Then I'll get another apartment! I will! Jane, don't do this. Please, if this isn't about keeping the baby away from me, then don't. He offered to get an apartment? Wow, that's a pretty big deal. Hey, who's side are you on? Yours always! But I let anger get in the way when I was younger with Rogelio. Yeah, I know. It's just so hard not to be angry with him. Plus, it doesn't help that Magda's walking around while we're here stuck paying Abuela's medical bills. Trust me, I get it. It's killing me, too. Oh. It's Michael. Good. Hey. So, yeah, I got your message. And, yes, Luisa's been cooperating with us. So far, it doesn't look like she's been in contact with Sin Rostro. Okay, that's good, at least. Thanks for checking. Yeah, no problem. - Michael? - Hey. Okay, there's this thing tomorrow. What kind of thing? Uh, like a ceremony thing. I'm getting a commendation. Wow! Michael, that's great! Yeah, thank you. Yeah, it's not a it's not a big deal or anything, but, uh, I was I'm supposed to bring someone. And I was wondering if maybe I don't know if you wanted to come. As a friend 'cause, you know, you were with me when I first started. But if not, it's totally cool. I'd love to go. Yes. That's great. I will text you the details. Sounds good. Okay, bye. Where are you going with Michael? He's getting an award. He asked me to go. As friends. He just said that on the phone. Knock, knock. Saw your light was on. I figured you were putting in a late night. Here. Double shot. Thank you. Sure. You okay? Eh, not great, honestly. Jane? Sorry. I don't want to overstep. It's just I, uh I saw her leaving earlier, and she seemed pretty upset, too. Raf, I hope you know you can talk to me. As a friend. Even if it's about Jane. Speaking of Jane You'll recall she had a novel to finish, and she was determined to write. Even though there were so many packages just sitting there, unopened. Uh, sorry. Yes. She was on a ten-page-a-day schedule. Oh, maybe just one. She'll just open one. Okay, that is definitely cute. I do love ducks. Now, back to writing. Jane? Come on. Time to write. Uh, okay, fine. As soon as you figure out where the towels go. Quick update. It's been two hours. She won't stop organizing. Jane? _ I just want to get a few things ready before the baby comes. _ I know. But I can't stop. Seriously. I keep trying to and work, but I can't. What? _ Nesting? _ _ I don't have time for nesting. Nesting is not in the calendar. There is no color for nesting. _ _ I'm serious, Abuela. I need to get pages. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Look at these teeny tiny booties. That's right, Rogelio. _ Now to the center. Okay, now we slow it down. Keep it sexy. And the lift rises. Stop! Turn off the music now! - Why? What is it? - Mitchell Murray will laugh at this choreography. It's not good enough. We have to do better! What was that all about? You want to know the truth? I could feel you out there. Desiring me. - What?! - Yes, and it made me uncomfortable. So I want you to spend the afternoon gaining control over that. Because we're just friends. But something didn't sit right. And so Detective Cordero continued to pursue his leads, and thanks to his tireless efforts, we were able to apprehend 22 members of Sin Rostro's network. Oh, dear. See, that's the rub, right there. - You're recall. - Your name was on the list. Were you working for Sin Rostro? _ Yes. But you have to understand she-she was threatening to kill my family she knew where they lived. With profound appreciation for your service and bravery in the line of duty A lot of names on that list, though. Probably take me an hour to find yours. We honor you, today, with the Distinguished Service Medal. Thank you. - Yay! Congratulations. - Thank you. Oh Detective Cordero, how 'bout a picture of you and your date? - Oh. Oh. I-I'm not his date. - We She's not Yeah. - We're just friends. Yep. - S Um Eh Okay. We'll take a photo. Thanks. All right. Sorry. That was weird. Um, anyway, thank you for coming. As a friend. It means a lot. No, I'm glad I came. That was amazing. You want to go for dinner, or You don't have to. No, I want to, but I have my high school reunion tonight. Oh, right, right. Yeah, I forgot. - I have that in my planner. -You don't still have that planner. No, no, I don't. Anyway, have fun. And stay away from the mean girls. Oh, you know it. Unfortunately, that was easier said than done. In fact, Jane was about to run into her first mean girl _ - _ - before she even got to the reunion. Jane Can we talk? Look, I know we have our differences. But, please, don't take it out on Rafael. What are you talking about? He's miserable, Jane. So I just I wanted to make sure that you know that I would never, ever harm your child. I hope you know that's true. I never would. It's funny. I'd like to trust you. But I did that once, remember? And then you turned back into a huge bitch again, basically. Look, i-it it was hard to watch you and Rafael together. I mean Look, you need to understand, we were we were in love. We were trying to have a baby. And then all of a sudden, he had all of that. With you. Look, I'm-I'm coming to you now with no ulterior motive. Except that she was trying to look like the bigger person with Rafael. And I just need for you to know that I would never, ever hurt your child. Okay? Don't punish Rafael for my mistakes. Jane? You ready? I have to go. Okay, you need a new necklace. This says, ""I'd rather be home in bed."" - Really? It's the necklace? - Yeah. Yeah. It's not the gigantic pregnant belly? - Mm-mm. Definitely the necklace. - Mm-mm? Here. Wear this. Straight from ""Tar-jay."" It's perfect. And get pumped. - This is gonna be fun. - Right. - Yeah. - Yes, and I need some fun. - Yes, girl! - Yes! Give Jane an A+ for effort. She was determined to have a good time tonight. As she headed into her high school reunion, she reminded herself she wasn't an unemployed pregnant lady. She was an unemployed pregnant writer. Most Likely to Succeed? Not so much. - Okay. Let's go. - Uh-huh. Don't worry. I'm not where I thought I'd be either. _ Have I made it onto the Bachelor yet? No. Have I auditioned three times? Four. Yes. _ _ Wow. I guess she really did drop Instagram as part of a social media cleanse. It'll be fine. I see Mr. Baird. I'm gonna go talk to him. Okay. And I actually decided to turn down a teaching job - because I'm writing a novel. - Really? Just trying to finish before the baby comes. - You know, I-I have a schedule. - Well, how far along are you? Oh, only halfway through. But if I do ten pages a day I-I meant in your pregnancy. Oh! Maybe get the baby news out of the way first next time. So, I'm having a baby. I can see that. Is there a dad? Yes. There is one. But we're not together. But it's for the best. I mean, at the end of the day, we were just so different, so now, I'm just, like, really happy. I'm incredibly happy. TMI, Jane! TMI! Try asking them questions. - You're engaged? - Want to come to my bachelorette party in June? We're renting a houseboat off of St. Thomas. I'd love to, but I'm giving birth. At St. Luke's. Abort! Abort! The situation, I mean. Get out! Hey, anyone sitting at this empty table with you? _ _ It's Jane, right? He knows our name! Yeah. So how have you been? As successful as everyone else I've talked to tonight? No, actually. Not at all. I live at home, and I'm currently unemployed because I'm trying to become a writer. Wow. It's a ballsy move. Just to be clear, Jane wasn't looking for a new boyfriend. But still, it was nice to talk to someone who wasn't focused on her pregnancy. You hungry? Constantly! - Definitely. - Cool, let's get some food. Oh. Wow. - You're pregnant. I-I'm sorry. I - It's okay. - No, I-I didn't know. - It's fine. I-I I'm single, though. - Oh, no, no, no, I'm not really looking for - No, no, I wasn't - saying it because I - Whoa, whoa. I'm really sorry. I-I had no idea. I'm telling you, he ran out of there. The rehearsal was going great, and then he had this, like, prima donna meltdown, and said that I was hitting on him. _ No! Geez! I was getting into position so that we could be lifted up into the air. _ It's this hydraulic lift that the director requested. _ _ _ _ _ You think he's afraid of heights? _ _ _ But he doesn't mind giant staircases for grand entrances. _ _ _ So how did Inez get over it? _ Mm-hmm. _ _ Mm-hmm. _ And speaking of sad stories The last time I addressed you, at our graduation, we were all wondering where the future would take us. I'm sure we had a sense of where we'd like to be. I know I did. But things didn't exactly turn out like I thought they would. I mean, at all. Honestly, they couldn't be farther from what I imagined. You know what's funny, though? I was scared to come here tonight, because I thought you'd all judge me, and think I was unaccomplished. But that didn't happen at all. In fact, none of you cared, because I'm pregnant. So, when you look at me, that's all you see a pregnant lady. And, look. Stop! Look! I get it. I know that ""Mom"" is the most important job in the world, and not just because so many of you have told me that tonight. The thing is, is I don't want to be just a mom. I want a career. I want a life! I want to be seen as a person in my own Ow! The baby's coming! Get off this stage before your water breaks and I'm humiliated! Ow! Ow! This can't be happening! Thankfully, it wasn't. The last time I addressed you, at our graduation, we were all wondering where the future would take us. You know the drill. Jane told everyone that life is what happens when you're busy making plans, yada yada. And that the real joy lies in the unexpected. It was a short, lovely speech. Go class of 2010! And unfortunately, Jane wasn't feeling a word of it. Luckily, with the speech over, home was within Jane's grasp. Hey, Jane. Ugh, so close. _ - _ - Oops. _ - _ - No, I meant it. Hi, Stephanie. Look at you! - When are you due? - Oh. Four more weeks. Wow. I would have thought you'd say, like, tomorrow. Oh. No. 'Cause you're so big! Yeah, I got it. Pull her hair! Shiv her! Take care. Wait. Jane. I just wanted to apologize. I was kind of harsh on you in high school, and it wasn't cool, so, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Oh. Thanks for saying that. And I get it. It was kind of weird that my mom dated your dad. That's what you think it was about? Well, yeah. You spread a rumor around the school saying that my mom was a slut, which, for the record, she's not. Oh. Yeah, I didn't care about your mom. It was all about Vince Di Bacco. - What?! - Remember? The guy that asked you to Junior Prom, - and then changed his mind the next day? - Yeah, I remember. I liked him, but Vince's mom was super religious, so I spread the rumor about your mom, because I knew it'd get back to Vince's sister, who was a huge gossip. And it did, and she told her mom, and her mom freaked, and then, he wasn't allowed to go with you. And then he asked me. Wow. That's incredibly complicated. It's a pretty basic technique use people's vulnerabilities against them. Your mom was your vulnerability. For the first time in her life, Jane found herself inside the mind of a mean girl. Sometimes you just have to play dirty. And just like that, Jane did learn something that night. And she did always love to learn, you'll recall. Jane. Such great work again. Thank you. I had fun writing it, so You are such a weirdo. - Jane? - Sorry. I was just remembering the fun part of high school. Class? You are such a weirdo. What are you talking about? You're afraid of heights. That's just crazy talk! I'm not afraid of anything except acne and Leprechauns. Leprechauns aren't real. I know what I saw! And regardless, I don't mind heights. I descend grand staircases frequently. Well, how about if there were no stairs? Let's say, hypothetically, we go to the Grand Canyon, and I take you right up to the edge? You can see over. There's nothing below, just a sharp drop Stop! Okay. Okay, it's true, but I don't want anyone to know. How can I expect Mitchell to see me as Jesus Christ, aka the Holy Messiah, if I can't even manage a hydraulic lift? - I am sure he'll understand. - No, he won't. And I don't want to get a reputation of being difficult. Again. Okay, there's got to be some way to get you over this. I've tried everything, Xiomara, but nothing's working. And speaking of not working, Jane was determined to turn things around with her novel. She had her plan, remember? Her calendar. And she really had to get diapers and wipes and a wipe warmer. _ _ _ _ Oh, yes. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And I'm in this weird in-between state. Totally scared of raising a kid, and so badly wanting to do it right, but also, not wanting it to take over my whole life. It won't. You won't let it. It could. I mean, I have this schedule, to finish my novel, and I'm already so behind. That's because it's a crazy schedule. What? I'm sorry, it is. Look, you-you decided you wanted to be a writer, what, like, six months ago? So give yourself time to get there. You like plans, so make a new plan. A real one. So, you give good career advice. No wonder you got a commendation. Michael? Yeah. Sorry. It's just complicated. - What is? - Work. I did something believed someone. I'm just not sure if I made the right call. I bet you did. Hmm? I bet you did the right thing. Thanks. You there? Yeah. It should be noted that they were both thinking the exact same thing that it felt like old times. So listen, I should go and get some sleep. Gotcha. Good night, Jane. Good night. Are you ready? _ What's the big decision? I want to apply to a graduate program for writing. Well, if I'm serious about writing a book which I am I need to give myself realistic goals. Plus, I-I-I I like being in school, and I'm I think that's a great idea. - It'll help keep you sane, too, with the whole mommy thing. - Exactly. I'll know that I'm working towards something for me. _ Great. _ Michael, actually. You know, we were talking last night. As friends. Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Anyway, I should go to my doctor's appointment. How's everything looking down there? Great. The baby's about five and a half pounds, and you're about ten percent effaced. - Effaced? - As the baby's head drops into the pelvis, the cervix becomes longer and thinner to get ready for birth. Wait, so she's close? How close? Since there are no other signs of labor, I'd say you're still on track for your due date. My due date. _ Oh, okay. Good. Um, is there any chance the baby will come in the next three days? Supposed to take a quick work trip. There's always a chance. Babies come on their own schedule. But it's not likely. Right. Uh, Perce percentage? Less than five percent. Thank you. Uh, it's-it's just a quick trip. It's It'll be fine. But I did want to talk to you, about custody. I've thought a lot about it. And I think the platform should go a couple feet higher, so we can really reach the cheap seats. Throw those folks a bone. On the other hand, maybe we should punish them a little bit for not being able to afford the good seats. _ _ _ This guy cracks me up. Now get up there, let me take a look. Okay. Are you okay? Incredible. Don't worry they wouldn't have us do this if it weren't safe. Stop! I'm sorry, Mr. Murray, but I just can't do this. The truth is I'm terrified of heights. What? I'm sorry, but I am, so this whole platform thing, it's just not gonna work. It's not going to work? Not going to work? I'll tell you what won't work. You. At least not with me again. Oh I have to rethink this. Everybody take ten. And for the love of God, get this thing down. Can't you see she's scared? Thank you. Hey, that's what friends are for. Huh. Maybe exes can be friends after all. And speaking of - Hey. - Hey. Um I just wanted to thank you for talking to Jane. She said that she doesn't think you're a threat to our baby. Really? Well, good. I'm so glad. Yeah. Except she hasn't changed her mind about the whole - custody thing. - What? Yeah, she's being completely unreasonable, saying that as long as your mother's walking around, she won't change her mind. - But - Like I said doesn't make any sense. Now I have to get a lawyer and it'll get ugly. Oh, God, I'm Raf, I am so sorry. I feel terrible. No, hey, come on it's not your fault. You have been incredible, actually. I just It means a lot to me that you tried to help. It means more than you know. Uh-oh. Looks like Jane's not the only one guilty of leaning on someone familiar. I'm sorry, I can't. Maybe if all this baby drama weren't going on, but I'm sorry. Hey, no. There's nothing to be sorry for. Wow. Looks like Petra does have a heart after all. Mother, do you remember how you said you'd do anything for me? Yes, of course. Well here's what I want. You're going to call Detective Cordero and you're going to tell him that, while I was showering, the night of the Palomas, you ran after Alba and pushed her down the stairs. - What? - You going to tell them that I had no idea, and that when you told me the truth, I forced you to confess. Petra, are you insane? I'll be the hero. Jane will drop her custody play. Mother, I am so close to getting him back. You know that's all I want. But what about me? I'll be in prison. You'll strike some sort of plea. Felony Battery. Likely a two-year sentence, and you'll be out in less than that. Afterwards, I'll take care of you. And I'm starting to rethink that whole ""Petra's got a heart"" thing. You owe me, Mother. Now, do you want to call Detective Cordero, or should I? _ It worked. They arrested her. Oh! Confused? Let me explain. - You remember this, right? - But I did want to talk to you about custody. - I've thought a lot about it. -  But what you don't remember probably because you never saw it is this: And I don't want to keep the baby from you. I know you'll be a good father. You were right I need to separate things. And Michael said that your sister checks out, and I don't think that Petra would really hurt the baby. - Thank you, Jane. - But wait. I still want her mother in jail. And I think I know how we can do it. It's a pretty basic technique. You use people's vulnerabilities against them. You're Petra's vulnerability, because she's still in love with you. - Wait, she's not, though. - Trust me. She is. Sometimes you just have to play dirty. And I think that she'd do anything, even turn in her own mother, if she thought she had a chance with you. See? There's a reason - _ - Jane was valedictorian. Oh Thank you. No. Thank you. And-And I feel like I should apologize for letting things get ugly. No. You were worried for the baby. Yeah. That and I was mad, honestly. After you ended it. - Jane - But I get it now. And you were right. It wouldn't have worked in the long run. And that was hard for me to accept, because of how much you hurt me. But I feel like I'm on the other side. Finally. And I really do want us to be friends. Great. - Me, too. - Cool. So have a good trip. - To justice being served. - Yes. Mm-hmm. Mmm. Ah. _ Oh, I got it. - Hey. - Hi. I thought you might like to celebrate. Looks like you got that covered. No, come on in. You can never have too much sparkling cider. What's going on? I am not going to Spain. If there is even a small chance that she can go into labor - What about the company? - I don't know. I'm guessing the board'll vote to sell. But I have to let it go. I can't risk missing the baby, it's not worth it. And I don't want to be like our father. Luisa, this is my chance to make a different choice. Yeah, I I think it's the right choice. Now what about Jane? Well, what about Jane? Call her. Tell her that you just made a mistake and that you still love her. - It is not that easy. - Dude just do it. Now. Come on. Things can change in a moment. So, can I ask you a question? - Of course. - Are you really okay with us being friends? Because, last night Kind of felt like old times, yeah. Okay look, I'm not gonna lie. In a perfect world, I'd want more. But the world's not perfect. And the most important thing is that I want you in my life. And you said friends, so I'm good with that. That's still all you want, right? Yes. Definitely. And she kept telling herself that was true Cool. Over and over All right, I should head home. Uh, I'll talk to you later? Sounds good. Thanks again. Cool. Bye. And over."
"Hi. Remember way back when you first meet Jane Gloriana Villanueva? Daughter of Xiomara. Gran daughter of Alba. Back then, Jane was engaged to Detective Michael Cordero, and across town, Rafael was married to Petra. But then zoinks! Jane was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. So Jane broke up with Michael and Rafael broke up with Petra. And guess what? They fell in love. Until Rafael started spiraling and broke up with Jane which, for the record, he really regrets. Also full of regrets: Petra. See, she owns part of Rafael's hotel, but she doesn't have the one thing she really wants: - Rafael. - Oh. I know! Straight out of a telenovela, right? Well, imagine this: Jane realized her father was her favorite telenovela star, Rogelio de la Vega. And he came back into her life with a vengeance. And that's enough recapping. There's a baby to be born, so let's get popping. Here's what you need to know about Villanueva babies Come on. Push, Xiomara. They come late, they come quick, and they come girl. Come on. Ah! Ah! Push _ - I need you to push again, Xiomara. - I can't. Mommy, I'm tired. _ _ _ _ _ And just like that, another Villanueva came into the world. She's perfect. _ I have a name. Jane. Jane Gloriana Villanueva. Mom, relax. The baby's not due for three weeks. I'm still only one centimeter dilated, and there's no movement, there's no change But I'll never forgive myself if I miss it You won't. But if you miss his Vegas show, Rogelio will never forgive you. You're his opening act! And you guys just became friends again. I know, I know. Plus, you know, this is really good for your career. And it's only three days. Two and a half. And if anything happens Of course, I'll call and you'll be on the next flight out. Okay. Jane? Ah Ah A contraction? Ow, ow! Ow. - Oh, my God. - Ow You're going into labor. Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh I'm sorry I hate you. I'm sorry. It was just so easy. _ So how was it for you and Rafael at the doctor's appointment? Pretty good, actually. You know, I'm glad we broke up when we did. I mean, after the baby it would have been so much messier. Which I told him, by the way. It's not that easy, Luisa. Jane keeps talking about how glad she is that I broke up with her when I did. Because you said that you didn't love her. She needs to know that's not true. Does she? Is that fair? I mean, she's moved on. Jane? What are you thinking? Nothing. Just you know, there was a moment at the doctor's office today. That, there, looks like hair. What? You can see hair? Sometimes. I was bald. That must come from your side. I did have a lot of hair. Wait, like a weird amount? - No, not a weird - Come on, if you had a weird amount, just admit it. Okay, it was kind of a lot. For a minute, it felt like nothing had changed. It was like before I screwed everything up. What happened next? Well, I wanted to take a picture Fine, one. You'll thank me. The timing could not have been worse. The timing was perfect, actually. A reminder: we're better off apart. You know, there's too much crazy drama in his life. And Petra is evil. Of course I don't blame Jane for not wanting to be around her. I mean, I don't even want to be around Petra. Do you even know all the stuff she's done - since we broke up? - I'm not sure. I know about the custody play, the false abuse allegations, - the covering for - The point is, I am finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And with the influx of cash from the Maracay sale _ _ I can actually buy Petra out. If she'll sell. I mean, yeah, she wants to be around you and she clearly wants you back. And I plan on using that. Trust me, I will get her to sell. Ah, I've hinted at a playboy past, have I not? Our Rafael had quite the game. Okay, well, just be careful. That woman is the devil in a pretty package. It is called the Vegas Star Package. Three complimentary buffet breakfasts and unlimited spa time. I already signed myself up for an energizing, 40-minute body buff. Sounds very impressive. As impressive as the city of Las Vegas itself. It's a cultural mecca. My driver's waiting. Where is your mother? Xiomara! Hurry up, Xiomara! _ _ _ _ _ Who are you texting? No one. Just Michael. It's nothing. I actually just canceled dinner with him. So you were having dinner? As friends, Mom. Which, for the record, she tried to believe was true. Don't you guys have a plane to catch? Oh, yes. Yes, we do. Now, if anything happens with the baby Yes, any change, uh, one centimeter more dilated, or a half a centimeter more dilated I will call. I promise. Don't worry. Break a leg. Oy! Oh Dad. Okay. Baby. So I think we should gut the recovery suites. Just turn them into something else entirely. Rafael? Uh Sorry. Uh, could you could you just repeat the last part? I told you he was good at this. Focus. Okay? Look, we need to change the recovery suites. Because right now, they're associated with Rose. I just wanted to drop off some ideas for the upgrade to the Recovery SPA. I agree. - Let's gut them. - Great. And let's also get dinner. - What? - Come on, Petra. I mean, I can't be the only one that's feeling - Not now, Scott. - Sorry, uh it's Miami-Dade Memorial. Patient Representative Department again. What? Is the cancer back? Did you get another scan? Are you okay? No, I am fine, I haven't been there in months. It's probably just a survey, or some billing. Maybe you can take care of it. - No, I-I tried, but it's - Now, Scott. So um we were talking about dinner, I think. What about Trivolo's? Yeah. Trivolo's sounds nice. Hmm. Never heard of Trivolo's. But it seems to mean something to Petra. I know you can't go out, but you still gotta eat, right? Cheeseburgers and half and half fries from River Green. Oh, my God, yes. And it sounds like that means something to Jane. Where is everyone? My mom left for Vegas and my grandma's at physical therapy. Ooh, just the two of them. Got it. Uh, sit, I'll get the plates. Aw, look at that. He knows where everything is. So how's the grad school application coming? Not so good. The school e-mailed me back and they won't accept it because I missed the deadline. By two days. You gotta be kidding me. Do you want to see the e-mail? No, I'm talking about giving up. What happened to the Jane who got a ""B"" on a four-page paper, then wrote a six-page paper explaining why she deserved an ""A""? Come on. Write the admissions person back. _ _ So? - _ - What do you think? Maybe - _ - one less exclamation point. Perfect. I would I would hire you based on this. Hit send. Ah Jane? Oh, my stomach - Ooh - Oh. Um - Ooh ah - Oh. Oh! Wait. What, what's going on? Wow. I think I just had a contraction. Did she just say Like a baby contraction? - I think so. - Uh-oh. I don't know, I've never had one. So my stomach got all tight and then I felt this pressure - Okay, so so what now? - Ooh. What do we do? We time them, my OB said. Um I don't go to the hospital unless it's four minutes apart Ah! Okay, I'll time them, I'm timing them. - Oh - All right? - Oh, there it is again. - What? What? - Take deep breaths, I think. - Uh-huh? - In and out. - Uh-huh ? Good. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Jane - Yeah? Those were definitely less than a minute apart. I think we should probably go to the hospital. Right now. _ _ They're called Braxton Hicks contractions. Or practice contractions, we also call them. Huh? What a letdown. So that wasn't real labor? No, it was a false alarm. Just your body getting ready to give birth. I'm sorry. No, don't be. We got a dress rehearsal in. I got here in just under nine minutes. So you know the difference it's pretty hard to talk through real contractions. Plus, with Braxton Hicks if you put your feet up and drink a glass of water, they'll subside. Real contractions won't. Gotcha. Thanks. This won't happen again. No problem. - Thank you. - Oh, yeah. Michael. It was false labor. Jane's just changing now, so you can go, I'll give her a ride home. Oh, I'll just wait to say good-bye. I'll tell her you said good-bye. You can go. It's okay. I'll wait. Of course you will. Because you're always just here waiting, aren't you? Hoping that she comes running back to you, right? You know, what I am or am not doing with Jane is none of your business, is it? Since you broke up with her. Why don't you just admit that you want her back? Just be man enough to admit it. Okay, you know what? Fine. I do want her back. Are you gonna do something about it? Stop hiding behind your badge for five seconds, maybe I will. Take your best shot. I'd be happy to kick your entitled ass. Emergency room's right over there. Oh, yeah. What's going on? Jane, uh, I was just waiting to say good-bye. Uh, Jane, let's go. Well, you just said good-bye I'd be happy to give you a ride, if you wanted one. - She doesn't need a ride. - Why don't you let her speak, man? I did. Stop it! Are you serious? Doing this, right now, in the hospital? My grandma's nearby. I'm gonna call her for a ride. Jane? Jane that that's not necessary. Yes, it is. Because I don't want to be with either one of you right now. Wow, this place is kind of depressing. That smell That smell is me. Because I'm in prison. I'm sorry, Mother. I know; I know it's not pleasant, okay? But I do have some good news. Is it about my appeal? Well, uh, relatively good news. Um, Rafael asked me to dinner tomorrow, at Trivolo's. The Italian place, where we had our first date! It's happening, Mother, between us. Don't be naive. He's having a baby with another woman. They will be bonded forever. - You know, you're being really negative right now. - Oh! I apologize. Probably because I'm in prison. Hey. Hi. Look, I'm so sorry about what happened at the hospital. I feel terrible. It's just that, seeing him there He drove me. - He's my friend. - Come on, Jane. You heard what he said. That's not what he wants. Honestly, it's none of your business. You broke up with me, remember? What? Tell her, man. It's now or never. I have been waiting for the right time, but there is no right time or place. I made a mistake breaking up with you. I was in a dark place, my dad died, the hotel was falling apart, and I couldn't handle that, and a relationship, and I knew that I was letting you down so, instead of fighting for you, I walked away. And I shouldn't have done that. What are you what are you talking about? I wish that I could take it back, make another decision. You said you didn't love me. That wasn't true. I I didn't think that I was good for you, and so I thought that's what you needed to hear, but I do love you, Jane. Of course I love you! And you and this baby, that's all that matters to me. - You broke my heart. - I know. I And now you're saying that you don't mean it, and that I should just pretend like this didn't happen? - No, that's not what I'm say - No yes, yes, that is what you're saying, and-and it did happen, and I, I want you to get out! - Listen, please - No! Just go! Ma, I'm sure. Nothing's changed you don't have to call every hour. All right? Just focus on dress rehearsal. Hey, someone's here. Yes, I'll check in after my interview. Love you, bye. Love to Rogelio. Hi. I was getting ready to leave, actually. - I have a meeting. - Oh, about grad school? Mm-hmm. That's great, cool. Um, I'll be quick, I just I wanted to apologize about yesterday. I feel really badly. And, uh to make it up to you, I made you this playlist for when you go into real labor.  Ah, push it  I also included ""Born This Way"" and R.E.M.'s ""Everybody Hurts"" So Thanks. And look, I I meant what I said about us being friends. If that's all you want, I'm totally cool with it. But, um, is that all you want? I mean, Jane, am I imagining this, or is something happening lately with us? You're not imagining it. But I don't know where it's coming from, and I mean, there's so much up in the air, - and with you it is safe and familiar and - Oh, wow. - Safe and familiar, huh? - I-I didn't - mean it like that. - You know what, to be clear, I, uh I don't want to be your safe choice, the reality to Rafael the fantasy. - I know that. - Well, and if I am, if that's how it is, or if that's how you feel at all, then tell me. Because I'm not interested. Good luck with your interview. Michael. What the hell are you doing back here? Stand. Put your hands up. Turn around. You remember Nadine, right? _ _ _ _ What do you want? I want to propose a deal. Here's the thing, - _ - while I was very impressed with your passionate e-mail, it doesn't change the fact that the application deadline has passed. Yes, I know. I've had some extenuating circumstances. And I did a little research, and you guys only took six candidates this year. And you took seven the year before that and nine the year before that, which is to say  some discretion involved I know I missed the dea Can you give me a minute? Hmm. Another Braxton Hicks. She had a few on the bus on the way over. Ms. Villanueva, are you all right? Fine! Just Mm. Just gathering my thoughts. Water. Drink more water, Jane. Ooh. Sorry, this happened yesterday, and it's not a big deal. So, whew, where was I? Oh, yes. Extenuating circumstances Where'd you go? Where have you been? I left you, and I made contact with my handler. - Sin Rostro's handler? - Yeah, they picked me up, they blindfolded me, - there was a plane ride - Did they bring you to Rose? - Did you see her? - No. No. But they think that I'm still working for them. So I was able to get information. To help you get Sin Rostro once and for all. And in exchange, I want my family safe and leniency for me. I can't push for a deal without knowing what you're giving me here. I know where the plastic surgeon's been hiding out. Dr. Moncada, the one who changes faces for Rose. And there are also rumors that he changed her face. And if he did, he is the only one that knows what she looks like now. So that's what I have. Okay. I'll check it out. Ms. Villanueva, I really think you should head home - or to your doctor - No, no, no. That's not necessary. Even if they are real, they're really spaced out. I think. You weren't keeping track, were you? - I-I wasn't. - It's okay. I just need you to understand how much this means to me. I definitely understand. I think we all understand, Jane. Now really, go. I'm a doctor of literature, not medicine. Oh. Thank you. I'm on the bus. - What? Why? - Grandma had the car, and it was the quickest way home. Plus, I wasn't really sure if they were real contractions, but I think they are. - How far apart are they? - Like, every eight minutes. So I'm-I'm just gonna - _ - go wait at home. Ooh Oh. Okay. - _ - Seven minutes apart now. Jane, are you okay? Oh. Yeah. I'm okay. - Should you get off the bus? - No. I'm, like, 15 minutes from home. Listen, I should call Rafael before I have another one. I am so sorry, Petra. I just got off the phone with Jane and she went into labor and we are having the baby. Rain check on dinner? Yes. Of course. Uh, hey good luck. Thanks. Okay, Mom, Gabrielle said they're five minutes apart now. - Who's Gabrielle? They're speeding up. - A nice lady on the bus. Just like mine did. How far are you from home? I don't know. We're stuck in traffic. I think there's an acc - What's going on? - Oh! - Honey? - Hey, this is Gabrielle. She's okay. She's just contracting. - How far apart are they? - Less then five minutes now. Listen, I think she should get to the hospital. - We're right near St. Luke's. - I agree. -Hey, is she okay? - She's in labor. - She's in labor? - Oh, my God. Here? - Hi, Mom. I'm back. - Gabrielle and I think that you should go to the hospital. - They're coming too fast. - Come on, let's go talk to the driver. Yeah. Go, go, go. Sorry to bother you, - do you know long we'll be? - She's in labor. - Now? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, and my mom wants me to go to the hospital. She wants to talk to you, actually. - Hello? - Look, when I was pregnant with Jane, I went from eight minutes apart to delivering in an hour. Jane is now five minutes apart. Do you want her to have a baby on that bus? - No. - Let's go! - Take her to the hospital! Take her! - Okay, we're going to the hospital. They're every four minutes now. Is there a doctor on board? I'm a vet. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Is this as fast as you can go? Didn't you ever see Speed? Good luck! Yeah, bye. Jane. Go forward and bring another angel into this world. - Now! - Okay. Bye. Um, Jane, a-are you okay? Do you want to try one of those positions that we Shush. Breathe, in and out. _ Okay. Now would be a good time for the epidural if you're planning to. Should I at least try to labor naturally? I mean, you didn't get an epidural. _ Oh, my God! Yeah, let's go with that epidural. Are you freaking kidding me?! There is not one available flight tonight? No, Noreen, I-I don't think you're lying. I-I'm just wondering if maybe you missed a plane. Fine, I-I'll keep that first one in the morning. Thanks. It really is hard to rehearse without the thunderous applause. What is it? Was I off-key? Was I giving it too much hip? Jane's in labor, but there were no available flights tonight, so I'm leaving first thing in the morning. Which means I have to miss the show. I'm sorry. I don't think it affects the act too much, though, right? It stopped? _ Not ""stopped"" Your labor's just stalled. Oh, there's another contraction. On the bright side, Jane is loving this epidural. - _ - It looks like we could be in for a long night. You should try to sleep a little. I'll check back. - Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor. Gracias. Abuela. Go home, get some sleep. _ Then we'll call you you live five minutes away. Come on. I need you well-rested when the baby comes. Talk about a pregnant pause. - So about yesterday - No, no. No, n-n-n-n-n-no. I'm so Zen right now. No talk about yesterday. Baby stuff only. We need to talk names. Yes, names, uh we were down to three. Rogelio. I know you're upset I'm missing the show. That is not why I'm upset, Xiomara. And the fact that you don't know why I'm upset makes me doubly upset. What are you talking about? I'm talking about how my daughter is about to give birth, but you assume I would have no interest in flying home to be there. You would want to come back? Of course I'm coming back. I already bought my own ticket. Premium first class, of course. Rogelio, I didn't think you would because I know how important this show is to you. You've been trying to impress this director nonstop so you could play Jesus Christ Superstar. There are many Jesus Christs. There's only one Jane. Nothing is more important than family to me. And I am hurt that after all my efforts to join this one, you didn't know that. Now, if you'll excuse me, it was raining quarters before you got here. So we decided then. Yes. _ Nina. - I love it. - Mm, me, too. Nina Villanueva. Has such a nice flow. Um, don't you mean Nina Solano? Oh. No, I didn't. Oh. I just assumed that it would be a Solano. I'm a Villanueva, we aren't married. Well, for the record, I wanted to be. We can go with a combo. - Though I don't love hyphens. - Neither do I. - One middle, one last? - Has to be. I'm assuming you want the last? - I assume you do, too? - I do. But I'm willing to negotiate. I will take the middle position, which we both recognize is the inferior position, but I will need 50% less anger from you. - What are you talking about? - I know it's a big ask, but keep in mind, this was my only sample I am giving up the chance to pass down my family's name. Fine. Yeah. I'm not feeling that. I got to feel it. Otherwise, you are looking at a straight-up coin toss. Look, I don't want to fight with you. I've been thinking about things, and the way you broke up with me sucked. But still, it was a good thing that you did it. No, it wasn't. We want different things from life. Your business needs to take priority. No, it doesn't, and it's not going to anymore. Oh, come one, that's so easy for you to say. All right, lay it out, buddy. Look, things are different now. The reason I didn't go to Spain wasn't because the meeting was canceled. It was because you were dilated, Jane, and the thought of missing the birth, just the smallest chance. So I didn't go to the meeting. And they sold the company. Your dad's company? Yeah. And I'm glad, because somehow with my mom being so awful, I started to idolize him. What you were saying before was right. I don't want his life. He wasn't a good dad. I don't want to be anything like him. And I won't be. And I just want you to know that. I do. And I feel, like, 50% better. So Nina Solano Villanueva it is. I brought you something. It's a picture. And you're in it. Now there's an offer he can't refuse. It's the best I could do in the middle of the night at the business center. It's the day Jane was born. And it's okay that you're mad. But you also have to get over it. Because that's what families do. They get mad at each other, and then they make up. And you're family. Okay? Thank you, Xiomara. I will keep this picture close to my heart forever. Come on, let's get some sleep. - Our flight's early. - Yes. Rogelio de la Vega! _ _ _ _ _ I don't have a good feeling about this. Thought you said your source was solid. Yeah, let's hope I was right. Dr. Moncada! There's nowhere to go! You're outnumbered. Detective, he's over here. So Nadine was right. This is where the plastic surgeon lives. Or lived. Damn it. _  It's another beautiful day   To be Rogelio   Wake up, Rogelio   Wake up, Rogelio   It's another beautiful day to be Roge  Oh, my God. My head is killing me. Why are you screaming at the top of your lungs? What happened last night? I don't know. Rogelifans like to party. _ Oh, my God. What? What is it? Jane's dilated to eight. Hurry, we got to get to the airport. _ Looks like you're at nine, Jane almost there. That's good news. It's just my mom and my dad are in the air flying _ I can't make the deal. But my information was good. The guy was dead, Nadine. We have no leads on Sin Rostro. We need concrete information. Cops don't exactly love dirty cops. I'm not dirty, Michael. You know me. Let me talk to Armstrong, see what he says. I can't promise you anything. Okay, Jane, it's time to start pushing. It could take time, okay? Your mom's plane is landing. She's not gonna make it, not with traffic. It's okay. I can do this. Uh, you know, I'll call Michael. He can meet the plane, give them a police escort back. Really? Yes, there's no guarantee that she'll be here, - but at least there's a chance, okay? - Okay. - Mm-hmm. - Okay, Jane. It's time to start to push. One, two, three Change of plans. Jane's in labor. I have to pick up her parents from the airport, bring 'em to the hospital. I'll be back. Oh, Michael! What a rookie mistake. We're gonna need a little more! You're doing good. Hey, okay. Deep breaths. Come on, Jane! Push! A little more! Okay, okay! - I can't. - Keep going, Jane! It's been an hour. - Another push, Jane! - No. I can't. I'm too tired! I can't! Is there a baby yet? Mom! Oh, baby! Mom! Oh, I'm so tired. I know, honey. Oh, I Oh Five more minutes of pain for a lifetime of happiness. So push or I'll yank that kid out myself! Okay, okay. Okay. Here we go. One, two and It's a boy. What?! A boy? _ We don't know anything about boys. Well, I'm here, and I'm happy to answer any questions. He looks great. A boy. A beautiful boy. He's beautiful. We can't name him Nina, right? No. It should be noted that at this very moment after everything But I've never had sex! - I'm proposing. - I'm pregnant. You want to break up. Am I imagining this or is something happening with us? Jane's heart was full. I meant what I said, Jane. I never stopped loving you. This is what I want. Our family. I know. And I'll think about it. But not right now. Right now, the only boy Jane wanted to think about was her son. I do have an idea though. For a name. Ready? Mm-hmm. His name is Mateo. Oh, Janie. That's my dad's name. _ Well, there's more. It's kind of a long name. - ""Kind of""? - Okay. It's Mateo Gloriano Rogelio Solano Villanueva. You named him after me? Yes. It's in there, but we-we're just - gonna call him Mateo though. - Yeah. We'll see how nicknames develop. Matelio, perhaps? It's perfect. He's perfect. _ It's Miami-Dade Memorial again for Mr. Solano. And he told me not to bother him. He's in his office with his sister. He's packing to go back to the hospital to spend the night with his son. What? He had a son? Uh, yes, ma'am. Anyway, look, I don't want to bug him. And they said they could speak with Mrs. Solano? - Which you were - Fine. I'll take it. Hi, this is Mrs. Solano. How can I help you? Get to the point. Excuse me? It should be noted that Petra's first thought upon hearing what she heard was ""Rafael."" She had to tell Rafael. But then she heard this I mean, I feel a little bad about manipulating Petra. But I just want her out of my life. I have a family now. With Jane. Hey. Well, I'll be quick. I just want to see him. Considering I broke about Can I? Mm-hmm. Wow. He's so cute. I think so. I'm biased, so No, he is. He looks just like you. - You think so? - So listen um, about before - Michael - No, I just want to say I don't want you to worry about any of that right now. You just focus on Mateo. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that this was the most perfect thing Michael could have said. Well, anyways, I should probably get going. Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Yeah, see you. Lieutenant? It worked. She's gone. Yeah, the tracker's in her phone. She'll head back to Sin Rostro's people eventually. She's got nowhere else to go. Huh. Shouldn't have underestimated him. Seems like he had a plan. And speaking of plans Mrs. Solano, let me get Diane. I know she wanted to speak to you directly. Yes, I should think she would. Oh, I should probably fill in some gaps. Remember that call Petra took earlier? Hello? Yeah, this is Mrs. Solano. How can I help you? Well, it's time to show you the other side of that call. My name is Diane. I work at Miami-Dade Memorial. We've recently taken over the fertility clinic that housed Mr. Solano's original sperm sample. The clinic was a disaster. We've just finished sorting through all of their mistakes. Get to the point. Your husband's original sperm sample was split into two vials. One was misplaced. We've just found it. Mrs. Solano? Is that my husband's sample? Yes, and again, we are so embarrassed. We're happy to continue to store it free of charge. Well, unfortunately, I can't really trust you. Can I? So I'm taking it myself. Oh, brother. Or sister! Hey, how's Jane? Good. Nursing. Yeah. What are you looking for in there? If you must know, my concealer. It's been a very emotional day. So I'm a little rough around the eyes. Is this yours? No. Maybe it's our last rehearsal? I hope it's not a sex tape. Yeah, you and me both. Oh, good, we both have our clothes on. Yes. It What Wait, why are we in a chapel? I-I don't know. Why, why are we holding hands? Why are we walking? Stop walking, Rogelio! Wait, this has to be some kind of joke! I mean, we were both so drunk. I totally do! I totally do, too! And by the power vested in me by the state of Nevada and the goddess Cher, who is with us here in spirit tonight, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. Okay, I am not a huge baby person, but that is one cute kid. Hey there, I'm Helen. I'm the new nurse on call. - Hi. - I hear you're our champion nurser. Oh, it's all Mateo. He's very smart. Well, according to his chart, he hasn't had his hearing test. Oh, it was a full house earlier. I'm sorry. No problem. I'll take him. It'll be ten minutes. No needles. Just a high-pitched sound. Take a quick nap. He'll be right back. I know your hearing's perfect. And I love you. There you go. Bye, Mateo. No! It can't be! To state the obvious, friends Where in the world is she taking Mateo Gloriano Rogelio Solano Villanueva? And I'd love to tell you but it will have to be later because this brings us to the end of part one."
"Hey, you guys. Welcome back. When Jane was young, her grandmother taught her to protect her flower. _ _ And so, Jane waited. Which wasn't always easy. This was Jane's fiancÃ© Michael. He's a detective. Their life was perfectly on track until  Oh, there you are, Dr. Alver. You have an insemination in seven and a pap in eight. - I got it.  - She does not ""got it."" Are you ready for your insemination? Hi, yes! I artificially inseminated the wrong woman. And the father to be? Rafael Solano, the rich owner of the Marbella Hotel. See, Rafael had cancer so it was his very last sperm sample or so he thought. But guess what happened? Jane and Rafael, they fell in love. So, Jane broke up with Michael. And Rafael broke up with Petra. Until Rafael started spiraling and broke up with Jane  which for the record, he really regrets. Also full of regrets? Petra. See, she owns part of Rafael's hotel, but she doesn't have the one thing she really wants. Rafael. So, when this happened  Your husband's sperm sample was split into two vials. One was misplaced. We just found it. She naturally took it herself. I know, straight out of a telenovela, right? Well, imagine this  Jane's father was international telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega. And he reconnected with her mother Xiomara. And remember Detective Michael? Well, he was on the hunt for Sin Rostro, a notorious crime boss who ran a plastic surgery ring, changing criminals' faces. And Sin Rostro turned out to be Rafael's stepmother Rose. And she disappeared and who knows what she looks like now? I know, OMG, right? And speaking of OMG, Jane had her baby. A beautiful boy named Mateo, and then, this happened  Bye, Mateo. Which, I'm afraid, is where we left off. _ _ _ To give some context, - _ - last night's episode of The Miracles of Mariana ended with quite the frightening cliffhanger. _ Yeah, but, I just don't know if I can stomach all the ups and downs. Then don't watch. Of course I'm watching. - _ - Did you make me ? _ _ _ _ _ Jane would think about that theme song briefly when she was told the worst news ever. But that hasn't happened yet. You see, we're only  _ Definitely not that one. Wait, what's wrong with this one? Well, he's got a hat on. We got to send one out that shows his hair. He's known for his hair. He's known for his hair? Well, he will be when we send out the birth announcement. Hey, what are you two doing over there? - Nothing. - I agree. Just discussing their drunken wedding night in Vegas. - Where's Mateo? - Matelio. How long's the hearing test take anyway? He's only been gone nine minutes. You timed it? We're on a nursing schedule. You have to keep track. When he eats, which boob, how long? Mom, it's helpful. - Hey, there. - Hi. I'm here to take Mateo for his hearing test. Oh, another nurse took him. Really? Who? Helen, her name was. There's no nurse in maternity named Helen. It should be noted that moments before getting the call that would change everything, Michael was feeling well, I'll be honest  a little blue. You okay, buddy? Oh, yeah. Just, uh, I don't know, a little blue. Yeah. Me, too. I got passed over for a promotion. Again. Ah, that sucks. My ex-fiancÃ©e was, uh, accidentally artificially inseminated with the sperm of this rich hotel owner, who she just happened to have a crush on in high school. And they had their baby tonight, so Wow. You win. Hello. Hello, Detective Cordero. Rose? - _ - Or Sin Rostro. I always did love a good play on words. Why are you calling? Because I have something you want. I want answers! That's what I want! - _ - Where is our son?! We don't know. The baby's not in the hospital. And I've just got word that surveillance tapes show the woman, the one Jane described According to his chart, he hasn't had his hearing test. Oh, it was a full house earlier. I'm sorry. No problem. I'll take him. She's on surveillance leaving the building. We've called the police and we've issued an AMBER Alert. I'll retweet it. Jane, honey? Which brings us here now, to that moment I mentioned, when Jane wished for a theme song. Something to tell her it would be all right. But there wasn't a theme song. There was only  Michael? Hey. Michael, someone took him. Someone took Mateo. Jane, I-I need you to listen to me for a second. - Are you listening? - What is happening? Jane, listen, I need you to clear out the room. I know who has Mateo and I know how to get him back. _ Wait, Rose? I don't understand. What does she want? Let's call it a trade. I had a dragonfly broach. Luisa took it when we last saw each other. And it was of real value. Apparently, it was logged into evidence at your police station. Get it out and I'll give you Mateo. Do the police even do that? - Do they make trades? - It doesn't matter. This can't be official. She said just me. - What?! - Look, following her instructions is the quickest, safest way to get Mateo back. And that is all I want. You know that's all I want. I trust him, please. Fine, but I am going with you. - Okay. - Me, too! Wait, what? No, you just gave birth. Yeah, exactly. I'm his mother. And I have to feed him in 92 minutes. So I'm not gonna just sit here and wait. I'm going. End of story. _ I'm just gonna need a hand out of bed. _ Grab those wipes. And-and grab that burp cloth. Oh, and I need pants. _ Hey, can you grab me that bag of, um, - _ - adult diapers? All right, let's go! _ Just answer me did you take the pin? You don't have it? You're not gonna get in trouble. Did you take the pin? We'll be right there. Wait, where are we going? - Who has it? - Your sister. Luisa?! No, not Luisa! Luisa, calm down. _ Ah, who am I kidding? Where is the pin? I w-went to get it and _ What's that, babe? _ Oh, nothing. The police just wanted something to do with Rose. Your ex-girlfriend? Um, it's some, like, evidence thing. You kept a box of her stuff? No! Okay, yeah, but They-they were just cataloging so much, I didn't think that they would miss it. You saved things from your psychopath ex-girlfriend?! Okay, first of all, she's not a psychopath. - She's a sociopath. - Oh, my God! - You're still hung up on her! - No, Juicy, I swear, I'm not. I'm really not. Will you just please give that back? No! No friggin' way! - Juicy! Juicy! - No! Wait! No! Oh, no! Oh! Go. Go! Guys, I got it! Come on! Hurry up and get out of the pool! She'll call. The minute Jane has him, she'll call. Just Gloria Estefan. She wants to know if there's anything she can do. _ _ _ _ _ Give me the baby. Ah, yes. You remember Nadine, right? _ Do you at least understand now why I went to work for her? This, this is what she does, Michael. She makes it so that you can't say no. Give me Mateo. Where's the pin? Do you even want to know what's on the chip inside? No. All of the faces Sin Rostro changed crime bosses, drug lords. It's a record of what they looked like before and what they look like now. Still want to trade? Yes. Huh. Rose was right. See, I wasn't so sure you would do it. Oh, my God. Oh! Go! Run! And so, Rafael ran. And then, even though she shouldn't have been physically able to, Jane ran, too. Well, we'll call it running, that thing she's doing. The point is Jane made it to her son. Oh, you're okay. You're okay. Mommy's here. Aww, and they all lived happily ever after. Well, except for Jane. And Rafael and Michael. And things are really screwed up with Luisa, and Xo and Ro, and don't get me started on Petra. Anyway, let's just enjoy this moment. Because it won't last. It's okay. And so, Mateo Gloriano Rogelio Solano Villanueva had quite a dramatic first night, causing enough worry for a lifetime. So he was gone 142 minutes A fact his mother would remind him when, at 16, he was nearly two hours late for his curfew. Which is only 20 minutes from when I would have fed him. But that's the distant future. Right now, Jane just wanted to hear two little words. He looks great. - He's fine. - Oh! That's what I was thinking, but ""He looks great"" works, too. I'm sorry, I'm just so happy. So let's get him on the scale, huh? Okay. Okay, looks like - he's six pounds and nine ounces. - Wait, what? He was seven pounds when he was born. - Why would he lose weight? - Well, it can actually take babies up to two weeks to get back up to their birth weight, which is why I'm not too concerned. Oh, you can get him now. Okay, so you're not too concerned. Does that mean that you're a little concerned? Observe Jane trying not to panic. Well, that's about ten percent already, so it's at the outer limits of normal, but you're nursing. So it's likely your milk just hasn't come in. Should we get him a bottle, maybe? No, I really want nursing to work. No, I just mean in the meantime. Bottles can get in the way. It's a supply and demand thing. The more the baby eats, the more she makes. Look who was paying attention in lactation class. Oh, right, the one he was too busy to come to. There could also be nipple confusion. Mom, now you're just showing off. Observe Rafael trying to pretend he knows what nipple confusion is. It means that Mateo can get confused between the bottle and the breast and the concern is that he would prefer the bottle. Just try to contribute something, man. Not if he's my son. Ooh, not that. So, how's the nursing been going? I thought okay, just short. He falls asleep pretty quickly. Oh, you have to nip that in the bud. Wake him up, wet washcloth - to his cheeks and his feet. - Got it. Is there anything else that you can think of off hand? Maybe we can take another class together. Mom, you were rolling your eyes the entire class. No, not the whole time. Let's go. I'm in. Sounds like a plan. Let's weigh Mateo again in the next few days and see where he's at, okay? Okay. But you're okay. You know, it's a damn miracle. A woman changing her mind, leaving the baby at a church like that. Yeah, no kidding. Anyway, I got to head out. Yeah, one last thing. Nadine Hanson's tracker was disabled last night. One last thing, tell Nadine to toss her cell. Can't help wondering if someone tipped her off on our side. What are you implying? You were partners. I have to ask. I'm the one who planted that tracker. You know how important catching Sin Rostro is to me. This was true, second only to  Go home, shower. I'm just gonna go feed him. And sleep. She needs to sleep. Look, we've got to try to get back to normal, right? Yeah, right. But it didn't feel right. Mr. Solano. _ Hi. Didn't expect to see you here so soon. I'm not really here, Scott. Just wrapping up some loose ends. You know, Petra's taking care of that meeting with the bank. Gotcha. So should I just wake her, then, or ? What? Ah, yes, Petra. _ - _ - Petra. You know what? It's been a while since we last saw Petra. I should catch you up. _ Last night, after stealing her ex-husband's sperm, Petra did what any reasonable person would do. She drunk dialed her mother. After being hung up on three times by the North Miami-Dade Women's Correction Institution, Petra decided to make a pro-con list. _ _ Well, there was just the one. _ Uh-oh. Beer goggles. Come on, baby, you know you want me. Petra! What is this? - Rafael, wait - You and Luisa have a meeting with the bank in an hour. Obviously, I don't want my sister to talk Have you been drinking? It's been an emotional night. How's your son? He's great. Great. I have the meeting under control, okay? Anything else? No. Thank you, Petra. I'll say this. The girl's got spunk. Hey. Why aren't you sleeping? I'm not tired. What if I hold him? You think you'll be able to sleep then? Yeah. Mmm. _ _ - I'm not tired, Ma. - Ah. _ _ _ Mi amor. It's over, right, Mom? Yes. It's over. Totally over. And so Jane closed her eyes, and for the first time since giving birth, she slept. For eight and a half minutes. Do you hear that? I think I know that sound. Whoa Okay, so maybe it's not totally over. I don't understand. - How did this happen? - It all began when international telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega retweeted an AMBER Alert that his grandchild was kidnapped. He then tweeted the baby's safe return. _ From there, the story got really #Crazy. See, when you Google the name Jane Villanueva, this comes up. Oh, no. Could this be a modern-day miracle? - No! - Yes. She was a teacher in our school. And you exploited me! And we believed in her. Especially when things started happening. Things? What things? I have no idea. We tried to get pregnant for seven years. _ I'm not sure. And then I hugged Jane. No We're due in three months. Ever heard of a coincidence, lady? _ Abuela! And it gets stranger. Apparently, Jane went into labor on the 125 bus line. Let's meet the woman who assisted her, the angel, Gabriel. - It's Gabrielle. - All right. Can you tell us anything about this miraculous ride? I don't know if it was miraculous. Yes, exactly. Thank you, Gabriel. Gabrielle! But some might disagree. I actually saw the baby. What the hell? It should say ""Slutty Crystal."" My mistake. I was coming out of my car this morning she was having sweaty car sex so her mom wouldn't know she was back with Dumbass Donny. And Jane was holding the baby, and, I swear, he had this glow. Okay, okay, enough, enough! What am I gonna do? Jane, I've been dealing with the press for many years. Let me help. - Okay. - But first, do you want to shut it down or do a tour of the morning shows and turn this into a book deal? Dad, I want to shut it down. That's what I assumed. So we should release a straightforward statement, emphasizing the fact that this was a medical mistake. Oh, good. Rafael's right on time for lactation class. Are you the father?! - What the hell is going on? - It's crazy. Oh! - Oh, my God. Logan just said we were on TV! - Oh, my gosh! - Oh, hi, Jane. How are you? - Selfie! _ #BabyMateo, #Miracle, #SecondComing. You have three tags trending - It's outrageous. - Girls! Stop it! Enough! Stop it, stop it, stop it, girls, stop it. Okay, come in. I don't even know how I'll get out of here to go to the class. I mean, they'll probably follow us. They will definitely follow you. But don't worry. I know how to evade the paparazzi. And to give him credit, he did. Which brings us here. _ Hey, Jane. What's going on? _ Well, uh, Mateo falls asleep when he's nursing. And he just lost so much weight in the first day. Exactly like mine. It was an issue with her latch. Move into the sun a little bit. Indirect sunlight is good for them in the first days. Oh, okay. Thank you so much. I was also wondering does, um, trauma affect milk supply? Definitely. Milk can come in later for mommies who've had C-sections. How about mommies who've had kidnappings? Don't worry. We'll figure it out. Now, let me see your breasts. Hmm. We're not shy here. Oh, no, me neither. Okay then Oh, okay. Yeah. Huh. We'll fix it. Pick up the baby, and when he opens wide, I'm gonna stuff your breast into his mouth like a hamburger, okay? Uh, let's give her some privacy. Thanks again for the police escort. Oh, no problem. I think that's what Rogelio thinks I do all day is drive around celebrities. - Actually, I'm gonna wait in the car. - Hey, can I can I ask you something? You know what? I'm gonna bust in here and translate for Michael. - _ - Sure. How did you deal with how close they all are? You know, the Villanueva women. - _ - Meaning? I could just kind of use some advice. - _ - Oh, wow. It's just I'm having a hard time finding that moment to assert myself. _ With the baby, you know? _ I mean, it's my kid, too. And I'm kind of feeling like it's hard to get in there. You know? Okay, a quick rundown of Michael's options. _ _ _ _ And he chose  Any other option, seriously. I mean, if she would have just chosen any other option I'm sorry. Are you actually blaming the banker for your behavior at the meeting? So can we get you something to drink? Just a juice. Juice. Juicy. I'm sorry, I'm having trouble with my girlfriend. Okay, we're done here. Now, on to important stuff. The sperm. - Scott? - Yeah? I had a little shopping bag small, blue. Oh, yeah, the baby present. I put it up in Mr. Solano's penthouse for you. I believe the words you're looking for are, ""Oh, crap."" _ Ah, yes. You'll recall, we left Petra on the hunt for a metallic canister filled with her ex-husband's last semen sample. Hello? Hmm, where could it be? Ooh, the baby nursery. What's wrong? You just ate, and we straightened out the latch. Well, there's still about 25 people out there. They know if they step on this property, I arrest them for trespassing. What is that? _ _ _ Got to be kidding me. They will go away. Eventually. Things do, after all, go away. _ A cupcake? I had the OB write down the sex. So blue inside, it's a boy. Pink, it's a girl. - Really? - Yeah, it's cheesy, okay? I know, I'm hormonal, so I Hey. I love it. Ready? Yeah. Does that look like blue or pink to you? It looks - purple. - Purple. Great. Hurry up, Petra. Wait, why am I rooting for her? Petra. What are you doing here? I'm looking for you, actually. Well, part of you, anyway. To tell you that your sister was a disaster in the meeting. She cried. My purse, please. Hey, Raf. You cried? Seriously? I needed that loan so I could afford to buy Petra out. You knew that. You knew I've been doing everything to try to get her on my side. Flirting even. But you are so selfish that you don't Look, I'm sorry. You know what? I don't even know why I'm surprised anymore. Hey. You okay? You know me so well. Yeah, plus you were sighing pretty loud, so I did this. I brought the paparazzi upon her, Michael. If I hadn't retweeted that AMBER Alert I never thought I'd feel anything but #Blessed to be famous. But now I'm feeling #Cursed. From my standpoint As resident Villanueva expert? As a cop, you did everything right. Nine out of ten times, that AMBER Alert would have really helped us out. But I just feel so impotent, Michael. Not in a sexual way, but in a paternal way. That kind of makes sense, you know? Is it like Jane's going through so much, you just don't know how to help her? Exactly. In the last 24 hours, I have ruined multiple celebrity friendships by tweeting their dirty secrets in an effort to distract the press. It has not worked. You know what, no more tweeting. 'Cause tweeting is not gonna help Jane right now. So think smaller. Less celebrity stuff, more grandfather Abuelo. Do you have a name in mind? Papa. Nice, ambiguous. Nice. Okay, so think Papa stuff. Oh, okay. Okay. All right, okay. He's eating again? Yeah, he must not have gotten enough. Why don't we just give him one bottle? No, I don't want to. But, baby, you're exhausted. You haven't slept in 48 hours. I'm his mom. I have to stay strong. Mothers don't always have to be strong. Hon. I'm sorry. Just think I'm a little overwhelmed. And I'd be okay, if I knew it was working, but he just keeps crying, like he's hungry. Look, I get all the great reasons to nurse, but if it isn't working But I have to make it work. It can't be my trauma getting in the way. - Why? - Because what happened is my fault. I mean, my maternal instincts, where were they? I just gave him to the nurse. Baby she was wearing a uniform. She said he needed a hearing test. But I should've known. And I didn't. And I know it doesn't make sense, but I just want to be able to do this for him. I just want to be able to do this one good thing. And even though Xo agreed, it really didn't make any sense, she too wanted to do something good for her child. How can I help? When he opens his mouth, will you stuff my boob in it like it's a hamburger? Honey, I am all over it. And it should be noted, she was. And then she was again. And stuff. And yet again. - _ - And stuff. Is everything okay? We don't know. He's nursing every 30 minutes. I must be doing something wrong. Maybe he's cluster feeding. Which brings us back, here. Come on, did you doubt Michael? He's a mensch. Get a book and read it so you know what you're talking about. Then wait for the right moment, when she doesn't know and her mom doesn't know, and even Abuela is stumped, that's when you come in with the save. Cluster feeding. Uh, it's like when a baby eats and eats before the mature milk comes in. I read it here. _ _ _ My milk is coming in. Oh, my God, my milk is coming in! Your milk is coming in! _ Nice work. Yes. Family fist bump. Family fist bump. Look who's cluster feeding? Yeah? And pooping. Papa time. I insist on changing his diaper. I just need someone to tell me exactly how to do it. I'll help. Thanks, Dad. Oh His first smile. Oh, how sweet  the way that none of them told him it was just gas. Okay, so I should take off. Uh, wait. I just wanted to thank you. You know, for your advice earlier. Aw, he's a mensch, too. No problem. What advise? I was just having a little trouble figuring out my place, you know, with your family. It's just, you guys are all so close, you know? No, I get that. And I know we are trying to get back to normal, but it's not normal what happened. discuss what our normal would be and even if we did, I don't know if it would count, because how do you know how you feel unless you're here? How do you feel? Like I don't want to be away from Mateo. So, do you want to stay over? Like, for like the first couple weeks? I was angling for, like, a - What? - Yes. - Great. - Great. Dude, options two and three were just sitting there. Oh, I, uh, still have Rogelio's phone. What? Someone tweeted a photo. Oh, God, of Mateo? Move into the sun a little bit. Indirect sunlight is good for them in the first days. Let it be known that any doubts about her maternal instincts shattered at this moment, and Jane had one thought and one thought only. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jane, where are you going? To shut this down. Wait, how? I have no idea. And that's when it hit her  a beam of divine inspiration. Okay, honestly, the beam was just a reflection coming off Slutty Crystal's compact, Well, that's for theologians to debate. But the fact remained that if her makeup wasn't smudged from sweaty car sex, Crystal wouldn't have had to fix it. And the light wouldn't have shown, providing the answer to Jane's problem. Jane, hello. Sister Margaret? Here's the thing. I didn't want to come out here before, 'cause the truth is I've had sex. A lot. In cars even. I just didn't want my grandma to know, but with all this, I decided to tell her the truth. So, now I'm telling you. I don't believe you. Well, it's true. And regardless, do you want to be involved in a public debate about my virginity? I mean, doesn't that sound archaic? What? Oh, my God! I'm leaking milk! Actually leaking! You want to see a miracle? This is a friggin' miracle! Look at this! Look at this! It's really over. And I don't want it to be. And I, I just, I feel like I don't know, I think, I think maybe I just feel a little lonely. I am so sorry, sweetheart, that things are so difficult for you. _ _ Mm, that's life. Now, do the reasonable thing. Sell Rafael's sperm back to him. I'm not selling it, Mother. Your choice. Just move on. Which for the record, she was trying to do when  Hey, I want to schedule a makeup meeting with the bankers. My brother's mad at me and I just You okay? Please, stop pretending to my friend, Luisa. I heard you the other night talking to Rafael, okay? I mean, I feel a little bad - _ - about manipulating Petra, but I have a family now with Jane. And you walked away? Yes, of course, I walked away. And was it divine providence that these two met at this moment  Then you missed Raf saying how he had no choice. Jane insisted. When Luisa was determined to find some way to help her brother with his Petra situation. And then, I asked him, point blank if all things were even who he wished he was with. What did he say? Well again, that's for theologians to debate. But the fact remains  the following events did exactly transpire. He got mad at me, actually. Because if I hadn't screwed up in the first place, then none of this would be happening, which it's true. I mean, that should have been your baby. Thank you. What? - _ - The baker says it's a boy! It's a boy? It's a boy. It's a boy?! You're right. It should have been my baby. To be fair: Luisa didn't know Petra had Rafael's sperm. There's still a chance with you and Raf. I swear. And so it was that after a quick Google search, and some pointers from fertilitygoddess1345  A sandwich and the extra turkey baster? Perfect. Thank you. Petra decideth  to go for it. Okay, it looks like Mateo is seven pounds and two ounces. What?! That's better than before. We hug now, right? Yes. And I'm impressed. Good job. Go-go tell your mom. Okay. Better than before? Yes! Okay, I'm going back in. _ Yeah, I think I'm just overwhelmed. Mm. _ I've just been so worried about her. _ So I think there's something I should tell you and Jane now that everything's okay. By the power vested in me by the state of Nevada and the goddess Cher, who is with us here in spirit, I now pronounce you man and wife. You got married? By a Cher impersonator?  Oh, if they could turn back time.  It was obviously a mistake. We're getting it annulled. _ - Abuela! - Ma! Ã¿QuÃ©? Morning, boss. It's not a good time, Scott. Oh, I'll be quick. I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm? Oh, Petra. You thought you got off scot-free. _ _ _ _ Home, huh? Just wanted to make sure there were no more crazy people around. Mm-hmm. You know, I haven't had a chance to say thank you. For I don't know. How do you say for everything? For everything. Oh, of course. You know anything. All in a day's work for our Villanueva family advisor. - So, you know Rafael's staying over. - Oh, I know. No, but, like, just as the baby's father. Huh? You don't tell that to an advisor. That was weird. I don't even know why I'm telling you that. But Michael knew exactly why. No. I just wanted to try some skin-to-skin contact. What? Well, it helps babies bond with their dads. It's, uh, chapter 12 in the book. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, I read that. It was a really cool chapter. So I should probably go to sleep. I have to be up in, um Okay. Good night. Night. This is a little weird. Yeah, but it was always gonna be weird. True. And it's actually kind of regular weird. Which is good? Yeah. It's really good. And so it was. For now. - _ - Oh, wait, I forgot one thing. _ _ I could really use some ""it's-going-to-be-okay"" theme music right about now. _"
"All right, where were we? Oh, yes. Jane and Rafael's new baby was kidnapped by the evil Sin Rostro, _ also known as Rafael's stepmother Rose. And she was operating a secret plastic surgery ring redoing criminal's faces. But thanks to Michael's heroics  I know who has Mateo, and I know how to get him back. - they got Mateo back, - Oh, my God. And everybody was super grateful. Also grateful? Petra, because the fertility clinic discovered one last sample of Rafael's sperm. And thanks to some wise words from Rafael's sister Luisa  That should have been your baby! A few too many drinks and a willing turkey baster well, you get the idea. But she didn't get off Scott-free. I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm. And let's not forget - Rogelio and Xiomara. - I totally do! - I totally do, too! - Remember, they're still married from their drunken Vegas wedding. But they're planning to get that annulled. And, of course, Jane has a big decision to make. Who does she love? Michael or Rafael? Okay, okay, enough guessing. Let's do this thing! When Jane Villanueva began dating Michael Cordero Jr. She tried to take an interest in the things that interested him. The books he liked to read  Mind blowing, right? The movies he liked to watch How crazy is this? So crazy. And the places he liked to go  _ which brings us here, to a campground in Central Florida. - 104, actually. - In the hundred-degree heat. My mistake. Wow, they said that's some kind of record high. - Okay. - Uh-huh? I'm done. To make up for the heat - and the bugs - Uh-huh? And the rash you got from the bug spray I have whittled you a giraffe. Thank you. That is so random. I know. But it's the closest to what the stick looked like, so It's sweet. You're so sweet. And I'm fine Actually, no, I'm not! I'm not, ah I can't do this. - What? - I hate camping. And I know you love it, so I wanted to try it, but you should know this: it's never happening again. And I hope that's not a deal breaker. No, it's not. Actually can't think of any deal breakers, here, to be honest. - Wow. - What? God I'm sorry. - You got the stank. Like - What? - My eyes are watering. That's how bad - No! - No, you said no deal breakers. - No. No! To be honest, it was the grossest Jane had ever been  until now. Uh-oh. Maybe Wednesday? No, because that's when the new neighbors started with their band practice, so she was up all night and slept all day. - Sunday? - No. _ I'm telling you. Saturday. That was her last shower. Wow. So that's, like, a full seven days. _ Hey it's daddy time! Hi, Mateo. And you need some mommy time. Why don't you hop in the shower? Oh, yeah, but I was gonna clean up a little bit first. _ Let's just take that off. Oh, a nice hot shower? I'm so jealous. - Yeah, go on, get in there. - Okay, then. - Guess I'll take a shower. - Might as well. Hey, just checking in. - Coffee for - Me! For me. Uh, Michael, Jane is about to jump in the shower. Great. Coffee for Rogelio. Jane, enjoy your shower. You know what? I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap instead. _ Oh! That's a good burpie. Yeah. With just a little spit up. Yeah. Okay, hon. Time for a reality check. First off, you are really kicking ass as a new mom. Thanks. Yeah, I feel like I finally finally got a little routine down. You definitely do. And on that note I think it's time to pop the new baby bubble. What do you mean? Take a shower. Run a comb through your hair. Maybe even leave the house. With Mateo? Oh, no, no. I-I'm not ready for that. Why not? What if he gets hungry? Your boobs come with you. Yeah, well, he's been fussy lately. You'll soothe him, honey. Or-or change him. Maybe just do something simple. Go to lunch. Have one of your boyfriends take you. Okay, stop with that. I can't. It's like an episode of The Bachelorette out there. It's not like that. You know, with what happened _ _ we're all in a different place. Which, for the record, was true. At first. _ - Hey! - Hey! _ - Hey. - Hey. _ Hey. Regardless, romance is the last thing on anyone's mind. Gotcha. Anyone want to take Jane out to lunch? - I'll I'll drive. - Yeah. Let's do it. Okay, great. We'll all go to lunch, then. And relax. Deep breath in  and out Good. Now, lie still and let the needles work their fertility magic. I'll be back in 30 minutes. Petra. I can't move my face, Scott, so you can't see how aggravated I am with your timing. Yeah, well, you see my face? I'm aggravated, too. You're stalling. I'm not stalling. She was definitely stalling. I'm laying the groundwork. It's not every day I recommend his assistant become the manager of the lounge. Executive assistant. Oh. Well, that's a position I can get you That's what I am! You have until the end of the day, or I'm gonna tell Rafael that you stole his sperm. Have him sign my new contract. Of course I didn't read the contract. Who reads contracts? That's what I have lawyers for. At least I did, anyway. You're fired. No, you go to the meeting at 2:00! Okay, what's going on? Nothing. We're being sued by the producers of our Vegas show for half a million dollars. - What? - They said we violated our contract by skipping the show for Matelio's birth. So, in punishment, they would like us to perform on one of their cruise ships. And Cruise ships is where old people perform. I mean, who am I? Charo? Who is a dear friend, by the way. I would lay down my life for her. But I don't want her career. How many shows would we have to do? I don't know. I hung up on my former lawyers. Okay, I guess we'll find out at the meeting. Until our annulment on Monday, I am still your wife. You get sued, I get sued. And I am not getting sued. Meanwhile  on the most dramatic two-on-one date ever! Okay. So far, so good. We're out of the house. Well, maybe not the most dramatic. - Everything okay? - Yet  Yeah. The table's just, like, a little wobbly. - Oh, I can take care of that. - Oh, I can take care of that. Here. - Got it! - Oh! I'm-I'm fine. Look, Jane, there's a four-""cheese"" grilled cheese here. Actually, cheese has been giving the baby gas, so Jane's off it until she's done nursing. That's why ""cheese"" was in quotes. It's soy cheese. You know what? I'm in the mood for a turkey burger, actually. Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? Diaper change? I think he's due for one. - Yep. I'll take him. - Okay. Such a good boy. You know Mommy needed to escape. What? I mean, you dove under the table. This is my family, okay? What are you even doing here? I wouldn't be here if Jane didn't want me here. Yes, Mr. Sweetface. Oh, mwah! We did it. Yes, we did. Our first public diaper change. - Great. So now that you're out of your bubble, let's talk. - Uh It is crazy tense out there and you need to make a decision. - I can help. - Who are you? Who do you think I am? My guardian angel? No. Oh, that's lame. I'm Bachelorette Jane. _ So? Which guy are you leaning towards? I don't know. I haven't been thinking like that. Well, it's time to. 'Cause that situation is a powder keg. Oh, my God  Is that Rose? - Oh - Oof  You okay? - What's wrong? - I saw a woman that looked a little like Rose. First time out of the house, it's bound to happen. This city is lousy with tall pale redheads. What? Nothing. I didn't mention it because it doesn't change anything. She's not coming back here. - She got what she wanted. - Okay, now you're scaring me. - Yeah, what's going on? - There's a possibility that Rose has had plastic surgery. A lot of it. So she could look like anyone, really. I told you the two-on-one got dramatic. _ How was it? Just Rose-y  Just awkward. Did Mateo melt down? Rafael and Michael did. _ - Team Michael. - _ Print the T-shirts, make the mugs _ There are no teams in this family. _ _ _ _ _ _ Abuela! _ _ Mami! Did you ever talk to the neighbors about their band practice? _ I wanted to throw a rock through the window. _ Thank you. Ooh, okay. She's back. You're on a deserted island with nothing but a blanket, a packed lunch and a gazebo. There's only one guy there. Who is it? I have no idea. I just took a shower. Okay, different scenario. You're hiking on a fjord. Who do you take into the ice hotel? Trust falls with - Michael. - Bali with - Rafael. - Rappel down a building with Neither. Oh, my God, the neighbors. _ I'll go over there and talk to them with Mateo, right? Nobody can resist Mr. Sweetface. Except, apparently, 20-something wannabe rock stars. It's a lady with a kid. Jane, actually. Hi. And this is Mateo. Yes, hi. So anyway, listen, um, so excited to have you guys in the neighborhood. Love your sound. I was just wondering if maybe you could not start practice at 10:00 p.m. Noise ordinance says we can play till 11:00. That's why my dad rented for us here. - Oh. - Yeah. Okay. Yeah, no, I get it. You know, uh but it's just it's something about the acoustics, it sounds like you're right inside my house. So weird, that's what it sounds like for us at 6:00 in the morning when that starts howling. Excuse me? Noise-canceling headphones help. Entitled breeders. Are you kidding me? - We have to outbid the Carton Group. - 12 million? When we have no idea what they're bidding? Uh, quick clarification. This is the bid for the charity auction? No, this is the bid for the neighboring property. Oh, my that makes more sense. I was like, ""Who wants to go to a Marlins game so bad?"" Ah, yes. Luisa. She decided to learn the family business, get her life back on track. And why do we want that property again? Because if somebody else buys the land, then they can block our views. Right. Okay. Oy  is all I have to say to that. Oh, by the way, um, I was thinking about promoting Scott, just giving him a shot at managing the lounge. Scott, my assistant? Executive assistant. Why? I see something in him. He's smart, knows a lot About your sperm. and, uh, he's getting other offers. I don't want to lose him. Okay, just send me his rÃ©sumÃ©. Great. _ Wait, who is that? I-I've seen him before. Oh, no. Oh, good. My noise-canceling headphones. Just sign here. Great. Now give me your baby. - Hey. - Hi. You seemed a little freaked out after the whole Rose thing, so I thought maybe a security system would help. Thank you. Are there lasers and stuff? Um no lasers. But there are a few menacing stickers for your window. Is this a good time to install it? Yeah, of course I was just gonna feed Mateo. Oh, yeah, do your thing. All right. _ _ Michael. Michael. Uh-huh. I heard a noise outside. I saw a shadow like a bear. - A bear. - Mm-hmm. - Oh, my God. - What?! It's a guy walking to his car. But I'll sleep better knowing you're on guard with the giraffe. Four more hours. You can do this. Mm-hmm. Go to sleep. I can't sleep. I'm worried there could be a deal breaker. What? Because you're a cop. And you're a criminal mastermind? My grandmother is undocumented. That's why she's quiet around you. Police make her nervous, and I'm just worried it's a problem ethically. Is she a criminal mastermind? Then no. Still no deal breakers. Blah, blah, blah. History, memory, he's been there, I get it. But how does he fit into your life now, with Mr. Sweetface? I mean, that's what you have to figure out. Never was there sounder advice  from a tipsy hallucination. Okay, you have to support his head. Okay, I know, I've been around babies. You have? Yeah, the summer before my parents got divorced. Oh, hello. Hi, Mateo. Wait, that time you were with your aunt and uncle fly-fishing? Well, I was partly there for the fly-fishing and partly to take care of their new baby. You didn't tell me that. Well, fly-fishing seemed cooler than babysitting. And we didn't really do a whole lot of baby talk before, you know? No, we didn't. Maybe we should. But, I mean, like, are you ready? Because you weren't when I was pregnant. Okay, come on, I It was pretty shocking. We were engaged, it wasn't mine. I know. But it's not some theoretical baby anymore. It's Mateo. So, yeah I'm in. I'm in. Can I come in? Hey. Uh, don't tell me, don't tell me. Rick. Lachlan. - We've met several times. - Sorry. Might have been drunk, but I'm not drunk now, so you are locked in, Mr. Lachlan. What do you want? Now, Luisa may not remember Lachlan, but I sure do. Let's take a quick trip down memory lane, shall we? You see, first Rafael stole Petra from Lachlan, then Lachlan tried to screw over Rafael, but instead Petra and Rafael screwed over Lachlan, then Lachlan and Petra just plain screwed, then Lachlan screwed over Petra, and then Petra and Rafael screwed over Lachlan. There, now you're all caught up. I know about the neighboring property, and that it's a short sale, and you don't have time for a geological report. But I have a friend on the inside. Why should we trust you? You shouldn't. In exchange, I want out of my contract and a $500,000 bonus. You are all set. Thank you so much. No worries. Uh It snowed on them once before, you'll recall. _ You should probably go. Okay. Oh, my God, it's over. Give him the rose. He's so sweet and sexy and handy and here for the right reasons, and why are you just standing there? Because I haven't had my one-on-one with Rafael yet. What am I saying? No, you're right. We can't get ahead of ourselves. Oh, but he's everything. He's the one, right? - That one? I'm not wearing that one. - _ Sorry, I missed what you said. I said you're wearing the sailor suit. Where would we perform? You're looking at it. So you would remove the buffet when we perform? No, you perform during the buffet. It's dinner theater They eat, you sing. - I cannot believe what I'm hearing. - Rogelio, calm down. I will not calm down, Xiomara, because nobody eats when Rogelio de la Vega sings. They open their mouth in awe. They scream, they cheer. But nobody eats. I have heard enough. I refuse to spend one more minute on this ship. - No - Oh, my God I can't believe it Who accidentally goes to Cuba? Rogelio thought the lawyer said the meeting was on the ship at 2:00. Turns out, we had to be off the ship before 2:00. Ugh.  This is your neighborhood lullaby  - Oh, my God. - Is that ? Ugh  This is the part that's gonna make you cry  It's okay, it's okay. They just pointed a big red amp right at my window. - What?! - Yeah. First, you go over there and you _ So they will not turn around the ship, unless there's an emergency. And apparently, being on the ship does not constitute as an emergency. Oh, my God, enough. Stop being such a baby. Singing on a cruise ship may be beneath you, but, frankly, it is a cool opportunity for me, and you are ruining it. - Uh-oh. - I mean, Lachlan's numbers make sense. If this came from anyone else, I'd be thrilled, but _ Need to make a call? No, I can do it after, because, obviously, I'm in a meeting. Sorry. Uh, please continue. Well, just the idea of betting our future on Lachlan I know, it's _ _ What's going on? - Nothing. - Nothing. Please, Petra, uh, continue. _ Pregnant? Are you serious? Luisa was her gynecologist. Not a great gynecologist, granted. But, still, all the signs are there. She's stopped eating soft cheeses. She's not drinking alcohol. She's doing her acupuncture thing again. Oh, my God. If she is, this could be the answer to our prayers. I mean, she'll focus on the baby, not you. Oh, my God, who do you think the father is? No idea, but I feel sorry for that poor sucker. Yeah, me, too. Oh, grab it? Enough with the small talk, Jane. Focus! So, eh, seeing that my mom's away and she's my night nurse, I thought Mateo and I can spend the night at your place. Perfecto. An overnight! Really? Just the three of us? Jane? Sorry, yes. Yes! Can you pick up Mateo real quick? - Sure. - Yeah. Ooh, I think she's getting a rose. No. An amp. Whoa. The neighbors don't respond to nice. So, should I bring something tonight? Uh nothing, no. I-I'll take care of everything. What's happening? Which brings us here, now to the  Fantasy suite?! Ah, I bet he goes all out. Like, a room full of roses and champagne fountains and candles everywhere and Oh, my God. Even better. You got the swing. Oh, and the Tummy Time mat. And here is a changing station. There's one in the nursery, of course. Just to make it easier. Oh, and this is a glider with a coffee table for your water, because I know that nursing makes you thirsty. Oh! Oh, I ordered some food. So I'll just be right back. Sit down, please. Oh, oh, my God! I'm freaking out a little. Plus, I drank too much, but we have to stay focused on why we're here. What does he want really? How does he see his life? What's an ordinary Thursday? Oh, Mateo! Oh, it's okay. Fine, I was a baby. I get it. You're too good for this. That's not why. As I near 40, part of myself worries that I could one day find myself here permanently. Like my over-the-hill friend Charo, for whom I would walk over hot coals.  Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown   I set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb   I was soft inside   There was something going on   Islands in the stream that is what we are  Can these two harmonize or what? Sadly, no one was paying any attention. Until they unveiled the chocolate fountain.  And we rely on each other, uh-huh   Islands in the stream   That is what we are   No one in-between   How could we be wrong?  Sail away with me to another world   And we rely on each other, uh-huh   From one lover to another, uh-huh   From one lover to another, uh-huh   Uh-huh   From one lover to  Yeah, I'm hungry, but we can't stop for more than a couple minutes in the first half an hour or he'll wake up. - Fast food okay? - Yeah, I love fast food. I'm not talking about sushi from the supermarket. I would never eat sushi from a supermarket. So, uh, in my previous life when I used to go to clubs, we would always end the night at 2:00 a.m. in a fast food drive thru. What was your go-to? Well, that depends on what kind of fries you're after. The Snack Stand Always solid. But if you want curly fries, you got to go to Ocean Side Burgers, unless you prefer your curly fries spicy, and then it's Speedy's. Now, for waffle fries, I recommend Big Ronnie's or Burger Bonanza if you're craving tater tots, which I don't even really consider fries. Spicy waffle. Game on. I agree Objectively he is in the top five percent of cuteness. I know, and then when you add in his personality, it's like, come on, forget about it. - You think he has a personality? - Absolutely! - Besides fussy? - Whoa, he's not fussy. He's opinionated. He is hear me out. And he's not afraid to use his voice to demand change. I'll bet you in the baby community, he would be a real leader. I'm just saying. So, what do you want in life? I just mean going to clubs until 2:00 a.m . Do you miss that? I miss the fries. No, come on, seriously. Seriously? You want to know what I want? I want this to just be a regular Thursday, instead of the first time all week that I have been truly happy. I love you, Jane. I never stopped loving you. I'm sorry. I'm just not ready yet. O-M-G. What are you doing? Just give him the rose and marry him! And have sex with him forever and ever! Hey, can you get that? I think it's breakfast. I'm on it. Ah, yes. - Good morning. - Morning. Right here is great. Thank you. Hey. We thought that we would let you sleep in for once. No raging neighbors. Oh. Thank you, God! Oh, it feels so good to be back here. And by here, I don't mean this closet off the engine room. I mean, here, naked in bed with you. Yeah, I got that. Where did we go wrong? Well, you kissed someone else. I know, and-and that was an idiotic thing to do, but don't you think you overreacted a little? I tend to react very emotionally. It's both my greatest strength And your greatest weakness. And what makes me such a compelling actor. See, I was thinking you overreacted because of your ex-wife Please don't say her name. _ Okay. Well, she cheated on you multiple times publically. I need to relive it, Xiomara. But I didn't do that. We're very different people. That's true. She would've definitely told me about the chocolate fountain. I didn't think you saw. I amazing peripheral vision. And you're right. You're very different people. And I screwed up. But I won't again. Because I love you. And I love you. So maybe we shouldn't get that annulment after all. Also reconsidering a contract  Oh, Alice, thank you so much for your help. My pleasure, Mr. Solano. I could talk about coastal erosion all day. All right, bye-bye. We are not bidding. What? Lachlan altered the geological report. I just sweet-talked the secretary to fax over the original. The property is in an erosion zone. Yes, that's what Scott just told me. - But how's that possible? - What? Um, have you, uh, had a chance to glance at his rÃ©sumÃ© yet? Uh yeah, I did. Mm. So, he really went to Harvard? Um yeah. Mm-hmm. He doesn't like to brag about it a lot. But, yeah, he's a he's a Harvard man. And suddenly, it hit him. I just see something in him. I don't want to lose him. Who do you think the father is? No idea, but I feel sorry for that poor sucker. And just like that, Rafael realized  _ Yes. Let's give him that promotion. Speaking of worst nightmares! What's going on? _ This amp was reported stolen. Oh, no. _ Go to your room and find your I.D. This is my fault. I'm sorry, Officers. I took the amp. Well, my neighbors are very rude. And they pointed that thing right at my window on purpose. I-I Which doesn't matter, I know. And I'm gonna return it right away. And I'm very, very sorry. Well, just try to work it out between you. And your grandma needs to sort out her paperwork, so next time there's a dispute, she'll be able to find it. Yes, sir. Thank you, we understand. Oh I'm so sorry. They're gone, it's fine, there's no problem. I know, Abuela, I know. Again I'm so sorry. I mean, if there's anything I can do To make us not press charges? We missed our gig 'cause we didn't have our amp. Well what if I can get you a better gig? _ I'm just so confused. I mean, when I was with Michael, I can see myself with him. But then when I was with Rafael - What are you doing? - A confessional. So I can work out my feelings. I mean, we have to decide who to give the final rose to and who to say good-bye to. Jane! Oh, shoot. Jane, what's going on?! It's me! Hello! W-Wait, how-how do you turn this thing off? I'm coming! _ How do I turn this off? Rafael set off the alarm. Giraffe. I know what my name is. - No, it's ""giraffe."" - What's the password? The password is ""giraffe."" - Hey, is everything okay? - Oh, you've got to be kidding me. - I was nearby. - Really? Is that what you do all day? You just drive around Jane's house? Is that your beat? I got an alert on my phone saying that the alarm went off, - okay? - Well, if we need a security guard, then we'll hire one. - Rafael, stop, he just came to help. - And how is he helping? He's the reason you need a security system in the first place; even Rose knew he was obsessed with you. That's why she took Mateo. Tell him to move on. Just tell him how you feel, Jane. Don't, Jane. Don't say it. Don't, really, don't! I'm in love with both of you. - _ - How did I feel? You ever been punched in the gut? And then in the face? - _ - How do you think I felt? Like my family was kidnapped again. Don't ask me that, jackass. Oh I blame you. I mean, I was feeling good in my nice little bubble. Hey, I just wanted you to shower. I didn't say to tell them you love them both. Well, what am I gonna do? I got to figure this out. And you will. Just don't rush. _ Hey, Ma, how did you sleep? Jane told me what happened. I'm so sorry, again. No, no, no, no. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ What do you mean? _ Ma. What? I thought you were scared they could say no, and you'd get deported. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Wow. If I knew this was gonna happen, I would have stole that amp years ago. - Oh. - Mami  Hey. Hey I just wanted to call because of what Rafael said, um, about Mateo's kidnapping being my fault. - Look, he was mad. - No, he was right. I am why she took him. She knew I'd do anything to get him back. Stop, uh, by that logic, it's my fault too. I mean, I'm the reason Rose knew how you felt about me. _ Do you know anything about wine? _ Because I know dry, and this isn't dry, it's corked. Actually, it's not corked, it's complex. Who are you? My husband owns the hotel. See, I've felt the grapes myself at this particular vineyard in Switzerland, and their unique texture gives the wine its flavor. But if it's too advanced for your palette, I'd be happy to bring you a bottle of Chardonnay. - Side of ice, perhaps? - Um, no. Th-This will be fine. Oh. Thank you for that. Oh, my pleasure. - It's Jane, right? - Mm-hmm. We haven't officially met. I'm Rose. You know Detective Cordero? I told her all about us. Our relationship. She seemed so concerned. She just kept asking so many questions. Jane, would you recognize the wine bottle? A little wine for Mrs. de la Vega? Trust me, you're going to want to take my name. You won't believe how much better you will be treated due to my fame. So, uh, here's the thing. I think we should go through with the annulment. What? But but I love you. And I love you. But I'm also trying to do things differently, now that I'm a grandma and all. So I don't want to ignore the alarm bell. - What alarm bell? - Luciana. Please don't say that name. Rogelio, you can't even say her name. You clearly have some unresolved issues there, and I think they go deeper than I realized. So instead of getting married, let's go on a date and talk about it? Well, I've heard wonderful things about the ice cream in Havana. Perhaps I can buy you a cone? Or use my fame to get you one for free? I'd really like that. Yes? Yes, I'm positive. Wow. So it really is Swiss. I've been through Rose's passport a dozen times. She's never even been to Switzerland. But you said she felt those grapes herself. So she has been there. But not as Rose Solano. As whoever she was before. Finally, we have a place to start looking. Wait, I've seen that mountain range before. _ Uh-oh, that can't be good. Also not good remember that geological report? It was forged. And Luisa is about to realize that in three, two, one  Oh, my God. Rick! She just had to find Rafael or Petra to tell  Oh, no! She was about to tell Petra about Rick. I'm sorry, I mean Lachlan. I'm sorry to make you think about Rose again. No, I hate uncertainty. I actually feel better knowing we're doing something. Yeah, I get that. - So I should go. - So I wanted to I just wanted to apologize for what happened with Rafael. Oh, yeah, I'm not I'm not worried about it. Let me ask you something. Who knows you better, me or Rafael? You do. So I know you're not really in love with him. You're just in love with the idea of family. You'll figure that out. And hopefully I'll still be around. Maybe she was just in love with the idea of family. But it was a very strong pull. Gun to your head, who do you choose? Let's go think about it outside, during sunset. Ooh, I love sunsets. Let me back in! We haven't given the final rose! You can't quit now! You're in a good mood. Yep. Because I just won the property bid. What are you talking about? We didn't submit. Right, but my new employers did. Because there is no erosion zone. No, Rafael called the planning commission. No, he called the number I provided. Oh, Alice, thank you so much for your help. My pleasure, Mr. Solano. I could talk about coastal erosion all day. That was perfect, Janet. It should be noted, this was precisely the moment Petra started to feel sick. I knew you wouldn't trust me. And now my new employers got the property for cheap, I got a half-million-dollar bonus, and we are going to build a high rise that kills your ocean views. She'd been played! Rafael had been played! But how could she focus on that, when she had a stick to pee on? Scott? Remember? Harvard's managing the lounge now. Hello. Hello, Mr. Solano, this is Diane calling from the Miami-Dade Memorial Fertility Clinic. What? Why? I just wanted to confirm your address since you'll be receiving a $127 rebate. Oh, uh, okay. For what? Well, according to our records, you've continued to pay the monthly storage fee. That's no longer necessary since Mrs. Solano took your final sample. Wait, wait she she what? Your wife, Petra Solano. She came by our office two weeks ago to retrieve the sample we found. You know what? This is too good. I got to see it again, instant-replay style in slo-mo. Note the lip snarl of panic and rage, the raised eyebrows, the bulging eyes. Yes, Rafael, you are the poor sucker. Which reminds me the results are in. Oh, baby."
"Good, you're here. Let's get you caught up. Jane Gloriana Villanueva was accidentally inseminated with Rafael's sperm. So, yeah, that kind of changed her life. But she still wanted to pursue her dream of becoming a writer, so she applied to grad school. Oh, and our Jane was also caught in quite the love triangle between Rafael and Michael. And let's not forget where we left Jane's parents. They'd accidentally gone to Cuba. And on the way, Xo realized what was standing in their way. You clearly have some unresolved issues - because of your ex-wife. - Oh, and speaking of crazy exes, Rafael's ex-wife Petra got her hands on Rafael's last sperm sample, secured a turkey baster, and guess what? Which Rafael just found out about. I know, oh, boy! Or girl! Oh, and remember our crime lord Sin Rostro, aka Rose? Well, Jane and Michael found a vineyard in Switzerland Rose visited before she changed her identity, so the noose is tightening there. Finally, we have a place to start looking. Oh, and remember this woman? She sent her henchman to the Marbella and he kidnapped Rafael's sister Louisa! I know, cray-cray! So let's see what happens next. Even as a young woman, - _ - Alba Gloriana Villanueva cherished tradition. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Oh, the heart of it. _ _ _ _ _ I don't want to do this. _ _ I don't think I even believe in God. _ _ _ Whatever. What is this? _ _ Oh. _ Are these from my baptism? And mine, too. _ Another cherished tradition of Alba's? Staying on task where church events were concerned. _ Lina confirmed and she said that she would wear something church-appropriate. But that probably means the black dress from Madonna's ""Like a Prayer"" video. Great. And did you talk to Rafael? Lina confirmed, did you get that, Abuela? - Mm-hmm. - Jane, did you talk to him? Why? He's the one that asked Michael. Thank you for bringing back my son. I want you to be his godfather. Yeah, that was before you told them both you loved them. I know, you're right, I'll call. And he'll say he's uncomfortable and I'll say I understand and we'll pick someone else. So? I can't imagine Mateo's godfather being anyone but Michael. Oh, the heart of it. _ _ - Okay, okay. - Which brings us to a time-honored telenovela tradition. This is a waste of time, Rafael. I took three home pregnancy tests. The ill-timed phone call. But you also stole my sperm and turkey-basted yourself, so you could see why I'd have trouble trusting you. I want to talk to my doctor, face to face. Uh, hey, Jane. - I'm sorry, can I call you - Uh, I just wanted to go over some of the baptism details. - But I'm also just - Shh. - Is this a bad time? - Shush me, - you dragged me here. - No, no, not you. Just, um I-I just wanted to talk about Mateo's godparents. I know you - asked Michael in the heat - Dr. Peters is here with the result, I assume, so - of the moment, but I wanted to check and see if - please hang up the phone! That's still something you're comfortable with. Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's all good. Petra is definitely pregnant. Well, Michael's the godfather. Rafael's totally fine with it. _ What were you thinking? Look, when I got a call about your sample, I went to return it, but then I ran into Luisa well, that you did - love me. - She said what? To be fair, Luisa didn't know Petra had the sperm. So I just did it. And I planned to seduce you, and then say it miraculously happened. Obviously, the fertility clinic wasn't supposed to call with a billing issue. I mean, they're, like, the worst clinic. - Petra. - What? I'm sorry. This is awkward, okay? I was playing you. Luisa was covering for me. I was trying to get on your good side so that I could buy you out. I wanted you out of my life so that I could move forward with Jane. I know it might seem like just a little blink, but it's the first step of your relationship. _ Are any babies blinking back? Tanner is. Yes! Good boy! Not just yet. And this brings us to an important tradition Jane hoped to establish for Mateo: overachieving. Or, at the very least, achieving. Make sure to explain to Mateo what you're doing, Jane. Mommy's trying to get you to blink, because all your friends are doing it. But also, say no to peer pressure. I know it can seem a little silly. But that's how language develops. Narrate everything. I've got a job to do. We are on it, right?  Good-bye, Tanner   Good-bye, Lily   Good-bye, Mateo  Good-bye, Dina. I'll see you shortly. I'm gonna have to conclude the Cuba slideshow early. _ I know, but there's a casting crisis because ""Make Love Week"" is coming up. _ It's my duty to handle these things, now that I am an Executive Producer or E.P. This isn't going to be one of those vanity credits. I'm ready to roll up my sleeves, so people can enjoy my strong forearms, and really produce. Feel free to finish without my nuanced insights into the local culture. I'll get the curtains. _ - Hey, man. - Hey! Wait, are you here to see me or Jane? - Uh, both. - Oh. Just saw you. Now, uh, I have to Look, I got to apologize to her. I drew a really hard line the last time we talked, and I just feel like I could've been more thoughtful Stop! Come here. You have to keep playing it cool. She likes it. What? I overheard her talking to her mom last night. And then Michael took this confident stand. It was actually pretty sexy. - She thought it was sexy? - Yes. Let me drop some Rogeli-knowledge on you. Pay attention. The next time you have wussy thoughts, don't say them to Jane. Write them down instead. Uh, wait. Let me just tear my E.P. notes. I'm an E.P. now maybe you heard? It's like being chief of police, but with higher stakes. _ Trust me. You want to protect and enhance your masculine image. Have you even considered a spray tan? And now we're walking to the front door. And we're seeing Michael? Hey, what are you doing here? Yes, what are you doing here, Michael? I-I'm Manly. Just here to update you on the Sin Rostro investigation. I talked to the owner of the vineyard we thought Rose visited in Switzerland. Had he heard of her? No, but he's gonna send us a copy of the visitor logs. If we compare them to samples of Rose's handwriting, maybe we can figure out what name she was using back then. - I'll walk you out. - Oh, okay, uh, I'll see you at the baptism rehearsal later? - Yeah. - If his busy crime-fighting schedule permits. - I'll-I'll-I'll be there. - Let's go, let's go! And now I'm shutting the door. And I'm thinking that was weird. And I'm taking you out of your seatbelt. Wow, she's pretty good at narration. Now we are going to check the mail. Ooh, junk. Oh, wow, Mateo. Look, Mommy got a letter from grad school. And now I'm opening it. Seeing it's from Professor Blake. And now I'm reading. ""We're delighted to inform you that you've been accepted into our graduate writing program."" And now we're dancing. Because Mommy got into grad school. Get it, get it, work, work. I mean it'll be hard, but I think I can pull it off. Mateo will be three months by the time class starts. I would've gone to work anyway. Hey, are you okay? How do you find the words to say that your psychotic ex-wife inseminated herself with your stolen sperm? Yeah! Yeah, totally. And I'm excited for you, sorry. No, it's okay. I mean, I've been Hey, so is your sister coming to the baptism or ? She didn't RSVP. Uh, nope, I have not heard from her. Maybe because she was kidnapped! Whoever you are, My brother probably has a SWAT team ready to bust in any minute! Wait, why is Michael here? He's the godfather. You asked him when he got Mateo back. if you were still okay with it. Any of this ring a bell? I'm sorry, to be honest, I wasn't listening to that call. But fine, whatever, Michael's the godfather. It's-it's great. Okay, stop, wait what's going on? Look, now's not the right time. Now you're freaking me out. Just tell me. - Let's just talk about it later. - Please! It can't be as bad as what as what I'm coming up with in my head right now. Turns out I had one sperm sample left. Petra stole it, inseminated herself. And now she's pregnant with my baby. What the ? As the Bible says: ""The Lord is a stronghold in times of trouble."" Let's hope so. All right, so your family members will be seated over here. Hola, Jane. What are we doing for Christmas this year? Godparents, you'll be standing over I just can't. I mean, why would she do that? Remember how we set her up to make her think I still had feelings for her? And I think that she'd do anything, even turn in her own mother, if she thought she had a chance with you. Yeah, well, apparently it worked. Oh, God. - Hey. Hey. - Huh? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Jane. Wuss alert. Wuss alert. Take care. Uh-huh. Cool diary. Oh. It's not a diary. Then can I read it? Yes. Confirmed by his doctor. - No. - Yes. _ Turkey baster. - No! - Yes. Thanksgiving will never be the same. Oh. Shh, shh. Grad school. Hello? Yes, this is Jane. Hi, Sheila. Yes, I'm very excited. Thank you. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay, well, thank you for letting me know. Yes, I will let you know. Okay. Bye. - What happened, hon? - The writing program has all these weird prerequisites, and apparently, I'm missing world lit. _ And they offer it at a summer school intensive, but I'd have to start tomorrow. - So? - Mom, Mateo's three weeks old. - I can't leave already. - Hon, do you remember what you said when you were pregnant? We need some kind of signal. that I'm about to let motherhood hijack my goals. You're about to let motherhood hijack your goals. There's got to be a way to make it work. No, you're wrong. Let's not recast. _ I'll work around Blanca's issues. You're not hearing me. Blanca can't even walk. It was a horrible boating accident. It's okay. It's Make Love Week. We're gonna be in the bed anyway. Rogelio, she broke her pelvis. But And her jaw is wired shut. We must recast. But it's Make Love Week. Fans will want to see someone spectacular in bed with me. Salma, Penelope, J. Lo. Rogelio, be realistic. You're right younger. Selena, Demi, Emma Stone. I heard she can play any race. - Stop, you know who it should be. - No, I don't. Her agent said she's willing to screen test. - I-I don't know what you mean. - You do. - I really don't. - You really do. You will never guess who Dina wants to screen test. Your ex, Luciana. Don't even say her name. And how did you know? Just a hunch. Based on your overall rage level. Do you think it's the right move for the show? You know, as an E.P.? Well, obviously, the fans and the press will go nuts. And it'll be great for ratings. Okay, so then maybe it's a blessing in disguise. I mean, we haven't made much progress on your baggage with I said don't say it. You can't even stand to hear her name. Maybe it's time to rip off the Band-Aid. And it could help with us too, you know, moving forward. Well, maybe you're right. Maybe it's time to clean out the storage locker. Is that a figure of speech? _ Knock, knock. - Professor Blake. - Jane. Hi. How are you? I'm good. I'm really good. Uh, so excited to start the grad program. Oh, and this is Mateo. You remember, he was in here, and now he's out there. I-I remember. - Congratulations. - Thank you. So I was wondering. Because Mateo's so little and so incredibly quiet, I was hoping I can bring him along with me to my summer class. I-I just See, I wasn't anticipating leaving him so soon. I wouldn't want it to be distracting for the other students. Me neither, a-and it won't be, because he's just a little sleeping blob. He doesn't even blink yet. I just really want to make this work, please. Tell you what, let's give it a try. Thank you. Thank you, and I promise nobody will even know that he's there. Is there anybody there?! Hello? Who are you? What do you want? And what are you doing? Please, just talk to me. I'd tell you what's going on, but I'm a little confused myself. Wait, no English? What what is that? That's German. No problem. I went to Munich for Oktoberfest. Listen..en _ _ Wh-What? Mutter? Murder? You want to murder me? No. Please. No. _ _ This ""pitiable bloody-handed fiend of vengeance"" represents the power of a woman scorned. Creon called her ""a clever woman, skilled in many evil arts"" She tricked King Peleus's daughters into murdering their own father. Shh. Shh. Oh, oh, uh, sorry, not you, him. Just gonna get the pacifier. Working on the pacifier right now. Oh. I got him, so that's the good part. - Hi, there. - I heard what happened. Uh, from my office. It was really loud. I'm so sorry. I mean, he's just having an off day. Sure, now you're perfect. And I probably shouldn't have taken off the brakes from the stroller. Lesson learned. Look, Jane, bringing him to class isn't going to work. I know. And if you're not ready to leave him, it's certainly understandable. You can always reapply next year. Mmm. But please let me know. There are other students who would love to take your spot. Something's wrong with this woman. I mean it. I think she could be a hoarder. - _ - Oh, she is. Her episode of Celebrity Hoarders was epic. Wow. What's that? Your diary? It's not a diary. Then let me read it. Oh, no, it-it's full of feelings I was too vulnerable to share, so I wrote them down instead. Yeah, that's a diary. Why don't you read it to me? It'll be cathartic. It's too embarrassing. Come on, I won't judge. I might. ""When you left me, I felt like a tiny kitten without his fur."" _ ""I often feel like a sweet peach you took one bite off and then carelessly tossed aside to rot in a compost pile of tears."" - _ - ""You crushed my heart ""like a walnut.. In a walnut-crushing machine."" - _ - Wow. I know. I always had a way with words. Maybe that's where Jane gets it. And Luciana pretty much destroyed you. Well, that too. But that was eight years ago. I mean, you're a different person. You're not nearly as insecure. Really? I promise. She has no power over you anymore. Thank you, Xiomara. So maybe for the good of the show, I can screen test L Luciana. You said her name. I'm letting go. I'm gonna burn this. Although, perhaps we should preserve it. Because of the quality of the writing. Burn the diary. What are you doing here? I'm just, uh, picking up Rose's handwriting samples to match to the visitor log from the vineyard. How are you? I took Mateo to class with me, and it was a total disaster. So I'm either gonna have to give up grad school for now or leave my baby behind at three weeks old. Macho. Manly. Suave. That's tricky. I'm sure you'll figure it out. Yeah, I'm sure I will too. Well, I guess I should go. So seems I miscalculated. I thought a romance was developing between Rafael and I. Turns out, he was manipulating me. So you inseminated yourself. Like I said, miscalculated. Now, we can keep rehashing the past, or we can move forward. You know, I don't even know what I'm doing here. I'm carrying Mateo's half brother. Or sister. Moving forward then. Now, the way I see it, there are three options. One, I get an abortion. Two, in the next month or so, I find someone. Let's say, a Russian oligarch. I, uh, sleep with him, tell him the baby's his, we settle in Russia, and you both get to say good-bye to me forever. Or three, I stay here in Miami, and we raise him or her together, with you 100% involved. What are you talking about? I'm not interested in being a single mother. No, I had one that was hard. Yeah, that's because your mom is evil, not single. Okay, see, that's the kind of language I don't want around my baby, Jane, and if you two are going to be co-parenting my child half the time, - then I - Us two? Yes, aren't you? - No, we're not. - Petra Oh, well, I just Never mind. My mistake. It was not, in fact, a mistake. I wanted you out of my life so that I could move forward with Jane. Which meant, of course, he wasn't with Jane. Which meant, of course, there was an opening. Well, you may or may not be together. Regardless, you, Rafael, need to be there every step of the way. It's a lot, I understand. So you two talk it over. Just remember there is a clock on options one and two, so, as soon as you can, let me know what you're leaning toward, because this is in your hands. I, uh Yeah. I mean, there's no good option. No, there is not. Well, what do you think? Hmm? Of the three? _ Oh, you can't ask me that. - Just in general. - No, no, no. That's your call! Because you don't want to be with me? I didn't say that. So it would impact you. Please. Mateo's only three weeks old! I just I'm just not there yet. And so, I told him he would have to make the decision without me. Well, I'll weigh in. I think she should have an abortion. Xiomara! What's the alternative? We welcome her to the family? Have her over for Thanksgiving? _ Used my own turkey baster. Enjoy! I think Yvgeny bit Mateo again. Oh, please, it was just a little nibble. _ Exactly. _ And then what, she doesn't tell Mateo he has a sibling until one day he finds out? Who can I make this out to? How about your son? How could you not tell me about Yvgeny? She's a liar! My mom's a liar! I'm moving to Vladivostok! Okay, stop! It's out of my hands. You know what? I have enough to worry about with this whole school decision. - Come on, you're going back. - Mom, he's so little. Lots of people have to leave this early But that's just it I don't have to. It's an option. Right, and an option you're lucky to have. Right, Ma? _ _ No, not a psychopath. Rose appears to be a sociopath. _ _ Frequent use of the past tense, disfluencies, lack of emotion textbook. Mm-hmm, and as for matching the handwriting to a name in the visitor log? Well, it's difficult, due to the ink degradation and wine stains. But my best guess would be this name. Denise. Denise, Denise what? I can't say. Her last name appears to be obscured by what looks like Pinot Noir. Maybe a Malbec. _ _ Okay, well, thank you, thank you. Michael! Meet my complexion consultant, Anton. Anton is a wizard with the bronzing wand. Okay, what-what exactly is the emergency here? You are too pale for the baptism photos. I'm a police officer! An emergency means someone is dead! Well, you look like a corpse close enough. Yeah, I'm not getting a spray tan. How's Plan Macho-Macho Man going, anyway? Oh, honestly, it's harder than I thought. There's a lot I want to say to her. I mean, she's got so much on her plate. Yeah, like the whole Petra disaster. What Petra disaster? - Lift the cheeks, please. - Petra disaster? Rogelio, what Pet ? Oh, my God. It is ""Make Love Week."" I cannot have any tan lines. Anyway, Petra got herself pregnant with Rafael's sperm. I'd be more shocked, but we did that story on Santos. Classic stuff. Jane must be devastated. Write it down, bro, write it down. Oh, my God Now you have to do it. Half of your face is already tan. _ So, mommies, as we wrap up, is there anything you'd like to share? Where you're at, where baby's at? I do, actually, have something to share. I'm starting school tomorrow. I'm sorry. I just wasn't expecting to separate so quickly. Why? If you don't mind me asking. Oh, well I got accepted And so she told them. The writing program. The world lit class. I won't put you through it twice. The point is she opened up. And my mom thinks it's a no-brainer that I should go back to school. But how do you leave Mateo? Exactly! God, my heart would crack open. No, mine is! But wait, it's her passion. I mean, do you want to go to grad school Mateo's mom? Jane, and yes. No one said she didn't want to go. But she just broke into tears. I want to work. Does that make me terrible? Mommies, stop. There's no right choice, because we're all different. The only thing that's important is that you honor whatever choice is right for you. Oh, my. Did you ? Do that again! Oh, my, you did! He blinked! You blinked! You blinked! Yes! Oh, my God, we have a blinker, ladies and gentlemen! Yes! Oh, you blinked. Oh You're doing the right thing. Remember, she can't hurt you anymore. This is the last part of letting go. Thank you, Xiomara. _ Hello, Lu Luciana. Rogelio. You look as incredible as I remember. You don't age. I never have. Let's work. I assume you've read the lines? This is when Blanca reunites with Santos after an agonizing separation. Let's roll! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Relax. It is called The Passions of Sant Oh, wow. Cut! Let it be noted, forever, and always, that on the day of Mateo Gloriano Rogelio Solano Villanueva's baptism, his mother and grandmother and great-grandmother put their troubles aside _ _ _ to focus on him. Ah, okay. He's got his gown on. You got the candle. The house looks great. Are we ready? - One more thing, Janie. - Uh-huh? Abuela wrote this to read at my baptism. I read it at yours. And I want you to read it at Mateo's. Oh It is with great joy that this family, brought together by unconventional circumstances, welcomes this precious life for baptism. Jane and Rafael, what name do you give your son? - Mateo. - Mateo. Michael and Lina, as godparents, do you promise to support these parents in raising this child, showering him with wisdom and affection? - We do. - We do. Mateo, with this holy water an ancient symbol of purity I baptize you in the name of the Father, - Oh. - And of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. I am going to read something that my mother read to me when I was baptized. This is something that my mother read to me when I was baptized. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ""May you be brave. ""May you be loving ""and joyful and kind. _ _ ""Whatever you dream for your life, ""may you summon the strength to follow that dream. ""May you always let your faith be greater than your fear. _ _ ""Through every moment of every day. ""That I walk beside you, ""cheering you on. ""Hoping for you, praying for you. ""Loving you. ""And may you one day ""love your own child as deeply ""as I love you, today and always."" I love you, Mateo. _ That was so beautiful, Abuela. Maybe you get it from her, Janie. The whole writing thing. _ _ _ _ Exactly. Going to grad school, pursuing your dreams. Um, I actually called and turned down grad school yesterday. _ Because Mateo blinked back. And I would've missed that. Janie, Mateo blinked two days ago! He did? I didn't tell you, because, well, it seemed so important for you to see it first. But, Janie, you're gonna miss things. I missed your first steps. You did? _ _ _ Do you think either of us is any less of a mother? I know, but it's not just that. I mean, I burst into tears at the mommy class just at the thought of leaving. That's because you're an emotional person. And you're three weeks postpartum. Do you remember how excited you were when you told us? We got into grad school! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We got into grad school! Mateo will be fine. I promise. - We've got him. - Mm-hmm. I got to make a call. Luisa, it's me. I'm, uh, bummed you missed the baptism. Hope you're still on the wagon. Wow, she got her ties off. These Germans are the worst kidnappers. Oh, no, somebody help me! Hmm, that was rather gentle for a kidnapper. You're not allowed to hurt me, are you? You can't ""mutter"" me. In that moment, Luisa realized he had to be working for someone both psychotic and caring. Someone like Rose did this, didn't she? Oh, my God. I can't believe this. This is so crazy. But it's also kind of romantic. Don't you think? I mean, no I'm still really mad at her. Hey, Professor Blake, Jane Villanueva here. Uh, listen, I called yesterday, turning down my spot in the program, but if I could just retract that, that would be great. That was a mistake, calling and turning down the spot. I was just thinking about what I want for my son. Just to reiterate, I can do this. I mean, it's a juggling act, but I actually looked you up, and I saw that you have kids, so you understand And as far as ""looking you up,"" I-I just meant that in a commiserating kind of way, not, like, in a stalker-y way So I hope to hear from you soon to see if I Mailbox is full. _ Xiomara, can we talk about what happened, please? What do you mean? When you walked off the set. Oh, that. I-I was just giving you guys privacy, since you two were obviously seconds from ripping each other's clothes off. Uh, that's ridiculous. I was only doing my job. It's not real, it's acting. Oh, please, you're not that good of an actor. I know you don't mean that. I'm getting a ton of Paloma buzz this year. Screw it. If he wants to be with her, he can. What are you doing? _ _ _ Ma, stop. _ _ B-But he _ Grab food. - Jane. - Hey. So I, uh, I got to take off soon, got to get back to work, but I left a little something for you in your room. Oh, okay, thanks. For everything. All right. He looks good, doesn't he? He's got, like, a certain glow. I don't know, he's been so distant lately. Seems more like extreme manliness to me. Maybe he's taking himself out of the game. No, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe you are just not aware of the sophisticated nature of the game. Okay, what's going on, Dad? Oh, hey, um Rogelio told me about Plan Macho Macho Man. What? Did you really think I would respond to that kind of thing? - Jane, so listen - And being distant, and kind of a jerk on purpose? Jane, I-I'm trying to tell you. I mean, the one thing I like most about you is that you're honest and straightforward and able to communicate. Jane, stop, just go look in your room. To preface, I gave Rogelio's idea a try. Weirdest three days of my life. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, take care. So, look, here's what I would have said to you. You're obviously not fine. I speak ""sad-Jane."" I can tell how conflicted you are about the whole grad school thing. I took Mateo to class with me, and it was a total disaster. So I'm either gonna have to give up grad school for now or leave my baby behind at three weeks old. I think about how much you wanted to go. I mean, you practically gave birth in the guy's office because you were begging him to let you in. I know you must be freaking out over this news about Petra. Petra got herself pregnant with Rafael's sperm. Jane must be devastated. But I do have some experience with the whole ""surprise pregnancy via insemination"" scenario. And when it happened with you, well, I pretty much did everything wrong, 'cause I just tried to ignore it instead of embracing it. So that's my advice to you. There's a baby coming. Whatever that means to you, embrace it. _ _ _ Okay, Mateo's down. So let's talk about Petra. I mean, if you still want to. No, yes, of course I do. What are you thinking? I offer a counterproposal. A modified oligarch, if you will. She doesn't pretend it's someone else's kid, I don't know, maybe I visit a couple times a year. But is that what you want? I don't want any of this. And I know that you don't want to be part of my equation, but you are. I know. Here's what I think. I think you'd miserable doing that because of you who are. And I would want Mateo to know that he has a sibling because of who I am. Wh-What are you saying? I think that you we, possibly should figure out how to make it work, here. I'm guessing from that reaction, that's what you want? Thank you. Yes. Thank you so much. So first of all, you're an excellent actor. That goes without saying. But I'm glad you said it. I want to be honest and mature. I'm just really threatened by Luciana. I know it's part of your job, but it was hard to watch. I want to be honest too. You were right there was chemistry. But let's be real, I would have chemistry with a cardboard box. You are who I want to be with. Good. Then I'll suck it up and deal with it. You don't have to. I told Dina, ""No, Luciana's out."" Uh, but is that what's best for the show? No, but you're more important than the show. We're gonna have to hire someone subpar, and I will shine brightly enough for us both. And speaking of tough choices. So you're in. Yes. We'll figure out the custody. But you want to have this baby? Well, I don't want you to have an abortion. Or move to Russia. Fair enough. So I'll stay. Great. Oy, I think that's her version of a happy dance. _ _ Gustav? Hello again, Detective. Sorry we just getting back to you. Who the hell are they? _ _ _ _ No, no, it's fine. Listen, thank you so much for the visitor log. went by the name Denise back then. _ Does that ring a bell? Denise brought great suffering unto our village. Hang up, Clothilde. All you need to know is this name - Hang up. - Heidi Von Ocher. Hello? Dude, I'm thinking the same thing. _ _ And speaking of Rose, Luisa was feeling better, knowing she had kidnapped her. I said room temperature. _ Do you have any lip gloss? Wait a minute, if they're trying to get Rose to notice Luisa's missing, then Rose isn't the one who had her kidnapped. Oh, wait, no, you can't you can't hurt me. Which means Luisa is not so safe here after all. _ Oh, my God. Professor Blake called me back while I was nursing Mateo. He got my 12 voice mails. He wants to institute an ""e-mail only"" policy. I'm in. I'm in. I got my slot back. Yes, yes. Girl, work, work. Okay, should I call him back? No, no, no, absolutely not. Okay, but I'm going, I'm going. Yes. Yes. Last look. Is it true I didn't get the part? This is not a good time. We are about to shoot a death-defying scene. Come on, people. We're about to go into triple overtime. I thought we could do this the easy way, Rogelio. But, uh, if you're not gonna give me the part because I deserve it, then you're gonna have to give it to me so I don't release this. - Standby to roll. - And this moment brings us to one last telenovela tradition the terrifying cliffhanger. And action. No !"
"Okeydokey, diving right in. Our Jane was accidentally inseminated by this hottie. But she was engaged to this hottie. So now, she's in a big old love triangle. And Rafael? Well, he went in for the kiss. But you know who saw? His ex-wife Petra. Oh, and she was inseminated by Rafael, too. Though not accidentally. She did it her own damn self. I know crazy, right? And speaking of crazy, Rogelio's first ex-wife Luciana came back to town with her beloved bunnies. And Xo was super threatened by their chemistry. But Ro chose Xo. Unfortunately, Luciana wouldn't go away that easily. Oh, and speaking of threats, Rafael's sister Luisa was kidnapped by some scary German henchmen. She thought it was related to her ex-lover Rose. Also known as international criminal Sin Rostro. But then, this happened. Oh. Also searching for Rose, Detective Michael, and he had a lead her name used to be Denise. And she had visited a small vineyard in the Swiss Alps. But when he called the vineyard about Denise - Gustav? - He got this answer. All you need to know Heidi Von Ocher. And I don't know who the hell that is. So let's watch and find out. From a very young age, Jane Gloriana Villanueva knew exactly who she was a good student a good daughter and a good friend. Ready? I don't know. You can do this.  At the end of the rainbow   There's happiness   And to find it how often I've tried  Jane did let it all hang out that day, yo. And in so doing, she ruined her perfect behavior record. But she also found herself a lifelong bestie. _ I don't see how this is supposed to help you lose weight. I'm not even breaking a sweat. Yeah, it gets a little harder after the whole pregnancy thing. - You know? - All right, Carriage Cruisers! Now it's time to start squatting! Oh, and a reminder, if anyone is still peeping their pants, you might want to sit this one out. Don't want to brag, stopped peeping my pants yesterday. Hey-o! You look amazing. What's your secret? Birth control. Okay, finally, tell me about Nat. Nate. He's so cute. Anyway, he Snapchatted me Oh. Go on. Anyway, so I texted him back, just like, ""Why are you Snapchatting me in the bathroom when we're in the same bar?"" - Oh - Sorry, not you, not you. It's okay, sweetie. - I'm sorry. - Wait, was that to me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He usually sleeps during the session. I'm sorry, go on, go, go, go. Jane, it's fine. We'll catch up on Friday. - Friday? - Come on, Jane! You're killing me! I can't keep showing up everywhere dressed like this. It should be noted that until this moment, Jane had completely forgotten about her best friend's - _ - Thank you for throwing me the best baby shower ever. And I am gonna throw you a killer 25th birthday party. That she had promised to plan. Please, the baby will be little. My sisters have kids. I know the drill. You're gonna kind of disappear on me. Stop! I'm not gonna disappear on you. And I'm gonna throw you a birthday party. Oh, my God! Can it be a surprise? I've never had a surprise party. Yeah, but you know. But not when. So ? Is it Friday? Turns out I hate surprises. Yep, it's Friday. Oh, God. What am I wearing? Is there a theme? A theme we need a theme! Um, the '60s or a Greek thing The Great Gatsby because of your roaring 20s. Oh, my God! I love that movie. The Great Gatsby? It's all I can think of; I'm writing a paper on it at school so, can you help me? Sure, it's been a while since I read the book. With the party. I was kidding. Oh. Oh, not up. Sure, I'll help. You throwing it at the hotel? I think so. Still have to ask Rafael. Have you talked to him since the big smooch? Okay, first off, it wasn't a big smooch. It was a regular smooch. And yes. We talked. Kind of. _ _ _ _ You know, it means I'm a little overwhelmed right now. And I just had a baby and I'm not ready. And I know that's not what you want to hear, but I'm sorry, that's where I'm at. Think he got all that from a gritted-teeth emoji? Unclear. But like I said, he's coming over, and I'm gonna talk to him. Oh, and I'm going to tell Michael we kissed. What? Why? Just to be on the up and up. It's a terrible idea. And we have no jurisdiction in Switzerland. So, I'll talk to her off the record even. We don't have the budget to send you. We'll find the money. I know the Sin Rostro case better than anyone, and right now, we got the element of surprise working for us. Oh, hi there. Cordero, meet Detective Susanna Barnett, your new partner. - What? - Can't beat the element of surprise. I was gonna tell you, then you started in on Switzerland. Pleased to meet you. _ _ _ _ _ Nice to meet you. What if we find a way to bring Heidi Von Ocher here? Who's Heidi Von Ocher? I actually can't remember. Just give me some time; if it doesn't work, you'll hand the lead over to the Swiss authorities. That's it. Swiss authorities, wow! Looks like we're fixing to go international. You want to catch me up? Read the Sin Rostro file. Sin Rostro already? Yes! Okay, this could be painful. Oh, it's really painful! Bone pain's the worst kind of pain. I know, because-cause I'm a doctor! Oh, can you, can you please just get me an oxy? Actually, wait, no, don't get me an oxy. Like they say in AA, it's a slippery slope. Actually, just give me half of one and then don't give me the other half no matter what I say. _ Let me just Google Translate that. _ Maybe ""I got the image""? Okay, okay, I don't care about the oxy. Just don't mutter me! _ _ So, what do you think? Definitely don't tell Michael you kissed Rafael. About the invitation, Ma! I'm just saying nothing good can come of it. _ What? How did you ? _ Oh, okay, that's Rafael. Enough. Hey, Mateo, it's Daddy! Hey Hey. Hi. Hi. Wait! I guess I misread the emoji. I just think it's too soon. You know, right now everything's about Mateo. And I can't see beyond that. I'm sorry. - Um - Um, actually, can we, um, can we go sit outside for a second? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. So listen, I know that you are not ready for a relationship. And honestly, I don't want to rush you. - Thank you. - But at the same time, the way things are, it's just not really working for me. And it's okay, if we were working towards being together, but if that part is on pause indefinitely, which I-I get,I-I do Rafael, what's going on? I think that we should talk about custody. What's the emoji for ""gut punch""? To remind you, Rafael just dropped the custody bomb. I'm sorry, Jane, I am. I-I don't want to do this, it's just that Mateo is changing so much every day. And I want to be a part of it. - You are. - I drop in. But it's your life with him. It's your routine. And it doesn't include me. Look, I get it. Uh I mean, it's just a surprise. I mean, the thought of lawyers Look, w-we don't have to get lawyers. We just try to work this out between us first. _ I'm really sorry. He says it's important. No, that's fine, by all means, just call Michael. Yeah, Michael, this isn't a good time. Yeah, we'll be there. Heard congratulations are in order. You okay? Just a little nauseous. Yeah, probably karma. Please, don't look so smug. We both want the same thing. You with Jane, me with Rafael. We should be working together. There's nothing to work on. They're not right for each other. Eventually, she'll realize it. Oh, is that what's happening? They're, um Realizing it? Coming. Hey, are you okay? I'm fine. So I might have a new lead in the Sin Rostro investigation. A woman by the name Heidi Von Ocher. - And who is she? - I have no idea! No one's telling me! She is Well, she's a professional singer. A yodeler, actually. A yodeler? Like in The Sound of Music? Kind of like in The Sound of Music. Never seen it. Really? Okay, weird thing to feel superior about. Yeah, really. Kind of. Here's the point Heidi Von Ocher yodels. Or ""jodels,"" I guess it's pronounced. I was corrected twice on the phone. Anyway, there was a big concert, and she didn't make it to the final show. - You think Sin Rostro killed her? - No. I think she slept with her. That does seem to be her weapon of choice. There was some whispering on the online jodel community about an affair. Is that Rose? Pretty sure. She went by the name Denise back then. I don't have jurisdiction in Switzerland, but if you book Heidi here, to yodel Jodel. Then I can question her. This is the first new lead I've gotten. Please. I need her on the next flight to Miami. Okay. I'll book her. I don't care about yodeling, I care about custody. _ No butter. Do you think you need to get a lawyer? No lawyers. We are going to figure it out between us. Rafael's gonna take care of Mateo while I'm in school starting tomorrow, actually. Yeah? You okay with that? I mean, I have to be, right? _ They're shooting La Semana de Hacer el Amor on Passions this week. _ _ Rogelio has to be super healthy until he can put his clothes back on camera again. Hey I made you a special dinner low calorie, low carb, gluten-free. You are the most accommodating woman, Xiomara, which is why I hope you will understand that I may need to hire Luciana after all. What? Why? Sometimes unforeseen obstacles can arise in an unexpected way and undo plans we'd otherwise not like undone. Dad - She is blackmailing me. - With what? Rogelio, what does she have on you? When I was a younger man coming to Hollywood, I joined a certain church for actors. Celebrities in general. Tom Cruise, specifically. Scientology? _ Not exactly. It's a church in which people believe they are immortal spiritual beings. _ Or say, aliens who are trapped on Planet Earth and must find their true selves through self-exploration. _ Or a carefully crafted, monetized system of levels on the Bridge to Total Freedom in hopes of uncovering your godlike secret powers. - Look, everyone was doing it. - Oh, Dad So it's embarrassing. So what? That's not the problem. Luciana has my audits. What are those? Auditing is like going to confession, only you record it. But the classes were too expensive, so we did a lot of independent study and we just made our own version of an E-meter. Continue. I was nine years old the first time I touched my If you hire Luciana, she'll give you the tapes back? That's what she said. Then do it. Hire her. I can handle it. Wie Bitte? Ich soll nicht auftreten? Was soll dass heissen, ich soll nicht auftreten? _ _ _ _ _ Ich bin nach Miami gekommen, um aufzutreten! Do either of you speak English? Yes. Little bit. _ Does Ms. Ocher recognize this woman? Erkennst Du diese Frau? - We think her name is Denise. - Kenne ich sie? Ob ich sie kenne? Natuerlich kenne ich sie! Sie hat mein Leben ruiniert und Mich laecherlich gemacht! Ich kann Mich wegen ihr in meiner Stadt nie wieder blicken Lassen! Sag ihnen nicht, dass ich sie kenne! Ich will Nichts mit ihr zu tun haben. Ich bin nur hier um aufzutreten. No. Tell her this is very important. Es ist sehr wichtig. Er muss garantieren, dass wir auftreten. Ich werde nicht noch einen Auftritt wegen dieser Teufels-Braut verpassen. First, you guarantee that we perform. Heidi says she will not miss another show for that she-devil. Yeah, okay. Sure, you can perform. Sie muessen Papp-Mache Berge zur Verfuegung stellen. And you provide the papier-mÃÂ¢chÃ© mountain. Also facing a mountain? Jane. See, she only has two hours to write 2,500 words on The Great Gatsby before Mateo needs to nurse. Oh, good! Looks like it's swimming along. You know, I've always loved The Great Gatsby. I'll bet Jane has an interesting take. Let's look. ""After thawing breast milk, you cannot refreeze it."" Hmm. I don't remember that part of the book. Oh. That actually looks like - A babysitting list? - No, it's just a list of instructions for the baby. - Hmm. - Do you know how long breast milk can stay out? Four hours. It's on page three. Okay. Got it. Look, I'm sorry, it's just really hard for me to leave him. It's hard for me, too. Every single time. And onto another shaky partnership. Can we just rewind real quick? No, no, we're not rewinding again. We've covered Denise and Heidi's first meeting, extensively. So after you made love overlooking the town square with the giant glockenspiel, what happened? Was ist passiert, nachdem ihr, den Marktplatz mit dem riesigen Glockenspiel uberblickend, miteinander geschlafen habt? Denise hat ihre Mutter angerufen und ihr gesagt, dass sie nach Hause kommt, und dann ist sie gegangen. Denise called her Mutter and said she coming home and left. Her Mutter? - Yes. Her mother. - Can we rewind - one sec? - Did-did you ever see Denise's Mutter? Hast Du jemals Denises' Mutter gesehen? Nein. Ich Weiss nur, dass Sie eine riesen Zicke ist. No. All she know she is how do you say? big bitch. - Speaking of big bitches - Ah, Rose Ooh! Oh, oh, wait. What country am I in? Do you speak English? Uh, you're in Miami. South Beach. Oh. Oh. Thank you. RSVPs are a little on the low side, so I branched out to Lina's second and third tier and sent them personal ""hope you can be there"" e-mails on my way home from school. What's that? Mountains this way. Hey, I-I'm having a party here. What's going on? I have no idea, okay? Petra told me - to move them in for some event - But I already Take it up with Petra. I don't need her yelling at me. I'm so sorry. _ She's just not feeling that great right now. _ Oh, Rafael what were you thinking? So, Mateo's doing well? Yup, we are great. Good. And the list, is it helpful at all? Looking at it right now. - Ooh. - Are you? Yes. Are you checking up on me? - No. - Really? Because it sure feels like you are. Jane? In this moment, Jane wondered if there might be another explanation for the crumpled-up list. Like maybe he made a copy. Which is why she hid in the closet. Jane? Are you there? _ This is a telenovela, people. We need some drama. Turn on the wind machine. And kiss like you've been poisoned and the only antidote is each other's saliva. I hope you used a mint. Please don't talk to me I'm getting into character, and it's very difficult as my character must make love to a lying, scheming chupacabra of a woman. Ready? And sexy. Sexy! Action! _ _ _ Cut! What is this? I didn't feel the lovemaking. Well, I must make love on the right, so the camera can capture my best side. But my right side is also my best side. I am the EP of this show, so my right side will be featured. _ - Rogelio? - Hmm? Everybody knows you're an EP but they don't know all the things you admitted to become an OT III. _ I will take the left side, but only because your left side is far worse, and I want what's best for the show. I was wrong. I can't handle this. Oh, and one more thing my dressing room is too small. I'll need a trailer for Consuelo and her brothers and sisters. Can you take care of that? As an EP? And speaking of trapped. Oh, good, help! Finally. Hey, Michael. Look, I wasn't sure whether I should say something or not say something, but I think I just have to. What's going on? I know you kissed Rafael. Oh. What was that? About 40 rolls of toilet paper - and a hundred bottles of mini shampoo. - What? Oh, I'm sort of trapped in a utility closet. Thank you so much. Why were you in the closet? You were in the closet? Briefly, yes. Look, I I saw this crumpled up - next to your trash can in your office. - Wait, what? So I called, you said you had it, I knew you didn't, unless you made a copy. - No. - I knew it! I knew you lied! I just didn't want you - to think I couldn't take care of him. - It should be noted that for a brief moment Michael really enjoyed watching things unravel. Are you really defending the fact that you came up here to confront me and then hid in a closet? No. But at least admit that you crumpled up this paper. Until he realized Don't look so smug. We both want the same thing you with Jane, me with Rafael. We should be working together. It was probably Petra. True, for the record. Petra saw you kissing she seemed pretty upset. You look pretty upset, too, man. Oh, my God, - she is crazy. - Well, crazy or not, she's still in love with you. And she still thinks she has a chance. So if there's not a chance, you need to tell her. Pretty sure he's not talking about Petra anymore. I got to go. Raf! - Oh, my God! - What - I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. - Luisa where have you been? I was kidnapped. - What? - Who kidnapped you? Stop, stop. She was not kidnapped. - No. Yes, I was. - That's what she said at Christmas when she didn't show up because she was drunk. No, Raf, I swear to God, I really was kidnapped by these really scary German men that wanted to mutter me, - and I don't know why they let me go. - Wait, wait, wait. Mutter? - Yeah. - I'm gonna need to talk to you. Look, I'm sorry. I saw the list and I got upset. Do you really think that I would have - thrown it away? - You were pretty mad. I'm not mad. Jane, I'm frustrated. I love you. I want us to be together. I think that's what's best. I mean, just think about Mateo. Are you serious? What? Think about Mateo? That's the whole problem. He's all I think about. I mean, it's like he's taken over my brain. I can't even write a stupid paper on The Great Gatsby, which I read in the ninth grade. And I forgot my best friend's birthday, because I'm thinking about when he needs to eat and-and how to get him to sleep longer. You know, and it's not just my brain, it's physical, too I'm exhausted. I mean, my boobs literally hurt when I'm away from him. And I know that he has changed a lot in the last three weeks. But you know what? I have, too. Because now everything revolves around him. I mean, that's why I can't choose who I want to be with. Because I don't even recognize myself anymore. - I'm sorry. - No. No. No, this started by me telling you I'm sorry. And I am. And emotional and exhausted, clearly. And you do have rights to Mateo. So I think maybe we should get a lawyer, so we can take the emotion out of it. Also trying to overcome his emotions Luciana. Luciana, please wait. I'd like us to start over. I know we're very different people. But maybe we can focus more on work and less on our differences. Wow. The high road. Didn't see that coming. That is very big of you, Rogelio, to admit that you're wrong and to realize that my happiness is best for the show. If there's anything I can do to better accommodate you here at Passions, just say the word. I'll call my P.A. to listen. First, I get shot on the right side every single time. Second - _ - Excellent talk. Need to go. High road, highway same thing, right? _ Oh, no. Nate, the guy Lina likes, is busy tonight, because it's so last-minute. - Head count? - 13 people confirmed, including my mom and Abuela. That's just embarrassing. What's embarrassing? - Lina, I screwed up. - With what? I forgot your birthday, and I tried to plan this last-minute party, and everybody's so busy, and it's just not looking great. Are you just trying to make the whole surprise thing work again? No. I'm sorry. I forgot. And I just didn't want you to feel like you weren't important. Well, it's pretty clear that I'm not. Oh, oh, shh, shh Oh, shh, shh, shh. Going to the club is the last thing I want to do. You think Lina wanted to go to Carriage Cruisers? She's celebrating her birthday tonight. You're going. I'll watch Mateo. No. Yeah, of course I'll watch him. Is your mom busy? No. But it should be you that I go to first, regardless of lawyers. I'm sorry. It's my lawyer. Again, you don't need a lawyer. No. She wants a booty call. Okay. Y You don't think it was Rose holding you hostage? No. I mean, at first I thought it was her, because the men, they were they were so gentle with me. They even used these soft ties. Then once they hit my leg No. It was not Rose. She would never hurt me. Even when we explored bondage, she was so gentle, she would just she would just take me right to the edge and That's why we're thinking maybe someone took you to send her a message. Because I mean so much to her? Yes. It's very romantic. Luisa did Rose ever mention her mother? Can we rewind just a sec? What kind of ties were you tied up with? - During sex? - No, with - the German florists. - Why is that important? - Silky cords. They were soft. - Okay, gotcha. - Now go back to Rose's mother. - Do you remember the color? - Blue. Like the color of oxy. - No. You know what? Can I talk to you for a second? Which, actually, I could really use that right now for my knee. - What are you doing? - Asking her questions. - About things we're not looking for. - I'm not looking for anything. I'm just listening. And you know what I heard? Blue silk ties. You know who used blue silk ties? A drug lord that ran Miami back in the '80s, went by the name Mutter look it up. _ _ _ _ So I'm thinking Rose, or Denise, wasn't actually talking to Heidi about her mother at all. She was talking about Mutter, the crime boss. Oh, I just wanted to say, forget about the oxy. - Got it. - So who's Heidi? Like, the next girlfriend of Rose or something? Just sit down. We'll be back in, okay? How do you know all this? I read up on Miami crime history before transferring. Plus, I have a photographic memory, which you would know if you'd tried to get to know me at all. But I get it. Your last partner, Nadine, double-crossed you, so it'll take you a second to warm up to me. Anyway, you're gonna want to read up on Mutter. And speaking of Mutters Hey, I want to show you - a picture. Can I come in? - Sure. What kind of picture? It's Mateo. My son. Why are you showing me this? Because he is who you're hurting, Petra, every time you try to drive me and Jane apart. I wasn't. And we are having one. A baby. You think I don't know that? I'm sick all the time. So focus on that. - I can't. - Why? Because I'm scared, okay? I don't know how to do this or why I did it. I thought we would be together, - and if we're not together, then I just - Then what? Then I made a huge mistake. Yeah. Yeah, you definitely made a huge mistake. But the crazy thing? I mean, it worked. After all those miscarriages and the doctors telling you you can't have kids, and then this stuck? Petra, it's kind of a miracle, right? - When did you get so cheesy? - What I mean is, this is a good thing, with or without me. Without, specifically. Look, you are smart and tenacious. And you deserve someone that'll really make you happy. Thank you. - Again, not me. - Okay, enough already. It was a gentle dressing down. Which brings us here, now, to dressing up. Or trying to. - Hey. - Hi. Um your mom let me in. I got your text about wanting to talk. Yeah. I-I do want to. Yeah, I was nearby, so Okay, I can't watch you do that. - Let me - Okay, thank you. - It's a little snug. - Well, I just had a baby. I know. Do you have something else? - No, you're gonna get this on. - Got it. - Okay. - On it. I know I shouldn't be upset about the kiss. You can kiss whoever you want. I just didn't know whether to tell you or not, since it didn't change anything. It didn't? No. But I should have told you. You've been so honest with me. And that's when it hit him. Not about everything. What? This I'd be fired. It's about Nadine. Your old partner? Uh, what, that you were sleeping with her? Because that was pretty obvious. But it's okay, 'cause it's none of my business. Not that. It's that I let her go. When I found out she was working for Sin Rostro, I told her to run, and gave her a head start. - What? - She said her nephew - was threatened, and I believed her. - And now? - Do you? - I-I don't know. Michael. Is that thing on? Uh Oh Scott, I don't care. They need an intro; you have to do it. Uh-oh. When did Rafael get here? Whew! At least the monitor's off. I have to go. I'm just making sure everyone's okay after the whole closet thing. But I'm going to work. Bye, Jane. Bye, Michael. So thanks for taking Mateo. Of course. No problem. And I wanted to say, let's not go to lawyers yet. Let's just try to figure this out. I'm not ready to take the emotion out. And I totally get what you were saying today Raf. Can we talk about this later, actually? I have to get moving. - Excuse me. - Which brings us here now to Lina's big birthday bash! Sorry I'm screaming! It's just so loud in here! Excuse me. Oh! Sorry. That was my breast pump. Sorry. Excuse me. Lina? Can we just talk? No. I'm dancing. Um Hey, work, work. Yes. - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. I really am. Lina! What you did really sucked! I know. And I know I said that nothing would change, but it did. Everything changed. And I get it. You're a mom. Yeah, but I don't want to be that mom that forgets about her friends, and all she does is talk about baby poop. Right, and I felt like that was happening. And I didn't want to let you down or lose you, so I panicked. And I'm sorry. Thanks, and thank you for coming. - And you can go now. - What?! Come on, you don't have to stay just because you feel bad. Oh, don't get it twisted. I came because I felt bad. But I'm staying because it's your 25th birthday. And I'm ready to party! - Really? - Yes! With your portable boob sucker? Oh. Oh. Oh, I'm pumping and dumping tonight. Okay. _ Okay. Mm, mm. - Oh, is it just me, or is it getting hot in here? - No. - Yes. Yes! - Yes! Oh, can I?  Oh! With a little bit of uh, uh   And a little bit of uh, uh, I was like   Good gracious, ass is bodacious  - Oh! -  Flirtatious, trying to show faces   I'm looking for the right time to shoot my steez, you know   Looking for the right time to flash them ki's  - Oh, girl! -  I'm leaving  -  Please believing, oh, me and the rest of my heathens  - What? What?  Check it, got it locked at the top of the Four Seasons  -  Penthouse, rooftop, birds I feeding  - What? -  Uh, it's getting hot in here  - Oh.  So take off all your clothes   I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off  - Oh, but -  It's getting hot in here, so hot   So take off all your clothes   I am getting so hot   I wanna take my clothes off  Whoa! Whoa! I just peed a little. - You know what we should do? - Get off this gross floor? No. We should take a bathroom floor selfie to commemorate your birthday. And your first pump-and-dump. Oh. _ - _ - Oh, my God! I haven't checked my phone. Why? Is everything okay? Everything's great. For the first time since he was born, I haven't been thinking about Mateo. Oh, my God, neither have I. Ooh, this song! - Mm! Go. I'll catch up. - No. I can wait till you're done milking. No, it'll take ten more minutes, and cleanup. Go, find Nate and dance. - Okay. - Okay. I love you, lady. I love you, too. Oh! - Go! - Okay, okay, okay. And there, on the floor, suddenly Jane wanted to do something completely and utterly her. She wanted to write her paper. And so she did on her cell. _ - _ - Jane would realize in the morning - _ - that it was all drunken gibberish. _ But for the moment, she felt like herself again. What's this? Fan art. I don't think they captured my gravitas. Did you sign the non-disclosure agreement? If I say a word, I pay restitution. Now give me my bunnies, you monster. Ah, Xiomara, enjoy watching Disc 142, Part C. It's quite a revelation. What's on Disc 142, Part C? Just a long-held, very deep secret of mine. Oh. Look, you don't have to share if you don't want to. Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay, that's not the answer -_ - she was expecting. Hey, Raf, uh, I am here to pick up Mateo. I'm walking into your house right now. Didn't you get my text? _ Oh, no. I must have missed it. Okay, um, Ubering, and I will be there in 15 minutes. And that's when Hey. What are you doing here? I'm, uh, dealing with Heidi. How was the club? I did ""Hot in Herre"""" You didn't. I did. Talent-show style? Whoa. Whoa. _ It should be noted that when Jane arrived home, well she was walking on air. Briefly. It's complicated. _ You gonna do-si-do on out of here? Yup. Sure. Look, um, you were right. I'm a little screwed up by what happened with my old partner, so, if I put that onto you What did happen? She was working for Sin Rostro. Yeah, I know. I just mean Devil's in the details. Another time. You were right. Cordero's definitely hiding something. - Find out what it is. - That's why I'm here. So glad you're here. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Heidi Von Ocher! Heidi Von Ocher! Oh, Nein! Nein! Ich komme zu spaet zu meinem Auftritt! Oh, nein! Nein! Hmm. That Web site looks familiar. Oh, I know where I've seen it! They'd been communicating with Rose. And now Rose was communicating with Luisa! Luisa was torn. On the one hand, Rose locked her in a mental institution, killed her father and kidnapped her nephew. On the other hand Yup. It's hard to let go. But Petra, at least, had made some progress. For the first time, she started to imagine life without Rafael. And I'm not gonna lie. She felt pretty darn good. Hello, Petra. Well, that lasted about 17 seconds. _ _ Milos. You could start calling first. I like element of surprise. Listen, I need to marry you for tax purposes. You knew when I give you hotel shares, there would be strings attached. You know what? You can have the hotel shares back. Okay, I thought we could do things soft American way. But I know all your secrets, Natalia. Things that could send you to jail with your mommy. In any case, we are not there. Let me do this right. Petra, you will marry me. Oh, it was beyond romantic. It was the best kiss of my life, Ma. And suddenly, it was so clear. It's Michael. Oh, no! Oh!"
"Welcome back. Ready to hit this baby one more time? Jane, you'll recall, was accidentally inseminated, and the doctor responsible well, that would be Rafael's sister, Luisa. Even crazier Jane had the baby. But now she's caught in a big ol' love triangle. On the one hand Rafael, her son's father. On the other hand Michael, her ex-fiancé And last night, well, this happened. Oh, and remember Raf's ex-wife Petra? Well, she stole Rafael's last sperm sample and inseminated herself, and now, she was kind of in a pickle. See, she's in debt to Milos. I have this abusive ex-boyfriend. And he has come to collect. You will marry me. I know! Straight out of a telenovela, right? So, let's get started. There are days we will always remember. For me, that day was Not relevant. Sorry. This is not about me. There are days the Villanueva women will always remember. June 12 was one. But first, allow me to set the scene. Here we have Jane, just 14 months old. Mommy! And Xiomara, freshly 18. Ma, want to go eat at La Rosa tonight, maybe? Come on, Ma, I know you can hear me. _ It's me. So, turns out I can go to the mall tonight after all. Crap! I got to go. Jane, what are you doing?! _ No, no, Janie! Ugh, this is the last thing I need today. If your Abuela sees It's okay, sweetie. We just need to clean this up. But alas, the day had left its mark. - _ - The important ones do. It was a moment of revelation for Jane. She finally saw the writing on the wall. _ Oh, my. Looks like someone's got a little skip in his step today. Wow! Michael? Yes, Michael! So, did you tell him? No, not yet. I have to tell Rafael first. I don't even know how to say it. - Jane is picking Michael. - How do you know? I overheard it last night on the baby monitor. Apparently, they shared ""an epic kiss."" Her words, not mine. It was pretty epic. - Does Jane know you heard? - No, I unplugged the monitor. I didn't want to talk about it. Good instinct. That's what I would have done. Okay, now, listen. You can still save this. Just don't let her break up with you. What does she even see in that punk? He's gonna flip out. Michael? Yeah, he's gonna be pretty stoked. - Rafael. - I know. It's awful. And that's why I just need to tell him first in the best way possible. - You got to play the cancer card. - What?! Just say that you're having a relapse. I'm serious. Just to buy you time to win her back. Raf, this is your family. You think I don't know that? She's throwing everything away. And what about Mateo? Mateo's involved, so, I need to do everything I can to make sure we all get along. 'Cause we're gonna be in each other's lives forever. Okay, you just said ""forever."" I did, didn't I? That's what I want with Michael forever. I just wish it wasn't gonna hurt Rafael. Oh, my God. I literally don't know whether I should laugh or cry right now. Wow. Talk about feeling all the feels. I told you it was a big day. Yeah. Mom, go put a sweater over that blouse. Abuela, I'm leaving! I'll see you at the lawyer's later. - Love you. Bye. Mwah. - Mwah. _ _ _ _ _ _ Wait for it. _ You'll recall Alba had recently decided to pursue her Green Card. Yes, but you do know that this meeting is for filing Mom's sponsorship papers, right? You're not becoming a citizen today, Abuela. _ _ - You look great. - I agree. Not looking so great? There she is, my beautiful bride. You know what? I should fill in some gaps. Last night, Petra tried everything she could think of - to get out of marrying Milos. - But I don't love you. Right now. No one knows future. - _ - I am pregnant. With Rafael's baby. I will raise bastard as my own. _ Fine. One year with the understanding that this is just about you needing a tax shelter and does not in any way indicate that I have feelings for you. - At moment. - At all. And no sex. - Unless you change your mind. - I won't. You might. - Milos! - Fine, fine. No sex, you little Minx! But you must make marriage seem real. I'm sure you have seen the film ""Green Card"" with Gérard Depardieu? That cannot happen to me. - I made an appointment with City Hall. - No need. I want to get married in my own hotel, so I have booked Marbella ballroom. Milos, we agreed to a small wedding. And see? I have started wedding preparations already, like a good, modern husband. Now, come, help me pick band. - We don't need a band. - Then who will open for the main act? Who's the main act? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You don't know who this is, but it's a really big deal, Mateo. - Hi. What's your name? - Jane. Jane, I think there's something about you. I can tell you have rhythm. Would you like to dance? Yeah. - Come on! - Okay. You guessed it. That did not happen. Here's what happened. Ah. Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, my God. Ah! Oh, my God, Jane saw Britney Spears checking in at the Marbella! Excuse me? She just texted. I think this is her elbow. And Britney was checking in? - Uh-huh. - Good. Then she will finally have to face me. Britney Spears? We happen to be in a little bit of a feud. A big feud, actually! I don't know why I'm downplaying it. I'm done protecting Britney Spears! Wait. You're not joking. Of course I am not. Okay, then-then why haven't you talked about it before? I mean, lord knows you drop Gloria Estefan's name enough. I don't drop her name. I mention people like Gloria Estefan, Alejandro Fernández and Oprah Winfrey because they happen to be dear friends of mine. Then how'd you and Britney meet? It was years ago. I went to an awards show wearing a look Britney liked. She expressed her admiration for the outfit, and I generously went home to change, allowing her to debut it in a video! She was touched. We became dear friends. - Friends like ? - Like regular friends! We'd swap concealer tips, career advice. When she kissed Madonna at the MTV Video Music Awards? That was my idea! I pitched it to Enrique Iglesias, but he wasn't feeling well and didn't want to get me sick. The point is we were close. Until she betrayed me. But now, Britney's here. And she can no longer avoid me. I'm serious. She's here. Events got a call about this huge, last-minute wedding in the ballroom, and she is performing. I don't know who these people are Actually the wedding is mine. - I accepted a proposal from Milos. - Wait. Wait. What?! You're marrying Milos? Sorry, I overheard. What are you talking about, Petra? He proposed. It was very romantic, actually. Is this about money? - No. This is about the fact that we've worked through our issues. - Like the fact that he threw acid at your mother? You've met my mother, Jane. Clearly, you can understand the urge. Anyway, just letting you know. Excuse me. Lots to get ready. I don't understand. She doesn't want to marry him, it's a play. She and I are in negotiations for child support. And she knows that I don't want our kid around Milos, so, she's using him as a bargaining chip. I'll reach out to her lawyers, I'll ask her to name a number. You think that'll work? It has to. I don't want that psycho around my kid. And at that moment, - _ - Rafael saw the writing on the wall. So, I So I should call my lawyer, uh, get things started while Mateo's napping. I hope the meeting goes well. Tell Alba I said good luck, huh? Okay, I will. Hey there. I'm Robert Torres. - Nice to meet you. - Alba Villanueva. Nice to meet you. And I am looking forward to becoming a citizen. And to visiting Helena, the capital of Montana. She's ready. Mm. I'm Xiomara Villanueva, - her daughter and her sponsor. - Nice to meet you. Jane, the granddaughter. I'm the one you talked to on the phone. Ah, yes. A lot of questions. Very thorough. Sit, sit. I screened your application, which looks mostly good. _ Well, Jane communicated to me that you're on the cautious side. Yeah. _ There was this girl in my grade school, and she came home one day her mom was deported. It was pretty traumatic. So what's the issue with my grandmother's application? Well, it came up in your background check, actually. Since you're Alba's sponsor, your felony conviction could be a problem. - This is crazy! What felony? - For grand theft, back in the '90s. - Oh, no, there must be a mistake. - You mean the jewelry store? - What jewelry store? - No, this is a mistake. It was a misdemeanor, shoplifting. Uh a felon is, like, a murderer. Or, in the state of Florida, anyone who steals in excess of $400, which is what you pled guilty to. _ It was this guy I was seeing Zed. We-we worked together at Slushie Palace. He stole this ring that I liked. I took the fall for him, because he had a prior conviction. I was 18 and in love. I got community service I thought it went away. _ Okay, so is this gonna make it harder for my grandmother to get a Green Card? Possibly. It's hard to say for sure. Immigration laws are constantly changing. _ But I know that your grandmother is cautious. _ _ Okay, so what if we found this Zed guy and we had him come forward? Can we get it taken off of her record? Of course if you have the conviction overturned. Okay. So this is fixable. At least, she hoped it was. Britney again? Aw. Even better. Here is what Jane wanted to do in this moment. It's you. It's always been you. And here is what she actually did. Hi. Hey, Jane! Rafael's right upstairs, with Mateo. Yeah, that's where I was heading. Bye, Michael. Let's talk later? Okay. Sorry, dude. He's my brother, you know? Had to put up the block. You all done asking me questions? Yes. Go. Please. Just pick whatever wedding cake you want, Milos. Okay? Cake is one of the many things that's making me sick, and these stupid lollipops aren't helping! Petra? Did you ever get sick Jane, when you were pregnant? No. No, of course you didn't, no. How can I help you? Oh, and please tell Rafael that his lawyer's offer was really just embarrassing. This is not about money. Then what is it about? I mean, why are you marrying Milos? Frankly, Jane, it's none of your business. Petra, come on. I remember that day in the stairwell. You were scared of him. Are you in danger? - No. - Then what is it? What is he holding over you? Tricky question. Most of her lies concern you. Look, Jane Milos and I were we were in love once. He was my Prince Charming. _ _ Give money. Support the artiste. English, of course. For the tourists. Oh, my! Brava! Oh! Best violin I ever been hearing. I have been watching you play for a few months now. You are good. But you are in need of upgrade. A violin as lovely as you. It was a handcrafted Guarneri. - More valuable than my byt. - _ Never played anything like it. We were happy once. Till my mother started making up all those lies. What lies? She said he cheated. He didn't. And now that I know the truth I think we'll be happy again. She can't possibly believe we'll fall for that. No. But that's the story she's sticking with. I was thinking, maybe you should go see Magda. I mean, if Milos is holding something over here, she'd know. Plus, she hates him. That's a good idea. Hey, I'll, uh, I'll put in a request to see her right now. Good call, Jane. Let's break his heart after he visits his crazy ex-mother-in-law in prison. And speaking of crazy relatives. Dad? - What are you doing here? - I'm just simply sitting here catching up on the news and waiting for Britney Spears to emerge - so that I can confront her. - What?! Oh. Hmm. There she is. - I'd move, Jane. - Dad. Britney! Britney Spears, stop! Hello, Britney. Ro Ro - Don't you pretend you don't know my name. - I'm so sorry. I hope I didn't hurt your feelings it's just that I meet so many people. Stop it, stop it, stop it right this minute! You know why I am here. Now apologize. I'm really sorry I forgot your name. This is not about my name! It's about the 2009 Latin Pop Music Awards. Wait, are you still mad about that teleprompter accident? It wasn't an accident, it was premeditated, and you were the premeditator. Like I told you at the time, I didn't have anything to do with that. I saw you talking to the teleprompter guy before the show! I like to get to know everyone on the crew. Mm-hmm. I don't believe you. But it doesn't make sense why would I do that? Can you think of any reason why I would do that? Because I was emerging from your shadow, and you didn't like it. Let's go! So long, Rogulio! Rogelio! You know my name! Come back and admit what you did, Britney Spears! Admit it! Admit it! A restraining order? This is what I think about your restraining order, Britney Spears! Okay. I got it up. - No, stop. Stop now. - Too late. And now, the winner of the category of Hot Latin Star of the Year. A category I wouldn't know anything about, being neither hot nor a star Wait, what? This was-was-was a mistake. Let me take that. It's okay. Everyone gets nervous. And the winner is Dad, it kind of seems like she was coming to your rescue. That's what she wants it to look like. That's not what's happening. I can only imagine she was jealous of my rising fame. Or ? Or I don't know. But I know what I must do. Let it go and move on? Virtual warfare. I'm gonna tweet out a call to arms, and my loyal fans will not hesitate to take up the cause. Britney's fans may be stronger in numbers, but nobody has the passion of a Rogelifan! I will use my anonymous Twitter handle, of course. Rogelio fans unite. With the knife emoji to symbolize warfare. Oh, no knives the restraining order. Fine. Oh, my God, amazing! Thank you. Slutty Crystal got an address for Zed! Yes, Mom! - I'll pump, you drive! - Yes! So, here we are, eight ounces - of breast milk later. - There he is. Oh Rollerblades? They were cool in the '90s. - Zed? - Oh! Hey! Oh wh Xo! Oh, from, uh, uh, Slushie Palace! How have you been? It's been years! Oh, my God, how's that baby of yours? Uh, she's here! Whoa, you got hot! Nice! Well, uh, thank you, Zed. Oh, no, no, no. It's not Zed anymore. I go by Jon Snow Because like him I watch the Wall. My wall. My masterpiece. - Amazing! - It's gorgeous! And I also sell a little cocaine. Get it? Snow. - 100%! - Hilarious! Um, so listen, um, Zed Ah. Jon - Yeah. - I need a little favor. - Yeah. - Remember that time you shoplifted from the jewelry store? Right. We got engaged, and I stole you an engagement ring. - What? You two got engaged? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, for, like, ten minutes. No, don't worry about it. Uh, right, and I took the blame for you, which has come back to bite me in the ass, because my mom is finally applying for her Green Card. - Oh, my God, that's great! -Tell Albs I said whutup. I will, I will, but the thing is, my felony record could get in the way, so I need you to tell a judge that you stole that ring, not me. Oh, yeah. No, I'm gonna have to pass. Sorry. But if it's any consolation, I still think you're very, very hot. And I think you're just as much of a jackass - as you were when I - Mom-Mom-Mom-Mom-Mom Mom, I saw some fake bags. Why don't you go shop for us, yeah? Let me talk to Zed, Mr. Snow, over here. Okay. Wait, oh, Mr. Snow! - Oh! - Yo, come holler at me for a second. - Yeah - Holla. Yeah. Um, so sorry about my mom. My mom is so wack. Eh. You know? And I am so much more chill. Oh, man, she used to be - way chill. - Yeah. You want a medical marijuana bar? They're 70% cacao. - Uh - Enjoy it. I mean Uh, wow, I cannot wait to partake in this later. Yes. Yes. So listen, um I totally get why you don't want to talk to the judge. I mean, who doesn't have a few hobbies that they don't want the law enforcement to know about? You know what I'm saying? - I got so many! - So the thing is this. You won't get locked up or anything, because the statute of limitations is up. Bam! - Whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah! - So it ain't that big of a deal, right? - Yeah! - Yeah! You know what I'm saying? - Yeah ! - Yeah ! No. - No? Yeah? - Got this strict policy if the police ask me anything I know nothin', like Jon Snow. Oh, come on, say something. I know you're mad. _ Okay, look I spoke to our lawyer, and we can appeal directly to the state's attorney and get the conviction cleared. Michael knows her through work, so I'm gonna call him now. Hey, Jane. It's important to note that this is what Michael expected Jane to say Michael, it's you. It's always been you. And here's what she said. Listen, I'm really sorry to bother you with this, but we're having an urgent issue with my grandma's - Green Card. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. _ No problem. I'll, uh I'll shoot the state's attorney an e-mail. Okay. Bye, Jane. Jane. As in Jane Villanueva? _ _ That's the gal who had her baby kidnapped last month, right? Mm-hmm. Strange story that was. Hard to believe. And something tells me she doesn't. _ He did it. We have a meeting tomorrow afternoon. Yes. That's great news! _ Ma, listen, I'll Google the crap out of this woman tonight, learn all about her so we can be prepared. Oh. It's Rafael. Maybe it's about Magda. - Hey. - Magda straight-up refused to add me to her visitors' list. - What? No. - But here's the thing: she said she would talk to you. - Why me? - There is a parole hearing coming up. Maybe you and your granny could say a few words on my behalf. Why would I ever help you? You must need something, hmm? Or why are you here? Because Petra is marrying Milos. You're lying. It's true. And she seems scared, and we wanted to help her. Can you think of anything Milos would be holding over her? Well, Magda could think of a few possibilities _ _ _ Nothing offhand. Petra said that you made up stories about him cheating. Why would you do that? First, I had mind open. Even though he act like stalker. _ - _ - Speak English. Practice for tourists. - Yes. Sorry, Mother. - I followed your daughter's music all over the city, before we even met. I will never forget when I saw her playing Schumann's Marchenbilder. My favorite piece. And to find the musician even more beautiful than the music. No, but that is viola piece. Ach, muj Buh, Cousin Dagmar, she's in trouble. She's stuck in Budapest, lost her wallet. ""I need two million Hungarian forints, cash preferred. Thank you."" That's not your cousin. It's me. My side business is Internet scam. I like to do prank. But also make money. Milos is Internet criminal. You should be very ""vary."" Very, very what? Very ""vary."" Not ""very, very."" I'm still not following. Very ""vary""! Oh. Very wary. That's what I said. Very ""vary."" Got it. I want you to listen to me, and I will tell you how you can help my daughter. Hmm? You spoke to my mother? Yes, and she had a good idea. Look, Milos is an Internet criminal. Oh, don't worry. Rafael's downstairs with him. _ Hey, um, can we talk? Talk or duel? Duel? Guns or knives? What are you talking about? Oh, you were kidding. Me, too. Okay, great. Let's talk. Download it, then copy his files, and hold it over him. For whatever he's holding over you. You don't have to tell me. Just use it. Y-You don't have to do this, Jane. I'll keep him away from Mateo. But there's two percent that's because I kind of care about you, Petra. In that ""I don't want you to marry a psycho"" kind of way. So Petra took the flash drive. She's doing it. Are you serious? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Okay. Uh, I can exhale. Yeah. So, listen So, I made this for you. Oh. He's changed so much, huh? Yeah. _ - No. - What? Don't tell me you're choosing Michael. Tell me anything, but do not tell me that. - Rafael - He's not a good guy, Jane. - You're wrong. - I'm not. He's shady. And he has it out for me. And you know he does. Why are you doing this? You're throwing away our family. Just go. _ Ah, yes. A date, you'll recall, we've seen before. And what about Petra? Will today be the day she escapes Milos for good? Petra? I have a gift for you. It's a Guarneri. The same as the one I gave you when we met. I know you sold it to come here. I haven't played in so long. Which is a travesty, Petra. And speaking of travesties All right, let's get going. We do not want to keep the state's attorney waiting. Aah! Mommy, don't eat that! _ What? Why? Why not? _ You're sure you can go to this meeting? _ _ Me, too. Totally normal. Okay. Maybe Zed was just selling counterfeit edibles. Just one thing, what is this meeting about again? I thought you said you felt normal. Normal. Nor mal. _ Normal. _ Is the coffee working at all? _ _ _ _ _ _ What's so funny? Nothing. Okay, Mom, you're the important one. Did the shower help? Yes. But, listen, I was thinking in there. I am pretty sure that this meeting is a trap. So here's how this is gonna work. - _ - I'll do all the talking, you just nod. Okay? Great. Okay, Mom, I'll introduce you, I'll talk about Zed, how you haven't gotten into any trouble. No, you can't just nod the whole time. Maybe you should give us some signal when we should stop? _ Mm. Yeah, they're not going to the meeting. Yes, I know she's very busy and she moved her schedule around. I'm really sorry. Okay, thanks. Bye. _ Hey, thanks for babysitting. Of course. How are they? Just hungry. And kind of annoying, frankly. Mm. Hey, are you okay? There's this Vine going around. Oh. The ""piece of me"" one? You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me? It's not that bad. I'm a laughingstock. _ Come in. What are you doing? Why are you getting married? Jane my life is complicated. Complicated? That's an understatement. Remember this? It was a handcrafted Guarneri. It was more valuable than my byt. Afterwards, Petra realized she'd misspoken. See, that day in Olomouc Milos had given her a Konner. So earlier today, when Milos presented her with a Guarneri, Petra wondered how they could have both made the exact same mistake. Unless Fine. You want the truth? I'm marrying Milos because he's rich. It should be noted, Petra didn't know where the bugs were. But she knew they were there. - What? - Yeah, please don't repeat that. It makes me look bad. Oh. Although I might finally be rich enough not to care. Remember, she had to sell it. Like Gérard Depardieu. But, hey, the fact that you cared that two percent thank you. It's more than I deserve. Look, if you ever need help Actually, yes, there is one thing. - Just make sure the tassels are even. - Okay. Ooh. Yeah, let me just fluff up some of these flowers. Aw. Perhaps it's stolen sperm under the bridge for these two at last? What is that? Uh, Security was handing it out. - Oh. Uh - Maybe it was seeing her father mocked like that, but Jane knew she had to help. The situation had become Toxic. This Circus couldn't go on. It was time to get to Work, Bitch. Oh, oh. It's a baby thing. Don't worry. Excuse me. Check, check. Sounds good. We're cool. Excuse me, Britney? You may not remember me. I'm Jane. Um, um you have a restraining order against my dad? Oh. I'll handle this. Look, Rogelio was out of line. Do you know how many poop emojis I've had to deal with today? And I apologize for that. He can be intense. And he's a lot of other things, but he's not a liar. And neither are you, Brit. Come on. Did you guys know each other? Come on. What happened? What happened is he betrayed me. And backstabbed me, like the backstabbing betrayer that he is. Can you be a little more specific? Just ask him what happened the last time we went shopping in Mexico City. - Huh. I forgot all about that. What did you do? I I tipped off the paparazzi. - What? - I was still a C-plus-Lister at the time and I knew that being photographed with Britney would help my career. Yes. How could you do that? I'm so sorry, Brit. Now that I'm mega famous, I understand what a mega transgression that was. I trusted you, Ro. I'm so ashamed. And I totally get why you changed the teleprompter. I didn't exactly change it, though. See, I was just sad about your betrayal and the teleprompter guy overheard, and I think he was trying to impress me. He was a real sweetie, you know? - Aw. - Yeah. Well, from the bottom of my broken heart, I'm sorry. And I hope that our friendship could be as strong as it once was. You know, I think it'll even be stronger. Stronger than yesterday. I'm on desk? Why? Because you let Nadine Hansen walk. You knew that we were tracking her. I'm talking about the first time you did it. It's about Nadine. Your old partner? It's that I let her go. Sorry, Cordero. An informant's came forward. Who? T-Tell me. Who was it? - _ - Is that thing on? Scott, I don't care. Look, he wants to remain anonymous. I gave him my word. _ Hmm. Well. She said she'd keep Milos away from Mateo, at least. What the hell, man? - Whoa! - Hey, get off me. - Hey. - Hold this. Milos. Petra. We are here on that most momentous of days. - You turned me in? Huh? - What are you talking about? - You turned me in! - Michael, calm down. Oh, no, this entitled ass cost me my job. Remember what I told you on the monitor, Jane? I, Milos, promise not to forsake you. - You let Nadine go? - Don't pretend you didn't know. And you knew this? I mean, yes, he told me These people kidnapped Mateo, Jane. - Don't pretend you didn't know this. - I didn't know! Stop, Michael, stop! Stop! No! Michael, no! No! Mateo. Are you okay? Oh, my God. Should be fine. Dr. Garcia said to bring him in tomorrow if it doesn't look better. How did this happen? I told you. That guy hates me. What? Did you do it? Excuse me? - You were there. - Of course I didn't do it. See, this this is why I said he's bad for us. He's making you doubt me. I'm sorry. But you still think I did it. _ Did what? Zed is gonna admit that he stole the ring. What? How? Admit what you did, or the masterpiece is toast. _ Jon Snow. Wow. Good job. _ You? No. I-I almost blew it for you. _ _ Wait, uh, what's June 12? The anniversary of your grandpa Mateo's death. Mommy. Ma, want to go eat at La Rosa tonight, maybe? Ma, come on, I know you can hear me. _ _ Yeah, well _ _ _ _ Stop. Ma, you've made it up to me a thousand times over. Oh, oh, it's okay. Yeah. Mommy's here. What happened to his arm? Michael and Rafael got into an awful fight. Like, a real, physical fight. And so Jane told them what happened. _ How ugly it got. And how she thought Rafael probably turned Michael in. Go ahead and take a seat. But I don't need to tell you that guy is not Rafael. Please state your name for the record. I'm Eric Wu and I'm here to talk about my friend Nadine Hansen. Oh. I-It it wasn't Rafael. What? I, uh I watched one of the interviews, and it was this guy, N-Nadine's friend. Oh, my God. I accused him. I'm so sorry, Jane. I-I screwed up. You know, the way I the way I feel about Rafael It-it clouded my judgment. And mine. And that man you attacked tonight, the man that clouds your judgment? That's Mateo's father. I know. I-I know. I'm gonna I-I'll work on my anger. How? Think about what happened tonight. Mateo was hurt Michael. He was hurt. And at that moment, Jane saw it. _ Which is why we won't work. Please. You should go. You okay? I will be. But you're getting your Green Card, so let's focus on that, okay? - Okay. - Okay. _ _ And smiling up at us. Look. Oh Your first smile. Look at you. It was a day the Villanueva women would always remember, because Jane meticulously documented it in her baby book. Oh. It was also a day Petra would always remember. Good night, Milos. Petra, there is something I must tell you. The marriage it wasn't just about tax shelter. Yes, I know, Milos, you have feelings for me. Yes. But I also have grenades in these boxes. What? Wedding provided perfect cover to bring them in. Oh, don't worry, I have buyer. And now that we are married, you cannot testify against me. Spousal privilege. It is, how you say, a ""vin-vin""? Wow. Talk about dropping a bomb. - Cordero. - Sir, I'm sorry. That you broke into my office? What? No. Stop lying, Cordero, I saw you. Give me your badge and your gun. Come on. Now get out. Drive. Okay, you know what? This is way too stressful. I'm out."
"All righty, here we go. Jane, you recall, was torn, between her baby's daddy Rafael, and her ex-fiancÃ©, Detective Michael Cordero. And guess what? She chose Michael. - Until this happened. - You turned me in! Michael, calm down! Only problem, he was wrong It wasn't Rafael. - I am so sorry, Jane. - You should go. Oh, and to make matters worse, Michael was fired and then this happened. Drive. Also under the gun, Petra. Remember how she stole Rafael's last sperm sample and turkey-basted herself? Well, her ex, Milos, blackmailed her into marrying him. What she didn't bargain for I also have 2,000 live-fire hand grenades in these boxes. Wedding provided perfect cover to bring them in. I know! So let's go, because time's a-ticking. They say with children, the days feel like years. You can do it, Janie. And the years Hurry, Mom! I can't be late for my first day of junior high. I'm coming. Well, they feel like days. _ Dr. Garcia said he should be totally fine. - She doesn't even think he'll scar. - Good. You feel better? Yeah. Sort of. You don't think he'll be scarred emotionally, will he? She's referring, of course, to the events of last night. _ He's the best smiler ever. Oh, I picked up the pictures for the baby book. Ah, yes, the famous baby book. - _ - Jane's meticulous record of Mateo's milestones. And for our own record keeping, Jane was grappling with a milestone of her own. _ Jane? It's gonna take time to get over him. Yeah, I know. Just got to keep pushing forward. So, what do you think, for this afternoon? Does it say ""cool"" but still, like, legitimately literary? Very cool, very literary. Another milestone: grad school orientation. Okay, but it's not too academic, right? Because I don't want to seem like a square. _ - _ - Road trip? Hmm. I was pretty sure she was gonna kill him. _ Chip? _ Does this mean you'll work with me? I still haven't decided. I don't know if I trust you. Sorry, could we check something real quick? Okay, here's where we left off. Drive. I'm sorry. My bad. It seems there was more. Why'd you call me? Because Sin Rostro cost me everything. And I can't rest knowing she's out there. You said you worked for her because she threatened your family. If that's true, help me catch her. You don't have to trust me. You just have to work with me. What do you say? Yes. Michael got into my head. And I believed him and not you, and I'm really sorry. Mr. Aguilar is here. Uh, thank you. Send him in. You ready? Yes. Uh, just real quick what exactly does Estate Planning Entail? Estate Planning Entails thinking and preparing for Mateo's future. We aim to eliminate all uncertainty. Well, now you're speaking my language. She does like to be prepared. _ Okay, the basics: Custody. Jane, you're dead. You want Rafael to raise Mateo, right? - Uh, oh, yes. - Let's say you're in a really bad car accident, on life support. Still Rafael? - Yeah. - Gotcha. And do you want to stay on life support, or do you want to be taken off, if you're a total vegetable. I mean, I guess taken off. B-But not too soon. Standard's about a month. Okay, let's say you're both killed in a car accident. Wow, this guy's grim. Then who gets him? My mom, right? And would Mom be in charge of Mateo's trust fund? Hmm? Trust fund. It's sizeable. And in the event of Rafael's death, he would come into about Uh, what is it now, 40? Yeah, that's about right. Forty ? Million. Give or take. Observe Jane, trying not to freak out. Makin' it rain! _ You're seriously complaining about too much money? - You knew he was rich. - Yeah, not that rich. And that kind of money's a huge responsibility. I don't want it to screw Mateo up. - I want him to stay grounded. - Jane! Look. This is just so he knows how important he is. Okay, first team in! Selfie. My last day as Santos. _ _ _ Well, I told him that I needed to look over the terms of the trust, which I do. Oh. - Shh, shh-shh. - We're rolling. All right, you're bursting to say your vows and make love, and action. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And freeze! Doubles in. _ Ro and Luciana hate each other so much they won't touch. And kiss. I just hope they're done by 2:00. I said 1.9. These are only worth 1.7. Ah, yes, when we last left Petra, you'll recall her new husband had dropped a bomb on her. Danek. I assure you, this is top-of-the-line merchandise. Or 2,000 hand grenades, to be exact. Now, Milos is asking for 1.9, you're willing to pay 1.7. Is there perhaps a middle ground? _ _ Fine, 1.8. And I sleep with your wife. Milos! Stop, the bombs. Deal is off. _ He would have taken the bombs. We do not negotiate with terrorists. I find new buyer. Well, how long did it take you to find Danek? Eight months. I can't wait eight months. I mean, do you know how long that is? I have some idea. _ Time, it creeps in here. Plus, I think the Russian red-haired lady in the kitchen is trying to poison me. I'm sorry, sweetheart, you were talking. I'm just having a really hard pregnancy. I know, I wish I was out so I could help you. I really wish you were out too, Mother. Well there might be a way. Ooh, vat is the vay? Cut! And that's a series wrap on The Passions of Santos. So a sincere thank you to the best and most wonderful crew in the business. Thank you, grips, for everything you've gripped. Uh-uh. Gaffers, thank you for all your gaffes. Best boy, well, you are the best, obviously. And on and on, you know, all of you. And when I choose my next job, the follow-up to the legendary Santos, I promise I will take you all with me, be Rogelio, that won't be necessary. Because the entire crew is joining me in my next telenovela, the sweeping historical epic Fernando e Isabel. Sorry, Ro, they roll right into production. Grip number two, how could you? And you'll never guess who's playing Fernando. _ _ I know, I feel really bad, but I have to go because of orientation. You're good; give me Mateo and go. Go. Oh, baby, oh. Okay. Aah Aah, aah Oh, my goodness, oh, my goodness. Is it terrible? Yeah, you want to trade outfits? Definitely not. _ No. Not on my watch. Wardrobe. Which brings us here, now, - _ - to Jane's big milestone. And I think ultimately everything I want to express comes from that early childhood trauma. And all the heroin I used to do. Whoa, this is intense. I think Jane was anticipating more of a wine-and-cheese mixer kind of thing. Sorry. So sorry. We'll give you a second to join us. Okay, thank you. _ You must be Jane Gloriana. You might be wondering why Jane isn't using her last name. See, she had a pretty significant Google problem. _ _ _ _ Okay, that last one's not so bad. Yep. And I just want to apologize for being late. That is so unlike me. Oh, and I want to say I'm sorry for missing the beginning of your story, because it sounds so intense. And interesting. If you're tethered to your electronic leash, then you're not present, are you? Oh, I'm really sorry, it' just ""Men have become tools of their tools."" _ - _ - Henry David Thoreau. So, Jane, tell us what you hope to gain from grad school. Oh, I want to finish my novel. Well, if you'd have been here on time, you would have heard me say that I'm not here to help you finish your novel. I'm here to help you grow as a writer. That sounds great too. _ _ Okay, mommy or school? I'm really sorry. I have to take this. Hello, this is Jane, is everything okay? Hi, there. Is Mateo missing a hat? Because we found one in our waiting room. Nope, not us. Thanks. _ Well, it is a milestone. You should know we've jumped a month. - _ - Like I said, time flies! And Jane, BTW, had really doubled down on school. _ _ Professor Chavez? Do you have a sec to talk about my piece? I wrote extensive notes. Oh, I know. I feel like I owe you a new pen. No? Okay. I just um, you write that ""there's a predictability to the love story."" And there is, yeah. But that's kind of one of the conceits of the genre, right? That's not license to be derivative. Look, you have potential. But it just feels like I don't know a first draft. Rushed. You might be right. I mean, with a new baby, it's hard to focus. That's understood. That's why the writer's retreat next month will be great for you. Like an away from home retreat? Gotcha. And wait, just-just, just asking, um is this a mandatory thing, technically? This is grad school, Jane. Nothing's mandatory. You chose to be here. Which she knew was true, after all.  Where, oh, where is the big brown bear?   Did he climb a tree?   Did he scrape his knee?   Did he count to nine? Did he climb the vine?  Let's check in on some milestones, shall we? First, Mateo's - _ -  Did he climb a tree?  - _ -  Did he scrape his knee?   Did he count to nine?  - _ -  Did he climb a vine?   Where, oh, where is the big brown bear?   Did you look, can you hear   Is the brown bear near?  And Rafael - _ -  Did he run off in a hurry?  - _ -  Wait, stop! What's that sound?  - _ -  Everybody turn around  - _ -  Where, oh, where is the big brown bear?   Did you look, can you hear  And, of course, our Jane. - _ -  Is he lost, is he worried?  - _ -  Did he run off in a hurry?  - _ -  Wait, stop! What's that sound?  - _ -  Everybody turn around   Look right there, it's the big brown bear   He did not get lost   But he ate up all my applesauce.  Wow, that new choreography is overly complicated, am I right? It's only because you haven't been here all month. We've been learning it in sections. Oh. Yeah. - We've missed you. - I know. Summer school, now grad school the work is intense. I don't know how you do it. Hey, did Charlie ever recover from the great lovey meltdown of 2015? You gotta tell Jane, it's funny. It wasn't funny. I dropped Charlie at his dad's and I forgot his lovey. And he screamed for the full hour it took me to go home, get it, drive back to his dad's So I heard that story, I went out and I bought ten loveys. - You did not! - That's hilarious. I did, I was panicked! I want loveys everywhere. It should be noted that these two had reached a few new relationship milestones this past month, as well. _ _ Let me ask you something. Hmm? Do you like Mateo? I want him to stay grounded. I just it seems pretty austere. ""Money for health and education costs, ""with everything else left in savings - until he's 50""? - He needs to learn the value of hard work. - Won't he learn that from us? - Well, yeah, but it's different. - What is? - Growing up knowing that you can just buy ten backup loveys if something goes wrong. Wow. - I just mean - No, it's fine. I'll return the loveys. I should probably take this. You know, you don't have to starve to be a good person. Hello? - _ - Please, Mum, may I have some more? Hi. Do you have a second? Ah, yes, Petra. She, too, had reached some milestones. _ _ _ Mateo's wearing the onesie I got him! He looks so cute! Yeah, thanks again. Huh. I get the feeling she's buttering Jane up. Sorry, I have to eat every Is there something that you wanted, Petra? Look my pregnancy's been difficult. Well, my mother is up for parole soon, and I was wondering if maybe your family would support her release? Ah, this must be vat Magda vas talking about. She pushed my grandmother down the stairs. I know. And I-I get why you would say no. Um But I'm pregnant and overwhelmed by the Grenades. Baby. That's a hard no. I must pass on every projects you have presented. Because I have found my next project. _ _ It is a perfect follow-up to Santos. A telenovela version of Mad Men. We'll call it Hombres Locos, no? The original is a masterpiece, but mine will move much faster it's a fasterpiece, if you will. I will play Don Juan Draper, somewhat like Jon Hamm, but very good-looking. First episode, bam! Don Juan shoots his wife Beatriz and sets off in search of his one true love. Wow. What can I say? We're really interested. We'll give him a limited budget, he'll drive it into the ground and then we'll Heather Locklear him. Put him on whatever show needs a ratings boost. Mateo had a nice little growth spurt. And he's meeting all his milestones. That's great. Now, I do have to tell you something. And I don't want you to panic. What's going on? Mateo's got a fairly pronounced case of what we call plagiocephaly. And that sounds worse than it is. Basically, it means he's got a flat head. - A flat head? - Why? Well, he's probably spending a little too much time laying flat on his back. Because babies need to sleep on their backs, we really need to be vigilant about tummy time. Look, it's largely cosmetic. But Mateo's condition is pronounced, so there could be some visual disturbances, dental problems Which is why some parents choose a helmet. A helmet? To reshape the head. It has to be custom-fitted, so Mateo would wear it 23 hours a day for about three months. Oh, my God. I know it sounds like a long time. But trust me, time flies. Anyway, talk it over. But if you're going to move forward, you should have him fitted soon. They take a while to make. Uh, okay. Uh, we'll talk it over, we'll research it. Yes later. I know you have to go. What could be more important than his child's doctor appointment? Ah. His other child's doctor appointment. _ _ - Maybe we should reschedule. - No. We stay. I can't take your money. Fine, go ahead with baby picture. Okay, so that is a little girl. And that's another little girl. Wow! You're having twins! No. No, I'm not. Yeah. Yeah, you are. Do they run in the family? No! No, definitely not! Twins? For those of you keeping track at home, that's now three children for Rafael. And zero sex. _ What is she doing? - _ - Come on. _ _ _ _ Oh! No I guess they decided on the helmet. _ _ _ Oh, I'm missing it _ - _ - Oh, come on So, yes, a few milestones of note, here. _ _ _ My love! Oh! Oh, Petra! Let me look at you. - _ - So, yes. - _ - A few milestones of note here, too. _ Wow! We thick around middle, huh? Yes, I'm pregnant with twins. Yes, I know, but it's still early. We don't want to be house. Mother, it's not constructive when you say things that diminish me. And right now, I'm-I'm really trying to-to create an atmosphere of positivity around myself. What are you talking about? I've started seeing a therapist. It's been a stressful month and Dr. Klein has really helped me reframe things in a, in a positive light. Everything happens for a reason. I'm pregnant with twins. Therefore, Jane took pity on me, helped get you out. Therefore, you can help to get rid of the grenades. What is that? Is that ? Is that a tear? Ah just to scare peoples off. Really? Yes, really. Come. Mommy help you get rid of Milos. And therapist. So I told him, like, I will get rid of you. - Mm-mm. - Hey. - Hey, what's up? - Hey! - How are you? - Good. It's nice to be out here, away from everything. But I'm sorry, go on. You were talking. Oh. Sorry, it's, uh, weird. I was talking pretty personally about my ex-boyfriend and we just, like, don't really know each other. - Wesley! - You are being so rude. What? It's true. I mean, we're constantly telling personal stories in class, and there's no reciprocity. Seriously, just stop. I feel overexposed. We know nothing personal about her. Okay, fine. Do you want to know something personal? My son just got a medical helmet put on his head, and I couldn't be there. A helmet why? Because he has a flat head from spending too much time on his back, while I've been writing badly, apparently. So I'm failing at being a writer and a mom. Well, I feel better. Finally, some reciprocity. So, what's the rest of your story, Jane Gloriana? Uh, well, for one thing, that's not my real name And so Jane told them the whole shebang. Highlights included: accidental insemination, a rich, hot baby daddy and a broken engagement, Mateo's kidnapping, That's it in a nutshell. Wow. Well, nice to meet you. _ _ And maybe it was the fact that she'd opened up, but that night, Jane's writing started flowing, too. _ _ _ _ Oh, wait, that one's real. _ _ No Okay, this isn't good. Boobs really bursting. _ _ _ _ _ Cut! We'll go tighter just on my eyes. Rogelio. Hello my favorite network big shot. Great to see you. Can we talk? As producer, director or star? Producer. Okay, as producer, the director is great. We still have a lot of shots left to make our day, so Oh, I'll be quick. You're out of money and way behind schedule. We're pulling the plug. What? The plug? Thank you. So, are you ready to see the cutest little man ever? Oh! Oh, my God, ever! Oh, oh, oh! He should be up any minute and be ready to eat. Okay, I'll wait to pump then. So, did your lawyer call back again? Yes. - Does he want to kill me? - No. A direct quote from his lawyer: ""I want to kill her."" Oh, I'm just still thinking through all the different scenarios. I mean, we can give him money under certain conditions. I know, but here's the thing. No matter how we slice it, Mateo's rich. I know. It's just so weird. Oh. I'm raising a rich kid. And-and that's just not the way I grew up. You know, and you said that your childhood was all screwed up. Yeah, but not because I had money. I was screwed up, because of my family. And that's why I'm fighting so hard for ours. I don't want to complicate things. It would actually uncomplicate things. It wouldn't. Why? Because I'm not over him yet. I'm sorry, I know that's not what you want to hear. _ No, no, it's, um, it's good that I know. I'm gonna feed him. He's really mad. Sweetie, what's wrong? It's probably the helmet. He just feels weird. Keep trying. Maybe he's not hungry. No, this is his hungry scream! Just give me the bottle! Here, here, here, here. Oh, my God. He's weaned off me. Where's Mateo? - _ - Ah, there he is! And So, is he still not nursing? No, just me and the pump. - Up every three hours. - Ah. Well, it's nice to have you back in class. Not that we mind having the occasional daddy. I know, Rafael's way better at the hand choreography. So, you guys are definitely not together, right? Um, no why? - This is awkward. - What is? Sometimes it-it feels like there's kind of a vibe between me and Rafael. Oh. Is it weird that I like, I'm even bringing it up? I No, it's not. Are you sure? Yes. Yeah. I mean, I only hesitated because I think it's weird that you even think that it was weird because it's not at all. It's - Whew, like - Okay. Of course it's weird they have a vibe. What does that even mean?! That they get along well and there's chemistry. - Hilarious. - Agreed. Well, these two have gotten chummy. I know, I can't be weird about it. I have to rise above it. You're human and he's hot. But let me ask you this. If you were with Michael, would you care who your baby daddy was dating? No, I wouldn't. So? Look, you're doing the right thing by keeping it platonic with Rafael. I mean, after everything you've told me about his insane family I know, it's, like, the curse of the Solanos. What's going on?! They're making fun of me on television! _ You know the sincerest form of flattery revenge! Which I will get in the ratings once Hombres Locos premieres. But, Dad, it was shut down. Well, I have secured a private investor. Which I was going to announce when I saw this atrocity! And speaking of atrocities Good-bye, Milos. Have a safe trip. Sorry to be leaving you, my pregnant princess, but it's better I find a buyer from Prague, so I don't kill your mother. She's driving me insane. Oh, good, their plan is working. That's because you eat like animal. And you don't pick up your socks. And as soon as he is gone, they'll ditch the grenades. Ah, good. Ivan. Ivan the man they accidentally took hostage? Hello again, ladies. What's he doing here? He's staying with you, sweetheart. To make sure you and your cow of a mother don't get rid of my bombs. _ And speaking of cows, the past month, there's been a lot of this Hey. - Pumping? - Always. - How'd he go down? - Oh, easy. I mean, I rocked him for, like, ten minutes and he was out. _ So, you know Charlie's mom from music class? She kind of I don't know, she kind of asked me out. Yeah, she actually asked me first if it was weird. Oh. And is it? Of course not. Okay. That's great. Anyway, I'm done, so I should head to bed. I got to be up in two hours and 40 minutes. Okay, all right, good night. Bye. Jane? Jane! To fall asleep while someone's reading their work? I know, I feel terribly and-and I promise it won't happen again. There are a lot of people that want to be here and you need to prove you're one of them. Mm-hmm. Until then you're on academic probation. And she thought a C- was bad. _ Oops. My mistake. - _ - I'm exhausted just looking at her. Jane, as you can imagine, has been burning the candle at both ends. _ _ _ Oh, Mateo, I know, I know. It's okay, Mr. Sweetface. I got you. Come on. Okay, come here. Shush, let's find your lovey Oh, ow, Mommy's booby! _ _ Have you seen his lovey? Which brings us here to Jane just plain burning up. _ I'm fine. His lovey, Abuela! His lovey? Um _ It's here. So you're pretty sick, huh? Apparently. What are you holding on your boob? A hot diaper, because I have a clogged duct. And mastitis, apparently, which means that my boob has the flu and it feels like glass shards are shooting out when I pump. Gotcha. Uh, maybe you should stop. - What? - Pumping. I planned to nurse for a year. Nurse, not pump. And you got to be able to change your plan, right? I mean, if it's not working. Just shut up and go away. What? I'm serious. Shut up and go away. You okay? Yeah. She was just a little Bitchy? I know. She's the worst when she's sick. Uh, what? _ I can hear you! And I hate all of you! I hate to say this, but I have to leave. What?! Why? Milos was arrested for Internet scamming in Prague. Which Petra knew, of course, since she and her mom had been copying his files and sending them to the Czech authorities for the past month. I have to go, see who I can bribe. Yes. Hey. What are you doing back here? Jill was tired after the charity gala, and I just wanted to make sure you were feeling better. I am. And look, I'm sorry about before. I've heard of mean drunks, but I-I know it's weird. - It's, like, a fever thing, I think. - Uh-huh. But what you said Don't you think it's selfish to stop pumping? I mean, what if Mateo's IQ is a point lower? Or-or he gets more colds? Look, with everything happening with you in school full-time and not sleeping You really think I should stop? Even with all the benefits? Mateo is eating solids now, and he's doing great. And I just would like to see you start feeling great, too. Okay. _ Oh, my God, I'm so relieved. I mean, it'll take a month to wean, but the end is in sight. Finally! - _ - I'm so glad to be rid of these things. Someone could have been killed. Oops, one more. Oh, my God. I think the babies are kicking. Wait, where is the pin? _ Mother, please reconsider. _ _ _ Let's do something for Thanksgiving. What I have to be grateful for? My hook? Petra? Oh. You okay? Yeah. How's your mother? Slightly better. What? I know. I know what you want. Yeah. Who taught you to do all the uh, baby stuff? My mom's not exactly nurturing. Eh, forget it. You were a natural, I'm sure. Oh, my God, no. Not at all. Oh, I felt like I knew nothing. I still do, actually. But it's like he's been with me the whole time. It's weird. I don't feel prepared. Yeah, well, you never really are. You know, it's a hard balance. It's kind of like you learn on the job. And just when you think you've figured it out, something changes. And then you have to do everything different. You'll be okay. So I hear you two finally have a plan. A two-part plan, in fact. Part one: to review the plan every three years, 'cause we plan to reevaluate and readjust the plan as need be. Gotcha. And does part two have something I could write down? Yes, we've decided to attach Mateo's trust fund to a charity. So for every dollar he gets, he has to give a dollar away. I'd like to thank my parents, of course, - _ - for instilling in me the desire to give back. Thank you to my mentors, Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie, whose fight to make sure all girls receive an education led me to the Peace Corps and Let Girls Learn. I'm here at the UN because more than 62 million girls do not have access to an education I'm sorry, I have to go pee-pee. And speaking of a huge relief Well, did the Telemasivo execs like Hombres Locos? They loved it. Wow, that's a shock. First of all, they thought it was hilarious. I was, like, ""It's a comedy, but okay."" Then they say I was like a young uh oh, ""Desi Arnaz."" Remember to Google that guy. Whew. You okay? Just relieved. The Passions of Santos was the most popular telenovela on Earth. To follow that up, scrutiny will be intense. Aw, I-I didn't realize you were feeling such pressure. I hide my nerves incredibly well. It's one of my most underrated talents. Helmet's off. Muy lindo. - Yay, no helmet. - Yay! Which brings us to a big old milestone. _ Oh, and also _ And finally _ Well, this year is easy. I'm thankful for Mateo. All day, every day. _ Health and hair. Always health and hair. And I'm thankful I got to see how hard you work, Rogelio. It's inspired me to get after it, my singing career, this year. Go, Mom! Rafael? This. Grateful for all of it. That must be Petra. I left Mateo's lovey at Rafael's office, and she said she'd bring it. It should be noted, after the great lovey debacle of last month, there were now three backup loveys in this very house. I have the lovey. Thank you so much. He wouldn't have been able to sleep. You know what, come in. Since you're here and there's so much food. Oh, no, no, I'm fine. Really, I'd like it. Come in. Yeah, okay. Thank you. And thus Petra too was grateful. And briefly, all was right. _ It's my lawyer. Probably calling to rave about the show. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh, uh-huh. And who exactly is this Matthew Weiner? _ Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And what does a ""cease and desist"" mean, anyway? Stop. No more dishes. We'll finish tomorrow. So, can I ask you a question? That's rhetorical, right? 'Cause you're gonna ask me anyway. What happened between you and Jill? I bumped into her this morning at the supermarket, and she acted all weird. I told you We fizzled out. It was more than ""fizzled out"" weird. Okay, do you remember the night I realized you're actually a very mean person? Oh, my God, seriously? Anyway, as cranky and stinky and mean as you were I hope this story has a point. I realized that I would still rather be with you. At your worst. So Jill just wasn't the person. And in that moment, Rafael saw a window opening for him. It's getting hot in here, huh? Go on a date with me. Just one. Say yes. And maybe it was the turkey, or the first glass of wine post-pumping, or just the fact that enough time had finally passed but Jane said Yes. Officer Barnett. Michael. We need to talk. No, don't be sorry. I'm just sad you can't make it for dessert. I know, I'm just stuck at my mom's. Bye, Jane. Sorry. Where were we? Are you sure no one's gonna find out we spoke? No way ""anonymous sources."" Come on, for a thousand bucks, you better have good stuff. Trust me, I got plenty of dirt on the Solanos. I mean, after everything you've told me about his insane family I know, it's like the curse of the Solanos. That's not fair the Solanos aren't cursed. In fact, there's Petra, and she's on a bit of an upswing. Magda. Looking good. Here's the thing. Milos knows you two set him up. He will forgive Petra, his wife, I suppose. But will Petra forgive you when she finds out what else you're hiding? It was accident? Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's on the hook for that one."
"What's up, my peeps? Let me catch you up. Jane's whole love triangle blew up dramatically, because Michael thought Rafael went to the cops - and snitched on him. - You turned me in! - Only problem - Stop! No! - Please state your name for the record. - I'm Eric Wu. It wasn't Rafael. And so Jane said good-bye to Michael. I know. Super sad. Also sad Michael got fired. - And then this happened. - Drive. And so he was gone for six long months, and Jane moved on. So Rafael took a shot. Go on a date with me. Yes. Also taking a shot - Rogelio. - What? His telenovela version of Mad Men was a comedic triumph. However, - he ran into a roadblock. - What does, uh, ""cease and desist"" mean anyway? Oh. And remember Petra? She and Jane actually had - a little breakthrough. - I have the lovey. And Jane even invited her to Thanksgiving. Nice, right? Not so nice? She came home to this. It vas accident? Well, it is Black Friday, and 'tis the season for more drama. So let's dive in. Even when she was young, - Jane Gloriana Villanueva - Tyler, no! Knew the value of hard work. But her first ever babysitting job turned out to be really hard. Potentially life-threatening. Fine. Five minutes but then I'm reading you A Christmas Carol. You'll love it. I mean, there's ghosts from the past and the present and Hey. So, how's it going? Oh, thank God the Villanueva women only have girls. Yeah. I had a feeling about that kid. What's the inside of the house like? Oh, my God, Mom, it's, like, my dream house. There's a white picket fence No. No, I don't care how good the babysitter is. - It's not the same as family. - _ Plus, I can't imagine leaving Mateo with a stranger. Speaking of ghosts from the past _ I get it, but if we don't hire a sitter, we'll be going on our date sometime around Presidents' Day. America's least romantic holiday. - What about next week, Ma? - Oh, Christmas dance recital rehearsal, remember? - I could do it tonight. - Nah, my grad school Christmas party's tonight. You really want to drink with the same people you're locked in a room with five days a week? You'd have so much more fun drinking with me. Yes. But I have to go. Dr. Lorraine Bolton's gonna be there. Seriously? Author of the The New York Times bestseller Inspirational TED Talk speaker - with two million hits? - Any relation to Michael Bolton? Ooh. I've heard of him. Anyway, she is the most in demand professor in our department because she is brilliant. - And fabulous, and I need her to be my advisor. - Got it. Did you ask your dad to babysit? Yeah. He said he's busy with Hombres Locos. He say anything else? No. Nothing about your theme song. - He hates it. - He doesn't! He's slammed I'm sure he hasn't even listened to it yet. The song is amazing. Seriously, you're our very own Michael Bolton. Jane, listen to me. Okay, two-hand grab. This is serious. I really think that we should hire a babysitter. I will even background check the background-checking company. What do you think? It would be nice to have someone to help out when we're all stretched out a little thin. Okay, I'll meet some of the candidates. But I am making no promises. _ _ Can I help you find something? No, thank you. Most of us are experts. Okay, since this is your first Black Friday, - let's go over some rules. - _ I just want to say how honored I am - to be included in this Villanueva - First rule: - no chitchat. - Rule number two: never dig in the bins; the bins are for suckers. Nobody needs a 12-pack of hand sanitizer. _ _ _ _ - She said - Got it. Don't go looking in anybody else's cart. Okay, then. Well, this'll be our meeting spot. I'll see everybody in an hour. Clear eyes, full carts, - let's shop! - Yes! Oh, wow. There's a ghost Jane didn't expect to see this Christmas. _ - Hi. - Oh, hey. So, how have you been? Um, pretty good, actually. I did some traveling. Good. Yeah. I heard that you lost your job. - I was worried. - I'm sorry, I actually can't do this. I'm just not interested in catching up. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, just, - you know, I've moved on, so - Yes. - I'm sorry. Of course. - Yeah. Hey, Michael. Take care. You okay? Mm-hmm. I mean, I get why Michael didn't want to talk. He's moved on. But it's just so weird. Okay, so what about this for the Christmas party? Note the riding boots. Dr. Bolton is a champion equestrian, so I'm trying to pique her interest without having to answer too many questions about horses. You look great. Very advisable. - Mm, mm, mm. - Now, go get her. Yes, yes, yes. Hi, baby! You ready to go to Daddy's? Huh, Mr. Mateo? Who is my best boy? Yes, you are. Yes, you are! Can we stop that? Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Hey, Petra. Oh! Jane. Hi! Yeah. Still haven't gotten used to the fact that these two are friendly. Hey, uh, thanks again for the Thanksgiving leftovers. I think my babies are now 20% stuffing. - Then again, it's only been a day. - Oh Of course. See you later. What's with all the ice? Oh. Swollen ankles. You know how pregnancy is. - Yeah. Here, let me help. - No, I'm good. - Oh, come on, I can grab one. - I'm fine. - Don't worry about it. - You're pregnant. I can do it. - Jane, I'm fine! - Oh. Well, that was a little cold. - _ - Is that enough? We'll find out. - _ - Okay. Enough enough of this. We need to go to the police, Mother, tell them the truth. You went to slap him. You forgot about the hook. I just got out of jail for aggravated assault. Do you think they're going to believe me? They'll lock me up, throw away the key. I can't do this, Mother. I-I can't be an accomplice. You tell the police and I will take you down with me. Don't worry. I have a plan. I wanted to say good-bye. I'm taking a quick trip to Los Angeles. Be sure to follow me on Periscope, Twitter and Instagram. Or TMZ. I'm sure they're going to be all over me at LAX. Geez, Rogelio, if you hated my theme song that much, you could just tell me you don't have to leave the state. What?! No, no. Xiomara your theme song was like a thousand tiny angels tickling my eardrums. Really? You loved it? - Why didn't you say anything? - I'm sorry. I've been the tiniest bit focused on myself lately. But know that I sent your song to Telemasivo, because I think it would be perfect for Hombres Locos. Problem is, there might not be an Hombres Locos. Which is just plain loco. What? Why? There's a legal issue with the original Mad Men. However, I tracked down the person capable of untangling this mess, so I must fly to Hollywood to speak to him, bigwig to bigwig. And speaking of bigwigs _ _ Okay, I've done my research on Dr. Bolton, and I have five anecdotes to casually slip into any conversation in order to evoke a natural and spontaneous connection between us. Love it. What a fun-slash-creepy way to begin your relationship. - _ - Ay. You remember this poser, right? _ _ Hey, Wesley! Ugh. He makes me so mad! Babe, just relax, okay? Bolton is gonna love you. Okay. Here goes. Oh, nope, never mind. I'll wait till Dr. Doom has cleared out. _ The man hates me. He doesn't hate you. You haven't seen my latest evaluation. I'm forwarding it to you right now. Seriously, have another glass of wine. You need to chill out. Yeah. That sounds like the weirdest orphans' Thanksgiving ever. Was Rafael's crazy sister there? No. Luisa was at this place in South America. The Osho Ashram. The what, now? Mm, mm. This place that she disappears to when she feels like she might fall off the wagon. Ah. Okay, he's leaving. I'm going in. - Jane. - Professor Chavez. It should be noted that Jane was armed with a carefully researched list - _ - of spontaneous and funny anecdotes. - _ - Also, she was kind of drunk. My cousin's actually the mayor of Savannah. I wrote my thesis on Lima. Lady Royal bucked me so hard I lost my sense of smell for a year. Je le fais souvent I was traumatized. The nuns used to check the length of my skirt with a credit card. Well, that's not very interesting. Get in there, Jane! I actually taught at a Catholic high school last year, and I had a pretty crazy exp _ _ _ _ I-I am so sorry. Here, let me help. Uh Oh Please stop. Just stay away from me. Well, there's your funny anecdote. No drinking and e-mailing. Mom, you don't understand. I have to apologize. I pawed at her boob. And then somehow I squeezed! Good. You finally got some action. Now, make your case the old-fashioned way. Also making his case, - _ - Rogelio or trying, anyway. So as Don Juan Draper closes the cigarette account, Rogelito opens up a carton to celebrate, no? but instead of cigarettes, it's filled with cocaine! Then Rogelito starts to snort the cocaine, when bam! Don Juan Draper shoots him in the head! Then he turns coolly to camera and says, ""I'd like to sell the world some coke."" Fade out. End of pilot. No. And speaking of bad news I've counseled Nadine's family since they joined our church Yeah, I know. I can't believe she's gone. You said you worked for Sin Rostro because she threatened your family if that's true, help me catch her. Help me. I'm not a cop anymore. We don't have to play by the rules. We're also here to celebrate her life. It's a tragedy Rose was supposed to be here. What's going on? Nadine, did you set me up? No. No. I swear. - You did. You-you set me up. - I didn't! We're also here to celebrate her life. It's a tragedy to have to mourn her death. Wait a minute. This guy looks familiar. - Please state your name for the record. - I'm Eric Wu, and I'm here to talk about my friend, Nadine Hansen. Oh. It's the guy who turned Michael in. What are you doing here, man? No one needs to be reminded - about what happened. - I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Also feeling rather sorry? Our Jane. Hello? Dr. Bolton? Okay. Okay, just leave the note on her desk. What? _ Okay, no problem. Write another one. Seriously? What kind of writer doesn't have a pen on her desk? Excuse me? Oh. Dr. Bolton. Uh, I'm sorry. I-I was not digging through your desk. Well, I was, but only to write you an apology, and now that it appears I've broken into your office, there are two things I need to apologize for. Damn it! Oh, no. No. Th-Th-The cafeteria ladies in the student union will give you a bag of ice and a pinch so your milk doesn't go bad. I have the same pumping bag. - You're nursing? - Well, I I stopped two days ago, and I hadn't had a drink in forever, and that's why last night I was just - and then I, you know - Well, that's good to know. I'm going to New York this weekend, and I was planning to pump and dump. Yeah, don't have that second glass of wine. And there it was a natural and spontaneous connection. Look, I might be pushing my luck here but you're part of the reason I applied, and if I'm gonna be at school and not at home with my kid, I want to at least make it worth it. She said yes! - To being your advisor? - No! Not yet! To reading my material. But it's a start. Okay, you ready? I'm nauseous. We won't stop looking until we find the perfect person. Plus, I bought that nanny cam. - We can use it - No. If I'm gonna hire a sitter, then I need to be able to trust her. Which brings us here, now to Babysitting Idol! How do you handle difficult situations, like a baby crying uncontrollably? Coddling babies is creating a generation that refuses to grow up. At some point, they've just got to toughen up and face real life. If you want something, ask me for it. Don't just sit there crying like a baby. Next. So, we usually follow an eat, sleep, play, change routine. - Oh, babies don't need diapers. - Hmm? Have you heard of Elimination Communication? I learn the baby's cues, he learns my cues, and then we hold them over the potty, and Psh, psh, psh, psh, psh. - Next. - psh, psh, psh So, you've done this before? Next! How long have you been caring for children, Chepa? First two of my own, then I spent 18 years as a pediatric nurse. When I retired, I missed being with the little ones, so I started babysitting. _ What's your favorite age to care for, and why? Each age brings its own joys and challenges. _ Where are you from? Frutillar, Chile. _ How do you feel about speaking both Spanish and English to the baby? I prefer Spanish. - _ - Only because Mateo will be hearing English the majority of the time. But, of course, it's your choice. _ _ _ I'll admit, I'm impressed. And? And if each and every one of her references check out then we may possibly have a part-time, very occasional sitter. _ I can't. I'm too upset! Wh-What's going on? _ The project is over. Done. Dead. - Aw, I'm sorry, Dad. - Just like that, no? And my private investor, he sank everything he had into it! Well, that guy's an idiot. Who sinks everything into a TV pilot? Dad? No. You were the investor? How much did you invest? Everything I had in cash. I tried to invest my SAG retirement, but my financial advisor wouldn't let me. And now I feel bad for calling her a ""narrow-minded idiot."" She did me a real solid. - When I'm 65, I'll thank her again. - Okay, you'll-you'll sell your house, sell your cars. They're all leased. Like Tyga. Everything? Yes. I live paycheck to paycheck. Granted, $50,000 paycheck to $50,000 paycheck, but until I start getting more $50,000 paychecks You're broke? Yes. And now I am mad at my advisor, again! I mean, she does this for a living. How could she have let me invest everything?! You spend $10,000 on something called ""smile maintenance""? It's worth every penny, no? And why do you own 40 HermÃÂ¨s scarves? I get cold. No. You clearly need to go on a budget. No more of that. But I love New Pants Wednesday. It's a perfect antidote to the mid-week blahs. Dad, big picture you need to tighten your belt. Don't cut out my trainer. If you rent a small place, get a cheaper car, you can ride out unemployment for about six months until you find your next passion project. And check this out. One search an adorable one-bedroom condo totally in your new price range. No, no, no, no. Forget it. Rogelio de la Vega doesn't do adorable. He goes big or he goes home to his mansion on the beach. That doesn't seem like an option right now. It is if I go to Telemasivo. I will swallow my pride, and they will put me in one of the projects I passed on. Hello? Jane. Hi. It's Petra. Hey, Petra. I, um I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I wasn't feeling great. Oh. That's okay. Ah, poor Petra. She doesn't have much experience with friends. Petra? Yes. Sorry. I, um I was also wondering if maybe you, uh you wanted to have lunch sometime? What? Well, I had fun on Thanksgiving, and-and wondering if, um maybe we could get together and eat. Oh. You know what? Forget it. No. How about tomorrow? At noon. Yes. Perfect. I'll, um pencil that in. So long, Jane. I think Petra just asked me on a date. She said yes. Oh, I got to go. Wish me luck. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Excuse me. This is the alcoholic support group, right? Sure is. Sorry. Are those mala beads from the Osho Ashram? Yeah. That place changed my life. Oh, my God, me, too. Rafael's sister? She's the one who impregnated you? I think the word that you're looking for is ""What?"" Well, that's just the craziest story I have ever heard. Yeah. And definitely your first novel. I know a publisher who would love it. Uh, wow. - Are you serious? - I know, I know, - getting ahead of my self. - No, - get ahead of yourself. - Okay. - Let's focus on why you're here. - Mm-hmm. Your story. Great news I think your writing shows real promise. I just loved the big reveal. So your stepmother was the crime lord Sin Rostro? Rose? Sin Rose-tro? You get it? She always did love a good play on words. So, what was she like? Oh, God, I don't even know where to begin. Well I guess with the way that she made love. Loved, loved, loved that character. But here's my advice. Take everything that you have written and turn the volume up. Sorry, I, uh, couldn't hear you. - Can you speak up? - Oh, happy to. Where was I? You and your brother are half-siblings from different moms. Right. But both moms are messed up. I mean, his mom took off I really want you to make me gasp. Gasp. Okay. Your mom committed suicide? Yup. She jumped off a bridge. And my dad didn't want a scandal, so he paid off the coroner, bought a death certificate and told the press that she died of cancer. - No. - Closed casket, obviously. Wait, so you never you never saw a body. No. Why? Do you think that's weird? - Do you? - Do you? So is there anything specific that you can give me in terms of direction as I attack this rewrite? Just figure out how to make it all more sparkly. Yes, yes, of course we want you back. _ _ And of course we want to put you in our next big hit. Great. Because I am ready! Ready to bring back New Pants Wednesday! So, what's the show? Audiences will love to see Rogelio de la Vega as the roguish cowboy El Ranchero in El Rancho de Mi Corazon. That's the exact hat I wore when playing Frederico in Llanuras de Traicion. Come on, it's not the hat that makes the cowboy, it's the cowboy that makes the hat. It's up to you to add the pizzazz! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Psh, psh, psh. I don't know, Dad. - You just don't seem like your heart is in it. - Oh, no, no, no, I am making an acting choice. To make the role more challenging, I have decided to play it like I'm suffering from Lyme disease. Mm. Well, you do sound very tired. I am tired. I'm tired of this part. You know, after Hombres Locos, doing El Rancho de mi Corazon feels like a creative step backward. Are you sure you just don't want to go on a budget? - I can't. I just can't. - Why? Why? - You can't just say you can't. - Jane, stop. I lived like that once, okay? Sitting alone in my one-bedroom apartment, eating ramen noodles, broke and miserable. I've worked too hard I can't go back there. You're not gonna believe this. Telemasivo wants to use the song that I wrote for Hombres Locos in another show. - What?! - That's wonderful, Xiomara! No, but it's it's for Esteban's show. - _ - Rogelio. Hello. _ How do you feel about that? Me? I feel great, of course. It's not a problem. Kind of a problem? Dr. Bolton's notes. _ _ _ _ Make me gasp. _ _ Turn up the volume! _ Just make it all more sparkly. _ _ I know how you feel, Mr. Sweet Face. I want to cry, too.  Where is Petra? Where is Petra?   I don't know   I don't know   Oh, there she is   I see her, there she is, I see her  Get out of the way, get out of the way. What are you doing? I told you, I have plan. _ _ _ But I don't care about your plan you're supposed to be upstairs with Ivan. The cleaning crew is going to be on our floor any minute. Mother, get back up there! I cannot. I have an emergency. I cannot go with him looking at me. Well, how long will you be? Your guess is as good as mine. Mother? Mother! _ ""Something came up""? Seriously, Mateo? ""Something came up""? All right, what am I looking at? It's the back room of Bar Lunara. I got the coordinates on Nadine's phone, went in as an electrician, set up a camera. Okay, I should let you in on a little secret. Remember this? Give me your badge and your gun. Come on. _ Well, here's what happened the moment before. Give me one reason why I shouldn't fire you. Here's one. Cordero's got something no one else has. A direct line to Nadine, who's got a direct line to Sin Rostro. Let's fire him, make a big show of it, then he can embed himself with Nadine, see where it leads. Yup, you guessed it. Michael's been undercover. Well, you didn't guess it I just told you. Anyway Look at this. Cash transactions. And that's way more than a crappy club on Collins pulls in. I did some research. The bar was purchased by The Maracay Group in 1983. _ _ _ We're thinking Rose inherited it from Emilio and is using it as a money laundering front. No laundry required, but if you do have time, baby detergent only. _ Am I going too fast? Just let me know if you need me to slow down. No. This is perfect. Okay, that is enough. Time for our date. Chepa's good. Right, Chepa? - I'm very good. - Great. I would like to get to know Mateo. - Go out, have fun. - Yeah, okay. I just want to say good-bye to him. Okay. Uh, bye, Chepa. I'm gonna go get the car. Okay. Good-bye, sweetie. Mommy loves you. Mommy loves you so much. _ _ De EspaÃ±a! I think I should be stabbing someone as I say this. Bring me an extra to stab. How dare you! What are you doing here? This is a closed set. Guards! Seize him! I know we've been fiercest rivals both on screen and off, but there are certain things that even the fiercest rivals do not do to one another! Is this about me sleeping with Luciana? Because that was just a publicity stunt. I loathe that woman. She calls me ""el flacido."" - _ - No! This is about you using my girlfriend to get to me. You have crossed the line, Esteban. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Don't play innocent. Okay? I know your plan. You chose Xiomara's theme song, and then you're planning to pull the plug at the last moment to humiliate her. We chose Xiomara's song? - Wait, what? - What? - Nothing. Why? - Enough! Now I know the truth. And I am pulling the offer. El erecto! Shh Luckily, things seem to be going well here. I have one tiny thought for your bedtime ritual. Oh, no. That's it. I'm done. What?! I have worked with people like you before. It never ends. No one can do it as well as Mommy. No, no, no. Th-That's not it! Chepa! You went to Esteban behind my back?! - I was angry I thought he was messing with me. - Yeah, yeah, of course. Because it's all about you! All the time, everything! Finally, there is one thing in our life that is about me, and you ruin it! Xiomara - Hey. - Hey. Uh, I thought you had your date. Long story. And I don't end up looking too good in it. I'm gonna put him down, and get some writing done. - _ - Oh, no, not this sentence again. - Let it go. - BOLTON: Just make it all more sparkly. Turn up the volume. Make me gasp. Huh. She's going back to Professor Chavez's comments. Losing point of view here. The sentence structure works. The problem is the tonal shift is too jarring. He's right that's just clumsy storytelling. Now to the police station! Watch when we zoom in. _ Oh, my God. You know who used blue silk ties? A drug lord that ran Miami back in the '80s. Went by the name Mutter. This bar isn't a Sin Rostro front. It's a Mutter front. Exactly. We know Mutter kidnapped Luisa to send a message to Rose. I think Rose was planning to send a message back, and this bar was her target. Also focused on her target Come in. So, I was trying to write last night, and I found your notes incredibly clear and so helpful. And I don't know why it took me so long to realize how incredibly clear and helpful they are, but now that I know, I wanted to ask you, um would you consider being my advisor? I appreciate the thought, Jane. But the Emperor of Smug Condescension doesn't have room for any more advisees. You haven't seen my latest evaluation. I'm forwarding it to you right now. _ _ _ Chavez Now, if you'll excuse me I have a class to teach. - No! - I told you I have plan. This is plan. This is not plan this is Weekend at Bernie's. Oh. What's that smell? Vodka and lemons, to cover dead man stench. _ - What was the tuna for? - Me. I got hungry. Just help me get him out of here. No, get back in there! Not yet. Petra? Oh. Jane. Hi. Hi. What happened to you the other day? You just kind of cancelled last minute. Yeah. I, uh Petra, what's going on? What I I just don't need us to be friends, okay? Uh, what? I felt guilty, because you invited me to Thanksgiving and I tried, but it's not worth it. Okay. Got it. Yeah. I'm officially done with Petra. _ Amen! Rogelio. - What are you all doing here? - We're here to show our #Rogelilove for your first day of shooting. Aren't you still mad at me? 'Course I am but even when I'm pissed off, I'm still gonna show up. We got your back, Dad, no matter that. You know that. _ Okay, people, the first scene for El Rancho de mi Corazon is up. And in that moment, Rogelio realized he would never have to worry about being poor again, because he was rich in love. And action! And so he did what heroes do. Where is he going? He rode off into the sunset. And seeing her father make such a courageous and crazy choice gave Jane the courage to make her own. Why did you register to take my class again? You won't receive any academic credit. But since you won't take me on as an advisee, I will take your class for no credit, because you're gonna make me a better writer, and that's why I'm here, away from my kid so much. So I'll see you in January. Okay wait. Frankly, I'd rather see you once a week as an advisor than three times a week in my class. Give me Uh, right, right. No problem. I'm leaving now. You're really leaving? Yes. We are really leaving. Ah. Date night. - Take two. - One hour, a trial run. You can do this. One hour, we will pay you for three. You can do this. Okay. Give her the baby. What is that? Sorry. New ringtone. Come on. - Whoa! - So since this is our first date, if you're gonna be one of those girls that's always on her cell phone, this is not gonna work out. Oh. I was actually just lining up my next date. I think this car's pretty douche-y, so Where are we going, anyway? Well, since we only have an hour I wanted to show you something. I'm thinking about making an offer. I don't understand. It doesn't seem like your kind of house. When I was younger, sometimes I'd drive by houses like this just imagine everything perfect inside. Yeah, me, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Anyways, it's kind of halfway between your house and the Marbella. I'm not asking you to live here with me, 'cause I know that this is just our first date and you think I drive a douche-y car, but But I do want your opinion. I love it. So much. _ It's Lina, and she says it's important. So, what's the rest of your story, Jane Gloriana? Was Rafael's crazy sister there? I mean, after everything you've told me about his insane family I know. It's, like, the curse of the Solanos. Oh, no. Absolutely I want you to bury this guy. Of course. The piece is littered with quotes from my sister. I'm sure she had no idea. Okay, call me back. Wesley is looking at a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit. My lawyers say when we are done with him, he's going to be broke and unemployable. Raf, I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's not your fault. You didn't know. Hello? Okay, so what kind of statement should we put out? This is a work thing. Sorry. How'd it go? How was he? Perfect. And he waved. - Really?! - I swear. You should have seen that little boy he was so proud of himself. Oh Thank you. Are you available next Thursday at my house? Turns out you don't actually need to spend $5,000 on a fresh pine tree after all. _ And that's the tour, you know? I live, eat, cook all in the same room. It's actually quite convenient. You're doing the right thing, Rogelio. Betting on yourself. I agree. Who better to bet on? I will wait for the perfect script to come along It's Telemasivo. Hang on. Hello? Y-Yes, this is Xiomara. What? They're gonna use my song! And look how surprised Rogelio is. Then again, he is a wonderful actor. _ _ Cut! Okay, let's do the scene again, only this time we're going to have him slip and fall into the mud at the end. - Esteban - Unless you don't want Xiomara to have her song on our show. Let's go again. Take 14. I'm going in the mud! Did you do something? No. Aw. These two are in such a sweet place. - Not in such a sweet place? - Petra. What is going on with you? Oh, you know, Mother. We're burying a body. He was not a good man. Mateo, are you sad that Mommy missed your first wave? Well I have a secret. I installed a nanny cam. Hey, don't judge me. Daddy's the one that bought it. What the hell? No, you paid me to lie to the cops about Cordero, and now Nadine's dead and he's showing up at her funeral and staring at me. - Hey, calm down. Calm down. - No! No. - You said nobody would ever find out. - Okay. Shh. Look, we can't talk about this here, okay? I will give you whatever you want, but you have to go. Jane. It's not what you think. I think you hired someone to go to the police and lie. What he was saying was the truth. I heard Michael on the monitor. - He let Nadine go. - You got him fired. He should have been fired. Because of what he did, Mateo was kidnapped, and you couldn't see it. No, no. Don't turn this around. Hey, no, you told me to fight for you, you told me to fight for our family, and I was. - I was fighting for us. - Just stop it! - Jane, w - Let me by. Did you read this article on the Solanos? No, I haven't gotten around to that yet. You're gonna want to hear this. ""As for Luisa's mother, ""she supposedly committed suicide by jumping off a bridge ""in 1983. ""But it was a closed-casket funeral. Could she still be alive?"" Yes. Just do it. Open it. No, no, no! I'm not ready. Stop. So what are you saying? Come on, Cordero, this can't just be a coincidence. She dies in 1983, the same year The Maracay Group bought Bar Lunara? Osho Ashram breath in Osho Ashram breath out Okay I'm ready. No, don't open it! What if she set up the money laundering front and then faked her own death so she could operate underground? Oh my God. She's not in there! That means that means Mutter is Luisa's mother. I can't believe it! I'm gonna find my mom! _"
"All right, all right, lots to catch up on. Jane was trying to balance motherhood with grad school. Making things harder: the evil classmate who wrote an exposÃ© about Rafael's family. Oh, and speaking of family drama, Jane's father, Rogelio, invested all his money into his passion project. - Unfortunately, it decked  - What?! Leaving him broke, until he finds his next telenovela. And speaking of telenovelas, we have not one, but two crime lords on the loose. The first, Rose, aka Sin Rostro, aka Luisa's great love. And then there's Mutter. I know, cray cray, right? Also crazy: Petra's mother killed someone. And Petra had to help dispose of the body. And then there's Jane. See, she wanted to be with Detective Michael, - until this happened  - You turned me in?! This entitled ass cost me my job. But it seemed Michael was wrong. It wasn't Rafael. I'm Eric Wu, and I'm here to talk about my friend Nadine Hansen. So Jane said good-bye to him. But then she discovered this. You paid me to lie to the cops about Cordero. I think you hired someone to go to the police and lie about Michael. - You told me to fight for our family, and I was. - Stop it. - Will you ? - Let me by. Which is where we left off. It should be noted that Jane at six years old was a lot like our Jane now. She was kind. She was smart. And she was a rule follower. I'm sorry, Janie. I was craving chocolate last night. However, there was one way in which she was very, very different. Janie. Stay calm. _ I can't help it. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Cheese. _ _ You, Abuela. - _ - Ay. _ _ _ Lists. And for ""M,"" Mr. Monkey. Ah. _ No ""A,"" I spell it in English. I told you she was smart. Okay _ _ That Christmas, Jane got an outer space puzzle, a Home Alone video tape and an anger management technique that would last a lifetime  _ which she really needed, after what just happened with Rafael. _ Oh, right, eventually Jane grew out of Mr. Monkey and the ""M"" became Michael, which only made matters worse right now. Michael was right this whole time. Rafael paid someone to turn him in, and he's been lying to me for six months. _ I know. Are you gonna tell Michael? What good would that do?! He's still be fired, plus he doesn't even want to see me. - Why are you yelling at me? - I'm sorry! I'm just so mad! _ _ Look, as angry as I am at Rafael, and I am very, very angry I'm gonna deal with him for Mateo's sake. Because that lying two-faced liar is not gonna ruin his first Christmas! I'm really sorry? Are you excited to meet Santa, Mr. Sweetface? 'Cause he's excited to see you, yes, he is. Remember, calm, Jane. Didn't know you were coming. Well, it was on the calendar, so Look, I am sorry, Jane. I know what I did was wrong. I just felt my family slipping away. So you paid someone to go to the police and lie. What he said about Michael letting Nadine go was the truth. Oh, so you don't actually regret what you did. I didn't have a choice. Look, Michael put Mateo in danger, and you were too blinded by your feelings to see it. I can't believe you are trying to justify what you did. - You were jealous of Michael. - Whoa, jealous? And because you have money and rules don't apply to you, - or laws for that matter! - I was protecting my son! - Ugh! - Ho, ho, ho. No fighting at the North Pole. Stay out of this, Santa, okay? _ Excuse me, I couldn't help overhearing, and I just have to say I know what you're going through. - Hmm? - Well, my husband and I, we turned into Bill and Betty Bickerberg those first six months. But it wasn't good for the baby. Couples therapy really helped us. I don't need therapy. He could use some therapy. I mean, he doesn't even regret what he did. _ Yes. I know I know. Green card? _ _ I don't know, I just feel like I need to be away from Rafael right now. Yeah, I get that. Why don't I pick up Mateo later? Aw  You can always count on your mom to help out with child care. Or to bleach the blood of a murdered man off your floor. Petra, it's done. No, it's not, I can still see the blood. Easy there, Lady Macbeth. Divka. - Divka, relax. - What? How? You you killed a man. We buried him. No, Ivan is missing. And statistically, if he is not found in the first 48 hours, they will not find him. Huh, I bet she learned that in prison. - _ - Don't worry. Just 24 hours left. What?! I can't afford to buy pizza?! Don't be so dramatic; you can order pizza. Just not from a place with ""osteria"" in the name. Here, the Pizza Highway. If you want to find your next passion project, you're gonna have to stick to Jane's budget. Fine! _ Would you be so kind to order me a pauper's pizza? Just cheese. - Will do. - How are the scripts? Are they full of passion? Intrigue? De la Vega flava? Nah, it's, uh, pretty clichÃ©d actually. Like, identity-swap stuff. - I'm leaving, I'm getting Mateo. - Okay. I really hope they make up for Christmas. Jane and Rafael? Not happening. She's pissed. Like, seriously pissed. And I don't blame her. JD, can I ask you something, celeb to normal person? Shoot. Let's say I was really tight with my daughter's ex-boyfriend, but they're no longer on speaking terms, what's the protocol, you know, for him and I? Oh, uh, yeah, that's that's pretty cut and dried. You cannot stay friends. That's what I thought. Okay, um, we wanted to catch you up, 'cause there have been some important developments in the case. We have reason to believe that the crime lord known as Mutter is actually Luisa Alver's mother, Mia Alver, who was presumed dead. We think Mutter kidnapped Luisa to send a message to Rose. She's here. Hey, guys, so weird that you called me because I was about to call you. I think my mother might be alive. _ Okay, Luisa, let's have a little chat in private. Oh, sure. Oh, God, please don't read that terrible article about my family. I was taken totally out of context. And here's the guy who took her out of context. _ _ _ Oh, great. - Not what she needs today. - What are you doing here? Don't you have another friendship to exploit so that you can advance your journalism career? I'm sorry if you felt betrayed, but that was a really great story, and you weren't using it. That's because it's not a story. It's my son's family. Which is why I'm going to the dean. Because there must be some clause to kick out some evil, amoral little piece of You know what, I would tell you what Jane said next, but I'm a gentleman. Hi, I'm Jane Villanueva, and I'd like to make an appointment with the dean. Urgently. But very respectfully. Oh, did you decide to enroll next semester after all? What are you talking about? I'm a full-time grad student. Oh, well, since you didn't pay tuition next semester, we assumed you were taking a little time off. No, I have the Elodea Gale Vigor scholarship. It covers the whole year. _ Elodea who? There's a need-based scholarship for creative writing students whose writing the committee loves. It's $15,000 per semester. Holy crap! - Oh, my God, this solves all my tuition problems. - Yes. A need-based scholarship for students whose writing the committee loves? _ Look, there's got to be a way to find out where the money came from. There's a phone number associated with the payments. Here you go. Thank you.  It's another beautiful day to call Rogelio   Leave me a message   I'll call you back.  Uh-oh. The same Rogelio de la Vega who can't afford pizza toppings? So first, I just wanted to clear everything up and say that I'm still enrolled, definitely. Your father made up a fake scholarship? Yes. I know, he's a bit eccentric. In any case, I was wondering if there were any TA positions left. I do have teaching experience. Yeah, you know, I'm sorry. Not this late in the game. You know what? This won't solve your problem, but I think it could help chip away a little. Um, there is a nice cash prize for a short story submission. I have tons of short stories. In one of the following genres? Uh, historical fiction, thriller, and sci-fi. I can write a new short story. Which category, do you think? I'm not sure. Why don't you write a few pages on each and I'll help you pick? Oh. Okay. No problem. Great. Go. Write like the wind. Whoosh! And speaking of Elodea Gale Vigor  Great coffee, right? Oh. I don't think it was worth the drive Oh, my God, JD. Look who's here. I guess I might as well go and say hi. Excuse me. Ex-Excuse me. Excuse me. Michael. What a surprise. This is my coffee place. We've been here together, like, 20 times. I know. Well, what's  what's going on, Rogelio? I miss you. I mean, we were in a pretty serious bromance. Oh, I don't know if it was a bromance. Thank you. Michael, come on. There are some things going on and you give such good advice. So I was thinking, if I asked Jane and she okayed the friendship, could we maybe hang? It should be noted that this is what Michael wanted to say. Sure, bro. You crack me up. And this is what he actually said. I just think it's-it's better for me if we all kind of move on. And this is what Rogelio wanted to say. Really? Just like that? Oh. That's what he actually said. Decaf chai cinnamon latte. Extra wet. - Thought you were fired. - Oh. These two haven't seen each other in a while. Probation. Good looking out, though, thank you. Okay. Now that you have your brother and your special tea, you want to talk to us about your mother? Uh, sure. I just, um I don't remember much. I was  I was six when she died. When-when she didn't die. There's something on another topic, though. Make it quick. Sure. I've been communicating with Rose online for the past six months. Wait, what? - I'm sorry. - How? Nothing crime-related, though. Just just personal stuff. Light role-play, um, there's-there's a Web site I'll get a secure computer. What's the name of the Web site? No, no! When was the last time you talked to her? Like a week ago? _ Ma, he's gonna tell you the same answer on the phone or in person. He doesn't know when your green card will come. _ Okay, I have a plan of attack. One Win fiction writing contest. Two trade in my car for a cheaper one. Three waitress again. At night, of course. Four take out a very, very limited loan. Five tell your father. No. And don't either of you say anything, please. I put him on a budget, and I don't want him compromising because of me. Hey, Dad. - Jane! - Mwah! - Matelio. - Hey, JD. All right, everyone is here. Let Mateo's first Christmas season commence. So no Rafael? No, thank God. I unlinked our calendars. _ Oh, my God! It's Rafael's mother. - _ - Why'd you leave? Your father offered me $10 million to go away and I took it. What are you doing here? The police have questions about your father's first wife, Mia. Well, I'm sure they'll fill you in. Rafael, wait. Please. I haven't stopped thinking about you. There was so much more I wanted to explain. Stop. I have a son now. - Yes. - And there is no explanation or amount of money that could ever make me leave him. I was thinking about - the Rafael situation. - I know. It's awful. - What is? - The Rafael situation. No, no. No Rafael talk. We're doing Christmas. Ma, time for the story about the tree topper. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ No, not just because it's from Venezuela. Something with meaning. A ""C."" Why am I stuck? - This makes no sense. - This makes no sense. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Huh. _ _ _ _ _ Remember, Jane, stay calm. _ So if I refused to give him Mateo for Christmas, can a judge use that against me in custody court? Oh, good, looks like she found a lawyer. I'm sorry, but I'm an immigration attorney. In case you were wondering, Alba got to ask her question already. No green card involved. - Can I be frank? - Mm-hmm. The baby's father is Rafael Solano, right? As in this - Geez. - Rafael Solano? - That thing's everywhere. - Mm-hmm. Here's my advice get in touch with the author of this article. What? Well, he insinuates massive financial improprieties on Mr. Solano's part. And if that's true, if he is involved in ongoing criminal activities, well you'd have a case for full custody. Whoa. Jane. _ No, of course not. But I do want to know what else he lied about. I mean, what if it's something bad? I have to make sure that Mateo's safe, Abuela. - Wesley. - What, are you following me around now just so you can yell at me? Calm, calm. I looked in the handbook, and I can report you to the dean for ""violating a fellow student's reasonable expectation of confidentiality."" But I won't if you reveal your source inside the Marbella. Please don't get me fired. _ I love this job You talked about a secret account where was the money going? Uh, Rafael was being secretive; I didn't ask. I can get you the number of the place. And the address. Oh, Raf. What are you up to? Why aren't you returning my calls? It's a long story. - _ - She is not taking my death well. - What's going on? - I just wanted to see what time our doctor's appointment was. Are you okay? It's just a blood sugar thing. Petra's a little hungry. Aren't you, darling? - Yes. - Don't worry. Bye-bye. Divka, great news. It's been 48 hours. Now he just decomposes. I can't do this. I have to tell. Who? Rafael? Good. While you're at it tell him how you covered up for me when I pushed Jane's granny down stairs, I'm sure he'll understand. Wow. She's a real piece of work, your mother. All the personal effects Luisa has from her mother. Anything interesting? Haven't looked. Came straight over. What's wrong? You all right? Yeah. I just think Luisa is flirting with me, maybe. Why do you say that? Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. Do do I have something there? Do you see it? Mm-mm. Oh. Maybe it's just my nipple. Stop. Stop laughing. What? Look. Check out the date on this picture. It's dated two days before Mia jumped off the bridge. Hurricane shutters. Aha. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Because I'm thinking I hope they tell us what they're thinking because I have no idea. Okay, so here's what I'm thinking. - Oh, good. - The tropical storm would have impacted the tides and currents, so when she jumped Our search area was too small. Exactly. And speaking of breakthroughs  - _ - Oh, information on Raf's secret account. Jane, do you really want to go down this road? Ooh! That's a sketchy part of town. You definitely do not want to go down that road. And I guess she went down that road. - _ - Yeah, so that's what Janie imagined Rafael was up to. And what she used as inspiration to write her thriller, while she debated what to do about that phone number. Hello? Hello. Are you there? Yes. Are you safe? Yes, I'm safe. I'm actually looking for Rafael Solano. No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not If this is about that article, you should know we wouldn't be open were it not for Mr. Solano's funding. I'm sorry, open for what? I-I was looking online and trying to figure it out, but I You won't find us online, because people who come here don't want to be found. Wait, you're a charity? Yes, leave us alone. Oh, no! - What? - JD failed the Prince William test! The what now? In order to see if a new friend can be trusted, Prince William tells them a very specific piece of information to see if it shows up in the press. - JD? - Yeah? I'm gonna tell you a juicy piece of gossip. _ I once had a torrid love affair with Charo. You slept with Charo? Of course not, but look. It's all over the Internet. Oh, my God, it's Charo. I don't know how I misjudged the guy. I really thought he was gonna be my Guy Pelly. _ Rogelio, is everything okay? You've seemed a little I don't know  Desperate for a friend? If you're looking for someone to talk to it can be, you know. Come on, what is it? A budget? Not at all. Then, what's going on? Well, sometimes these um, feelings come up. In the past, I've talked to Michael, vent a little and get over it. But that's clearly not appropriate anymore. What feelings exactly? Angry ones. About the 23 years you kept me from Jane. And I know it's not the same thing, but when I see her push Rafael out and you encouraging her, it just brings it back up. Yeah, I get that. Hey. - How are you? - Not great. I found out where Rafael's money was going. To a charity. I mean, I don't know what I was thinking, except that I was just so mad. I know. So maybe the lady on the Santa line was right. _ _ Ah yes, here we are. At a three-starred Rate-A-Doc Reviewed therapist. Which was the best Jane and Rafael could find under such short notice. Thank you so much for squeezing us in. Yeah. And you're sure you're credentialed? _ Yes, I just have a young face. So why don't we give you some backstory? - _ - Oh, I don't need backstory. I deal in the present. So why don't you guys tell me why you're here? Okay, um I just found out that Rafael's been lying to me - for six months - I'm gonna stop you right there. Let's avoid using language that places blame. So instead, we'll say ""I feel"". An example would be, you know, ""I feel hurt that he didn't notice my new haircut."" Got it. I feel angry. That after our son was kidnapped by Sin Rostro and my ex-fiancÃ© Michael rescued him, that Rafael decided to pay someone off to lie to the police. And I feel angry that Jane doesn't realize that I had no choice. She was blinded by Michael and that I was trying to protect my family. _ Okay, maybe I just need, like, a teensy bit of backstory. And speaking of a complicated backstory  You found my mom? We think so. We expanded our search area, found an incident report of a woman who washed ashore saw your mother jump. _ _ She was pulled from the water wearing a bracelet that said ""Mia"", but she had a head injury, so she didn't even know her last name. _ She was sent to the hospital for treatment, then confined to the Burnwall-Meriweather Home for the Mentally Ill. _ The home was closed about a year later and she was transferred to a less restrictive institution. _ She's had access to the outside world, sometimes for days at a time, which is what she'd need if she were operating as the drug lord Mutter. So what happens now? Well, that's where we could use your help. You think that'll help? It might. But you both seem very stuck in your points of view. So Jane, why don't you take me back to the incident that started everything, but try to tell it to me from Rafael's point of view. Um okay. Uh, so I'm Rafael. And I'm lying there, and I hear that Jane kissed Michael, and so at first, I'm feeling sad. I mean  just really sad. And my heart hurts. But you know what, instead of saying anything, I'll pretend to be asleep. And then later, I just start thinking and thinking, and I say to myself: I could make this whole thing go away. I can get rid of Michael. All I have to do is pay someone off, because I'm rich. Rules? What rules? I don't like something? Boom, I pay my henchman. I got a henchman now? - Seriously? - You have a guy you paid to break the law. As far as I'm concerned, that's a henchman. Okay, my turn. I'm Jane. Ready? So, I'm in my room, right by the baby monitor, because that's my favorite place to talk. And I'm listening to Michael confessing how he let the person go who was involved in the kidnapping of my son. But you know what? Who cares? Because it's you, Michael. It's you! And, sure, you've been shady, but I just  I love you. Even though you broke the law and freed Nadine, who worked for Sin Rostro, who kidnapped our son and killed my father. I'm sorry, I-I can't do this. I wasn't even thinking about your father. I know. Because of Michael. And yeah, maybe I was jealous. But Sin Rostro was out there and Michael was compromised and you couldn't see it. And I knew that if I came forward I would lose you. Yeah, I get that. But it was just the lying. The six months of lying. Jane, why do you think lying is such a trigger for you? _ Hi. I'm Luisa Alver, I'm here to visit my mother, Mia. - You're Mia's daughter? - Yeah. I know. Uh, we just found out that she's here. It's-it's a long story. Uh, could my wife and I see her? Mia? You have a visitor, dear. Oh, my God. Mamma Mia. That's not my mom. Or not. So we're talking a straight-up identity swap. It must be. Is she okay? Oh Go. Talk to your wife. And during a transfer of patients, the bus broke down. And that's when we think your mother switched I.D.s with a nonverbal patient. And ever since then, we think she's been running her operation as a ghost. Oh. Is that all? I know. Are you okay? I'm just I'm trying to make sense of it all. I guess my mom's a psychopath. And maybe that's why I fell in love with Rose. Why it all felt so familiar. Yeah. Okay. Maybe. _ _ _ What a clichÃ©, no? I agree. It's not that great. That's JD. Stay calm. _ _ _ _ How could you? Uh, what? Don't ""uh, what"" me. I know exactly what you are! A betrayer. As slippery as they come! You're right. I'm a shape-shifter. And the fact that you know, it's a real problem. W _ I didn't. But then again, it could be me. Mom, stop. I'm JD. _ Okay, I read all three stories. And, uh, the science fiction one is really crazy. I know. I-It's not my genre. So of the other two? Just go with romance. - I'm sorry, what? - The contest is fiction in any genre. I Elodea Gale Vigor'd you there, huh? What? Misled you for your own good. You seemed a little stuck in your own perspective. You know, she's actually been hearing that a lot lately. I gave you the historical fiction 'cause I wanted you to get a feeling for time and place. And then the thriller was so that you could work on the element of surprise. And the science fiction was I don't know. You have to break the rules a little more. In general. But again, that piece didn't work at all, so Um just go write a great story. The deadline is two weeks. Okay. I will. You know, but in the interest of full disclosure, I am the tiniest bit aggravated because I had a lot going on this week. This might help. A T.A. position opened up. - What? - Apparently, Wesley is not going to be enrolling next semester. Seriously? That's what I'm being told. And I-I get to have his job? I'm sorry, but you're fired. What? You betrayed my trust by revealing the intimate secret I shared with you to TMZ. About you and Charo? No, I didn't. Who else could it be? One of the two other people who were in the room when you told me. I once had a torrid love affair with Charo. Rogelio! I-I'm so sorry for doubting you. But now we can continue to develop our friendship. I don't want to be friends with you. Rogelio, you don't know one thing about me. Yes, I do. You are an intern. I'm a writer, okay? And I'm good, too. Here. Um, read my script at some point. Or don't. Either way, I'm-I'm done being your intern. But I know what I have to do. - Read his script? - Get him a wall of flowers, like Kanye gets Kim. Read the script. Hi, Dad. How did it go with Rafael? Good, actually. _ Look, I don't agree with what he did, but I see why he did it. And the lying I'll get over. I guess I realized it's something I'm sensitive to because of well, you know the 23 years we lost. I guess it still comes up once in a while. Yeah. W-With me, too. But you should know that now I can't imagine life without you. You, too. Elodea Gale Vigor. You know? Well, I'm glad I paid the whole year, you know, before all these money troubles. Yeah. Good thing. Come on. Let's go decorate the tree. Are you ready to put the angel on top, Mateo? Matelio. He's ready. Yes. Oh, crap. - I forgot. I broke it. - What? I meant to tell you the box fell down right before Mateo's baptism, but things were all crazy. It's just a crack. I'll get glue. What? But, Mom, where is it? I left it in there. I swear. _ _ We'll find it. Don't worry. Should we be worried? Well, high blood pressure isn't good. She really needs to take it easy, - reduce stress. - That's what I keep telling her. I will. Yes. I'll have you back in next week, to check those numbers. - Thank you. - Thank you, Doctor. Okay, Petra, what's going on? - Nothing. I'm fine. - No, you're not. And whatever it is, it's affecting the babies. So please tell me. I can't. You can. It's bad. Trust me, I know good people do bad things. My mother killed Ivan, and I helped her bury the body. Yeah. Usually not that bad. You'll recall, we left Petra confiding in Rafael. And it should be noted, she told him everything, including  _ _ _ Is that all? Almost. There were these grenades that Milos was hiding in the hotel, and, uh, my mother and I threw them into the ocean. That's how she lost her hand. And her eye. I-I I know. I told you it was bad. Do you hate me? No. Wow. I did not see that coming. If anything, I think I finally understand you and everything that's been going on. So let's get your mother out of your life, huh? Really? The least you could do is admit you got me kicked out of school. But I didn't. I didn't even speak to the dean. Well, someone did! You said Wesley resigned. I misspoke. He was removed for violating a fellow student's reasonable expectation of confidentiality. Like I said, - that thing's everywhere. - Now get to work on your story. And so Jane did. The thunder was loud and echoed as she walked. But still, she was quiet, praying that she would not be heard. _ You know what's in your heart. You only have to listen to it. _ And just then, as though it was scripted, the door to the castle blew open and Amelia saw him. Her knight in filthy armor. _ Right. There's still that. - Awesome. - QuÃ© rico. Huh? So good. QuÃ© rico, huh? What's that? It's our angel. What? How? _ _ - Michael. - And I'm not gonna lie, it felt a little like a Christmas miracle. Oh my God. As did this. My intern's script is amazing. Completely original. It's about Thiago, a time traveler cobbler who is also a devastatingly handsome ladies' man. Matelio. Or he will be once I have given my first round of notes. I have found my next passion project. Yeah. _ _ Mommy. And then there was Petra. Call the police. Your mother needs to be in jail. - Is Petra Solano here? - Yes? You're under arrest for the murder of Ivan Rogachevsky. - What? - I'm so sorry, sweetheart. I had to tell them what you did. - What are you talking about? What-what did you do? - You have the right to remain silent. Mother, what did you do?! Yeah, see that's the thing about miracles. There are only so many of them. Or we wouldn't call them miracles, would we?"
"Ready? Okay. Jane the virgin was accidentally artificially inseminated, and she had baby Mateo. But he was kidnapped and then traded for this flash drive. Luckily, Jane and Rafael got him back. And they would have lived happily ever after, except she chose to be with Michael. Only problem? - You turned me in! - Stop! But it turns out, Michael was right. You paid me to lie to the cops about Cordero. Rafael did rat him out. Unfortunately, it was too late. Michael had moved on. Oh, and her baby daddy, Rafael, well, his life was complicated, too. See, his other baby mama, Petra, was in a bit of a jam. He mother killed someone and then blamed her. Talk about dysfunctional family, right? Well, how about this? Rafael's mom abandoned him when he was four. Oh, and his half-sister, Luisa, well, her mom was a criminal mastermind called Mutter, and her signature was blue silk ties. And Detective Michael was on the hunt for her, along with Susanna, who Luisa kind of liked. As in, like-liked. Oh, and speaking of romance, Michael returned Jane's tree topper. So maybe there was hope for them after all. I guess we'll see. It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Gloriana Villanueva loved school. However, she didn't love all of school. Specifically second grade gym class. - Because of Tommy boxer. - Yes! Fortunately, Jane's Abuela gave her the tools to deal with boys like that. Tommy? I know what's going on here. You're extra mean to me because you like me. Ah, yes, that old Chestnut. And just so you know, that is not the way to get me to like you. I respond to kindness. Your grandma's wrong. I'm mean 'cause of math class. You're only cheating yourself, you know. Yeah, Jane didn't see that coming. Or that. Hey. Or this. Hey. - So, listen, you're probably wondering - I wanted to reach out - and thank you for the tree topper. - Why I left the tree topper. I want you to know that you were right, uh, about Rafael turning you in. Yeah, I know. But I get it. He was looking out for his family. Anyway, we talked. He and I are all good now. And I was hoping maybe you and I could Maybe be good. Really? Really. No, Mateo, not again. Mateo. Not again. Oh, it's 2:37 A.M. This sleep regression has got to end, baby. - Okay? - _ Shh. - Try to go to sleep. - _ Yeah? - Yeah? Oh. - _ Jane, come on. Rogelio's mom comes tomorrow, and I cannot face that woman I'm trying, obviously. _ _ _ _ I'm not comfortable with that. _ Wait. He's getting sleepy. Oh, buddy. Yeah, buddy, oh. Okay. _ I want you both to know that I am on it. When Mateo woke up at 4:30, I researched some very gentle sleep training methods. _ _ No. _ For you, but there are other well-researched methods. _ His lovey. I'm supposed to wear it in my bra so that he can smell me and feel like I'm with him throughout the night. And your opinion is noted. Hmm. Hon, can you maybe not eat? Liliana will be here any minute. Mom, you need to just relax. Remember, dad said that grandma was much more chill when she's with grandpa. - Ay, shh, shh - Whoa. _ _ _ Hello, everyone. Glamma is here. _ Jane, you look adorable and darling. And, Alba, so good to see you. Hello, Xiomara. _ Liliana. Where's Grandpa? Well, it turns out that he was not well enough to travel after all. It's, it's a shame. Aw, I was really excited to meet him. I know, I know. But, uh, you know, better safe than sorry. Can I get him? I could use a pinch of happiness - in my current state. - Mm-hmm. Thank you. Oh. What's going on with your mother? I have no idea. She was like that the whole car ride down. Happy, then sad. She wouldn't even duet to ""endless love."" - Did you ask her? - Of course I did. Over and over. I even sang her part. Poor Grandma. Let me go check on Mateo and see if maybe she'll talk to me. He's adorable. Thanks. A little less adorable when he wakes up every hour. Ah. So, Glamma, is everything okay with you? Oh, yes. Yes, I'm-I'm just a little Overwhelmed seeing my beautiful great-grandson. Okay. Just seems like maybe there's something else. And if there is, you can tell me. Okay. Your grandfather is gay. And he has left me. For a man. Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Oh, wow. You are so right. I feel so much better. Good, good. Now, listen, you cannot tell anybody. And you can especially not tell your father, because I know how much he idealized our marriage. And when he finds out that it was all a lie, he is going to be so devastated. I can trust you, yes? No big deal. Yeah, it was just, like, you know, terrible food on the airplane and they charge for it now. So it's so annoying. Oh, okay. Well, I'll just send a series of irate tweets to the airline. They're gonna respond with a flight voucher or something. - Thank you, Jane. - No problem. Okay, I'm gonna go shower, because I got to go teach. Thank you guys for watching Mateo. Okay, from one mama drama to another. There's security footage of you wheeling Ivan out of the hotel. I was helping my mother. The murder weapon have Ivan's blood on it and your fingerprints. Yeah, but this isn't the murder weapon. The murder weapon was my mother's hook. Well, no one knows where that is. 'Cause she had that one removed last month. It could be at the bottom of the ocean. And without it, the case comes down to your word against hers. My mother is a convicted felon. She also came forward You didn't. Okay. Okay, so what happens next? Because Petra obviously didn't do this. Indictment is likely. Self-defense. It's 15 years to life. Without the murder weapon Petra. Yeah, sorry. What were you saying? That you will be indicted unless you can get your mother to confess. We're gonna figure this out, okay? Also nervous Jane. Not indicted-for-murder nervous, more like first-day-as-a-teacher's-assistant nervous. Okay. Oh, hi. Welcome. Wow, there's lots of tall people here. Whoa. Hmm, okay. Welcome to Great Books 105. I am Jane Villanueva, your section leader. And I can promise you that the course name d oh. Hi. I was just I can promise you that the course name doesn't lie. These are great books. Okay, so I hope you all enjoyed ""Pride and Prejudice"" over your break. I know I loved rereading it. We'll start with the immortal line, ""it is a truth universally acknowledged ""that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife."" Can anyone unpack that? Okay, I'm gonna steer a little. Uh, thoughts on how it frames the marriage plot narrative in satirical, rather than straightforward, terms? You. Any thoughts on the quote? Uh _ _ I haven't gotten to that part of the book yet. It's the first line. Did you read the book? Uh, dude. What's up with the teacher? Books for Ballers is supposed to be easy. Excuse me. What did you call this class? Uh, Books for Ballers. ""Books for"" If you're actually gonna make us read all these books, can you at least explain how to drop the class first? Yeah, so it's a truth universally acknowledged that Jane did not see that coming. Wow, and they got a shot off. - What a game. - Wow. I'm confused. Who are these people, and what have they done with the Villanuevas? Okay, cool. This is exciting. Right? I mean, one point right before the buzzer. _ Well, way to be supportive. I'm trying to connect with my students here, Abuela. _ _ _ Stop. Please. _ _ _ Okay, well, I'm not doing that, so, enough. _ _ _ _ Don't look at me. I have no idea who she is, either. This makes no sense. These therapy transcripts are just the ramblings of a mentally ill woman. Well, if Mia was gonna hide out in an institution, she's got to make it look real. - To give you a refresher - _ _ _ - Well, she did a good job. - _ I mean, listen to this: ""Mia likes mint chip ice cream. ""She dreams of vacationing by a magical lake. Collects hummel figurines."" Well, it doesn't mean anything to us. But it might mean something to your girlfriend. Oh, shut up. But, yeah, we're gonna have to talk to Luisa. - Heads or tails? - Heads. You gonna wear something sexy? It's gonna be so awkward. Well, at least not as awkward as this. When Manuel was touching me, and we were making love, is-is he thinking about another man the whole time? - You know? - Yeah, I do. Oh. Hey there. I-I think your Uber's waiting outside, Liliana. Thank you very much. Okay, I will, uh I will see all of you tomorrow. So, where are those Cubanos? I think I might've found something out. - You heard? - You know? - She told me this morning. - She who? Wait, what did you find out? I think Michael has a girlfriend. He does? I don't know. I saw him talking to someone and they looked like a couple. I know because of the tree topper, you thought maybe Yeah, no, uh It's good to know. Or maybe know. So, wait, what were you talking about? Yeah, no, same thing. Jane Okay, but you have to swear not to tell anybody. I swear! - Manuel is gay. - What? And he's leaving Liliana for a man, and she doesn't want anybody to know, especially Rogelio. Well, why doesn't she want to tell Rogelio? She doesn't think he can handle it. - Of course he can. - No kidding. That's what I said. Okay, Mr. Sweetface You and I are gonna go take a bath. You are officially on the clock, I found a great method. - _ - And you took a nice bath. And you got your cute jammies on. And here's your lovey. until he's drowsy but not asleep, and then I'm going to put him in his crib. _ _ Yes. I do this now, and then, every time he wakes up, I give him a little less comfort, so by the end of the night, all he needs is a pat to go to sleep. You see? Good evening, folks, I'm John Salley. And I'm Lee Reherman. And welcome to sleep tonight. And tonight, team Villanueva is going to attempt gentle sleep learning. - _ - Oh Okay So it's early in the first quarter, John. with the kissing and rocking combo. Let's see if it works. All right. Okay okay You see here, Lee? Villanueva has the lovey placed just so. Now she slides a pacifier in. Oh, that's straight butter! Now she's patting his back gently. Do not count Villanueva out. No way. And a typical rookie mistake, John! I'm with Alba on this one. She's got the experience and the know-how. We are definitely going into overtime tonight. How do you sleep at night? Sleeping pills. I have a prescription. I'm serious. Because I am a survivor, Petra. And I raise you to be one, too. Which is why you will get through this. I promise. Mother, stop! I can't go to jail for something I didn't do! You know what really happened that night. I walked in. You were standing over Ivan's body. Your hook was bloody! And here is what I know. There is a recorder hidden somewhere in this room. So I will speak loudly enough: Stop lying, Petra. Admit what you did. _ - _ - Okay, new plan. It's called ""gentle, independent sleep,"" and I watched a whole video on it last night. First, we say good night, - _ - and remember, be peppy, so little Leo knows that it's going to be okay. So, you leave him and you check in in five minutes. And then you check in in ten minutes and then you check in in 15 minutes until he falls asleep, and then he doesn't feel like you abandoned him. What do you think? _ _ _ Ma! I'm sorry, I'm too exhausted to keep secrets. - She won't say anything. - Mm-mm. Ay _ _ _ _ Trust me, I know how difficult this is. You don't. If you did, you wouldn't be asking me these questions that I don't have the answer to. We're just looking for anything. And I was only six years old the last time I saw my mom. Look, I know what it feels like to try to remember someone. My father left us when I was about five. All my memories of him Well, I don't know if they're real. Or from pictures Or from what my mom told me. - But anything you can remember - ­ No matter how small the detail Well, it could help. Are you trying to use the fact that I like you to try and get me to trust you? A little bit, yes. We need to find your mother, Luisa. Is there anything you can remember? Anything at all? I remember that she was beautiful and I remember the story that she used to tell me about this lake with magic fish. A lake? There's something in her file about a magical lake. ""Bioluminescent organisms in the water create a glow under the surface""! So the magic fish are real? Longbourne Lagoon. See? A lead! But then Elizabeth Bennet takes the lead, outmaneuvering the powerful lady Catherine de Bourgh in the final pages, and that is why ""Pride and Prejudice"" is just like the George Mason-UConn matchup in the 2006 NCAA tournament Boom! Yeah! Oh, oh, okay! This was a good class today, guys! Don't forget to turn in your paper on your way out! Matt Matt? McBaskets? Your paper? Oh. Yeah. I didn't do it. Big game Saturday. Any chance you'd cut me some slack this time? But you have to have it in my in-box at the end of the day tomorrow. Wow. You're killing me, Prof. My father is dying. What-what do you mean? I mean, think about it. He was too ill to travel. And I can't even bring him up to my mother without her changing the subject. Clearly, he is dying. - Who is dying? - His dad. He thinks. I'm not ready to lose him. But I must stay strong. I have to help my father achieve everything on his bucket list. I have to make sure he gets to see Bette Midler in concert. And Wicked on Broadway. He always wanted to vacation in Mykonos. A place in provincetown might not be feasible, given my current budget, but Dad Manuel is not dying. He is gay. And he's leaving Glamma for a man, and that's why she's been acting so weird. Gay? Wait But but that's impossible. Surely there would have been some sign. _ _ _ _ It is true. Wow. And he's leaving my mother. And why did she tell you all, and not me? Well, she didn't tell all of us, just me. And, for some reason, she didn't think that you could handle it. What?! Everybody knows how gay-friendly I am please. I was on the cover of Out magazine in an issue that also featured my very suggestive editorial spread with Neil Patrick Harris! I must convince her of this. Methinks a plan is afoot. But first, this plan. _ Okay good night, Mateo. Remember, peppy, Jane. Show him no fear. You're gonna do a great job falling asleep. Hello, everybody, and welcome to the sleeper bowl! It is the biggest night of the sleep training season. Tonight, the Villanueva team's strategy is a modified cry it out. The question is, Lee, do you think - they can make it work? - Well, they'll have to. And this first play is crucial. Jane needs to stay out of Mateo's room for five minutes. - _ - Luckily, she has a strong defense - _ - And a deep bench to support her. You need a distraction. Let's look up Michael's girlfriend. - Is that her? - ­I think it's her. You think or you know? No, I know. He's okay, he's okay. ­- Mm-hmm. What was that? _ _ What? Oh, my God, let me see Villanueva's been staying on the sidelines, letting Mateo run his own play. But he's struggling. Okay, that's enough. And in the final moments, there she is, stepping in! Oh! - _ - Man, and that will do it for Villanueva. Tough loss for this team. Back to square one, Lee. Jane. _ He wasn't, he hit his head. _ What? _ Oh, no, no, no, not mommy's compu Oh! No! That's gotta hurt! Oh, God. All right, that's for the blooper reel, Lee. Let's see it again, but in slow motion. Put a fork in her. Carry her off the court. Jane Villanueva is done. - You didn't save me any? - Sorry. Sorry. I'm trying to get it together to teach. _ _ _ Stop obsessing. You canceled it in time. Unless she gets notifications on her phone. In which case she'll see my name, know I'm his ex, and think I'm a creepy stalker. Maybe she's not his girlfriend. Maybe they're just friends. Who cares? If she's his friend, she'll warn her friend Michael that his ex is a creepy stalker. Either way, Jane Villanueva equals creepy stalker. _ Abuela _ You don't think I know that? I was actually thinking that he'd sleep with me a while. _ Yeah, just until he gets over this sleep regression. _ Look, I tried a little crying, because you said to, but I can't do it. _ Because it's so selfish! _ It's for me. It's so I'm well-rested and so I can go to school and teach, which is also for me. Don't you think I should do something for him? Hon, stop. You do so much. I just feel like I've been choosing myself a lot. And I feel guilty. _ _ _ _ _ What? _ I am plenty tough. I am! Oh, look. Look at this. McBaskets made his deadline. It's probably because I've been so firm with him. Hmm. Great. Let's have a quick look, shall we? Your paper is plagiarized. What? Oh, I-I didn't know. You didn't know you plagiarized your paper? From a famous paper, by the way. In fact, when I was in college, I wrote a paper about this very paper. Well, I was, like, inspired by it. Inspired to copy it? Okay, fine. You win. I'll I'll take a do-over. It should be noted that on another, more well-rested day, Jane might have been inclined to grant his request. No. You'll take an ""F."" But alas, this was not that day. Hey, no way. If you fail me, I won't be able to play. Well, you should have thought about that before. Are you serious? Yup. _ I remember her. - _ - Lived in an old house by the river. Kept to herself. - You're sure it's her? - Yup. Not too many people around here. When did you see her last? They're offering me a plea. I'll be out in 14. But there is a 24-hour clock on this offer. So maybe maybe I should Should just plead guilty to something you didn't do? - No, absolutely not. - What's my alternative? Go to trial? - Risk a long sentence? - I'll find you a new attorney, a better attorney. - She's the best. - Not if she's asking you to plead. That's ridiculous. I'm sorry. I'm just This is crazy. I know. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little dizzy. When was the last time you ate? Yeah, see, if you have to think about it, it's been too long. What do you want? - For my last meal? - No. For dinner. Ah, yes dinner. And Luca and I met while I was working at the Marbella. - It's nice to meet you. - You, too. I happen to be a huge fan of Luca and Byron's. - Nice to meet you, Liliana. - Thank you. _ I needed some spiritual guidance after I broke up with my partner of 25 years. Here's some spiritual guidance. Enjoy being single. Wait a minute. There's something queer about this dinner. Oh, good, Ricky Martin might stop by for dessert. Ah, I see. A big gay dinner to show Liliana how gay-friendly he is. So, should we eat? _ Allow me, please, Alba. Dear heavenly father, thank you for making the world such a beautifully diverse place, filled with all kinds of people who love whoever they want. Like men who love women, women who love women, men who love men - _ - Oh, no you told him? Way to be subtle. - I don't want to be subtle. - I'm sorry, Glamma. No, don't-don't be mad at Jane. I thought my dad was sick. Why didn't you tell me, mother? I-I couldn't. But no, I don't understand. Why didn't you tell me? Because! Because he promised not to tell anyone until I broke the news to you. And so now, telling you means that he tells everyone, he moves out, it actually happens, and my husband of 47 years is leaving me. Mother I need some air. I'm sorry. All a lie. I'm sure that's not true. I feel like a fool. No. No, you're not, mom. You didn't know. I mean, none of us did. I just wish you told me, instead of making me stage a ridiculous dinner with a random Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. Real honor. Are you okay? Oh, I'm terrified. I moved in with your father right out of my parents' house. I have never been alone. You're not alone, mom. You're not. I promise. Aw. There's nothing like the bond between mother and child. _ You promise? Right? _ _ However, sometimes that bond goes horribly wrong. Lucky that the one thing I know how to make is the one thing you're really craving. Your mother? She calls every day now. I haven't called her back. I thought you were ready to hear the whole story. Why she took $10 million to walk away from me? You know, the more that I think about it, what could she possibly say? Well, you don't know. Right? Look, at a certain point, under certain pressures I might have taken money like that. And I'm not a bad person. Right? No. You're not. Besides, she can't possibly be as bad as my mom. You have a point there. I'm sorry, do you have to do that? You're kind of holding the murder weapon. Not really. New ones. These have an ""M."" No, it had an ""M."" I saw the picture. Wait. Are you sure? Petra, this is new cutlery. It came in just before the Christmas party. After Ivan was killed? Yes. Definitely. Definitely? _ _ Hello? Jane, hi. I'm sorry to bother you at night. No, no, no, that's okay, what's going on? I was calling about a student in your class, Mr. McNeil. I'm hearing he plagiarized. Oh, uh, yeah. Was I supposed to report that? No, no, not at all. Here's the thing. I was wondering if there's any way he can have a second chance. Uh that was his second chance. I gave him an extension and then he plagiarized. I know. I agree. But this is a complicated situation. There's the reality of university politics to consider. Excuse me? Donors like to win basketball games. Oh, my God! This perfectly encapsulates what's wrong with higher education Privileging athletics and alumni contributions over academic rigor! Look, I hate this. And I'm not asking you to give McBaskets Mr. McNeil a free pass. Just one more shot. So to speak. Inspire him to do the paper. Yeah, okay, I'll try. He basically wants me to give the basketball player a free pass. - Seriously? - Seriously. _ Oh, my God. - Oh, my God! - Shh! And it looks like the Villanuevas have pulled the upset of the year! This one is going down in the record books. _ _ Uh, Matt? Hey, you talk to Professor Blake? Oh, a-and if you want that ""F"" removed so you can play tomorrow, you're gonna have to write a new paper today. Didn't Professor Blake tell you to give me a break? - No, he suggested I give you a break. - Yeah. You know, for an English teacher, I don't really think you understand nuance. I'm not doing you any favors by giving you a free pass. Actually, you would be doing me a huge favor by Not in the long run. I'm not a writer. I'm never gonna be. I'm not saying you have to be a writer. But you do have skills that would improve with a little hard work. I mean, why won't you even try? doing something they aren't good at? I don't see you out there on the court playing basketball. Try me. You serious? I make a basket, you have to sit down and write the paper. No, not for real. Yes, let's do it. Let's do it. One basket, I'll write you that paper. Oh! Ooh! Traveling. Double dribble. That's reaching in. It wasn't that much of a foul! Take it back! Lucky shot. Just like that! You all right? Yeah. I'm good. Okay. Let's do it again. Come on. Man, I have never seen anyone as bad at basketball as you are. But good effort. I'm gonna write you that paper. Dude, no way is my paper gonna suck as much as you do at basketball. Let's hope not. At last, a victory. Which Petra could use right about now. You did the right thing, taking the plea. You'll get out in a year, tops. Well, actually it's a different plea, the one that I took. One that involves no time. Because I turned you in. The murder weapon arrived at the hotel after Ivan was killed. Which means you falsified evidence. I'm hoping murder charges will follow. Magda Andel, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used Wrong choice. It should be noted that these words will come back to haunt Petra. But you don't know that yet. Pretend you don't know that. It's over. Thank you. Oh. No. Come here. I feel like I'm waking up from a bad dream. And speaking of dreams Oh, hey. - Hey. - Thanks for the tree top Why did you send a friend request to my girlfriend? Your girlfriend? Yeah. Oh, Michael, I-I'm so sorry. My mom saw you at the Cubano truck, and I was trying to distract myself during sleep training, and Mateo's little foot hit the keyboard. I canceled the request. I'm so, so sorry. It's just that when we saw each other Yeah, you didn't want to keep in touch. But then you left the tree topper. Because it meant a lot to you and your family. That's why I didn't knock. You know, it wasn't about us. Got it. Coincidentally, a line from ""Pride and Prejudice"" comes to mind here. _ That makes sense. Look, I'm-I'm finally, you know, happy again. And I want you to be happy, too. I want you to be happy. Again, tough love. Yeah, thanks. Which was, it turned out, exactly what she needed To move on. And that night she slept like a baby. A fully sleep-trained one, which, happily, Mateo was! _ I'm proud of you, too, Mateo. Of course, Rogelio didn't need sleep training. When he came out, he knew how to sleep. He knew how to suckle. Mm-hmm. Okay, I got the paper. McBaskets actually put some real work into it. I mean, it's like a solid C-minus. I'll get it. Jane? Grandpa? Dad? _ Ah. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Mom? Is that true? Oh, dear. The story, right. When I met your father, I was 24. I was new to the country. I worked in his hotel. I'd heard rumors about his wife Mia. How she was mentally unstable. And after her death Supposed death. Your father was devastated. Somehow, he Fixated on me. I was flattered, overwhelmed. I got married. I got pregnant. All in the first year in this country. But he was controlling. And away all the time. So, yes, I Turned to someone else. And when he found out, he threatened to destroy me. I was afraid. I was young. Well, you could've fought harder. For me. I know. I should have. But I'm here now. And I'm hoping it's not too late. And for them, at least, it wasn't. So, you were right. Your mother did love that lake. When she escaped, that's where she went. Apparently, she had a quiet life. She died about eight years ago. Natural causes. Preliminary DNA tests on the body confirm it. Which means she couldn't be Mutter because Mutter's been active recently. Well, at least there's that. But wait. ­- I can't. If Mia isn't Mutter, then who is? That's when Mia disappeared. That's also when Emilio's company purchased Bar Lunara, which we know is Mutter's money laundering site. Yeah, but Mia's dead. She wasn't the one hiding money there. Exactly, because someone else had access to Emilio's company. Because something else happened in 1983. He remarried. It's her! Rafael? Found it. I'll be right there. Mutter's signature was blue silk ties. No. Where is the flash drive? What are you talking about? The flash drive you traded for Mateo. Who did you give it to? We gave it to Rose. No, she doesn't have it who does? I don't know. We gave it to her. Why are you doing this? What is happening? _"
"Okay, people. Time to reboot and refresh. As we all know by now, Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated with Rafael's sperm. Meanwhile, Rafael's ex-wife Petra intentionally inseminated herself with his sperm, because she really does love him. I know, it's crazier than anything Jane could dream up. And remember, she's in grad school to become a writer. Oh, and speaking of unexpected developments  - Jane? - Grandpa? Rogelio's mother outed his father. Your grandfather is gay. So, yeah, mama drama. Oh, and speaking of, Rafael just learned his mother Elena is the international crime boss known as Mutter. And Detective Michael has just realized that as well. - It's her! - But unfortunately, they did not get there fast enough. So let's hope Rafael's okay. Let's begin today with a portrait of the writer as a young woman. It should be noted that all of her QuinceaÃ±era gift money, and three weeks of comparison shopping had led young Jane Gloriana Villanueva to this very moment. Now I can write anywhere anytime. And so she took her first laptop everywhere, waiting for the muse to strike. And she waited. And still waiting. Seriously, anytime, muse. She's ready. And just when she was beginning to feel defeated, there it was. That's when Jane learned a very important lesson. You never know when inspiration will strike. And let me tell you, when it happens  there's nothing quite like the rush of finding the flow. _ _ _ A night like this is just the best feeling in the world. Well, to a woman who's never had sex. Ah! _ _ Because I finally cracked my novel. I tried, like, ten different openings. And then last night, it just came in, like, a rush. Yay, yay, yay! Why are you so happy? Because you cracked your novel. And after last night, Rogelio finally sees his mother for the master manipulator she is. Ah, yes, last night. _ _ _ _ You don't. I do. Mom. Come. Let's check in on the master manipulator, shall we?  It's another beautiful day to be Rogelio   Wake up, Rogelio   The day awaits.  And in honor of the first day of shooting of Tiago A TravÃ©s Del Tiempo. Wow, she is good. - I know what you're doing, Mother. - Huh? You're trying to seduce me into forgiving you with a perfect blend of savory and sweet breakfast items. _ But it will not work this time. Rogelio, I am simply making you breakfast. It's what I always did before your professional milestones, okay? - _ - So, when you say your line, show you them your beautiful soul and your beautiful teeth. Chewel's Gum oozes with flavor. Enough. I know we made an amazing and dynamic team. But that doesn't change the fact that you lied just to get my sympathy. Well, that is right. I-I did. But that's because I knew that when the truth came out, I wouldn't have it. I just want you to be happy. You and Dad both. Oh, and we were, we were. That is what's making this so difficult. I knew that your father had his stuff on the side. But we were partners in other ways. So why is he now trying to, trying to change everything? Rogelio? Please talk to him. Convince him that he doesn't have to leave me. _ Yep, he definitely has to leave her. Wait, where's Mateo? He was playing right here on the floor. Mateo! - Mateo? - Mateo? Oh, my God, look! He's crawling! Oh, my God, he's crawling! - He's crawling! - Slow down, speed demon. My computer! No, no, no, no! Please don't be dead! - Please. - Oh, my God. No, no. Try to turn it on. - _ - I am. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. This is the worst thing ever. Well, maybe not ever. You'll recall Rafael was injected with a mysterious liquid by his mother. - _ - Or Mutter, as it were. Where is the flash drive? What are you talking about? The flash drive you traded for Mateo. Who did you give it to? I gave it to Rose. No, she doesn't have it. Who does? I think we can all agree that that's worse than possibly breaking a computer. But in fairness to Jane, she didn't know any of that. And hardship isn't a competition. My mother Yeah, we know. We know. _ Why'd you want to talk to me alone? Because my mother wanted the chip. The one we traded for Mateo. Do you even want to know what's on the chip? - No. - All of the faces Sin Rostro changed. But I gave that to Nadine to give to Rose. My mother says Rose doesn't have it. Oh, my God. Nadine must not have given it to her. That's why I wanted to talk to you, away from your partner. 'Cause we probably broke some laws trying to get Mateo back. You didn't. I did. It should be noted that at this moment Michael knew he had to come clean. But that didn't make it any easier. - What the hell, Cordero? - Jane's baby was taken. I had to get him back. - This, it's - I know. But the chip, that's what this is all about. Rose took Mateo to get it. Elena took Luisa to get Rose to give it to her. But Rose doesn't have it because Nadine didn't give it to her. So where is it? I don't know. Yet. But give me some time, please. What-what are you what are you gonna do? Please Wait. Hold on. Just Yeah. I'm not sure if we can recover the files. I'll ask you to keep in mind that, like hardship, the importance of files is relative. Please. If there is anything you can do, it is so important. Th-These are important files? Well, in that case, then I'm gonna really try. Yeah, I guess you get that a lot. It's all relative, you know? Look, I'm gonna give it to you straight. OJ, it's like napalm for keyboards. But it's okay. It's okay. L-Look, I-I've done this before. I'm gonna go in the back, run some diagnostics. You wait right over there. Regardless of what happens, I'm gonna set you up with a sweet cloud service so that this never happens to you again. Okay? Um, heavy flirt alert. What are you talking about? The eye contact. The hand on the arm. He wants to set up your sweet cloud? Oh. I-I just My head is not there right now. I'm in a crisis. - What? - Nothing. I just think that the real crisis is that you've lost touch with the fact that you are a 24-year-old mom - and not a grandma. - Lina. I'm serious. When was the last time you got any action? Virgin action, even. My birthday? When you kissed Michael? Maybe. That was six months ago! No wonder you couldn't see the flirting. You need a reboot, lady. You see how I used the tech lingo there? Okay, listen, I just don't really have time right now. - I-I - No. No. I refuse to accept that. You could find a dozen eligible randos on Cynder while you're sitting on the toilet. - Look, I'm-a show you. - Oh, God. As romantic as that sounds, I want a meet cute. _ If I'm gonna meet somebody, I'm gonna do it - the old-fashioned way. - It's 2016. Ok. Cupid is the old-fashioned way. That is so depressing. Ooh, he is coming back. - Look natural. Sexy natural. - What? How? Shoulders back. Hi. Uh, - what happened? - Not the coolest sitch. But let me keep it a few more days and go deep. But you have a hard copy, right? O-Of your document? Yeah. I mean, I have, like, a middle-of-the-night one, not with revisions, but I threw it away. The garbage. Where's the garbage? _ No. From the Marbella Business Center. _ Oh, you are saving my life. Thank you. It's been such a traumatic day. Again, relative. I hear you. Can we talk, actually? Out here? And so Rafael downloaded the whole sordid story. The injection. The flash drive. The fact that his mother was an international crime lord. Oh. Yeah. So I thought I'd just watch Mateo here today. - Are you okay? - I am. I promise. Go write. Which, for the record, she was trying to do, when  Hi! Hey. I'm Brad. Oh, I look a little different with stubble. Excuse me? I know. Way different. What you got there, a mocha latte? Oh, no I, uh, I'm actually working. - Oh, am I early? - Early for ? - Our date? - Our what now? You're the one who suggested coming here. On Cynder? I'm not on Cynder. You're Jane. I am. Yes, you are. Oh, my God. These pictures. Wh ? And Ã¢ÂÂrandoÃ¢ÂÂ? I've never used that word before in my life. _ Okay, I'm never telling you where I'm at again. Oh, stop. Did you have fun, at least? No. It was very awkward and confusing. That's because it wasn't a match. Otherwise, it would've been - the most romantic story ever. - Okay. Send me the profile info, I'm taking it down. Fine. I'm sorry. I love you. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ And I realized he was right. So, I'm going to make my mother my manager again. What? The Kris to my Kim. It makes total sense. That's how we started out. Rogelio, that's a terrible idea. Why? She needs this. I mean, I know you don't like my mother, but I was hoping you'd be more supportive of her in her time of need. Hey! - Hi. - Hi, Mr. Sweetface. Oh, my goodness can you get cuter? How was writing? Oh, it was, um Interesting dilemma. Do you tell your ex-boyfriend about an ambush blind date? Lina ambushed me with a blind date. I guess if you're Jane, you do. - She what? - She set up a fake profile and set up a date. - That's crazy. - I know. Was it a match, or ? Stop. No. - Okay. - No. Ooh. Ooh, whoo! Who needs a diaper change, huh? Okay, we'll be right back. Yes. Let's go. Yeah. Mommy's so proud of you. Yes, she is. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ He Petra Wait, what? Stop, stop. I'll be right there. _ Yeah. Okay, I understand. Hey. Hey, what's going on? The babies are fine. Uh, there was some bleeding. I got scared. But they're they're okay? Yes. The oxygen levels are solid and the babies look good. But she's gonna have to stay on strict bed rest for the next week at least. Of course, of course. We'll get you a nurse. _ Not okay? Jane's thesis. Okay, back to it. _ _ _ Okay, take that profile down. Then it's back to work. _ - _ - 42 messages? Whoa. Okay, let's at least read them. That's just common courtesy. I'm Zander. 32, into Vin Diesel movies, Greek food, and hopefully you. Damn, your pictures are hot! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Colby here. 26. Me: smart, athletic, successful, confident humble. You: really big brains. LOL! Yeah! Taylor. My sister has a friend called Jane. She's a freak. What's that? A wink? What's a wink? Oh, wow. That's flattering. Let's swap out the picture  Something a little more Jane. Now, let's see what happens. Hey. I'm Greg. Yes, really a scientist. I love books, live music and the beach. Hey, who's that cute kid? Reminds me of my nephew. And just like that, she found the flow. _ See? Never know when inspiration will strike. _ Wow! It looks like we're going on a date, people! _ It's 2016, Abuela. Ok. Cupid is the old-fashioned way.  Looks like someone had an about-face. And it's just 30 minutes. I won't even buy a muffin if there's no spark. I became involved in this coastal ecology project studying Leidyula, which is a kind of slug native to Miami. Anyways, after I graduated, the conservancy hired me full-time, and and I've been in Miami ever since. _ _ _ Uh, what? N-Nothing. I-I was just thinking about how my son would get a kick out of touching a slug. Oh, Mr. Sweetface? Yeah. You remembered his nickname. Yeah. Oh. One sec. It's work. Let me get rid of them. _ Look at Jane surprised by this happy turn of events. - Also surprised - I've been trying to call you. This is a report I wrote outlining all your violations. Give me one good reason I shouldn't drive it over to the chief right now. I mean  I can't think of any. Because you need me to find Rose and Elena. Nobody knows this case better than me, okay? Nobody. Fair point. Still, illegal. I want to know everything that happened between you and Nadine in Mexico. You leave nothing out. You'd meet at the beach? Right. Once a month. Daylight. A tourist place. - Did you hear anything? - Nothing. Actually, I'm gonna overrule here. We'll take the snapshot version. _ _ _ _ _ Stop, stop. - You're going to fast. - I'm sorry. Okay, so on the day of the meet She said she had information. Rose is meeting an importer, and they always meet alone No guns, no guards. This is our chance to take her. When's it happening? Tonight. What was - Ow! - Sorry. Sorry. I'm on edge. Yeah, no kidding. You're bleeding. Sit down. No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's fine. Sit down. Let me stop the blood. I have a first aid kit in the car. Question. Do you trust me? I don't know. Oh, you have to trust me that's the only way tonight's gonna work. If it doesn't then it's on you. And I didn't. And it is. Her death is on me. Damn. Nadine really got under his skin. So please don't go to the chief. - Not yet. - I just need more time. I've never had to ask for an extension before. I just can't seem to get my rhythm back. Okay. A story. - Hmm? - I have one. To put this in perspective. Ernest Hemingway's wife went to visit him in Switzerland, and she took a big, green briefcase of all of her husband's manuscripts because there was a publisher that was interested. At a train stop she got up to get a glass of water, and when she went back to her seat, the briefcase was gone. Well, then what happened? Besides Hemingway divorcing his wife. Then he wrote The Sun Also Rises. And the point of the story is that he never would have written that book if he spent his time trying to recreate what he'd already lost. Yeah. I just keep thinking that what I had before was so much better. So stop thinking about your thesis for 24 hours. I'm serious, let it go. She fired me. - No - Your key card and your bill. I have dealt with some nightmare patients, but she's a real piece of work. What happened? She was annoying. Too cheerful. That's the second nurse you've fired. The agency won't send another one. I don't need a nurse. I can take care of myself. I'll call room service if I'm hungry. And what happens if there's an emergency? I'll call you or the concierge. You make everything twice as difficult as it needs to be. Krishna, patch all my calls through to Petra's suite. Yeah, I'm going to be working from here. I'm not supposed to work at all for the next 24 hours, so, you know, it's perfect timing to actually hang out with Slug Guy again. And thank you, Lina, you were right about online dating. And thank you, Lina, it's a fun diversion. - What? - Well, that's weird. I can't find his profile; he just disappeared. Oh no, honey. - He blocked you. - What?! No. Yeah. No, if he disappeared, that's what happened. But he was feeling it. And he canceled his lunch to hang out more. And then his friend called and said that his car broke down. Oh. No Yep, I know what happened. One sec, it's work. Let me get rid of 'em. _ I wasn't clingy. You, Greg, Mateo and the slug. Well, I do have a kid to think about. Only if you're trying to find his next dad. Are you? - I mean, I don't know. - No. The answer is no, okay? You are 24, okay? You need to have fun, let loose, kiss a rando. Oh, you know what? We're going out tonight. Yeah. - What? - No, I can't. Yes, you can. _ _ _ Okay, my apron is not rigged to fly off. What's going on? Sorry. Your mother switched the aprons out at the last minute. - Oh. - Uh-oh. Looks like Kris is causing some trouble for Kim. So what's up? I'm hearing you hate the ending of the script. What? No. That's what your mom said. I'll be right back. Mother, Mother, Mother. I see you've met our new costar. We were very lucky to steal Adriana - from Bandido de Tu Corazon. - Ooh. _ _ _ Although perhaps I made a mistake. Uh, wh-what did you say to her? Nothing, I told her a little lip wax would go a long way. Ooh, diva. Adriana, please wait. Wait. Sor She comes on a little strong, but she's well-intentioned. She's not gonna be around, is she? Don't worry, I'll talk to her. - I'll take care of it. - I hope so. Or Tiago might have to travel through time to find himself a new costar. Is that a new Ã¢ÂÂor elseÃ¢ÂÂ look? Yes, I have recently added it to my repertoire. Is it threatening? Extremely. Good. How was work? Fine. Perfect, in fact. What happened to your neck? Oh. Nothing. - You have a rash. - Might be the new foundation they're using. You sure everything's okay? You seem tense. I would tell you about it, but I know you're biased and have a bone to pick with my mother, so I don't feel comfortable sharing with you. Come on. I feel bad. I-I messed up. Tell me what's happening. She's driving everyone crazy. I have to give Adriana an extended close-up just to keep her from quitting. _ _ Okay, so talk to your mom. Tell her to tone it down a bit. Coming, Mateo. Where's Jane? She actually went out. Like, to a bar. Which brings us here. - Like, to a bar. - All right, where are all these exciting prospects I was promised? Have two more drinks, and they'll start to appear. - Let's take a shot then. For efficiency. - Yeah. - Oh, my God. Okay. Don't look now, - What? but over your left shoulder is the guy from the computer store. - Oh. - Stop. Be subtle. - Okay. - Mm. - Hey, computer guy? - What? - What are you doing?! - Come on. What are the odds? He's here, you're here, and he's perfect fling material. Dax, hi! We met at the computer store. The orange juice. - Orange juice. - Yes. That's right. How's my computer looking? Uh, am I wearing a lanyard around my neck? - No. - Actually, we're all gonna hit the skate park in a few. You should come with. Yeah. No way she's going to a skate park. You want to stay low on the board. - Uh-huh. - And just feel it out. You're not that high off the ground, so if you fall, no biggie. - Ready? - Yup, I'm ready. - You're sure? Hop on. - Yeah. Okay. Good. Good. You feeling it? Maybe a little? Great. Now, now, you want to carve it out. I don't even know what that means. Oh. Hold on. Okay. You're a natural! - I am? - Slow down. Slow down. No. Wait. What now? More crackers, please. Without sesame seeds. Oh, and water. Wow. Seriously? What? With the attitude? Look, if you don't want to be here, you can leave. I can't leave, because you fired the nurses. - I had to. - Had to? What do you mean, you had to? I had to. They kept smiling at me and saying Ã¢ÂÂDon't worry. You're gonna be fine.Ã¢ÂÂ That's what they said the last time, and it wasn't fine! I should point out what's unspoken between them right now. _ I get it. I'll get you your water and crackers, okay? Okay. All right. We're all good. You know, I've never actually seen someone catch air their first time up. I didn't mean to go so high. Well, you can't let the fear of falling keep you from flying. That is so true. And I should point out, there's something unspoken here, too. _ _ - Hmm. - Well, it's all good. Thanks, Doc. Now, wait. You're shivering. I didn't see that coming. Well, then you weren't paying attention. I had fun tonight. Is it over? Maybe we can continue this on a weekend. - Mm. - This Saturday? Oh, Saturday I can't. I'm going out of town with my girlfriend. You're kidding. _ But I mean, I'm mostly mad at myself. I actually started imagining weekends at the skate park, because I don't know how to do this. - What? - Date with a kid. I mean, how often do I bring him up, and in what context, because the moment you do, it gets serious real quick, you know? What? You've always been serious. I mean, you were gonna marry your first-grade boyfriend. _ My point is, you're a relationship person. Yeah. I am. You know, and the thought of going through all this again. Trying to find the right person, going on so many terrible dates. - Till one isn't terrible - And then what? I have to start over again with someone? It just sounds so exhausting. I just want to skip to the end. So maybe you're not ready yet. Why force it? Maybe you're right. You know, I have Mateo and my thesis. I have enough going on right now. I'm sorry. I got to go see Rogelio. Apparently, his mom is driving him crazy. You had a shadow across your face! I am going to talk to the cinematographer. Again. Mom! Deep breaths. - You can handle it. - I can't. I'm gonna have to fire my mother. - Rogelio. - You think I want to do this? But there's no other option. Which brings us here. - Now. - I told them - you don't pop in peach. - It's actually more of a coral, and I do look good in it. Mom, this is not working. I thought it was a good idea to have you here, but you're just too present. And opinionated. I don't understand. Isn't that why you asked me here? For my opinions? No. I-I asked you here because you were struggling. And I wanted you to have something to occupy your time. Oh. I'm so sorry. No, no. Say no more. I am a professional. I know how show business works. It's fine. It's fine. _ _ Well I remembered a sentence. Just the one sentence. _ _ _ Hmm? _ _ Abuela _ _ I got it. And, you know there are some older people that Internet-date. I can always sign you up. _ Are you kidding? With that dress you wore at the baptism? You okay? Well, my son just fired me. So not great. Okay, look. So you know, I I made him do it. So blame me, okay? Not him. You're lying through your teeth. What? No, I'm not. Xiomara I overheard you two. - You think I want to do this? - Rogelio! But there's no other option. _ No. Absolutely no. You don't fire your mom. But I appreciate the effort. I'll be okay. I know you will be. And I know it's scary starting over, but we're here. Okay? All of us. Also figuring out her next step  _ _ Okay. I'm putting in everything. Mm-hmm. _ _ Mm-hmm. Oh. _ Okay, so then the Web site takes all this information and comes up with _ _ A text. _ Even better. My computer. _ When suddenly, and I should say, quite without warning  there it was. The spark. Miss. Last stop. Got to get off. See, it's true what they say  or what I said earlier. You never know when inspiration's going to strike. What was Ow! Oh, you have to trust me That's the only way tonight's gonna work. If it doesn't then it's on you. You have to trust me That's the only way tonight's gonna work. If it doesn't  What was Ow! Then it's on you. It's on you. Like I said, Nadine really got under his skin. Hey. _ _ Hey. Your computer. They got all the files back. Thank you. And guess who else is back? Oh. Glad you came, Liliana. Well, of course I came. I am the one who suggested that this last scene be rewritten. I want to see the results. Manuel. _ _ _ _ _ And speaking of pride  And action! Disculpe. _ _ _ _ La policia! - It was on me, literally. - What is that? A computer chip. Nadine left it with me, and I-I didn't know I had it. Honestly, I don't know what I am going to do next. But I'll figure something out. I am resilient, if nothing else. I know you are. And, uh I want to give you this. Since I no longer need it. For Xiomara. You know you found a good woman. I think you should marry her. Now, go back to your telenovela. And we should return to ours. Ã¢ÂÂNatashaÃ¢ÂÂ? It's a good name. Like Boris and Natasha? Fine. Throw it out. Next. Oh, I like that. This was at the top of my list. Show me. Yes. Oh, I love this. Let's see them together. I like that. Wow, it's starting to feel real. My mother's a monster. But you're not. I know what you're thinking. Who's Pablo Alonso Segura? I wanted the love story to start right there. Completely unexpected but inevitable at the same time. - I love it. - Yeah? Yeah, there's no wonder you went crazy looking for your chapter; it's great. Well, no, I actually wrote that on the bus. It's a lot better than what I had before. Uh, I'm gonna be sure and tell my nephew that next time he cries because his little brother crushed his tower. Oh, how old are your nephews? Three and five. Man, I can't get enough of those little guys. _ Uh, have you read this? That is one of my favorite books. Me too. Read it every year. _ I was going to recommend it for the magical realism. Hmm. Is that a grilled cheese sandwich? _ _ Your brains are so hot."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right. Let's do this.  Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated  with Rafael's sperm.  And from there  things got really crazy.  See. They fell in love  and then borke up. Oh.  And Rafael's ex-wife Petra  intentionally inseminated herself,  because she still loves Rafael,  and they've been getting closer.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  - (screams) - Well, imagine this:  We have not one, but two crime lords on the loose.  First, Rose aka Sin Rostro  aka Luisa's great love.  LUISA: Do you remember  what we got that first time that we were together?  Powdered donuts from the vending machine.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And Rafael has just learned  that his mother, Elena, is the international  crime boss known as Mutter.  And they were both fighting over this chip.  Do you even want to know what's on the chip inside?  -  - All of the faces Sin Rostro changed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And as for our Jane,  well, she's trying to juggle being a mommy  with her dreams of becoming a writer of romance.  So, she enrolled in grad school and was studying  under Professor Jonathan Chavez,  who she might've just had a sexy dream about,  so let's see what's up with that.  Jane Villanueva grew up in a house with three women,  one bathroom     and no boundaries.  Abuela, mom's in a rush, remember?  She's got that interview.  Actually, I cancelled.  I just don't want to be a dance teacher.  (spits, gasps)  - Eww! - Oh  Gross, get it out, get it out!  - Oh, Janie. - Oh!  - I'm sorry. - Maybe we wouldn't have to share a bathroom  if you got a regular job.  But there are some lines  that should never be crossed.  I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have said that.  No, I-it's okay.  It's just not easy to give up on my dream, that's all.  It never is.  -  - You can't just say you had a dream, I need details.  I don't remember anything specific.  (funky music plays)  Yeah, I call bull.  Enough!  I have to draw the line somewhere,  and telling my mom the ins and outs  of my sex fantasy is definitely crossing it.  Did you say ins and outs?  Seriously?  - What, are you 15? - Maybe.  So, you gonna go for it?  With Professor Chavez?  Mom, h-he's my advisor.  It wouldn't be appropriate.  Then why'd you put on lipstick  to go meet with him?  What's that shade called,  Lusty Virgin?  (Mateo crying)  Coming, Mateo, and guess what?  Your grandmother's a bigger baby than you.  (laughs)  (phone chimes)  Oh, shoot.  Hey, so Diego finally texted me back,  and he can meet the day after tomorrow at 4:00.  Could Rafael watch the baby?  Ah, he's got meetings and I I'm teaching.  Sorry, I mean if I want to get on the schedule,  I have to kiss the ring.  Yeah, of course, I'll text Chepa.  ROGELIO: I'm here.  Ah.  Mom, he wants to do this for you.  Come on, it's sweet.  Xiomara, meet your 40 and fabulous  glam squad.  Ah.  My hair stylist, Shalisha.    My costume designer, Marina.    And your photographer, Alejandra.    Nice to meet you guys.  - (Xiomara chuckling) - Yes, yes.  I thought I was getting my picture taken.  I didn't know this was gonna be a big production.  Getting one's picture taken is always a big production.  Besides, we need wonderful images to put up  at your birthday party.  Which we agreed to keep small.  Agreed.

I think you should marry her.  What?  Nothing.  You know something about this. What is it?  Mom, do you really want to know?  Yes.  I heard Liliana give the ring to Dad.  Said to propose to you.  Really?  So, I take it that'd be a yes?  - Yeah. - Oh  (crying): I think we're finally ready.  Oh, this must be the surprise he was hinting about.  I feel so bad for giving him such a hard time.  - (keys in door) - Oh!  Take it off.

What if he doesn't feel it?  You know what, let me get you your own copy  so you can take notes.  So, pretty clear sign.  He's not interested.  Yeah, I wanted to ask you something.  I-I hope I'm not crossing a line here.  Go ahead. He's going to ask me out.  Yeah, I saw your dad at the reading,  and my mom is a huge fan of his telenovelas.  Ooh, that's a blow.  So, I was wondering if  it's not too inconvenient to,  maybe we could visit the set some time with you.  Okay, at least he wants you there.  Yeah, totally.  That's really easy for me to organize.  I'd love to.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Enough.

Yeah, of course.  Hi, baby.  (smooches)  I, uh, I don't understand.  He swallowed something?  A penny, a marble?  I understand it was a diamond.  (quietly): What?  Look, he's fine, and he'll pass it.  But, you're lucky, this could have been much worse.  - So lucky. - I know.  If he develops fever, or a cough, bring him back.  Otherwise  just keep an eye out  for a diamond in his poop.  Thank you, Doctor.  I'm sorry, Jane.  You see, I was planning to propose to Xiomara,  so I was showing Matelio the diamond.  - You're mad. - Dad.  - You are. - Who shows a diamond to a baby?  I was playing with him,  but then you called about the tweets  Oh, so, it's my fault?  I'm-I'm just saying I you distracted me.  I called because I knew that  you weren't ready to take care of him,  and clearly I was right because look at where we are.  You know what, I'm not even mad at you, I'm mad at myself  because I knew I shouldn't have left you alone with the baby.  It was just so scary,  - thinking about what could've happened. - No kidding.  Who doesn't feel it when a baby pulls a button off your shirt?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Button, diamond, same difference.  It was an accident, and I was really hard on him.  And I'd cancel the set visit,  if I didn't think it'd make him feel worse.  Ah, yes, the set visit with Professor Chavez   and his mom.  But you're not taking the baby on your date, right?  No, I'm gonna drop him off at Raf's, and it's not a date.  It could become one.  Just pay attention to the signs.  What signs?  Look, it's been a while since I've been single,  and Professor Chavez is my advisor,  you know, I have to make sure.  So, what am I looking for?  Well, okay, first off,  he'll tell you to stop calling him Professor Chavez.  -  - Mm-hmm.  Then he'll start being more familiar, you know?    He'll talk about non-school events.    -  - He'll touch you.  -  - He'll lean in.  Okay, got it.  Yeah, so, like, if he does any of those things,  - I just -Respond.  - Uh-huh. - Show him you're open.  He's your teacher.  He needs to know you're cool with it,  otherwise it gets creepy.    And speaking of creepy   - (bell rings) - Jane.  Have there been any developments?  No, none, but we're on the lookout.  Look, I don't know if you got  my voice mail last night,  but I am so sorry about what I said.  Why?  It was what you believed.  Dad, come on  Oh, your guests are here.  The show must go on.  (whispering): Hi.  Uh, Dad,  this is Professor Chavez.  Professor Chavez, this is my dad Rogelio.  Jonathan, please.  -  - Right, Jonathan.  - Rogelio, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.  This is my mom, Diana.  Lovely to meet you.  (sighs)  Wow.  (giggles)  Oh, don't worry,  this happens all the time.  No need to talk.  Just grab my arm  and I will give you a tour of the set.  (sighing)  (laughs)  I'm freaking out a little.  I've never seen my mom like that.  Oh, this happens, trust me.  No, but you don't understand.  My mom is, like, hard core.  Growing up, I saw her laugh twice.    Oh, my God,  -  - I think my mom is gonna  try to kiss your dad.  Huh, looks like things are looking up for Jane   Unfortunately, not for poor Petra.  Izzie.  Hi.  Did you get the Miami News Gazette art critic to my show?  Yes, I did.  I wanted to mend fences.  She is so influential.  Exactly, and my art was not ready for her.  The review is terrible.  Which I'm sure is what you wanted.  What? No.  No, no, no, I was trying to help.  I-I just wished you would've consulted with me first.  - Well, I didn't. - I could have made calls.  I wanted to take care of this myself.  - Why? - Because I am not  some useless trophy wife, okay?  Just for the record, I never thought that you were.  Okay, let's not get sentimental, all right?  You stole me away from your business rival.  Sure sounds like a trophy to me.  Yeah, that might have been why I was interested in you,  but that's not what I loved about you.  I loved that you were the kind of person  that saved $743 on fish filets.  PETRA: And I just, I couldn't shake the feeling  that the caterer was gouging us,  - so I went to the fish market - No, you didn't.  - And I priced it myself. - Yes, I did.  - You went to the fish market? - I was right.  We were paying $12 per tilapia.  They're seven dollars a cut.  That's $743 right there.  So, you saved $743 on a $100,000 wedding?  No, on a $99,257 wedding.  - Oh, you did. - Yes, I did.  (giggling)  That might be the answer.  Free fish.  Do you know who I am?  Sorry, ma'am, no.  Luisa Alver.  You drove me around a few times last year.  With Rose Solano.    Look, no one knows I'm here,  but I'm desperate.  I need to get in touch with her.  Please.  I love her,  and I know I shouldn't.  I've tried to stop, but I just  I can't let go because  there's a part of me that thinks that she's coming back for me,  that we're gonna be together.  Okay, look, you don't have to say anything.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No way he was going to.  Just  give Rose a message for me.  Tell her that if she wants me to wait,  she should send me donuts.  She'll know the kind.  JONATHAN: A second donut?  (chuckles)  This is getting embarrassing.  It's human nature, people can't turn down free food.  - She put seven granola bars in her purse, I saw her. - (giggling)  You lose something?  I think I left my cell phone in the car.  Mm. Can't do that with a baby at home.  I'll walk you.  I could use some air.  Hey, that looks like  some self-initiated body contact right there.  Seriously, Jane, thanks for doing this.  I mean, I  I haven't seen my mom this happy in  it's been along time.  Oh, my pleasure.  Oh, it means a lot.  And I had fun, too.  Me, too.  Oh, my God, the lean in.  (record scratches)  (smooching)  Or maybe he was just going  -  - to get the car door.  You misread the signs. We've all done it.  Really? You've made out with a guy's sweater  as he desperately dodged your kiss?  Oh, I just keep replaying it in my mind.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: For your viewing pleasure.  (smooching)  Stop it. I can't.  So, how did you leave things?  Yeah, cut the wheel a little more to the left  - (both shout) - Sorry. I it's just it's a new car,  - CAR VOICE: Back up. - so I don't really know the parameters yet.  Straighten it out now.  A little more, a little more, great.  Okay, now let's get out of here.  You kissed his freaking sweater.  So, what are you gonna do?  I just got to talk to him about it, you know?  I'm just I'm gonna  deal with it head on.  Or just transfer to a different school.  So, I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry.  Oh good, she went with option one.  I only kissed you because  I thought I was getting signs from you.  - From me? - Well, because  I really wasn't trying to  No, that is not what I'm saying.  Because I could get in trouble.  Well, that's not what I mean.  I had a crush, and I guess I projected on you.  But now that it's clear  that it's all in my head,  I was hoping that we can just move forward  and pretend like it never happened.  I don't know if that's possible.  It is for me, really.  Please?  Can't we just put this behind us?  We'll give it a try.  (laughs)  That's your solution?  Yes.  A free wedding.  What's the catch?  Look, The Marbella can't afford  the bad press if you cancel.  Plus, your friends will stay,  they'll have a great time, and they'll come back,  which is good for us in the long run.  I have one condition.  You sure you're okay with this?  Yeah. Whatever, it's fine.  It's not me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it wasn't.  Not anymore.  Which brings us here,  now, to Jane,  who is back to writing after meeting with Jonathan.  Actually, let's go back  to calling him Professor Chavez.          Yeah, sometimes when you cross a line, you can't go back.  JANE: I screwed everything up.  I mean, now I'm censoring my writing  because I don't want him to take it the wrong way.  - (shower running) - I'm sorry, hon.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  Okay, no more complaining.  We're gonna have fun at your party tonight.  (groans)  (Alba screams)    Maybe we wouldn't have to share a bathroom  if you actually went  to these interviews and got a regular job.  ALBA: Xiomara!  Sorry, Ma, sorry.  (phone rings)  Hello?  Oh, hi.  Why aren't you home getting ready?  So, I have some bad news,  and I feel terrible.  What's going on?  I have to work tonight,  - singing. - What?  Diego offered me a slot, last minute.  But it's your party.  There are 40 doves waiting for you to free them.  I know, but  I have to show him  that singing is my priority.  Xiomara, any other night.  But he's offering tonight.  But I need you at the party.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Because he's going to propose.  I can't believe you're doing this.  I can't believe you are.  It's my career, Rogelio,  and that is more important than a party that I didn't even want.  VolarÃ© como un ave azul   Y al llegar, te dirÃ©   Quiero estar, siempre feliz   Junto a tÃ­   BrillarÃ¡, la estrella fugaz   Que a tus pies, caerÃ¡   Como yo   Que quiero estar   Junto a tÃ­   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall,  Luisa was waiting for a message from Rose.  -  -  Desde el cielo Ã¡ngeles dorados   (knocking on door)  Anunciaron el momento en el que naciste tÃº   Hey.  Come in.  Crearon el encanto de Tu Luz   No message from Rose?  Mm-mm.  Who cares?  I don't need her in my life.  Luisa  Mm-hmm?  Deseando   Amanecer   I can't.  (sighs)  Look, I know you were helping us,  when you were talking about how you felt  about Rose?  But that sounded real.  It's 'cause I never got closure.  I know.  But for us  now is not the time.  En el que naciste tÃº   Y en un sueÃ±o hecho realidad   Crearon el encanto   So, the new stationery came in.  De Tu Luz   I love it.  Very funny.  I'm just really glad it all worked out.  Me, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, their legs are definitely touching.  Junto a tÃ­   Es asÃ­ que por la Ciudad   El Amor seguirÃ¡   Would you keep still?  I almost poked my eye out.  Sorry, just nerves, I guess.  You should be nervous.  You fell in love with him.  I told you not to cross that line.  Deseando siempre vivir   Junto a tÃ­   We can't.  Why not?  Seriously, why not?  Are you over Jane?  Junto a tÃ­.   I'm really glad you came.  Of course I came.  I overreacted with your mom.  Only because, well,  I wanted to propose tonight, you know?  Yeah, I know.  And look, Dad, I overreacted, too,  and I'm so sorry I yelled at you.  That's not why I was upset.  Mm.  It's just  w-what if it's true?  What if I'm not good with kids?  I mean, I want them with your mother.  Dad  What if I'm terrible at it?  I mean, you turned out perfect without me.  (laughs softly)  Trust me, I wish I had you.  And you'll be great, you know?  You'll learn as you go.  You can't just jump in and expect to know everything.  I promise.  You'll get there.  Oh, and I have something for you.  It showed up this afternoon.  (sighs)  It's been washed and disinfected a dozen times,  which is why it's so shiny.  Yeah.  (knock on door)  You were wonderful.  I'm so glad you came.  Ooh, and guess what?  Diego's giving me Monday nights.  I'm back in.  I'm so glad.  And I'm sorry we fought.  It was only because well  well, I had planned something.  My buddy, Ryan Gosling, said, âThe only quality I look for  âin a woman is that she's Eva Mendes.  ""There's nothing else I'm looking forâ""  At this point I was going to wave to Eva,  and then look at you, and tell you  that you are what I've been looking for.  (laughs softly)  And I think back to when we first met,  when we were 16, and I think that  my whole journey up to now  has been about finding my way back to you.  I haven't had time to have it set.  (cries)  It's a long story.  Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva,  I want to spend my life with you,  and raise kids with you  so  will you marry me?  I  want to.  Okay.  So?  But  there is one thing  that I didn't know, but I'm realizing.  I don't want to have any more kids.  What?  Because I-I-I want the next 20 years to be about me.  Is that a deal-breaker?  (shimmering music fades)  I don't know.  JANE: And then what did he say?  That he had to think about it.  Wow.  I know.  And look, maybe it is a midlife crisis, but  I just started thinking about my life,  and-and what I want it to look like going forward, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, I get that.  What's going on with you?  No, ah, nothing, I'm fine.  Jane.  I need to get my mind off the ring.  I can't believe  I just jeopardized my writing career  over a hot guy I had some sex dreams about.  I ju-I just  oh, I feel so  I don't know  Horny.  I was going to say  at a crossroads.  But, yeah, maybe that, too.  I don't know, Mom, this whole no-sex-till-marriage thing is  I mean  I could see the finish line.  First with Michael.  And then Rafael, and  now, it's not even in sight, and I'm a mom.  When I was ten years old, making that promise,  I didn't see this coming.  Yeah, makes sense.  (sighs)  So, maybe it's time to reevaluate?  Yeah, maybe.  (sighs)    JANE: Hey.  I just wanted to say,  you were right.  I crossed a line and now there's no turning back,  and I'm mad at myself, but  I should get another advisor.  Are you sure that's what you want?  No, but it's what I have to do,  because what happened is getting in the way of my writing.  If you think that's for the best.  I do.  So, I'll see you around.  Wait.  Since you're no longer my advisee,  I was wondering if you wanted to get dinner sometime.  Yes.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, isn't that a nice surprise.  Also a surprise?  Did you find something on the chip?  Finally  yes.  Our first face.    I wasn't sure if you'd come.  And speaking of a hidden face   Of course, I came.  If the police have the chip, we both have a problem  Mom."
"1 Latin lover narrator: Yo, yo, yo.  Let me catch you up.  You recall that Jane the Virgin  was taught to protect  her flower until marriage.        But lately Jane's been rethinking a little,  especially since she's single now  and crushing on Professor Hottie.  I was wondering if you  wanted to get dinner sometime.  Yes.  I know OMG, right?  Oh, and remember when Petra  inseminated herself with Rafael's sperm?  Well, Raf was pretty mad at first, but lately,  they've actually been growing closer.  And speaking of romance, Ro proposed to Xo.  And they would've lived happily ever after,  but for this.  I don't want to have any more kids.  Yeah, so big problemo.  And speaking of problems,  Jane's ex-fiancÃ© Michael  was trying to find two crime lords.  Rose aka Sin Rostro,  aka Luisa's great love.  And Elena aka Mutter,  aka Rafael's mother.  Turns out they were working together  to change criminals' faces.  And they kept all the information on a secret chip.  But the cops finally got the chip  and decrypted it.  Our first face.  Exciting, right?  So maybe they can use it  to solve this friggin' case already.  I know Michael certainly wants to.  (doorbell rings)  -  - As you all well know,  our Jane had an active imagination.  That, coupled with her tendency  to romanticize,  well, it pushed her towards  a certain worldview.  Rosy, if you will.  Ow! Ooh, God!  Hey, maybe we should go to my place.  But there was one thing Jane didn't romanticize.  Uh, so, uh  it's probably time that I told you.  What?  I'm a virgin.  - Oh. - Wait for it.  And I'm saving myself until marriage.  Well, I guess we'll have to wait  till we're married then.  But, alas, that day never came.  Instead, this day came.  Waiting just doesn't seem to make sense anymore.  I mean, I'm a virgin mom!  That's just weird!  Totally weird.  Like, what exactly am I holding onto?  No idea.  Because everything is different now.  Look, trust me, I get it.  But do you really think that Professor Hottie is the guy?  I don't know.  I'm just open to it, that's all.  I really feel open.     Do you have condoms?  Uh, Mom, it's not happening tonight!  Okay, stop stalling and go talk to Dad.  All right, I'm going, I'm going.  Wish me luck.  Hopefully the fact that I don't want kids  isn't a deal breaker.  I don't want it to be a deal breaker, either.  So, I guess, how important are kids to you?  I mean, important.  I didn't get to raise Jane  - Rogelio - I'm not blaming you.  I mean, this-this is just coming up,  because now you're springing this on me.  It's not like I've been keeping it a secret.  I-I'm just realizing it.  I only wish I'd known.  Yeah, well, there are things about you  that I wish I knew, too!  Like what? I'm an open book.  In fact, I gave you my unauthorized biography.    Well  what about your Scientology discs?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, thank you.  I've been waiting for someone to bring that up.  -  - Is that what this is about?  Because you can watch those discs right now  if that will help.  Great, let's do it! I'm in!  No, I'm sorry. (sighs)  - That's not the problem. - Come on!  I'm lashing out because  I love you and  I want to make this work.  Me, too.  - (knocking on door) - MAN: Rehearsal's up, Rogelio.  Coming.  Listen, let's just put the baby decision on the back burner.  We don't have to decide that today, right?  You look handsome.  Thank you.  This week, Tiago is going through the time portal  and arriving in the women's suffrage movement.  I'm playing the nation's first male feminist.  I think history has really overlooked his point of view.        And speaking of overlooked heroes   So  I'm seeing a clean record here.  Looks like you've never been in any trouble, Gus.  Nope, never have.  That's why I'm not exactly sure why I'm here.  That makes two of us.  This guy, on the other hand,  he's been in lots of trouble.  His name's Igor Beltzky, Russian mafia.  He's wanted for drug trafficking,  multiple murder charges,  Yeah, sorry, I don't know that guy.  MICHAEL: Interesting.  Because it's you.  Rose and Elena kept records on a chip  All the faces they changed, what they looked like then  and what they look like now.  Is it me or was he way cuter before?  So here's what's gonna happen.  You're gonna contact Rose, however you contacted her,  and you're gonna tell her you have the chip.  And you're gonna tell her you'll sell it back to her  And tell her to come alone.  And for the record,  things would've unfolded that way exactly,  but for this.  If the police have the chip, we both have a problem.  That's right Rose and Elena knew the cops had it!  But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Yeah.  Okay I'm in.  At this point, I should remind you  that this case meant everything to Michael.  Because of, well   Okay! (kissing)  Come to Daddy!  - Thank you for switching nights. - Of course.  But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Hey, uh, before you go, do you still have  that list, uh, you made before you had Mateo  of all the best baby products?  'Cause Petra's kind of struggling.  Oh, no, really?  She bought a pram.  A pram as in an old-timey stroller?  Apparently, Kate Middleton uses one.  - (chuckles) - Around the castle.  I tried to make suggestions,  but she just kind of bit my head off.  Yeah, well, the hormones are crazy  at the end of the pregnancy.  That's what I said.  You called her hormonal?  No.  I just suggested that she might be  because she is!  - Not the point! - I know.  Hey, you couldn't?  What?  It's just that she just looks up to you  with all the mom stuff.  Oh, you want me to talk to her?  Well, we all are gonna be a family.  You see Michael wasn't the only one who knew Jane.  You went there.  I'm not proud of it.  I hate you.  Where is she?  (creaking)  (thump)  - JANE: Oh! - Oh!  Oh, I'm sorry!  Didn't notice you were there.  I was just looking for Rafael.  He's upstairs.  Ah, shoot.  You know, while I'm here  Hmm, looks like she's got her father's acting chops.  I, uh, was thinking maybe we could clear the air.  I-I know the only reason why you canceled that lunch  was because your mother murdered that guy.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  No, it's not your fault.  I mean, my mother does a lot of stupid stuff, too.  Anyway, uh, you know, maybe we can have a redo.  Talk about baby stuff  I'd love that.  Oh, wow, that was quick.  Oh! Okay.  I think I got the wrong stroller.  Like, this pram won't fold.  Or respond to kicking.  I mean, I could pull up my baby shower registry.  Oh, that would be great. I'd just buy everything.  I'm not having a shower.  My mother's in jail, so  Who would throw it?  Anyway, it's fine.  Ah, yes, and now I'll remind you  of Jane's rosy worldview.  I could throw you one, if you want.  What?  A shower.  (stammers) A small luncheon.  It's no big deal.  Yeah, we-we can invite  um the two women that you go to yoga with.  And-and the woman that I met downstairs,  uh, in the lounge.  She doesn't speak English.  Stepanka.  Mm-hmm.  Come on, it'll be nice.  XIOMARA: You offered to throw her a baby shower?  The better Petra and I get along,  the better it'll be for our kids.  Which ones?  Neither. Higher.  (groans)  I'm impressed.  This is a brand-new Jane.  Friends with Petra,  open to having sex.  Hey.  Just in case.  He's very handsome.  It's not happening tonight!  I'm just getting to know him.    You're very hard to Internet-stalk.  Privacy it's not underrated.  What do you want to know?  Why'd you get a divorce?  I wasn't suited for marriage.  Huh.  I can tell you that I'm  definitely not thinking about my ex right now.  No, I am completely rooted here in Miami.  So you wouldn't take the sabbatical?  Two years in Thailand?  Hmm no way.  When are you leaving?  Not for four months.  Mm.  Teach till the end of the semester.  Then relax for the summer.  Then I take off.  Wow.  (Jane laughing)  So you're saying I'm pretentious.  No!  No, I'm saying that novelas explore serious themes,  they just don't scream it.  And yes, you are pret  (laughs)  MAN: Um, hey?  We're actually closing.  Oh, sorry.  (chuckles) We're leaving.  (laughing): Oh, my God.  (speaks indistinctly)  Come back to my place.  Oh, um,  no, no, not tonight.  Fine.  Tomorrow?  I'll make you dinner.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, we all know what ""dinner"" means.    Great. Sounds perfect.  He's just the perfect person to do this with.  I mean, first of all, I'm extremely attracted to him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll say.  Yes, you've made that clear.  Plus he's leaving the country, so there's no time for me  to romanticize the whole thing and get attached.  At this point, I just want to get it over with.  You know, rip off the Band-Aid already,  - so it's not such a huge thing. - Got it.  So, you gonna tell him it's your first time?  No, there's no need.  Then it's suddenly deep, and it's not.    Jonathan. There's no real future there.  (chuckles)  Okay, you two, I got to go to school. Bye.  Give me a ride. I'm meeting Rogelio.  Bye, Ma.  Bye.    (knocking on door)  Xiomara, thank you for coming.  - Are you okay? - Yes.  I have decided  Please come in.  Sit.  I know you said this wasn't the issue,  but if these Scientology discs are holding you back in any way,  I want to show them to you.  Oh, no, that's not necessary.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Shut it, Xo.  Please, I insist.  Sure, if you really want to.    Okay, fine.  Here it is.  I was 26 years old, and a friend was setting me up.  She said she wanted to find me a girlfriend.  She was an older woman.  And I thought she liked to be called ""madam""  as a sign of respect, but that wasn't the only reason.  She was also  LUCIANA: What?  An actual madam.  But I didn't know.  It wasn't until I watch the acclaimed film Pretty Woman  that I realized I was a ""pretty woman.""  Well, now you know.  It was 15 years ago.  It's so embarrassing.    That's the big secret?  Rogelio, honestly, I don't care.  I was imagining something way worse.  Really? Luciana hung that over my head.  How many times do I have to tell you?  I'm not Luciana.  No, you're not.  It's finally been set.  Xiomara, be my wife.  Please.  I know, no kids, and I'm okay with that.  I'd rather have you than some hypothetical  genetically blessed kid.  PETRA: That thing is huge.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, these two were also giving it a try.  I know, but that is the best breast pump  because it comes with an extra battery.  Yeah, I won't need it.  Oh, trust me. (chuckles)  I forgot my battery, and I was at this writer's retreat,  and then Raf had to bring it to me,  and it was just, like, this whole big thing.  No, I won't be needing it, 'cause I'm not breast-feeding.  Oh.  I'm having two babies, Jane. That's a lot.  No, I get that, I-I'm  I'm not judging.  Oh.  Felt like judging.  Sorry. Totally didn't mean that at all.  Anyway, um, Raf and I have this glider.  We love it because it is so comfortable,  especially if you're gonna be up long nights, feeding the baby  I'm not worried about late nights.  I have a night nurse.  Oh, well, maybe she wants to sit in it.  I just don't like it.  - Okay. - Okay?  I think gliders are ugly in general.  Okay, got it.  WAITRESS: Here you go.  Your oil.  And your water.  Thank you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh. Perhaps I've romanticized  their friendship potential just a little.  So, pacifiers?  Oh, yes, definitely pacifiers.  Wait, how about those?  Two for $12?  No, that's ridiculous.  - Lookit, five for ten. - Yeah.  But don't you think there's a reason for the price difference?  - Yeah, they're trying to scam you. - Or they're better.  - Maybe. - Definitely.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah.  Not quite so rosy in real life.  JANE: I was trying.  But Petra is so  Judgy.  Seriously, Jane's judgy.  She was buying all these overpriced impractical things  just because they were more expensive.  She made me feel bad for wanting the best things for our kids.  And you should have heard her talking  about around-the-clock nannies.  And she's such a martyr.  She has to do everything herself.  Whatever. We're just really different.  Oil and water. Honestly.  Enough, Petra.  - We just wanted to help. - ""We""?  Okay, I might have told Jane  you needed a little help.  I don't need help.    It's too late now, I already said I would.  I just got to get through this.              Cut!  Now let's move on to Tiago making love in the voting booth.  Yes.  Oh, hi! Come.  I'm so glad you're here.  Suffragettes, gather round, please.  I want to make an announcement.  The beautiful woman standing next to me  is going to be Mrs. de la Vega.  (whooping)  Uh, unless I keep my name.  (laughing): Why would you do that?  That's ridiculous.    Mr. de la Vega, can I take a picture with you?  - For my mom? - Of course.  Wait, first,  find your light.  And then hold the camera up high  to streamline your features.  - (camera clicks) - Yes.  BOY: Thank you, Mr. de la Vega.  ROGELIO: Sure.  Rogelio, are you sure this is what you want?  A life without kids?  No, I'm not.  But I'm sure about you.  And who knows?  Perhaps in the future you'll change your mind.  What?  You did before.  It's a possibility.  But I'm 40.  I-I can't even have kids much longer.  Yes, I know.    What if we could manipulate time?  Xiomara, will you consider freezing your eggs?  Just as an insurance policy, in case.  Uh, I guess I could think about it.  JONATHAN: It's all about the eggs.  You have to make sure they're at room temperature.  'Cause if they're too cold, they won't mix with the flour.  Delicious.  I've never had a homemade pasta before.  Oh, I'm glad you liked it.  I did.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's be real.  No one is thinking about pasta right now.  And this, my friends, is what we call ""chemistry.""  - Just so you know. - Mm-hmm.  You're the first person I've been with.  You've got to be kidding me.  I mean, since my divorce was finalized.  Oh, okay, that makes more sense.  I mean, not a big deal, I'm just mentioning it.  Got it.  You know what else is not a big deal?  Wait, I thought we weren't telling.  You are actually my first.  That's it, buddy.  That's the end of the sentence.  I'm a virgin.  Oh.  But also not a big deal.  It was just, like, a promise I made to my grandmother. Yeah.  (chuckling): Your  your grandmother?  Oh, Jane.  I just mean that I was saving myself for marriage,  but now I'm not.  So  Oh, no, did I ruin the mood?  Not the stuff about being a virgin.  Maybe all the talk about your grandmother.  Look, I'm just looking for something casual.  Oh.  So am I, so  Jane.  Mm-hmm?  M-Maybe we shouldn't do this.  I'm sorry.  No.  Gotcha.  No problem.  It's cool.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall we left Xiomara  considering a certain fertility treatment.  (clears throat)  Were you waiting up for me?  -  - No.  - Are you still ? - Yes.  I didn't have sex.  For some reason, I told him I was a virgin,  and soon we were talking about Abuela.  Ooh. Yeah.  He pulled the plug.  I mean, if he hadn't, I would have done it.  Maybe.  Or maybe you brought up the virgin thing  because you weren't sure?  What? No.    JANE: Oh, nothing.  It was just a bad date.  Uh, I do have some pretty big news, though.  Mm-hmm?  I might freeze my eggs.    As in get them removed and frozen.  In case I change my mind about having kids.  Huh.  Just to leave the door open.  Okay, so he'll just open the door,  and I'll apologize.  For keeping in touch  with the woman who killed our father and kidnapped his son.        SUSANNA: Perfect.  Just be straightforward.  You can do this.  I can do this.  RAFAEL: You did it.  You apologized.  - So now you can go. - Rafael.  You chose to stay in touch with Rose instead of turning her in.  You need to understand.  Uh I'm an addict, right?  And-and I've been sober,  but in some way, I've replaced one addiction with another,  and and alcohol became Rose.  I mean, even with all that bad stuff,  I just, I was obsessed.  I just couldn't let her go.  Does this make any sense?  No.  You should leave.    JANE: Knock, knock.  I'm in the middle of something.  I'm sorry, it's just  you haven't returned my calls or texts.  I just wanted to know  if the tea sandwiches are a go.  Kate Middleton's favorites.  Jane, just spare me. Okay?  What?  I don't need your pity party.  This is not a pity party.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Stay put, Jane.  Resist the urge to help.  Look I know that you and Rafael  were plotting how to help me, okay?  I should have realized it, the way you were talking yesterday.  ""We"" this, ""we"" that.  No, no, it wasn't like that.  I mean, we're close, that's all;  we're raising a kid together.  He mentions things.  That's it?  Of course.  Got it.  Oh, we kissed.  Did he mention that?  No, he didn't.  Well, we did.  Wait, is that what this is about?  Do you think that I want to be with him?  Well, do you?  No, I don't.  Does he know that?  Of course.  (knocking at door)  Hey, he's still sleeping.  He'll be up any minute.  Is everything okay?  Apparently, Petra knew that you sent me in.  (sighs)  Shoot.  I meant to tell you  And did you mean  to tell me about the kiss?  I mean, I just wouldn't have mentioned your name  so many times, had I known.  I don't know why I didn't.  Okay.  Well, Petra said  That's not true, I do know why.  It's 'cause I still love you, Jane, I do.  And I'm sorry that I lied to you,  it's just that we were in such a good place before that  and I just want to get back to that.  We can't.  We can.  W I won't lie again.  It's not about the lie.  We're just so different.  Then we'll learn how to compromise.  - Rafael, stop - Fighting? I-I can't,  'cause I don't understand, Jane. We were in love.  We were. But  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And she knew she couldn't leave the door open.  My feelings changed.  I-I don't know when,  but they changed  and that's why we aren't together.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And strangely, in this moment,  his sister's words came to mind.    Okay.  Yeah, I got it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know what you should do  if you share a baby daddy and months of animosity?  Exactly!  Throw a baby shower!  (laughter, chatter)        -  - XIOMARA: Sorry I'm late.  Nah, don't worry,  Petra's not even here yet.  So, how was the fertility doctor?  I learned I have ""geriatric eggs.""  Oh  Seriously.  That's what they're called if you're over 35.  But because of where I am in my cycle,  I can start injections  - tomorrow. - Tomorrow?  Which she recommends, because of the geriatric thing.  Wow, okay.  How do you feel about that, Mateo, huh? Huh?  You want another baby? Huh?  Ooh, somebody's wet.  Let's go change you.  Let me. I want to.  Okay  All done.  Nice and clean.  Yes.  Who's my perfect boy?  I love you.  Yes, I do,  I love you, Mateo.  (sighs)  (sighs)    Why aren't you downstairs?  I thought I made myself clear. I didn't want the shower.  Um, no, no. You did not make that clear.  And the shower is happening. Right now.  Okay, well, I'm not going.  What? You have to.  No, I don't.  Jane, we don't like each other.  And I don't need  your sympathy, okay?  I know you pity me and my screwed-up family and  This isn't because of your screwed-up family,  it's because of mine. Okay?  I just got to know my dad,  and my grandma doesn't talk to her relatives in Venezuela,  and it was just the three of us, a lot of the time.  And that was lonely.  And I don't want that for my son.  I didn't know that.  You tend to  Romanticize. I know.  Well  I do feel better  knowing you've suffered a little.  What? I like honesty.  So do I.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At last.  Something they have in common.  Then, honestly,  I don't react well to being handled.  I get that.  And honestly, I don't respond well to snobbery.  And I don't like it when people are fake.  Part of the reason I didn't want to go to the shower  was because I didn't want to hear you  give some insincere toast.  Good.  'Cause I didn't want to give it.  Now can we go down?  To Petra.  She's  having two babies.  GUS: Careful there, baby   - Can I take you to dinner later? - No.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think he's forgetting about his new face.  And that she's a lesbian.  And that he's killed, like, 32 people.  You're gonna wait for Rose in the warehouse.  When you exchange the chip for the money, we move in.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which again would have happened  (phone ringing)  - but I'm getting ahead of myself. - Cordero.  What?  What's wrong?  Luisa was drinking.  She was in a really bad car crash.  SUSANNA: Is she okay?  Is Luisa okay?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And I'd tell you the answer  to that, friend, but again   I don't want to get ahead of myself.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall, Luisa was taken  to the hospital in a stretcher,  but Jane knew nothing of that.  Or she wouldn't be doing this.    (phone chimes)    Who's that?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Professor Hottie.      Don't sugarcoat, Jane.  Ugh.              LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I believe the term here is ""sexting.""  It should be noted  that when two professional writers decide to sext,  it gets very hot, very quickly.  (shudders)      It should also be noted  that our Jane's driving just a little too fast   and also she's not wearing pants.  (siren whoops)  What?  Yes.  Hello.  - Everything okay? - Oh, yeah.  Because you have a lot of papers on your lap.  I do.  Because, um  I'm not wearing any pants.  It's a long story.  I'm sure it is.  You were also speeding.  Related to the pants.  License and registration.  Yes, of course, I'm sorry.  Ow! Ooh, ay, ay, ay  Sorry.  (gasps)  Don't have sex.  I said, don't speed.  Right.  I'm so sorry.  I'm gonna let you off with a warning.  But drive safely.  Think first.  Oh, God,  I'm so sorry I'm late, I was speeding and  I want you so badly.  Come on, let's go to the bedroom.  (whimpers)  Hey. Are you okay?  Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.  Okay. I'm fine.  (sobs) Hey  J You're-you're crying.  No, I'm not crying.  (crying): I'm not cry  I'm not crying.  I'm fine. I really want to do this.  I really do  Jane  I'm sorry, I think I'm just, like,  a little overwhelmed, but I'm fine.  I still really want to do this, I do.  I think I just need to blow my nose.  Yeah. Okay.  Here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ugh, what a mess.  Okay.  (crying): Okay, great.  It's okay, don't worry.  No no, I really might want to.  Oh  It's okay.  I've been waiting for you.  Oh, sorry, sorry, I grabbed your keys,  I didn't think you were gonna go out.  It's the first night of the hormone shots.  Ro wants to be with me  Whose pants are those?  Jonathan's.  I went to his house to have sex with him,  - and instead I burst into tears. - No.  - Yes. - You cried?  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, she definitely cried. - I didn't mean to.  Like, actual tears?  Okay, now you're just making me feel worse!  Uh, anyway, Mom, um, bye.  Tell Dad I said hi and thank you for watching the baby.  Bye, Ma.  Uh, let me go change, Abuela.  And then we can catch up on our novelas.  ROGELIO: Telenovelas need heart.  But they also need a big, fun action sequence.  That's why we're putting Susan B. Anthony  in a freak riding accident.  (screams)      Plus, it's an old trick.  A woman in distress really brings everyone together  at the end of an episode.  (steady beeping)  - But I'm getting ahead of myself. - WOMAN: Shh!  Lecture the intern somewhere else.  We're rolling.  - Xiomara! - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Shh!  We must be very quiet, because we are now  in the midst of an official telenovela  action sequence.  Gus looks nervous, which makes sense,  because he's waiting to meet Rose.  Is that her?  (whistlist)  (exhales)  Come on, come on, come on!  (thud nearby)  This is it she's coming.  Rose.  Your face.  It's the same.  Would you repaint the Sistine Chapel?  (laughs)  I had to make sure you were all right.  (sniffles)  And I also came here to say good-bye.  What?  You need to move on.  There's no future for us.  Why?  Don't say that.  Luisa, you're not gonna run away with me.  I mean  I could.  Okay, she's getting ready to move.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, finally, I'm not getting ahead of myself.  Let me fill you in.  Remember how Rose and Elena knew the cops found the chip?  If the police have the chip, we both have a problem.  Well, Michael knew they knew!  I'm guessing there's a signal  when it's downloaded,  so Rose and Elena know we have it, which means  we need a public plan and a real plan.  And now I can tell you Luisa's okay.  Now!  Turn around slowly  and put your hands up.  You set me up?  (crying): I'm sorry, I had to!  I'm sorry I couldn't say anything before.  I wasn't sure who I could trust.  SUSANNA: Stand down! Put your hands up!  What is she doing? What is she doing?  Wait, what's happening?  Send your guys in. We need to wait until she's out of ICU.  Don't worry, there's only one way out.  Susanna Barnett.  And now I urge you to pay attention.  One of these women is about to die.  So the details could be important.  Yes.  Susanna Barnett.  I thought it would be you.  Put your hands up.  Your mom lives in Nashville with your little brother Tyler Dylan.  What was that?  A blue comforter on his bed?  A Titans banner in the corner?  No  Stay away from him.  ROSE: I'd love to.  Escort me out.  I'll take your gun.  Or I will have my associates  execute him, make no doubt about it.  Follow and I will kill her.  - No! No! No! - Damn it, no!  (grunting)  Where is she? Where is she?  In there! Go!  Stairs!  Oh, my God.  No!  MICHAEL: She was strangled by blue silk ties.  That's got to be Mutter. She beat us here.  Wait for forensics. We need to do this right.  I need DNA, prints. Let's get some  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And now it's time to remind you again  that he had everything riding on this.  Huh.  Didn't see that coming.      Or that.                - I'm sorry, what? - I'm sorry, what?    With who?      Oh.  Why didn't you tell me?  Ay       Well, they shouldn't have.                Yeah, I agree.  No more crying.  (crying)                            Hi there.  Powerful scene, no?  Yeah.  It really was.  Poof!  XIOMARA: Sometimes there's no clear answer.  And sometimes there is.  And I know I don't want to do this.  Is it the needles?  No.  It's that I love being a grandmother.  Because I love being able to choose  whether or not I want to change a dirty diaper.  And I want that choice.  My needs are important,  like Tiago said.  And I know  I don't want to have any more kids.  So, uh, I shouldn't leave the door open.  (crying): And I know you want them.  So you should have them.    ROGELIO: My greatest love  was my first love,  Xiomara.  I think about her every day.  (phone buzzing)  Hi, Jane.  Hey, Mom told me what happened.  You okay?  Yes, yes.  Of course.  LUCIANA: You never told me about her.  I told my pen pal Lola.  It's easier to write than to talk about.  Plus, Lola is in prison, so it's not like  she's going to do anything with my secrets.  She won't be out for another ten years.  And we'll be on the Bridge to Total Freedom by then.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But again     It's time to resume here, where we began.  (phone chimes)  With our Jane.  This heart has its bleeding   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She was a romantic, you'll recall.  This heart has its workings   But some moments can't be romanticized.  This heart is still mine   Which means it's still yours   What are you doing here?  It's over.  Rose is dead.  What?  She can't ever hurt you or Mateo.  I don't understand.  I-I couldn't jeopardize your safety again.  I had to push you away.  But-but it's over now.  She's gone and you are safe.  And, Jane, I love you.  I've always loved you.  Oh.  Tell me it's not too late.  Like I said, some moments can't be romanticized.  Don't think. Just tell me.  Do you still love me?  Because they're just that perfect.  Yes."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whassup, peeps? You'll recall our favorite virgin mother  just heard this bombshell.  Rose is dead.  She can't ever hurt you or Mateo.  I couldn't jeopardize your safety again.  I had to push you away but it's over now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not as thrilled  about Sin Rostro's death   Her former lover, Luisa,  AKA Rafael's sister See, she'd stayed  - in contact with Rose  - LUISA: I'm an addict.  I was obsessed I just couldn't let her go.  - You should leave. - And Rafael wasn't  the only one who was bothered  - by their relationship. - I can't.  In Luisa's defense, breakups are hard   As Zo and Ro were learning.  I don't want to have any more kids.  And I know you want them.  Babies, man they're no joke.  Which brings us to Petra.  You see, she inseminated herself  with Rafael's sperm because she thought  they were meant to be together  Crazy, right?  But he did say he'd be there.  - (screams) - Oh, and speaking of crazy,  all this crime stuff has been bad for hotel business.  Can't blame honeymooners for avoiding the Marbella, right?  And on the topic of honeymooners,  let's get back to our love story, shall we?  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva  was exactly 24 years, eight months and 17 days old,  she had the most romantic night of her life.  Don't think just tell me, do you still love me?  Yes.  -  - It also happened to be last night.  - Yes? - Yes.  Oh    Does this mean we can be Facebook friends again?  (laughs): Yes!  I can't believe you unfriended me.  I had to. I stalked your girlfriend.  - As for what happened next - That was not my girlfriend.  We work together. Your mom is crazy.  Oh  What about you? Did you date anyone?  Well, I  Kinda. Yeah.  My professor.  Well, after exactly 216 days apart,  they had a lot to catch up on.  He's huge!  The professor?  (relieved sigh) Oh Mateo.  JANE: It's giving me panic attacks.  He lost his baby face.  Well, pretty sure you're looking at a baby right now.  (laughs)  (laughing): And then I challenged McBaskets  - to a one-on-one. - Final score?  - 56 to nothing. - Ooh.  It was a lot closer than you think.  I almost scored a bunch of times.  JANE: No.  I'm so sorry.  Yeah, it was awful.  I mean, N  Nadine died trying to save me.  - I can't believe it. - It's because I didn't trust her.  That's what haunts me.  - I didn't trust her. - JANE: Trust me, I was shocked.  And then when the green card came  How much crying?  So much crying.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on,  conversation wasn't the only thing they had to catch up on.  -  - MICHAEL: This doesn't feel real.  I know.  But it was.  Just the two of them, in their own little bubble.  But we do need to talk about Rafael.  (bubble pops)     I have to apologize. That's all.  What happened when I punched him  - I think about that every day. - True, for the record.  And I think about how angry I was, and why  Rafael had gotten him fired.  And none of it matters. I was wrong.  So I just want to apologize and start fresh.  Great.  But you gotta let me talk to him first.  And you should really get going.  - Are you kicking me out? - (laughs): No.  My mom and my grandma are gonna wake up soon, and  I just don't want to deal with their opinions yet.  I think it might be a little too late for that.    That's it?  JANE (laughs): Yes.  We talked. That's it.  Your mom is a liar.  Ma, don't say that to him!  Check me out.  Ooh  - Ah - Wait for it.  It still fits.  I'm actually really excited  - to be picking up a few shifts. - You're seriously trying  to talk to me about waitressing right now?  What's going on! Are you back together or not?    Thank you, Abuela.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ã¿Y tÃÂº, Abuela?  Look, as much as I want to tell you how amazing it was  So it was amazing.  I need to talk to Rafael first.  He and Michael  I mean, they fought.  I need to make sure that they can coexist for Mateo.  But don't worry,  I will be talking to him right away.  (knocking on door)    No, that's Rogelio.  I, um, invited him to breakfast.  To remind you: it's been exactly  12 hours and 41 minutes since Xiomara and Rogelio broke up.  XIOMARA: I told you, you don't have to knock.  You can just come in and out like you did before.  Thank you. I just wanted to be respectful.  Mm-hmm.  - What? - JANE: Nothing. I just don't think  we expected you guys to be so comfortable  with each other after the breakup.  We decided to be mature about this.  Exactly. Like my good friends Gwynnie and Chris,  - we have chosen to consciously uncouple. - But we're not calling it that.  Oh, yes, we definitely are.    I might be on the board of Goop, Alba, so yes,  I would say we're very good friends.  The point is, we're bypassing  all the negativity  and going straight to the friendship.  ROGELIO: Exactly. You're still accompanying me  to the Tiago premiere, right?  Of course. I already RSVP'd to Paola.  I should check in on her, actually.    We want to get a hashtag trending during the premiere.  Have I told you guys she used to work for J. Lo?  - SÃ­. - Yes. Yes. Like, a couple of times.  - Like, I remember, the last time you told me. - Yeah. We heard.  - Was just this morning on the phone. - Yeah. That's right.  Yep. You texted it  to me yesterday.  Anyway, what I love about her  is that she won't reveal a single secret.  Which is also what I hate about her. (chuckles)    JANE: And I have to go.  And I'm really impressed by the way you two  are handling the breakup.  Bye.  MAN: Rediscover the romance, and the magic,  at the Marbella.  It's a slice of heaven.  Or hell.  The Marbella Hotel.  You check in, but you never check out.  Okay, seriously? This is now the first thing  that comes up when you Google us?  Yes! It has half a million hits.  (sighs) I've made a call to our marketing people  and asked them to brainstorm new ad campaign ideas.  You think that's necessary?  Only if you want to continue having guests.  Yes, it's necessary! And I want it done this week!  - Whoa. Why so soon? - I don't know, Rafael.  You know, maybe just knowing that two actual human beings  are about to blast out of my body at any moment  - has give me a sense of urgency. - Okay, first of all,  Ã¢ÂÂblastÃ¢ÂÂ out of your body?  - Wow. - Look, I just mean there's a lot  I want to get done before then I made a list.  Ah.  What?  This happened with Jane.  It's called nesting.  It's when an expectant mother becomes obsessed  with planning out all the details.  Feathering her nest, so to speak.  -  - In anticipation of the baby.  Are you serious with that crap?  -  - Ask me what's on my list!  - What's on your list? - Night nurse interviews, finalizing the nursery plans,  and making a new non-throat-slashing commercial  for the Marbella!  Got it.  I'm on it.  All of it.  Thank you.  (woman screams on video)  MAN: Our luxurious honeymoon suites are to die for.  (Lina shrieks)  I can't believe it!  (laughter)  - Oh. (gasps) - (gasps)  You just made my job a thousand percent more fun.  - Oh, it's nice to be back. - (sighs)  It's familiar, you know?  - It's, like, my old life - Yeah. So quick update.  Mm. We no longer hate Busboy Ben.  Uh-huh. Turns out he was just in a bad relationship  that made him cranky, which I found out after I slept with him.  - Oh. Okay, good to know. - Mm-hmm. Anyway,  ""now all of our hate is reserved for Ã¢ÂÂVestsÃ¢ÂÂ""  the world's worst boss.  Who's approaching.  Hey, Scott.    Uh, actually, I go by Mr. Archuletta, now that I'm manager.  - Seriously? - I told you. You might want  to shut it down, Lina Because we have a problem.  - I know you've been stealing liquor from the bar. - LINA: What?!  I haven't stolen anything. You were closing up last night  when the bottles went missing, and you were clearly drunk.  (laughs): Okay. I do not appreciate  being accused of a crime I did not commit,  and I will use  every legal recourse  to fight these accusations,  and then I will file a counterclaim  against you and the hotel, and then you'll find yourself  up to your eyeballs in legal bills!  I know it was you.  Just figuring out how to prove it.  Okay, someone's Good Wife binge really paid off.  I know.  But, Jane I didn't do it.  - So you weren't drinking at work. - Oh, of course I was drinking at work.  But ever since they put in the new rules, I bring my own booze.  (groans): Oh I can't lose my job, Jane.  Busboy Ben will definitely go back to his girlfriend if I'm not around.  Okay. Calm down.  (exhales) We'll figure it out.  If you didn't do it, then you're not losing your job.  I have to go to work.  No, you don't.  I do.  I feel okay.  Where's my jacket?  Oh. I got it.  Thank you. And thank you  for taking care of me last night.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To give some context  It's been exactly 14 hours and 53 minutes  since Luisa's ex-lover lay dead in front of her.  (gasps) No!  Also   394 days since Luisa has had a drink.    Well until last night.  12 steps forward, one step back.  And now this step.  Jane, you'll recall, had decided to tell Rafael  about Michael as soon as possible.  (exhales)  Shh, shh. Mateo's still sleeping.  Look what I got him for his first swim lesson.  So cute, right?  Raf, I have to talk to you about Michael.  Oh, wow. So not even a little lead up?  What about him?  Well, he didn't want to be around me or the baby  while Rose was out there  but now  - What? - Now  she's gone and we're safe.  He still loves me.  And I still love him.  No.  What?  Come on, anyone but him.  I don't love anybody else.  - He punched me in the face. - I know.  - In front of Mateo. - And he feels bad.  - Oh, he feels bad? - Okay, so what I mean is that he wants to apologize.  - He's different. - And you turned him in. So that makes it okay?  - No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. - He's a bad guy.  No, he's not. Well, he's bad for our family,  and I want nothing to do with him, okay?  - Are you serious? - What?  Petra covered up for the fact that her mom pushed  my grandmother down the stairs, and I threw her  a freaking baby shower. And now you're telling me  - you can't even have lunch with Michael? - Fine.  Let's all have lunch.  Great! I look forward to it!  Spoiler alert:  I don't believe them.  So, he agreed to lunch, at least.  And I use the term Ã¢ÂÂagreedÃ¢ÂÂ loosely.  He definitely wasn't happy about it.  Yeah, well, it'd be weird if he was.  - Yeah. That's true. - It's gonna be hard, obviously.  - I have to apologize. - Yeah.  Any thoughts on what you'd say?  - Huh? - Because you can  try it out on me.  - No. - Michael.  Your toast at Mark's wedding?  Oh. Come on.  - What were your opening lines? - Let that go.  Oh, yeah: Ã¢ÂÂFor the longest time,  Ã¢ÂÂI thought Mark was dating his sister.Ã¢ÂÂ  Who cuddles with their sister?  (chuckles)  Let's talk about this later, okay?  - I love you. - Yeah, I love you, too.  Anyone ever tell you you got a goofy grin, Cordero?  Hey. What are you doing here?  You should be home in bed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To remind you,  it had been 15 hours and 32 minutes  since Sin Rostro threatened her family.  We have to figure out where Mutter is,  how she got ahead of us and how she killed Rose.  This is what we got so far.  I  I was sent here from Internal Affairs.  To investigate you.  Yeah.  I figured that one out.  A while ago.  I understand now  how Rose got to you,  how she manipulated you.  JANE: I want to be with Michael.  With Michael. And he loves me.  - He loves me. I want to be with Michael. - PETRA: Rafael.  - Rafael! - Sorry. Yes.  Yes? You like the synchronized swimmers.  Hmm?  For the commercial!  WOMAN: Like I was saying,  it's Old Hollywood glamour  with a touch of Miami magic.  We'd be selling the fantasy.  - Okay, what is going on with you? - I'm sorry.  Jane just told me she's getting back together with Michael,  and I  I guess I'm still processing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that Petra was feeling  many mixed emotions. On one hand         On the other hand       Meaning she really had to get things checked off  her freaking list.  Okay. Well, are you done processing?  Can we move on with the commercial now?  - Yes. Of course. - Also,  I'm scheduling night nurse appointments  for the day after tomorrow.  Terrific.  ROGELIO: Beyond terrific.  It's incredible.  While we've been eating,  Paola secured the hologram of Selena  to do a one-night-only performance  at the Tiago premiere.      JANE: Well done, Paola.  It was nothing. Anyway, we should get going,  Mr. de la Vega. You have to be at the set in half an hour.  Oh, and you need to call Antonio Banderas back.  He called me?  No. But you told me to practice dropping names.  Oh, Paola, that was so convincing.  - Bien, Paola. - Nice to meet  - you all. - Nice to meet you.  Ah  What?  Nothing. Just  nice to see now that you're single you're dating Dad.  Stop! You're being ridiculous.  We're just worried about you, that's all.  And we want to make sure  that you're okay seeing Rogelio this much.  I'm fine.  You have nothing to worry about.  Okay. Good. Just checking in.  Good-bye, sweet boy. (kissing)  Thanks for putting him down.  I'm gonna be late tonight. I'm closing.    It's for a good cause.  Mm.  - (loud crunching) - Shh!  Okay, in case you didn't notice, we're on a stakeout.  The liquor thief is never going to show up  - if he hears your loud snacking. - Really?  It's the snacks that'll tip them off?  Not your extremely loud voice?  And we're not on a stakeout. We're just very casually  and quietly closing the lounge.  You know, should the thief show up  - while we're doing it, then - (gasps) Shh, shh, shh.  Come, come. Look.  Oh, no.  (gasps) Hey!  (exhales) How's that adorable nephew  of mine?  What's going on?  You know, same old, same old.  With the alcohol.  I thought you were sober.  I  I was, and  I  (sighs)  I've had a hell of a tough week, Jane, and  I messed up.  Actually, um  I'm glad you caught me.  I don't want to do this.  Just  just do me a favor. Um  don't tell my brother. Let me tell him.  Who cares who tells him? What about me?  Our boss thinks Lina stole it.  Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'll fix it.  I can't fix it if you don't stay still.  I'm sorry, Paola. Mm-hmm.  You know, Paola, most men would feel intimidated by a kilt,  but I have been fortunate enough  to be blessed with incredible legs.  Indeed, Mr. de la Vega.  So, was J. Lo a fan of Braveheart?  She seems like she would be.  You know, I'm not at liberty to say.  Okay. You're done.  Go get your Spanx on.  Hmm.  My lucky lavender briefs are folded in half.  I always fold them in quarters.  Maybe the wardrobe department came in here for some reason,  - no? - We'll ask them immediately.  And then we should report this incident to studio security.  Don't you think that's a bit extreme?  - Mm-mm. - What's going on?  - What - Okay.  I'm telling you this only  because it's a matter of safety.  Something very similar happened  on Maid in Manhattan to you-know-who.  - (gasps) - And it turned out to be a stalker.  What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh. Remember this?  -  - I told my pen pal Lola.  Lola is in prison, so it's not like she's going to do anything  with my secrets. She won't be out for another ten years.      J. Lo had a stalker?  Focus, Rogelio.  The point is we need to take this very seriously.  JANE: Be careful.  Don't let him trap you in an argument. And be prepared  - to do some groveling. - Totally prepared to grovel.  And, of course, no touching,  no long loving looks, and definitely no inside jokes.  Okay, so, impressions, goofy faces,  - off-limits. - Yes. Like they always are.  - Okay. - And the fact that I laugh at your goofy faces  means it's an inside joke,  so it's doubly off-limits.  So I shouldn't give him one of these?  - (laughing): No. No. - What about one of these?  No. Not that one either.  - No, don't you dare. - Mateo?  - I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. - Don't do it. Please don't do it.  I have to.  I wanted to apologize. Sincerely.  Uh, it was a bad situation all around.  And now, with some distance, I understand  how you must have felt. And as for, you know, what happened,  me punching you,  I'm not asking you to forgive me for that,  but I hope you can accept my apology.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Humble and sincere.  This was exactly the apology speech  Jane wanted Michael to give.  Which makes sense, considering she wrote it.  I got it.  So, is there anything else you want to say?  Sure. I don't like you,  I don't trust you, and I don't want you anywhere near my son.  For the record, not what she would have scripted.  - Look, I know that you're upset, I - Because you won't leave us alone.  - Rafael. - You're like a cockroach  you just  - keep coming back where you don't belong. - All right, you know what,  - just to be clear, I do belong here, because Jane chose me. - Oh, really?  - Yes. That's what this is about, huh? You're jealous. - She chose you?  - I'm jealous? -Seriously?  - Yeah. - Okay, you know what,  we're done here.  - ROGELIO: Hi, there. - (startled shout)  Sorry. Didn't see you.  No problem.  I'm meeting your mom to run some lines.  Are you okay?  Look, I want to tell you what's happening,  but you have to promise to stay calm, okay?  - Of course. - I'm serious, Dad.  - No matter how excited you get. - Say no more.  Luckily, I'm an actor, blessed with the ability  to keep in total control of my emotions.  Go ahead.  Michael and I want to get back together.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To be clear,  that's how he was on the outside.  On the inside   (shouting)  Everything's gonna go well! The bromance is coming back.  The bromance, the bromance  bromance the bromance  You don't say.  But I don't think it's gonna work.  Interesting. What's, uh, holding you back?  He and Rafael hate each other, and Rafael won't let go of that.  And-and I don't want that kind of animosity around Mateo.  I mean, that is so important.  But so is true love, Jane.  I mean, I'm sorry, but it is.  And it's rare. It's so rare.  What you and Michael have and what me and Xo have  Dad  Well, fine.  It also applies to us.  Which is why well, you see,  we're not willing to walk away from each other.  Yeah, but what about the kid issue?  I don't know. Perhaps she'll change her mind, you know?  (phone buzzing)  Studio security. I have to take this.  Hello?  What?!  Nope.  No, I've never seen this woman.  She did a little extra work here.  We found her in possession of these.  Which your assistant Paola has identified as  your second favorite lucky briefs.  Thank you, Paola. Very much.  Please have these laundered, with a gentle press.  They've been through enough.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no.  Looks like they sniffed out the wrong stalker.  Where are you?  - I'm running late for swim class. - What?  - We have night nurse interviews. - Now?  Yes! You said swim class was at 1:00.  I am so sorry.  It moved and I forgot to tell you.  Can they reschedule?  They're here.  You know what? Forget it. I'll just decide.  - Pet - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  From one angry baby mama  to another.  Yup, this is gonna be fun.  Hey, Mr. Sweetface,  do you like your first swim lesson? Yes?  - Hey. - Hi.  Okay, swim parents,  so for the first five minutes, we're just gonna get our babies  - used to the water, all right? - Five minutes that's certainly  a lot longer than you lasted at lunch.  Are we seriously gonna do this now?  We were supposed to do it yesterday  but you didn't even try.  So if you want,  you can blow bubbles  (spluttering)  I did try. I showed up.  You didn't.  (spluttering)  - You were angry and defensive and - Yeah!  - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God,  - is he doing it? - Oh, my God!  Is he blowing a bubble?  You're a little Michael Phelps! Yeah, he is.  Yes, you are.  Just move your kiddo around the pool,  take 'em on a little boat ride, so they see  what that feels like.  Yes Oh  Okay  maybe I am a little jealous.  But that's not what this is about.  This is about Mateo's safety  Which is why Michael stayed away.  But now that the threat is gone  But it's not.  Look, time and time again,  Michael made these really dangerous choices  because of his job. You know that's true.          Is this okay?  Don't be silly. Of course.  I mean, it's just acting, right?  Right.          I-It says that you're supposed to lust after my breasts,  not my shoulder.  Of course. (clears throat)                  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, what?!  Hey! You guys are off script!  Ow!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, here we are.  Approximately 62 hours and 25 minutes  since these two broke up.  Stuff like this always happens after a breakup.  I'm sure Gwyneth and Chris have done this numerous times.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  Consciously uncoupled coitus.  (door closes, Xiomara gasps)  Jane's home. Quick, get up, get dressed!  What Why?  I just don't want to hear her opinions right now.  Ma?  XIOMARA: Uh, hey, honey.  Hurry up. What's taking so long?  These pants are on the snug side, but David Beckham  told me I could pull them off.  (thump)  What was that?  XIOMARA: Just dropped my shoe.  All good.  Hm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whew! That was close.  Whatcha doin'?  Oh, you know Ah.  I'm just waking up from a nap.  Oh, are you not feeling well?  'Cause you look a little sweaty.  Oh, it's You know, it's hot. Miami.  Mm. Because  that is one wild  nap.  Oh. Maybe  Liar! I saw Dad sneaking out of the house like a teenager.  Okay, look, look, it was just ex-sex.  Oh  It's a totally normal thing that  everyone does after they break up.  Well, everyone except for you.  It doesn't change anything.  It's over. We both know it.  - But Mom - No, no. No.  No lectures.  This is not a lecture.  Dad is holding out hope.  He thinks you might change your mind.  About kids.  He does?  I won't.  I know.  Wow.  I-I really thought we were in sync.  RAFAEL: They're gonna be great.  PETRA: Yes, they are.  What's wrong?  If me and my daughters  are going to be second-class citizens,  you need to tell me so I can be prepared.  Second-class?  To Jane and Mateo.  You won't.  We are now.  And look, I know  you didn't choose this pregnancy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's an understatement.  But you did agree to be there.  And if that's changed, I need to know.  No.  I will be there.  And I'm sorry for making you feel that way.  - Okay, what is going on? - With the synchronized swimmers?  They're filming a commercial.  No, with Vests. He just fired me.  - What? - What?  Luisa asked me to replace  some bottles and he saw me putting them back and now  - he thinks I stole them. - Don't worry.  I'm calling her and we are fixing this right now.  Hola, Jane. Como esta?  Luisa? Where are you?  Just hanging out. What about you?  She's drunk.  - I am not! - Are you okay?  Tell me where you are, I'll come get you.  (pop song playing over phone)  (same pop song playing, louder and clearer)  She's in the lounge.    (sighs, then gasps)  Stay cool.  I'm gonna count to three,  then you guys are gonna stand up.  I'm gonna slip away. (whooshes)  One, two, three.  I only had one drink.  And five shots.  And two shots.  I'm sorry.  Please don't take me back to the Marbella.  Luisa, you're in the Marbella.  (gasps)  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I didn't mean to slip.  (sighs) Did you tell my brother?  No. Did you?  - Yeah. - Luisa.  Mm? Okay, no.  Just, I didn't tell him  because he's gonna be so disappointed in me.  I know, but still, you have to tell him.  Can I call my sponsor first?  (exhales)  Ay Mm.  Are you Luisa's sponsor?  No.  Oh But look, I'll take care of her.  When she wakes up, she should probably talk to her brother.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of big scary talks  We can't do this anymore  Act like we didn't break up, because  we're really just putting off the inevitable.  I'm not gonna change my mind about having kids.  Jane told you?  Yeah, she did.  But it was good, it-it helped me see.  We're not gonna feel broken up unless we take a step back.  Not see each other as much.  So  maybe take Jane to the Tiago premiere?  (text alert whooshes)    (laughs)          Uh uh  (phone rings)  Michael,  you can't.  You're more important.  I'm not losing you again, Jane.  I told you the other night that I would do  anything to make this work,  and if that's losing my job  versus losing you, then  you win out,  every single time.  JANE: He loves his job. How can I let him quit?  It's not really your choice, right?  I mean, if he loves you enough to  to sacrifice something like that,  I-it's up to him.  Mom?  (gasping): Oh,  my  Hon, you look beautiful.  I'm glad you're going to the premiere with your dad.  But are you okay?  Yes, I'm totally fine.  I'm gonna order Chinese,  fire up the DVR  I'm looking forward to just relaxing.  Go on.  No, no, I don't want the gluten-free, MSG-free egg rolls.  I know that's my normal order.  Just the regular egg rolls tonight.  For one.  This British telenovela is not that original.  We did the Egyptian deflowering the virgin  then dying in her bed on Amor de Arabia.  Stop talking and pay attention.  This part's important.  - What?! - I assume?  - You watched this without me?! - I'm sorry.  - I'm sorry. - No, no.  That is, like, a fundamental relationship rule.  You wait before moving forward on your DVR.  (both laughing)  (sighing)  Forgot my phone.  Mom? Are you okay?  Sorry. Yeah.  (gasps)  I just don't know whether or not  to start episode eight, because  we were watching it together, you know, and  Oh.  Oh.  (crying): And don't want to move ahead without him.  But I want to know what happened  to Lady Sybil, you know?  Yeah, I know, Mom.  (crying) I know.  - Jane should be arriving any minute. - No problem.  We're a little ahead of schedule.  But listen, I've been thinking about your stalker situation.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll remind you,  this is his stalker situation.  And I'm concerned.  Stalkers can be really dangerous.  I've set up security on set,  but what's your situation like at home?  Do you have a dead bolt?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No, don't tell her, Rogelio.  No. I lost the key.  Weapons?  Just the mace I keep in my underwear drawer.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is torture!  Okay, how about  a password-protected security system?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm shaking tables over here.  Password's the same as every other password.  Rogelio, or, Ã¢ÂÂRogelio1Ã¢ÂÂ if a number is needed.  Hmm. Oh, it's Jane.  -  - Um      You okay?  Yeah. Yes.  Jane is running late. Her mom was upset.  Oh, God, are you always going to be a second-class citizen?  - What? - I'm sorry.  I shouldn't speak out of turn.  No, it's okay.  This is a big night for you.  That's all.  I wish Jane turned up for you.  - Anyway, you should walk the carpet. - Yeah.  (reporters clamoring, cameras clicking)        -  - LUISA: I just feel so alone.  My parents are dead  my brother hates me  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The love of her life died in front of her.  So when this little voice tells me to drink,  even just one, to take the edge off  Well, I don't have a little voice.  I have a big voice.  You need to go back to rehab.  So that when you're out,  and you're better  I can take you out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At last, a step forward.  Which brings us here, now.  Hey, Dad.  I've been looking for you.  Why aren't you at the after party?  I just needed some air.  Well, Tiago was great.  I-I'm, I'm really sorry that I missed the carpet.  I understand your mother was having a tough time.  Exactly.  And she's more important to you than me.  Wait. Wait. What?!  Well, you chose her over me.  No, it was just because she was upset about the breakup.  So was I, and tonight was a huge night  for me, and you didn't show up.  So the only Tiago related hashtag trending  was hashtag Rolonelio.  You made a choice.  At least own it.  I'm really sorry, Dad.  I just think I need some space right now.  Uh  I just feel so badly.  I know.  I'm sorry I put you in that position.  I e-mailed him a long apology, lots of emojis. I won't be long.  Where are you now?  Taking Dad's advice, actually.  I'm owning my choice.  Michael is willing to give up his job.  Does that make it okay?  I didn't think so,  because it's not about that.  The problem is I'm choosing him.  And I am  choosing him.  Either accept it, or don't, but if you don't,  you're the one who is making it worse on our son,  not me.  I don't want to be replaced.  What?! No, you won't be.  Hey, you won't be.  You're Mateo's dad.  Yeah.  I'll try.  Thank you.      (elevator bell dings)  (elevator door closes)  - What are you doing here? - You asked  what to expect from me when the babies come, so, here it goes.  I will be there  for all of it.  I'll be the night nurse,  I'll wake up with them every three hours.  I will feed them, I will burp them.  - What? - It's everything that I wanted to do  with Mateo and Jane, but I never got the chance.  I'll even put in a door between our suites,  - so that I can go back and forth. - Rafael, stop.  What's going on?  I want to be there  with the babies,  with you.  You are not a second-class citizen, Petra, and  Maybe I made a mistake.  What happened?  - Excuse me? - I'm guessing  Jane rejected you in some way, so now you're here?  I'm not a second-class citizen, Raf.  But I'm not a second choice, either.  You should go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here.  Hey. Hey.  Are you alone? Yup.  But I'm not planning on going home alone.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And neither, for the record, was Jane.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when she saw him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And he saw her.  (bright Broadway-style melody playing)    WOMAN: Guys, we're trying to rehearse.  Can you make out somewhere else?  (both snickering quietly)  (bright, Broadway-style melody resumes)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw. And I hate to burst this bubble.  Paola!  Thank God it's you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But that is what I'm here for.  I thought it was a crazy person sitting there in the dark.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You thought right!  No problem. And so you know,  I've taken care of all the security measures we discussed.  I had new locks installed.  I also had  a new security system put in.  (beeping)  And I installed  bars in all the windows so no one can ever get out.  You mean, so no one could ever get in?  No.  That's not  what I mean.  Rogo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it should be noted, that's when he realized  There's only one person in the world who has ever called me  by that name, my old prison pen pal Lola.  So you remember me?  But you-you couldn't be.  She was in jail when you worked for J. Lo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when he heard  the scariest words of all.  I've never met J. Lo."
"1 Okay, where to begin?  After being engaged and then broken up,  Jane and Michael are finally back together.  Not as thrilled? Jane's baby daddy/former boyfriend  Rafael, but that was over.  My feelings changed and that's why we aren't together.  And he did say he'd try to get on board with Michael.  Complicating everything? His ex-wife Petra.  See, she impregnated herself with Rafael's sperm.  And she was expecting twins! Oh, and did I mention  Rafael recently got back in touch with his mother?  You actually have a half brother.  - Oh, and turns out she's a crime lord. - It's her!  So, yeah, tough times for the Rafster.  Also going through tough times Jane's father,  international telenovela star, Rogelio de la Vega.  See, after he and Xo broke up, he and Jane got into a fight.  I just think I need some space right now.  Even worse, he was kidnapped by his number-one fan/  fan/prison pen pal/new assistant!  No one can ever get out.  I know, bananas!  So let's see what happens next.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was 15 years old, she fell hard and fast  for romance novels.      (record scratches)  What the?  (Alba clears throat)  (sighs)  Man, did Jane yearn to know what that black ink was hiding.  It was as if her whole life were leading up to that revelation.  Which brings us to last night,  just after Jane and Michael's romance-novel-worthy kiss.  Jane was ready. The time was right. What were they waiting for?  And so they finally had sex.  Lots and lots of sex.  Just kidding.  Geez, why are you all so obsessed with that anyway?  Here's what really happened.  (exhales) We got to take a break.  - No, let's have sex. - What?  I mean, I've been thinking about it, and it was  one thing to be a virgin when marriage was on the horizon.  But then we weren't together. And the finish line moved.  - And it seemed so far away! - Closer now.  - Huh? - The finish line.  - Because we're getting married. - Oh  that's true.  Yeah, and I wouldn't even be waiting that long.  Well, on the other hand, what's the point of waiting  if we're gonna get married anyway, you know?  Well, I mean, I did want to wait.  - Yeah. - And if it's gonna be soon.  Bro! You just blocked yourself!  In that case, get ready to be proposed to, because it's gonna happen soon.  Very soon.  (laughing)   And so Jane and Michael were back together.  And in some ways, it felt just like old times.  They ate Cubanos.  Jane and Michael? You're back together?!  They sent cute texts to each other.          They caught up on Scandal.  Honestly, I'm glad Olivia's done with Fitz.  Oh, my God, I knew it.  - You kept watching without me. You did! - No, I, no, I didn't  - Some of the guys from the office - You're a total Gladiator, admit it.  - Admit it. - (Mateo crying)  But then again, some things were different  - because there was a baby. - (knocking)  And a baby daddy.  This seems like a good time to catch up on what Rafael has been up to  these last ten days.  He has, in fact, been having sex.  Lots and lots of sex  with a lot of different women.  The exact number is not important.  But all six encounters had one thing in common.  Let's talk contraception.  I probably can't have kids, but we still need two different kinds.  I've got the condoms. Then either the pill, an IUD, the patch,  the ring, the shot or the sponge.  Yes, Rafael had decided that instead of no sex and babies,  he would try sex and no babies for a change.  Sorry I'm late. I keep missing that turn onto 3rd.  You'll recall Rafael promised to try with Michael.  Guess I need to give myself some more time.  Yeah, gets confusing.  So here he is, trying.  Don't worry, it took me a while to figure out the neighborhood.  And the traffic on the I-95 is the worst, so it's  In fact, I think it's safe to say that all three of them  were finding this trying.  So, I'll check in with you later and just tell you how he's doing.  Great, yeah. Have a good time with Daddy.  All right. See you two later.  Mm-hmm.  I just, huh  Did he seem okay to you?  Yeah, yeah, he seemed, uh, you know, normal.  Like he was trying to be nice.  - Well, let's talk about it. - No. (Stammers) I'm sorry.  - No, if you're, if you're worried. - I'm sure he's fine.  In times like these, Jane couldn't help but imagine what could've been  if she hadn't broken up with Michael all those months ago.  The Sliding Doors version, as it were.  - Raf! Hey! - Hey!  - Oh, come on in. - Hey, come to Daddy.  - Jane, Raf's here. - Oh, my boy!  - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, how are you?  Okay, now that I have you two here,  we need to start planning Mateo's first birthday party.  - Really? Three months early. Come on! - I mean, that's a little early, Jane.  - No way, you two. Don't gang up on me. - (both laughing)  - Okay, it wouldn't be like that. - Maybe not.  But if I hadn't left Michael back then, things would be so much easier.  And tomorrow would be our first wedding anniversary.  - Really? - (phone chimes)  - What? - Dad replied to my text.    So immature. Did you see his latest tweet?      I'm getting pissed. I know that I hurt his feelings.  But you don't just detach yourself from your family.  There's no excuse for that!  How about being held hostage by your old prison pen pal,  who disguised herself as your assistant?  - Please, let's talk. - We will.  - Without the shackles! - How can I trust you?  First you stopped writing to me. Then La Miseria stopped airing.  I was your biggest fan!  Okay, if there's any hope of recapturing the magic,  - I can't be shackled. - What are you talking about?  Cesar the Barefoot Bandito kept Estela in a love cage  until she finally developed feelings for him.            Look, you can't keep me here. I will be missed.  Tiago starts a two-week break tomorrow.  - My family will notice I'm gone. - You asked them for some space.  I'll stay in contact with them for you. Give me your passcode.  No, I will not do it.  (gasps)  No, not the face. Dear God, not the face.  007! It's 007!  Which brings us here now  to the biggest acting challenge of Rogelio's career.  Thank you, dear Lola.  It's so hard to believe I once feared you.    In some ways, it was working.  Occasionally, she removed his arm shackles.  See?  (phone chimes)  But not in all ways.  Another text from Jane?  ""Dad, it's been two weeks. I know I really hurt you and I'm sorry,  but please stop shutting us out. When do you get back?""    Please, Lola, she needs more than that.  She's missing her father.  I'll think about it.  - Time for night-night. - Maybe one night without the pill?  (chuckles)  I love you, Rogo.  Heard you got a lead on our missing person.  Yep, Derek's ex-girlfriend is back in town.  I know what you're thinking. Who is Derek? Well, Derek is  Actually, what the hell? Let's Scandal our way through this.  What? Michael's not the only fan.  Derek Ruvelle, son of Rafael's mother, Elena Di Nola.  Rafael's half brother. Is he a good guy or a bad guy?  Here's what we know rich kid, dropped out of Pepperdine.  - Classic Trustafarian, he travels. - Spends his mother's money.  Here's where it gets exciting Our buddy Derek disappeared  the day after Mutter's identity was discovered.  Social media accounts remain silent. Last known whereabouts place him  in St. Croix traveling with this woman, Avery Van Allen.  - So find me Avery Van Allen. - Just landed back in Miami.  She was in Ibiza. Want me to pick her up?  ÎÎ¿. Let's see if we can catch her off-guard.  Before she knows we're looking for her.  No, definitely not. I have no interest in finding my brother.  I know that. I'm just asking you to help us make contact, get information.  Sorry, I'm not getting involved.  (door opens)  Well, looks like Rafael's pretty much killing my investigation.  Oh, wait, I'm sorry. This is a Rafael-free zone.  - What is, what is all this? - Well, it's silly, but  today we would've been married one year.  So I thought we might as well celebrate anyway.  Old-school Jane and Michael style.  - Oh, yeah? Old-school? - Mmm, hard-core old-school.  (laughs)  Oh, I had the same thought.  - Happy would've-been-our-anniversary. - Oh  - Open it, open it, open it. - (laughs) Okay!  (gasps) No way.  - The new Angelique Harper? - Mm-hmm.  Oh Thank you, thank you, thank you.  And a hardcover, how decadent!  Î¥ou know me Living large.  And this is good. I can look at her without cringing.  Ah, yes, you'll recall this happened last year.  Even my masseuse has a manuscript.  - Oh, no, no, I'm not - You don't want me to read that?  Well, I-I do  Let's see how the massage goes first, okay, honey?  I wonder why she never responded to my chapter.  She liked my massage, trust me. Lots of moaning.  - Ooh. - Oh.    You all right?  Yeah, fine.    Okay, let's eat.  Wait, I thought tonight was old-school Jane and Michael.  - It is. - So what would old-school Jane do?  Beg to push dinner for an hour so that I could start reading.  - Fine, one hour. - (giggles)  Oh, man, a new Angelique Harper!  Let's see what it's about.        Huh, that's weird.      Wait a minute.  - What's going on? - Angelique Harper stole my idea.  Just listen! ""The harrowing story of a young woman  who bravely goes undercover as a man during the Revolutionary War  and falls for her mysterious commanding officer""?  She just changed the war and the names!  Turns out, she's coming into town for her book tour.  - She is? Perfect. - Mm-hmm.  I'm gonna confront her, and I am going to tell her  not only has she invited a major lawsuit,  but she has lost a very loyal fan.  How similar are they? Where's your computer?  What's Alba do with your laptop?  Watching this Venezuelan priest who puts his sermons online.  Pablo? As in Pablo Alonso Segura,  the man Alba lost her virginity to?  Let's translate this.    What?  Nothing.  Uh, so how do I prove plagiarism?    My girl is ""plucky and stubborn to a fault.""  She calls Clementine ""scrappy and bullheaded.""  Write everything down, every similarity.  Prohibitive similarities, that's what we're looking for.  Which is tricky, because there's coincidence. There's this case  of Dennis the Menace. Two separate cartoonists  Shh. I need to get through this.  You know what, I'm gonna call the DA tomorrow  and ask her legal advice.  Jane.  (whispering): It'll be okay.  Yeah.  I just loved that idea.  And I was gonna go back to it.  And now I can't.    I can't even Is she why you've been late to so many meetings?  No. No! Told you.  Jane and I have been getting our signals crossed.  You're hungover. Again.  Oh, Petra, honestly, back off.  Not in the mood. I'm tired.  You're tired? I'm full-term with twins.  Do you have any idea how rare that is? I'm a medical freakin' marvel.  I'm just blowing off some steam, I guess,  before I become a father of three.  No, you're not.  No, you're going to that dark place of yours.  - What? - Yeah, that place you go to.  In his defense, he had just discovered  his stepmother and his mother were rival crime lords.  Oh, and Jane dumped him.  - I just have a lot going on. - Yes, I know.  But all that other stuff, it's out of your control.  And you're about to become a father of three.  So enough with the self-indulgence and grow up.  Yeah.  - No, you're right. - Really?  Huh, that was easy.  So it's gonna be hard but not impossible.  The DA says the first step is establishing  that your material predates Angelique's.  Did you e-mail the chapter to anyone around then,  so we can, you know, establish your timeline?  Yeah, um, Rafael.  Okay, so let's search your sent e-mails.      (groans)  - We don't have to do this right now. - No, it's it's important.  (chiming)  Okay, so let's search your sent e-mails.  You must have sent it to me, right?  Of course I did, because you read every single draft  of every single thing I do.  Yep, there's my story.  Team Cordero-Villanueva for the win!  (whoops)  - Look, at least you found the e-mail. - Okay, shh, shh.  Hi there. Allison?  Yes, it's Olivia, Angelique Harper's assistant.  We met in the city during the holidays. Anyway, um, I'm doing some bookkeeping,  and I wanted to know if you know what fiscal quarter,  uh, Angelique's first draft of Revolution of the Son came in?  Me? Olivia Pope erson.  What? Oh, you know what, I can't hear you!  Yeah, I think I'm just, like, under a tunnel, so I'll just call you back!  Okay, you were right. That was a horrible idea.  - Mom. - You got to see this.  What?  I was checking my e-mails, I swear.  I didn't mean to see it, but there's this chat  between Mom and some guy. Oh, Mom, don't look at those.  - Come on, she was using my computer. - Too late. Too late.  ""My glorious Alba, how I long to see you, to touch you,  - to kiss you"" - Okay, enough, Mom.  ""like I did in 1972 when we made love""?  Oh, my God.  She had sex.  With a guy who wasn't Dad?  Wait, why aren't you freaking out?  - Did you know? - Yeah, but she just told me it happened.  She's really embarrassed, so don't say anything.  - Mom, I'm serious. - What a hypocrite.  - Let it go. - Says the girl who just impersonated  Angelique Harper's assistant.  - What? - Why don't you let that go?  That's different.    Oh, uh, nothing. We were actually just, um  discussing one of Angelique's passages from her book.  And the fact that you had sex before you were married!  - Seriously?! - You told her?  No. No, she read the messages from Pablo.  You lied to me this whole time?        Oh, my God, are you serious?  You're such a hypocrite.          I did not sleep around, Ma! Do not make me feel like a slut!    You are! Like you always have!  And I am not!  I am just a normal woman who enjoys having sex.  And you have made me feel like crap about it my entire life!  (crying): And that's why I'm so pissed.      She's right, Abuela.  I'm gonna go make sure that she's okay.    Hey.  You okay?  Yeah, I just  I don't know.  It just came out.  You don't have to explain.  - Your dad's tweeting again. - Really?  (chuckles)      Talk about a staycation.  Okay, last photo,  and you'll tweet that you're so sad that the trip is nearly over.  Perfection.  Well, that's easy.  I am sad. Because this time has been so special.  That's one way to put it.  And now we must return to reality,  as the couple we are.  - If you return. - Hmm?  We're at the part of the story that I love so much.          And that's how I feel.  I love you.    - But, see, I don't believe you. - What?  It doesn't feel the same, like you love me like that.  - But I do. - Don't lie to me!  Okay, fine, you're right.  We're not at the part of the story where I'm in love yet.  We're in the part of the story where Estela  realizes there's something holding her back.    You have alienated me from Jane.  She still thinks I'm angry with her.  And you won't let me put her mind at ease.  Bravo, Rogelio! Daniel Day-Lewis would be proud!  Look  Look, I understand family.  I miss my mother every day.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't killed her.  As a gesture, to improve our relationship, let's reply.  - Good. - I'll type!  What do you want to say?  (clears throat)  ""Dear Jane.  I'm sorry I haven't reached out.  It's just that I'm having a wonderful vacation  and service has been spotty.  But you don't have to apologize.  It's fine.  I love you.  And tell your mom, 'besos.'""  Hmm. Something tells me a besos is not just a besos, in this case.  And then I usually add four happy-face-heart-eye emojis.  ""Besos""? What the hell is that supposed to mean?  (laughing) What do you mean? It's a sweet message finally.  - It's not sweet at all. - Why?  Yes, why? What is it, Xo?  He used to end his texts to me with ""besos"" until I made him stop.  You respond to your creepy Twitter stalkers  and tell them, ""Besos""?  Each and every fan is a gift, Xiomara.  Yeah, but you say the same thing to me.  I don't want to be lumped in with thousands of other stalker fans.  Millions.  And you're right, I will never text ""besos"" to you again.  You're too special to me.  And now he texts it to me? What am I supposed to think?  ""Besos"" equals ""creepy stalker.""  He's obviously being passive-aggressive. I'm not special anymore.  No, that's not it!  Anyway, I should just stop obsessing about this.  I should just let it go, right?  No! Don't let it go!  Probably  But I am gonna write him back, okay?  You should. Absolutely.    ""I really do feel terrible that I didn't come  to the Tiago premiere. I should have been there,  but you have to know how important you are to me,  and I miss you and love you,  and as soon as you come back from vacation,  I want to see you.""  - You're lucky to have her. - I really am.  And I look forward to you two getting to know each other better.  All right, let's give you your sleeping pill.  I'm telling you, he was out of it.  Like, a sloppy drunk mess.  At first I wasn't sure it was Rafael, but it was him.  You positive about that?  Talk or you're fired.  It takes four texts and three phone calls for you to pick up?  I was almost asleep. You almost woke up Mateo.  Well, this is important. Something's up with Rafael.  - Petra, that's not my responsibility. - Are you kidding me?  This is Mateo's father.  - I know. - And I'm worried.  He's been neglecting work lately, and he's been drinking a lot.  Our server saw him wasted at the Fontainebleau today.  He told me he was with Mateo. Was he?  - No. - I tried to talk to him,  but I guess I didn't get through. And  he listens to you. Please?  Jane.  (whispering): You okay?  I'll call you back, okay?  - But I - I'll call you back.  What's wrong?  That was Petra. She's worried about Rafael.  He's been off lately and was totally wasted today at the Fontainebleau.  Look, I'm sorry to bring him up, it's it's just, I'm I'm worried, too.  It  - it's not what you think it is. - What?  Rafael was there today because he's working with the police.  Let me fill you in. Remember this?  - I just have a lot going on. - Yes, I know.  But all that other stuff, it's out of your control.  Rafael realized it wasn't in fact all out of his control.  There was one thing he could do.  I want to help you find my mother.  - You guys are working together. - Yes, but  look, that's obviously privileged.  I didn't want you to go chasing after him.    I wasn't gonna go chasing after him.  Didn't mean it like that.  I know.  Or maybe I did.  I'm sorry.  I'm I'm just trying to be honest.  Seeing those e-mails between you two,  it really bothered me.  - I know. - You were in love with him.  And I knew that.  But seeing them  I don't know.  - It brought me back to that night. - I can't be with you.  I'm so sorry, Michael.    I keep telling myself it won't happen again,  but you know.  Trust me, I wish I could go back and make a different choice.    (faint, echoed chiming)    (exhales)  And you don't have, like, a boat sale coming up?  No. Got it.  Okay, let's pull the trigger.  Thank you. Whew.  - $400 for a boat rental? - It's worth it.  Michael keeps going back to that moment, so I want to redo it.  Make a new memory for us. The way it should have happened.  Petra?  Look, I need your help. Don't worry,  it's not about Rafael. Well, it is, but only peripherally.  - He just canceled on me. - Hi, Petra.  Oh. Hello Xiomara.  - Cute shorts. - Thank you. Your hair is nice.  Thank you.  (sighs): Anyway, Rafael was supposed to take me  to my birthing class A class he insisted on signing me up for.  I don't want to go alone and sit there  with all those smug judgy moms staring at me.  Okay, so are you here to ask me if I'll go with you?  Would you? I don't want to go alone.  Can you watch Mateo?  Okay, let's do it.  - You sure you don't want me to drive? - Nope. Have to keep control of the car.  'Cause we're not going to birthing class, we're going to confront Rafael.  - What? - Sorry, I had to get you into the car.  I tracked him down using Find My Phone. He's at The W.  Yeah, probably meeting, like, a work contact for happy hour.  Or a person of interest for the police for happy hour.  Oh, my God! Stop being so naive, Jane!  This is serious! Look, he listens to you, so we're going to confront him together.  Do something, Jane! Or Petra's gonna blow this investigation wide open!  Freeze! Don't move.  Wow, that generic drugstore tan-in-a-box  isn't doing you any favors, buddy.  Bless you, Lola I feel so much better now.  You're so thoughtful.    Tell me, when we emerge as a couple,  do you prefer Rola  or Logelio?      Let's think about it tonight.  After a special dinner.  Sure.  And it's special why, exactly?  Because there's a full moon.  Don't you remember? Cesar and Estela  ate dinner and then they finally made love  in the light of the full moon.  What?! Rafael's working with the police?  Well, you could've told me this an hour ago.  Have you got any idea how hard it is to drive this pregnant?  Seriously? You practically kidnapped me!  Whatever. Let's go.  Join me in welcoming best-selling romance novelist Angelique Harper.  - Ugh! - What? I thought you loved her.  Didn't Rafael, like, propose or something during a reading?  Yeah. But after,  well  I went to her room with my chapter, she mistook me for a masseuse,  I gave her a 90-minute massage, and then I gave her my chapter,  and then she stole my idea.  - You gave her a massage? - Did you not hear me? She stole my idea.  She did.  It's always so interesting to hear what inspires an artist.  How did Revolution of the Son come about?  You know, it's funny. I was getting a massage,  and I was so relaxed,  the idea just sprang from my head fully formed.  Not unlike Athena, from the head of Zeus.  - Oh, my God, she stole your idea! - I told you!  - I'm just trying to let it go. - Let it go? What is wrong with you?  No, we can't let her get away with this.  Where's that book signing? We're gonna get her to admit it.  You want to help me?  Okay, don't make it into a thing, all right?  I'm overdue with twins and looking to yell at someone.  (tires squealing)  - This could take hours. - All right.  Excuse me, pardon me. Hi. I'm sorry, I'm pregnant.  Do you mind if I just kind of squeeze through?  I really appreciate it. Excuse me, pardon me. Could I  - No. - Oh.  Yeah, never mind. We'll wait.  You need some prep time, anyway. So, what are you gonna say to Angelique?  Trust me, I've been rehearsing this. I'm gonna say, ""Do you remember me?  You stole my idea. I left a chapter with you.""  And I threw it away I don't accept unsolicited materials.  - What are you doing? - Toughening you up.  - I'm sure any similarity was coincidental. - Coincidental? It's the same idea.  - Security, take her away. - Okay, enough. You made your point.  What do you suggest I say?  I have a confession.    A confession?  So early in the day?  Well, it must be the tequila.    It wasn't totally random  our meeting.  I'm trying to find my brother.  - His name's Derek. - What?  Hold on. Wait, wait. Look, I just need to talk to him, okay?  - He's my brother. - Stay away from me. All of you.  Hi, Angelique. I'm here because the plot of your book  was stolen from a chapter that I gave you,  and I've had a committee of independent authors  review the works side by side, and my legal team seems to think  I have a pretty strong case. So I'm here to tell you  - that a formal complaint is forthcoming. - All right. Better.  - Yeah, right? - Yeah. But you need  to drop your voice another octave. And never lose eye contact.  Calm. Quiet.  It's always much scarier.  It really is.  - Got it. On it. - Good.  You're welcome.  - Oh, my God. - Oh!  Sorry. I feel like I'm peeing my pants.  - The babies must be right on my bladder. - Really?  Are you sure that your water just didn't break?  What? I don't know. You're the one who had a baby.  My water didn't break. It's-it's rare, actually.  That's true. My sister's did.  It's not a big splash like they show on TV.  - Does it feel like you're peeing? - Yep. Just feels like you're peeing.  - Oh, my God, I feel like I'm peeing! - Okay, all right, stay calm.  - We're gonna go to the hospital. - You're up, miss.  Go. I'm calling an Uber.  I'd be lying if I said Jane didn't briefly consider it.  No, no, come on, come on. Step aside, people, she's having a baby!  Two babies!  Oh, boy! Looks like we're doing this again!  Where is he?  Michael's getting him, Rafael's gonna be here.  No, not Rafael, the doctor with the drugs, I need the drugs.  Oh, good. Uh, she is ready for her epidural.  So, here's the thing. You can't have one, Petra.  Your blood tests indicate that your platelet levels  are too low, it's too risky, you could bleed too much.  - Any wiggle room there? - Excuse me?  Look, if there's a 50% chance I won't die,  - I'd like to go for it. - She's kidding.  - No, I'm not kidding. - Petra, you can do this. She can do this.  Hurry!  Multi-car accident up ahead,  fire, the works. The highway's down to one lane.  Yeah.      Oh, no, it's coming back. Oh, oh, oh, oh oh  Okay, breathe. Breathe  Oh, shut up, that's not working!  Is it me or is labor making Petra meaner?  - Don't clench, you gotta let go. - Distract me!  - Um, okay - Quick!  Uh, uh, uh  Michael and I are having issues.  Did you ever see that movie Sliding Doors?  - Hated it. - Anyway, I just keep thinking  about how I screwed things up and how I wish I could just take it back.  - That's so stupid. - What?  Well, clearly things weren't that great, or you wouldn't have broken up.  Let the past go  Says the woman who artificially inseminated herself with her ex's sperm.  Trust me, I'm regretting that now.  - (chuckles) - (snorts, exhales)  Also full of regrets?                (sighs)            - (sighs) - Thanks, Ma.  Here's how you can make it up to me.  You can tell me about Pablo.  I'm serious.  I want details.  What did he look like?      - Huh? - (laughs)  ""Sexy, strong, like the man she knew all those years ago,  - out on the battlefield."" - (wailing)  Keep reading! Oh. ""She-she  couldn't be sure it was him, but it was. They spoke.  - ""Oh!"" her father said. - (shouts)  The pain was unbearable. It was the kind of pain  - that tore through her."" - (shouting)  - Breathe, Petra, breathe. - (moaning)  (exhales)  ""It was him. He looked at her and her breath caught, just like always""  And a funny thing happened as she read from her novel:  Jane realized her book and Angelique's weren't actually that similar.  Well, except for the cross-dressing premise,  but, really, Jane had ripped that off of Twelfth Night.  And Shakespeare had based his on some Italian play and  What's wrong with you? Keep reading!  ""Mauricio's skin was glistening a little. Sweaty.""  Looks like you finished dinner.  Do they really make love right after?  Because I get a little bloaty after dinner.  To true love.  And all the different ways it grabs you.  Okay.  Get ready.  - (groans) - Are you all right?  - Just got a little tired. - Let's cuddle up then. Here, lay down.  - Okay. - Yeah. Mm-hmm.  - Just for a minute. - All right.  Okay, so here's what happened. Remember this?  Let's give you your sleeping pill.  Rogelio considers his oily T-zone to be his one facial flaw.  And so he had the costumer of Tiago  sew a special pocket in his underwear where he could stash  a secret supply of pressed powder.  A little powder panty pocket.  And he stored the pill in there.  And from there, he slipped it into her drink.  Hurry, Rogelio. Just find the keys and get out of there!  - (moaning) - Okay, here we go.  I'm gonna need you to push.  - Where's Rafael? - Uh, he's hurrying.  - I'm not gonna make it, am I? - I don't think so.  I'm sorry.  - I'm sorry. - (Petra shouts)  - Come on, Petra, push. - I can't. I can't anymore.  And so Jane said the words her grandmother said to her mother  and her mother said to her  Five minutes of pain for a lifetime of happiness.      It's time, Petra. Push again.  - No, I'm done. I can't. - I'm gonna need you to push.  - No, I can't. - Are you serious?  After all that talk in the line at the bookstore about being tough?  Suck it up  and push those babies out.  (whimpers)  (breathing rapidly)  (grunting, shouting)  (baby crying)  Here she is. A little girl.  - (panting) - She's beautiful.  (laughs)  - Oh, okay. - Yes.  Okay. Ready to go again.  - Huh? - Yeah.  Come on.  (panting)  (grunting, shouting)  (baby crying)  (panting)  (laughs)  (panting)  - Is it over? - It's over.  - You did it. - (sobs)  You did it.  (crying)  I'm sorry I called you all those horrible names.  - You didn't. - Oh, I did. Trust me.  It was just in Czech.  Thank you, though.  Of course.  Hey, do you want to know their names?  Rafael and I already decided.  Elsa.  - And Anna. - (laughs) Wait  - What? - Elsa and Anna?  Like in Frozen?  - What do you mean? - That's the names of the sisters.  In Frozen.  - The movie? - Oh. (Scoffs)  Well, no one except for you would think of that.  Let it go, Jane.  Nice names.  - Just beautiful. - Oh, I missed it.  I can't believe I missed it. How are you?  - I'm okay. - She was a warrior.  - (chuckles) - Here.  - That's Elsa. - Oh.  Hi. Hi, Elsa.  Hi, Anna.  Oh, wow. They're beautiful.  They are, right? It's not just me?  (sneezes, cries)  No, they're perfect.  They're so perfect.  - Oh, yeah! - (laughs)  I'm starving. Salt and vinegar. You rock.  Wow. Easy to please.  And to think, I rented a boat.  I wanted to go back and redo the moment when things went wrong,  - when I made the wrong choice. Oh, - I shouldn't have brought that up.  No. No, it's okay. Because, um,  I realized  I don't want to go back.  I mean, there was a lot of stuff wrong in our relationship.  I mean, you weren't being honest about who you were.  I wasn't being nest about what I wanted in life.  And that's why we broke up.  Are you breaking up with me now?  Never. No.  I'm just saying I don't want to go back.  Because we're better now.  - Yeah. - And I want you to know  that you are absolutely who I want.  And I'm not going anywhere.  I'm not either.  Oh. (Gasps)  I wasnât gonna do this here, but, Jane  - Yes! Yes! Okay! - Wait, wait. Can I ask?  - Okay, get ready. Jane, will you - Yes. Sorry. Yes.  - Sorry, sorry, sorry! - Will you will you marry me?  - Will you marry me? - Yes! Yes!  Ah, true love.  The kind Angelique Harper might write about.  Were this a romance novel.    But, of course, it's not.  I thought you'd be excited.    Yep. And he's coming.  Xiomara.        Ocean view, perfect.  And how long will you be staying for?  Not sure.  (grunting) (rattling)  I knew it. You were lying to me.  Please, Lola. Don't make me do it. Please stop or I'll shoot!  You would've shot me?  No.  I knew it was a fake."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, let's do this, peeps.  After breakups and make-ups, Jane the Virgin  finally got engaged to Michael.  - Will you marry me? Marry me! - Yes! Yes!  And her baby daddy Rafael, well, he said he'd try  to accept it, maybe because he had other things on his mind.  See, his ex-wife Petra just gave birth to twins.  - Elsa and Anna. - Like in Frozen?  No one except for you would think of that.  Oh, and he recently learned  his mother was a crime lord.  I know, cray-cray, right?  Even crazier, he was working with Michael  to find his long-lost brother.  Derek Ruvelle, son of Rafael's  mother Elena Di Nola.  Our buddy Derek disappeared the day after  Mutter's identity was discovered.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this  Jane's father,  international telenovela star Rogelio de la Vega  was kidnapped by his biggest fan.  And even worse, he's in a fight with his family.  I just think I need some space right now.  So they aren't even that worried!  Such bad luck, right?  And speaking of, Alba  had been corresponding with her first lover,  the notorious Pablo Alonso Segura.  And Xo invited him for a visit.      And I got to say I really hope that's not true, don't you?  Breaking news   our Jane Gloriana Villanueva always had strong opinions.  I'm embarrassed to be from Florida.  About politics.  Too revealing change!  Her mother's wardrobe.  Jane, no!      And her grandmother's superstitions.  - Stop, that's ridiculous. - Ay!    And I don't want to mistake correlation for causation,  -  - but here we are today.  Six weeks away from our Jane marrying the man of her dreams.    I'm working on it. I'm working on it.  I know what you're thinking.  That we've been here before, right?  But this time was different.  This time there were no reservations.  Did you make the reservations for the chair rentals?  No, I'm finalizing the head count.  Michael's brother's a no, so that's 25.  No, 26 both his parents are driving down.  Seriously? Aren't they, like, archenemies or something?  Well, they're not in a comic book, but yes, basically.  They haven't been in the same room  since Michael's high school graduation.  - He's freaking out. - Well, you never know.  I mean, engagements bring people together.  Michael's parents, Alba and Pablo.      Ah, yes, Pablo Alonso Segura.  The man,  the myth, the legend.  Abuela, you're gonna have to,  because he's traveling from Venezuela.      You're being ridiculous. Now, back to the list.  The only question mark is Dad.  He still hasn't gotten back to you?  No.  I'm calling him again.  (phone autodials)  LOLA: Hello?  Hey, Paola.  Just trying to get in touch with my dad.  I'm sorry, Jane.  -  - He just stepped into a meeting  with a very important casting director.  He'll be tied up for a while.  (sighs) Have him call me back.  Tell him that it's important.  You know what? Tell him  I'm marrying Michael.  You got it. I'll give him that message.  (beep)  If you don't call  she'll know something's wrong.  No!  You can't call!  Stop arguing with me!  You'll say good-bye to them tonight   when we livestream our murder-suicide.  Okay, if he doesn't respond,  then there's something definitely wrong.  Something is definitely wrong.  God, this is frustrating!  Thank you for taking Mateo.  I should go I don't want to be late for my new advisor.  Stop. She's gonna love you.  I got to be frank last thing I wanted is another advisee.        I hear you.  A-And I'm sorry to be adding to your schedule.  Yeah, and apparently,  you wanted a new advisor because of some complications  with your old one?  That's one way to put it.  Well, life is complicated.  B-But it's all material, right?  That's the clichÃ©.  So, what do you write?  Well, uh, my genre is romance.  (quietly): Barf.  Did she just say   Ex-Excuse me, what was that?  I said ""barf.""       So, you're not a fan of romance. Good to know. (chuckles)  But I do hope you keep an open mind.  - My mind is always open. - Well, I was  Careful, Jane, you're running out  of English Department faculty members.  Just as long as it passes the Bechdel test, okay?  - Got it. Yes. - You've heard of it?  No. No, I haven't.  It's a three-part question.    Does the work feature two female characters  -  - with names    who talk about something other than a man?    Like, for instance, you, Jane,  talking to me, Professor Donaldson,  about the work  that passes the test.  But you, Jane, talking to me, Marlene,  about your former advisor, Jonathan Chavez  that doesn't pass the test.  Oh, yeah, well  I mean, m-my work certainly passes the test.  Translation: Jane will certainly check  to make sure her work passes the test.  (laughs): Great! Because otherwise  barf.  Just a little spit-up.  You're okay, Anna.  (Elsa crying)  - Hey, Petra, can you ? - Sure.  - (electronic ding) - No, no, no, I meant can you just pick her up?  Oh, no, it's fine. I needed water.  Hi. Elsa's crying again.  And, um, I needed water, room temperature.  Again, that's not what the button is for.  But anyway, I have some good news.  Dr. Grove says you're getting out today.  What?  I-I thought I, um,  I needed to stay longer  because of my platelet problem.  Things look better. You're good to go.  The babies, too?  Yes. The babies, too.  Petra  don't worry, we can do this.  JANE: It's gonna be okay.  Michael, I promise.  (sighs): Oh, I don't know. The last time my parents  were together, it was a disaster.  There was fighting, finger-pointing, tears  - mostly mine, but still - (laughs)  Come on, they are not gonna do that in front of me.  That's because the only thing they can agree on  is how much they love you.  Which is why you can't leave the room.  - I won't leave. - No, I'm serious.  Not even to go to the bathroom.  Well, I might have to go to the bathroom.  Remember that astronaut that put the diaper on?  - Stop it. (laughs) - Where's your commitment?  - No, I'm serious. - Oh. - (doorbell rings)  Hi, Mom.  - Hi, Dad. - Hey.  Hi!  Oh, Jane. Hi.  I didn't realize you'd be here.  Oh. W-Well, I wanted to see you.  Come on in.  Mike, we were hoping for a  private moment alone.  We have some important family business  we want to discuss.  Oh. Well, it's just Jane.  I'm just gonna tell her whatever you say anyway.  MRS. CORDERO: Fine.  We think you're making a mistake.  Don't marry her.  Barf.  You you don't want Michael to marry me?  You were heartbroken, Mikey. Don't you remember?  When we found out the two of you were back together,  I called your father. We got to talking.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At least Jane's still bringing them together.  We wanted to reach out, but then the next thing we knew,  we were getting an evite to an engagement party.  - That's enough. That's enough. - Michael it's okay.  You guys should talk.  Um I'll see you later.  (clears throat softly)  I am so sorry. You should not be leaving.  They should be leaving. I'll kick them out.  No, no, no, don't do that. Go back inside you know,  the longer you're out here, the worse it'll be,  because then they'll think I'm upset.  You are upset.  No, no, I'm not.  Just go back inside and talk to them.  Oh, yeah, and remind your mom  about the time we got mani-pedis,  and a smoothie, and we split an Orange Zinger,  and she said that I felt like the daughter that she never had,  and make it seem like I told you that at the time  because I was so touched, and not today, okay?  Okay, go. Go.  PETRA: Honestly, go.  - We'll be fine. - I was planning on staying over.  I've got it covered.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, Helga has it covered.  And Wilma.  Well, I guess you could sit in here  with Helga and Wilma all night.    (laughs)  See? They think it's silly, too.      Heard you've been looking for me.    The cops send you?  No.    But they do want to talk to you.  I went to prep school with a topflight attorney.  - I'll let him know. - Good.  Okay, look, man, this isn't about the cops, okay?  Up until a few months ago,  I didn't even know I had a brother.  Did-did you know?  - About me? - No.  Okay.  I mean, so, can can we at least just talk?  Maybe.  I'll be in touch.  I'm staying here, by the way.  Mind if I send you the bill  brother?  (door closes)  You'll meet him in public.  Don't go off with him alone.  Okay, I got it.  (beeps twice)  Oh.  I I should go.  It's, uh Jane.  Yeah. Never not awkward.  Maybe once Mateo's in college.  Let me know when you see him.  (smacks lips) Okay.  (beep)  (sighs) Hi.  Jane, look, I'm so sorry.  I don't care what my parents say.  No, no, no, it's not that. Well, I mean,  it's definitely that, too, but  I'm worried about my dad.  I left him a message this morning,  and I told him that we were engaged,  and he hasn't called me back all day.  And we want to go check in on him,  but he told us to give him his space.  Okay, I'll-I'll swing by the condo  and see what's going on with him.  Thank you. I love you.  He's gonna go check on him.  Good. I feel better.  Hey, can you move  those papers? Pablo will be here any minute.  Yeah, sure. Sorry. I was just making sure  that my chapters passed the Bechdel test.        Yeah, she sounds like a hard-ass.  Have you had any movement with Michael's parents?  No, and I'm so frustrated,  because I love him so much.  - (buzzer sounds) - But I don't know how to prove that to them.  (groans)  Look who it is.  - Finally. - Okay, good.  Bechdel test, take two.  Why aren't you dressed? Pablo's gonna be here any minute.  - (buzzer sounds) - Geez, this thing is tough.          Ma, stop being ridiculous.          - (both chuckle) -           Fine. What's the undeniable proof?      Afterwards, we will consider sending him away.    (sighs)                                        JANE: Abuela, there are, like, 100 different  environmental factors that go into an early frost.      - (doorbell rings) - (gasps)  He's here! Come on, Abuela.  No, no, no, no, no. Dame.          Please come in.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, this could totally be explained  by a fuse blowing or a power outage.  (gasps) Or is it   the Curse of Pablo Alonso Segura?  It's just our house. The other houses on the street have power.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not entirely true.    Good question. Let me go check on her.  Stop.  It's not a curse.  You're being silly.    Yes. And you're being rude.  Now, that nice man travelled a long way to see you  and, yes, maybe we shouldn't have invited him,  but I read those chats,  and you certainly wrote pretty vividly  about wanting to see him.  So I'm gonna need you to come out of this room right now.  And I would change because he's fine.    Just one more minute.  It'll be quick,  painless,  and when our death goes viral,  we'll be famous.  And they'll make a movie about us,  - maybe. - At this point, Rogelio's life  actually did start to flash before him.    His first smile.    Wait, what?  Oh, yeah. This part is really happening.  And now's a good time to remind you that Jane's fiancÃ©  is a detective.  -  - And remember, he was sent by Jane  to see if Rogelio was okay.    Huh. Since when does Rogelio not rush out  to open his monthly Cosmetic Crate delivery?          And here is where we left off.  Lola, could we do this outside?  The dramatic skyline, the sound of the ocean behind us  it'll add more production value.  Please, please, don't-don't let me die  against a flat background lit by unflattering light.  Okay. We'll go outside  - Drop the weapon. - Oh!  - Drop it. Drop it. - No!  (grunting)  No.  - Let me go! - Calm down.  Rogelio!  - It's over. - No!  Rogelio!  - (shouting indistinctly) - (exhales)  (inhales deeply)                                        - Jane! - (gasps)  It's fine!  Just the wind! Finish what you were saying.  (phone rings)  Michael  Dad was kidnapped.  Is there a particular concealer you'd recommend  - for an injury of this kind? - Uh,  concealer, like  Makeup. To cover up wounds.  - Surely I'm not the first to ask this. - Dad!  Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh.  Yes, I'm okay, I'm okay.  Oh. (exhales)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And then they remembered they were broken up.  And this guy.  My hero. My best friend.  And now my daughter's fiancÃ©. I'm so happy for you two!  WOMAN: Oh my  God!    - Soledad, what are you doing here? - I heard what happened.  The news outlet has it now.  It's a huge story everywhere.  - Really? - Oh, yeah.  I'm getting calls from big people.  - How about - Not yet.  - Might we - I'm putting out feelers.  JANE: Who are they talking about?  JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart from Telemundo.  It's your dad's dream to be interviewed by him.  Just don't tell the story to any other news outlets, all right?  - Because JDB would need an exclusive. - My lips  - are sealed. - But you can talk to family.  Are you okay? What happened?  I'm fine.  I just want to put it behind me.  Oh, my God. 1.3 million more  - Twitter followers. - I know.  - I know. Oh, I can't even. - I can't even.  - I really can't even. - I can't even even can't even.  I seriously can't even.  Is she in there?  Thank you.  Good morning.  What are you doing here?  The band canceled for the live music series.  Weren't you copied on the e-mails?  I've called the agencies. Now I have about  - 15 artists to listen to. - I can take care of that.  You just had twins.  You heard what Dr. Grove said. I'm been cleared  to resume regular activities, hence (chuckles)  Not every mother has to stay home.  I actually feel happy here.  But, hey, if you want to go upstairs, by all means.  JANE: Well, excuse me.  Who is the most handsome boy in the whole world?  Is it you, Mr. Sweetface? (chewing sounds)  Huh? Yes? Maybe you should come with me  to dinner with Michael's parents later.  Right? 'Cause nobody can resist you.  - (phone chimes) - Oh. Oh, what is this?  -  - An e-mail from Professor Donaldson.  Should we open it, Mateo?  Should we?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's it?  Yes. That was the whole e-mail.  And now I have to go meet with her.  Which, heads up, I'm dreading.  XIOMARA: Relax, Hon.  She's obviously just a really cold person.  Keep up the good, brave work.  Thanks. Thanks so much.  Come on in.  - So, I got your heads-up. - Yeah, I never like  you kids to be blindsided.  Everyone's so, you know, ""sensitive"" these days.  But, yeah, not into it.  So how can I address your concerns?  Because I do think, overall,  the work passed the Bechdel test.  Well, yeah, big whoop.  That's pretty baseline, right?  Let me ask you a question.  What kind of a book are you writing?  Is it, you know, like, a book for bored housewives?  Or is it about something?  It should be noted that Jane found this  more than slightly offensive.  Both, I'm hoping.  Well, then you better get back to work.  'Cause it's, you know, not now.  Maybe put it in context.  Give it a ""frame.""    DIRECTOR: Move the frame to the left.                  Good.  Now we go to soft focus and reveal it's a dream.  Cut!  - Rogelio. Are you okay? - Mm-hmm?  You're not kissing with your usual passion.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (coughs): Tongue.  Yes. I'm fine.  I'm fine.  Jane. Hi.  What a surprise.  Oh. Hey, Dad. I just came by  to check in, see how you're doing.  Incredible.  I feel that I'm accessing this whole new set of emotions  and their corresponding facial expressions.  I'm more  wounded now.  But sexy wounded.  Probably that's what JDB responded to.  JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart?  Fine, you pried it out of me.  Yes, I will be sharing the harrowing tale of my kidnapping  with him exclusively.  Oh, wow.  It means that I'll be late to your engagement party, though.  Is that okay?  Don't even think about it. But, Dad,  I haven't even heard what happened.  D-Do you want to tell me, maybe?  I do.  Bu-But I also want it to be fresh,  so I don't seem rehearsed, you know?  Is that it? Because we haven't even talked.  I-I'm sorry that I was late to your premiere.  Oh, stop it. No, I'm fine.  I just want to move forward.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which Jane understood, after all.  Which brings us here, now.  So, I-I just wanted to say thank you  for agreeing to come to dinner.  And honestly,  I understand where you're coming from,  - how it looks - It looks like  you fell in love with someone else and dumped our son.  Right.  And I know it seems like that,  but just to explain myself a little,  I was accidentally artificially inseminated.  My whole life was upside down.  And so you left the one person who stood beside you.  You threw him out like a  - Dirty tissue. - Exactly.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: On the bright side,  these two are really getting along.  How do we know you won't do it again?  Guys, go easy.  It's okay. It's fine.  You can ask me anything you want.  And yes, I left Michael.  And I regret it.  And I would never do it again.  Were you dating them both at the same time?  As soon as I realized I had feelings  for Rafael, I told Michael.  Yeah, and then threw him aside, no second thoughts.  Well, I-I didn't want to lead him on.  How long did you wait  before getting together with Rafael?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. This must be  where Michael gets his interrogation skills.  Well, that isn't the point, I told him  How long, Jane?  That same night.  That same night?  And now you want my son  to help raise this other guy's kid?  Enough.  This is not some other guy's kid.  This is Mateo. And I love him,  and I love Jane. Way too much  to be putting up with this disrespect.  Come on, we're leaving.      Abuela, enough. (sighs) What am I supposed to do?  Michael's parents don't like me.    Ma, come on, it's Jane.  - What? - Nothing.  Just that  you have a compulsive need to be liked.  I do not.  Jane.    I don't.  I just want my freaking in-laws to like me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And her freakin' advisor.  MARLENE: What's the context? What's the frame?    RAFAEL: So, was it any good?  Ugh. No idea.  Honestly, my brain is fried,  but there's a frame. They are  - beautiful, Raf. - Thank you.  Are you ready to have a playdate with your sisters? (whooshes)  Oh. (chuckles)  I'll leave you to it. I got to go grade papers.  Oh, um, can I ask you a question, actually?  It's about Petra.  I'm worried she's not really bonding with the babies.  - What do you mean? - Well, she's not holding them, really.  And she's working already, and I can't bring it up  without her accusing me of treating her  like a 1950s housewife.  Is that normal?  I don't know. I mean, everybody's  experience is different, right?  I mean, I became a shut-in. M-My mom had to basically  force me out of the house.  Yeah, well, the mom thing isn't really an option.  So, um  maybe you'll have to give her the push?  It'll happen.  And when they bond I mean,  that mother-child thing is intense.  Isn't it? Isn't it, Mateo?  - (phone dings) - Say ""Bye, Mommy.""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup. It sure is.    Slight change of plans: I'm on my way to Fort Myers.  What?  Michael's parents left.  They said that they weren't coming  to the engagement party, so I'm going there.  Jane.  What?  It's only 112 more miles.  This is crazy. So they don't like you.  It's not about them liking me!    Okay, well, it kind of is,  but it's about Michael, too.  I mean, he wants his family there.    And plus, you know, I-I get why they're protective.  I get the parent-child bond.  So I just want to appeal to Mrs. Cordero as a mother.    MRS. CORDERO: Jane, really,  - this isn't a good time. - No, no, no, please,  l-let me just say one thing. Please.  I am so sorry. And you know what, I know how you feel.  If anyone broke Mateo's heart, oh, my God. Oh, my God.  - Right now - I just-I just want one more chance to prove to you  how much I love your son. And I do. That's why I'm here.  Because if you don't come, you'll hurt him.  And I know you don't want that. No mother wants that.  I'll think about it.  And if you'll excuse me  I really should get back to my book club.  Your  Sorry about that.  I-If it makes any difference, I loved that book, too.      Okay.  (knocking)  Hey.  Hi. (giggles)  I heard you paid a little visit to my mom's book club.  Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.  I didn't know they were all gonna be sitting there.  No, don't apologize. It worked.  My parents are coming to the party.  Apparently  the, uh, book club ladies were really feeling you.  Yeah, well, I mean, those are my people.  Thank you for doing that.  Of course. Family matters.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, Family Matters.  It wasn't just a terrific Friday night TV staple.    It was also a mantra Rafael was leaning on in this moment.  So  tell me about yourself.  I'm not talkative.  Anything else?  Nope.  How's the food?  Mm.  Okay, man, come on,  I'm just trying to get to know you.  Then ask the question you really want to know.  Did you know our mother was a crime lord?  No. Did you?  No. But I'm not the one who disappeared  after she was exposed.  And I didn't have tunnels under my hotel  where people did illegal surgeries.  Where were you?  You really want to know?  I do.  Fine.  Let's go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait. No. What did Michael say?  Don't follow him anywhere.  And yet, there he goes.  Right this way. So, you can prepare here.  Sorry there's not more room.  Are you kidding? It's like four cubano trucks in here.    (gasps) Ooh,  sexy, Ma.    And you sure it's not for your date after?  Hmm? You're gonna lose  that sweater, right? And show Pablo that hot little bod?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's safe to say this  conversation fails the Bechdel test miserably.  (phone buzzes)    Hello?  What?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I'll be there.  Be there? Where are you going? The party's gonna start.  And I'll be back as soon as I can, but that was Dad's agent.  What-what are you doing here?  I heard you were having a hard time.  What's going on?  I just  I don't think I can do this interview.  And you don't have to if you don't want to.  No, but I do want to, that's the point.  It's one of my #LifeGoals.  I always wanted to open my heart and soul  to JosÃ© DÃ­az-Balart.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Who doesn't?  But I don't know.  It's just, every time I think about  saying it out loud  I get choked up.  And not like a single tear  glistening down my cheek thing,  but like  Oh, Dad, of course you're going to cry.  It's a really traumatic thing that happened.  I don't want people to see me as a victim.  I want to seem like a powerful, extraordinary actor.  You can be both.  But what if people make fun of me  memes, GIFs?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or is it JIFs?  Well, not everybody's gonna like you.  Which is a lesson I've been learning.  Well, that's not too helpful to me,  because I'm trying to build a social media dynasty.  Well, personally, I don't think anybody's gonna make fun of you  if you're honest and vulnerable, and that's all you can do.  What if I can't get through it?  You want to practice with me?  No. You have to go to your engagement party.  This is more important.  Now what happened?  (sniffles)  I thought I was going to die, Jane.  Oh, Dad.  Oh.  Yes. Say good-bye.  - Good night. -   She's still with her dad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's move on, shall we?  I could use a breather from all this tension.  So much for taking a breather.  Don't bother. No service.  - Come on. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You really shouldn't go, Rafael.  - You heard what Michael said. Not alone! - You coming?  And with Michael's words ringing in his ears,  Rafael refused to get on the boat!  Let's go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ugh. Well, it was worth a try.  Tonight, we're here with international telenovela star  Rogelio de la Vega, and the story you're about to hear,  well, it's straight out of a telenovela, honestly.  I know. It-it really is.  But then again, you know,  sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll say.  - DEREK: Be up in a second. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall,  we left Rafael on a boat alone with his brother.  No problem.  (creaking, thud)  Did you think it was a gun?  No.    So  where were you?  Right here  on this boat.  In the middle of the ocean.  I heard about my mom  our mom.  They were seizing assets.  I freaked out.  I didn't know what to do.  They were taking everything.  Okay. And?  And I sat out here, man.  Thought about things.  My dad, for instance.  Ran half marathons twice a year,  died of a heart attack out of the blue.  Did she kill him?  Things like that.  Thought about taking the plunge myself, briefly.  'Cause I suddenly had no family.  But then I punked out  and headed back to good old Miami.  But you do, though.  Have family.  So, you gonna pour that Scotch, or what?  Yeah.  JANE: Hi.  Hi! Hi! Oh, I love you.  I'm so sorry. Thank you for coming.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  - Michael, hi. - Hi.  I'm sorry I'm late.  - Oh. - Me, too.  (laughs)  I'll go inside. I'll give you guys some privacy. I'll just  How are your parents?  My mom is not as mad as when she found out  my dad slept with his dental hygienist.  But it's a point of reference?  It's definitely a point of reference.  Oh. Okay.  - I'm going in. - Okay.  Michael, Patricia, hi.  I am so sorry I missed the party.  - My dad had an emergency. - We heard.  The point is, you missed it.  After you made a real big deal  about how important it was to Michael.  MICHAEL SR.: And once again,  someone else comes in first.  I told you both not to say anything.  Michael, it's fine. It's fine.  I know, but my dad really needed me tonight.  Okay. Forget it.  I'm sorry you don't like me, but you know what?  Your son understands why I wasn't here,  so I'm cool.  And I really hope that you'll learn to live with me,  because I'm not going anywhere.  If we do attend the wedding,  it'll be for his sake, not yours.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted  that the people-pleasing side of Jane wanted to attempt  one last ditch charm offensive, but instead, she said  Noted.  You know, I'm turning over a new leaf.  Who cares if people like me?  Cheers to that!  - Yeah. - Mm-hmm.  That's what I'm talking about. 100% over it.  My new motto  take me or leave me.  - (phone chimes) - Mm.  (gasps) Oh, my God, oh, my God, my advisor.  She just e-mailed me, ""Heads up.""    ""I liked your material.""  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  She liked my material!  Yeah. Get it. Work, work.  - But you don't care? - Mom, baby steps.  - (phone chimes, Jane gasps) - Oh.  What?    Oh, yeah, well, you know what?  I'll take it. Yeah. Uh.  (phone buzzing)  Oh, be right back. It's Rafael.  He was meeting his brother. Sorry.  Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.  I don't think he knew.  Wait. What are you talking about?  You can't know that already.  Well, I do.  What?! Stop.  You are being played.  And you are entitled to your own opinion,  but this this is my family.  So investigate all you want, man.  I'm done.  Thanks, man.  Well, I meant it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.  I don't know if I like this.  I got to run.  This, on the other hand, I'm all for.  - Hi. - Hi.  Where are Wilma and Helga?  I let them go,  just for a night.  I thought it would be good to have a bonding night.  Just us.  As a family.  And you don't have to change a single diaper.  Come here.  Come here.  Here, hold Elsa.  You want to go to your mommy.  Come here.  That.  How can you even tell which is which?  Had Helga put an ""X"" on her foot.  (baby cooing)  I've been having a little trouble.  I'm not sure this is for me.  It is.  I just think part of the problem is  that you've been avoiding them.  (baby crying)  Uh-oh. Someone's got to get a diaper changed.                          LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, there's really no way to sugarcoat it.            Ah.          Ah.          Oh.      - (violin plays) - Ah.                (tango music plays)  Michael left?  Yeah, he has an early morning.  Where's Abuela?  - Still out with Pablo. - Ooh! Nice.  (creaking)  Hey, did you hear that?  (tango music playing)  - (creaking) - Wait. I hear it now.  Is that what they mean when they say  that a house is settling or whatever?    - Maybe it's the air conditioning? - (rattling)    Oh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  Maybe there is something to this curse business after all."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's do this by now you know  Jane and Michael got engaged.  - Will you marry me? Marry me. - Yes!  Leaving Rafael heartbroken.  Also heartbroken? Rogelio.  See, he and Xo had reached an impasse.  I don't want to have any more kids.  Also at an impasse? Petra.  See, she gave birth to twin girls.  - Elsa and Anna. - Like in Frozen?  No one except for you would think of that.  But alas, she was having a hard time adjusting  to new motherhood. In her defense,  she didn't have the greatest role model.  Oh, and speaking of tricky family members,  Rafael's half brother Derek was back in town.  And the question of the hour   Was he working with their mother,  the notorious crime lord known as Mutter?  Michael certainly thought so.  But Rafael, apparently not as much.  RAFAEL: I think Derek's telling the truth.  Oh, and speaking of danger,  remember Alba's first love?  Yo soy Pablo Alonso Segura.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, Alba swore he was cursed!  And yet   And then this happened   I know OMG, right?  Things are getting seriously biblical up in here!  So let's get started.  In the beginning,  there was Alba and Mateo in Miami.  And at first, the house was charmless and empty.  And Alba said       So Mateo built her a porch swing.  And it was so.  And there was morning.  And there was evening.  And God blessed them and said to them,  ""Be fruitful and multiply.""  And Alba begat Xiomara.  And Xiomara begat Jane.  Who begat Mateo II.  And it was good.  And then came the flood.  (thunder rolls)  Sorry, not that kind of flood.  But remember this?  (screams)    And thus, they would have to rebuild.  And so Alba, like Noah before her, said       Ma, just because Rafael was  generous enough to let us stay here  Ah.  Does not mean we should take advantage.    It was too overcast to go to the beach.  ALBA: Hey.  I thought we were meeting you  at the house with the contractors.  Michael's neighbors complained about Mateo.  Seriously, who complains about Mateo?!    - Can you blame him? - He's been displaced!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes,  the Great Villanueva diaspora.  Anyway, Michael's lease is up soon.  We were gonna look for a new place after the wedding.  It's just really bad timing.  Or really bad luck.    Oh, Pablo, didn't know you were here.  You remember Pablo Alonso Segura, right?  Alba swore he was cursed.  Jane and Xo didn't believe.    You'll notice the tables have turned.  In Alba's defense, a more scientific explanation  of events had emerged.  Long before Pablo arrived,  a pipe at the house got clogged,  which begat a leak, which begat water damage  to a circuit breaker, which begat the power outage  when Pablo arrived.  After the water continued to fill up the attic,  until it could no longer bear the weight of it,  which begat the ceiling crashing open  which begat the great flood!  And while that does make sense, well,  it's the third doorknob this week, people!  Okay, let's hustle.  We don't want to be late for the contractor.  Hopefully, she can get us back in the house very soon.  Yeah, you're not moving back in any time soon.  So, it's as bad as it looks?  It's actually worse than it looks.  Infested with mold.  Oh.  Do you think I'll still be able  to get married here in six weeks?  (laughing): That's cute.  Oh, you're being serious?  Yeah, there's no way that's happening.     JANE: Okay, I think I have everything I need.  You guys ready?  XIOMARA: Coming.    XIOMARA: What's that?  The first Bible Abuela bought me.  I was looking for it when Mateo was born.  It's in perfect shape!    ROGELIO: I am your savior.  -  - See, Jane, every time God closes a door,  he opens up  the opportunity  for a much bigger wedding venue!  Ah, we have to make decisions.  I've been texting with Lauren Conrad,  and she says we are way behind in our planning calendar.  Dad, this  all looks so excessive  a-and so expensive.  People are loving Tiago and my profile's  never been higher, thanks to my kidnapping.  So I'm sparing no expense.  And that is so generous, but still,  I just want, like, a small wedding.  But we no longer have to adhere  to the size restrictions of the house.  - 75 people, Dad. - Don't remind me.  I don't know how I'm going to squeeze  - my list to 75. - What?  What do I tell the president of Mexico or Charo?  - Oh. - Oprah?  I mean, even if I could get a hundred  Dad!  The wedding is 75 people total.  What?  That's not a wedding.  That's a game night.  - You get 15 people. - 15 people?  Oh, great, my daughter's getting married on the same day  - I lose all my friends! - Dad!  - I can't reduce to 15 people. - You'll figure it out.  We can go over the list together.  DEREK: We've gone over it already.  Yeah, but just to clarify, 'cause I'm still  having trouble connecting a few dots.  So you find out your mom died, you decide to  hike the Appalachian Trail.  So you drove alone to Georgia.  What are you clarifying?  You seem to have all the details.  Yeah, but I feel like you're leaving some out,  pertaining to your mother.    See, I think you know where she is.  What the hell?  You're questioning my brother  without his lawyer present?  This is an informal thing.  His lawyer is in New York.  Informal, right. Come on.  Get up. We're leaving.  No, sit down. You're not leaving.  Let me speak to you outside.  - What the hell are you doing?! - What the hell are you doing?!  I'm trying to conduct an investigation!  And my brother was not involved with our mother!  - I'm getting him local counsel. - From now on,  you do not question him without his attorney present.  (Mateo crying)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, I can kind of see  why Michael's neighbors complained.  I think he's teething.  Oh, I'm gonna try walking him.  Okay.  - Hi. Bye. - Hi.  Bye. Bye.  (crying continues)  Hmm.  Okay, okay.  (shushes)  (shushing)  (crying)  Oh! (shushes)  Sorry.  Oh.  - (Mateo stops crying) - (gasps)  (whispers): Finally.  The twins keeping you up?  Hmm?  Oh, the babies?  No, no, no. They're-they're,  they're good sleepers.  - Oh. - Yeah.  Uh, how does your family  like living here?  It's too bad the sun's been hiding out.  My grandma's never leaving.  (chuckles)  And Michael and I are gonna go  look at a place tomorrow.  Yeah, there's like a  I didn't realize there were so many charming houses  in my price range Petra, are you okay?  Yeah, good.  Tired. (chuckles)  Good luck with the, uh,  charming houses.  Thanks.  Hmm.  Okay, so clearly ""charming"" is code for ""small and old.""  Mm-hmm.    Take your time. Look around.  A house has to speak to you.  Come on.  Pretty depressing. We can't live here.  Well, a coat of paint,  some plants.  It's got nothing on our list.            Yeah, that list is not happening.  Not on your budget.  Yeah, got to be honest.  I'm falling apart here, Jane.  I've got asbestos in my bones,  creaks in my floorboards,  and a dirty-ash chimney.  You know what, yeah, this isn't really speaking to us.  Okay, let me show you something  that might be interesting.  Oh! Two bedroom, two bath,  actually within your price range.  Oh. What's the catch?  It's in West Miramar,  about, uh, 30 minutes away.  I don't know.  Our lives are here.  Well, people commute.  You know, let's just go look at it.  It's a real house with a yard.  PHARAOH STATUE: Go, Jane, go!  Get out of here while you still can.  (coughing)  -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted  that with every fiber of her being,  Jane really wanted to hate this house.  And it should be noted, with every fiber of her body,  she did not.          The drive didn't even feel that far.  - It really didn't, right? - And with podcasts?  I actually like driving. I think it's relaxing.  - Yeah. - Yeah.  (speaks indistinctly)  Whoa, slow down.  Look, let's not beat around the bush.  I'm kind of perfect, right?  My dishwasher, the swooshy yard.  And did you meet the Diaz-Goldbergs next door?  They've got a daughter on the honor roll  who babysits.  But can you really move  Mateo 39 minutes away?  I mean,  I hate to be all doomsday prophecy,  but your baby daddy's never gonna go for it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And as much as Jane hated to admit it,  she knew the snarky wallpaper made a good point.  JANE: And West Miramar's only 30 minutes away.  - It's 45 minutes away. - 39.  With no traffic.  That's over an hour  for every pickup and drop-off.  And what if something big happens?  Like he takes his first step?  It's not like I can just pop over.  I know.  And trust me,  I wish it was closer.  But it has a yard  for Mateo, you know?  And-and we can't afford that kind of house in Miami.  Yeah, but I can.  Find a house like it,  near here,  and I'll pay the difference.  Before you say no, just  will you think about it?  Like, really think about it?  We can't take your money.  Why not?  Everything's about compromise.  And it's what's best for Mateo.  He'd grow up in a nice place near his dad  Look, just talk about it with Michael  and-and at least consider it.  Yeah, okay.  We'll consider it.  Okay, good-bye, Mr. Sweetface.  (kisses) Mommy loves you, yes.  I'll see you tomorrow.  So Petra's back full-time?  Yeah.  And is she okay?  Because I saw her last night, and she seemed off.  She's definitely overwhelmed.  - Yeah. - It kind of seems like  she's afraid of them.  Maybe I'll check on her.  Just mom  to mom,  I wanted to see how you were doing.  Because Rafael and I are a little concerned.  And yes, we talked about it  and I know you don't like to be handled.  I don't really know what I'm doing  with them.  That is totally normal.  It is!  Have you ever been to one of  those new moms groups?  - Oh, please. - Seriously.  I-I went when I was feeling overwhelmed, and it helped.  Because then you see  that everyone's going through the same thing.  Well, even if I wanted to,  I can't go out with two babies; it's such an ordeal.  Petra  - Fine. Will you take me? - Yes.  - MICHAEL: Whoa. - Hi.  What are all those doing here?  Trying to make the place homier for Mateo.  Aw.  You know, I never thought I'd say this,  but I'm actually getting  kind of sick of shrimp cocktail.    Okay, so, I just got off the phone with the Realtor.  Turns out there are other people making a play for the house.  So they want us to write  some kind of a letter  explaining why we are the perfect tenants.  Yeah, about that  Rafael already said no?  He just thinks it's too far.  Oh  - He did offer - What?  - I already said no. - To what?  Well, to pay the difference for a comparable place here.  - No. We are not accepting his money. - Calm down.  I said no. I knew you'd never go for it.  - Would you? - No. (scoffs)  I think.  I don't know. Maybe.  I mean, it would be better  for Mateo to be close to his father.  I'm sorry, I just don't feel comfortable with that.  I know. I get it.  I mean, there's always strings attached with money.  Like, look at your dad and the wedding.  He thinks because he's paying for it  he can invite whoever he wants.  - What? Did he call you? - (doorbell rings)  Ma, your room service!  Texted. Three times.  He's desperate for some wiggle room  with his guest list, and by that I mean  he wants to invite the actual Wiggles.  - Oh - Apparently, they're very dear friends.  He also wants to know if Charo performs,  does that count as entertainment  or as one of his guests?  - Charo is performing? - No.  I can't believe he went to you after I said no.  You just need to tell him to back the hell off.  I would, but he needs his space from me, so  JANE: Okay.  New rule: if we haven't met them,  they can't come. Period.  Oh !  They gave me extra chipotle mayo.  What?  I love it here.      What if we made a schedule  and presented it to Rafael?  I'll be driving into Miami  every weekday for work  And I'll be coming into Miami  three days a week for school  and twice for shifts at the Marbella.  You know? So between me, Michael and my mom,  you'll barely have to spend any time in the car.  Before you say no,  will you at least consider it?  Like you guys considered the money?  Come on.  We did.  You can understand us not taking it.  Look, I know it's not ideal,  but I-it's only a year lease.  If it doesn't work, we won't renew.  You're the one who said we all have to make compromises,  and a year is not that long.      (laughs)    Mmm.    No.                      Abuela?      (giggles)  Abuela, that's  Hilarious.  You're joking, right?    Abuela, what Mom is trying to say  is that you guys have only known each other for a week.    So date. Yeah?  What's the rush?      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that years  of reading each other's body language  allowed Jane to correctly interpret this as,  ""It still seems pretty crazy to me.""  And Xo correctly translated this as,  ""I know, but what can we do? She's happy.""  Abuela, if that's what you want, we are happy for you.  - Ay - Yeah.  Ah  I can't believe you're both getting married!  I really gotta step up my game!  - Ah! - (laughter)  Which brings us here, now.  Any silly games?  Nope. No games.  Cheesy songs?  Maybe one cheesy song.  But it's not about rainbows and friendship and gross stuff.  And you do not have to sing.  And my name is Petra   MOMS:  Hi, Petra, hi, Petra   I'm mommy to Elsa and Anna   Oh, like in Frozen?  No, not like that at all.  Hi, Elsa, hi, Anna   And my name is Ja-ane   MOMS:  Hi, Jane, hi, Jane   I'm mommy to Mateo   Who's not here but I am   Because my   Oh, um, sorry.  Because, uh, when he was a newborn,  this group was really helpful.  Uh just in terms of not making me  feel so alone and overwhelmed.  And my (clears throat)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What is the right word here?  Friend  Slash son's sisters' baby mama   Petra is going through it,  times two.  WOMAN: You're in the right place.  We're all feeling alone  and overwhelmed here.  WOMAN 2: This is my second kid.  I thought I was prepared.  No.  That newborn bubble, it is intense.  - And the hormones. - (baby fussing)  There are days when I wonder why I did it.  Are there any days you don't wonder?  (laughter)  (knocking at door)  Oh, hi.  Good morning.  Is, uh, Jane here?  I wanted her to join my dear friend and I  for breakfast downstairs.  Hi.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Cuchi, cuchi!  Is that who I think it is?            Uh  Jane isn't here.  She went to a new mommy class with Petra.  Oh, dear.  Rogelio, we can meet her at class.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're we can discuss.  Thank you, Xiomara.  Actually,  do you have a minute to chat?  - Alone? - Mmm  I keep no secrets from Charo.  Okay  I know you and Jane haven't exactly been seeing eye to eye  with all this wedding stuff  Lauren says  that spirited disagreement  is part of the fun of planning a wedding.  Who is Lauren?  L.C.  Okay.  Look, I just want you to know  that I'm here, in case you need help navigating.  Stop, Xiomara. I think I made it very clear.  I need space from you.  But but this is about Jane and the wedding.  And we're still a family, first and foremost.  Yes, we are.  But my heart is also still broken.  And repeating that over  and over is getting a little  embarrassing.  Come, Charo.  PETRA: And I feel   at a loss, I guess.  I mean,  I-I, I look at them  and I know they're my daughters,  but I-I just  can't connect with them.  I don't know, I just feel like  m-maybe they would be better off with  someone else taking care of them.  JANE: You know that's not true, right?  You're their mom.  Petra  I'm fine.  (laughing): I'm fine.  I'm just overwhelmed, like everybody else here is.  WOMAN: Petra, I'm gonna jump in here.  It definitely sounds like  you're veering into postpartum territory.  - What? No. No. - How's your sleep?  Fine.  I saw you walking the halls in the middle of the night  What is this, some kind of intervention?  You told me to come here to talk about how I was feeling.  And now I'm hearing you  and I'm a little concerned.  I'm fine.  Excuse me,  - I-I need to use the restroom. - Oh.  I got her.  Wow.    So  you never came back.  The way everyone was judging me there?  We were concerned.  Look, early motherhood is hard  and I don't think that I would've  been able to get through it without these  great moments with Mateo.  And I just don't think you're having great moments.    Look, Pippa's mom had postpartum  with baby number one.  Here's the number to the doctor that she saw.  And FYI,  I hear that the doctor is very exclusive and very expensive.  Yeah, and I don't even think they take insurance.  Just tell me that you'll think about it.  I'll think about it.      (sighs)    PETRA: What's wrong?  You-you look upset.  Everything okay with the hotel?  No, I  You're with the twins.  Well, it's not like they can fend for themselves.  Is this about our booking shortfall this month?  RAFAEL: No. No, no.  I was just writing an e-mail to Jane.  Her and Michael found a house they can afford,  but it's 40 minutes away, and I  I just don't want Mateo that far.  - You freaking kidding me? - Excuse me?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when it happened.  After everything Jane's done,  starting with having Mateo in the first place  after your sister knocked her up,  and you can't tolerate a small commute  to let her live in her dream house?  Get over yourself, Rafael, and find a way to make it work.  And so, just as Jesus rose Lazarus from the dead,  Petra Solano went to the mat for Jane Villanueva  on this day in the Year of our Lord 2016.      DIRECTOR: And action!              -  -     And cut! Good.  It was so nice of you to come here on your day off.  You needed to think of my character.  I want you to give a great performance.  I also wonder, after work,  you want to run lines?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, sounds like ""running lines"" means having sex.  And then maybe we can have sex.  Oh, I guess it just meant run lines.  Uh, I'm sorry, Adriana.  I don't think it's the right time for me.  Now, if you'll excuse me.  Jane!  (Rogelio laughs)  - Thank you for coming, Jane. - Oh, of course.  You were amazing, and I loved that w  No need to shower me with praise.  Come, there are some people I want you to meet.  It should be noted that Rogelio failing to bask in her praise  was Jane's first clue that something weird was going on.  Jane, I want you to meet all my friends at video village.  Jane's second clue that something weird was going on?    And, my dear, dear friend, Charo.  Aah!  Jane, you are so cute.  Oh, thank you so much, Charo.  You're spectacular.  - Charo. - I know.  ROGELIO: And this is Lewis and Andres.  Have you guys seen Kathie Lee and Hoda?  Hi, everyone. If you could just excuse me for one minute.  - Yeah, but - No.  Are you seriously trying to find a loophole in our guest rule?  (scoffing): Of course not.  - Dad. - Perhaps.  I just thought  that once you met them,  you will bend your insane 15-person rule.  - It's not happening. - Why? I'm the one paying for it.  Excuse me?  Uh, I just mean that it's not  about the money for me.  It's not about money for me either.  It's about who I want there.  Which is why Michael and I will pay for it.  What?! Yeah, it's just easier that way, Dad.  But Jane  Uh, so what do you want me to do with all this extra cake?  Let the crew eat it or ?  Put it in the freezer.  I'll take it home and eat it on my cheat days.    JANE: It's too complicated with Dad, you know?  Too many strings.  This way is better.  All I need to do is find a new venue that's super cheap  and available in a month and a half.    Really?    Great. Have a double wedding.  Ma, stop.  Do you really want to get married  where the church ladies play bingo?  All that matters is that I'm marrying the man that I love  surrounded by the people that I love.  I'll go look at the church  after Michael and I sign the lease.  Oh, I need to go.  Good luck.  Mwah.  Adios.  Mwah. Adios.    The house isn't too far, right?            MAN: Ready to make this official?  Two copies, read 'em over.  There you go, buddy.  It's all standard stuff, babe.  I'm yours for the taking.  -  - (thunder rumbles)  WALLPAPER BIRD: Come on, that's not real; you're just imagining it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Says the talking wallpaper.  - Jane, look. - (gasps)    Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Mateo, you're cruising!  - This is, like, uh, a milestone, right? - REALTOR: I'm filming.  What a sign, right? In the new house.  And it did feel like a sign to Jane,  but a very different one.    What's wrong?  (sighs) Um  We can't live here.  What? I'm sorry.  It's okay for me to be away from my parents,  because I am an adult, but Mateo isn't  and he should be close to his father.  WALLPAPER BIRD: Uh, lady, what?  Need I remind you of my built-in dishwasher  and the fact that there are jets in the master bath?  I don't care about the dishwasher and the jets  - in the bath, okay? - I'm not gonna change my mind!  Whoa, whoa. Why are you yelling at me? I get it.  - You do? - Yes.  I do.  So we'll keep looking.  It doesn't matter where we live,  'cause wherever you are is home to me.    WALLPAPER BIRD: Yeah, good luck finding direct sunlight  and wood floors, you cheeseballs.  WOMAN (over phone): And do you ever have thoughts of running away?  Yes.  Yes, I have.  It's okay. That's okay.  And does postpartum depression run in your family?  Did your mother suffer from it?  I don't know.  We're not exactly close.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's one way to put it.  Well, if you can, ask her before you come in.  The more we know, the better we can help you.  What do you mean you're taking off? Where are you going?  New York for a little while.  I got some friends who'll let me crash.  Why not just stay here?  In Miami?  (chuckles softly)  There's nothing for me here.  Just a bunch of people judging me because of who my mom is.  Same with me.  Stay.  I'll get you a job here.  Let's hope this story turns out to be  more Prodigal Son than Cain and Abel.  DEREK (over speaker): Why would you do that?  RAFAEL: Like I said, we're family.  Oh, dear! Michael's spying on Rafael!  This could be bad.  It wasn't that bad.  There was a pigeon inside.  There's exactly one half-functioning toilet  for the entire rec room.  Okay, some nice lighting, music, scented candles  There are no windows.  Hotel living has really spoiled you.  Maybe.  But why would you want to have your wedding there  when you could have it somewhere much nicer?  I tried, but Dad won't listen to what I want.  Yeah, okay. What's so bad about what he wants?  I just want to keep the wedding small.  It's a religious sacrament.  Agreed. Keep the cereceny small.  You think Charo wants to sit in church?  But why not have a big party after?  What's the big deal?  You used to dream of a big wedding?  I don't know, it's just  - not where I'm at now. - Well,  it's not really all about you, is it?  My wedding? It kind of is.  Nah. It's also about your family.  We get to show you off. Plus, your dad didn't get  to throw you a communion party or your quinceaÃ±era.  And he's proud of you.  Ugh, you might be right.  I'll think about it.  Oh. Wrong floor.  Must have pushed it by mistake.  And that's when she saw him.  Now, was it Pablo's coat of many colors  that caught her eye?  Who knows? In any case, Jane turned around to look.  And unlike Lot's wife, she didn't  turn into a pillar of salt.  But if she could have turned Pablo into one, believe me,  Jane would have, or maybe she'd smite him instead.  Yes, smiting! Let's go with that.    I'm so sorry, Abuela.  (sighs)    Hey.  You can't blame yourself  because he turned out to be a jerk.  You got swept up in the romance.      - What?! - Uh    Oh, my God. Welcome to my world.  (laughing)  You know what? This was good.  So he wasn't the guy.  Mm. You should be dating.  Ooh, I agree.    Mm-hmm.  So what are you gonna do about Pablo?      -  - (thunder crashing)  -  - (thunderbolts zapping)              (grunts)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And thusly was he cast out.    Look. A rainbow.  Oh.  MAGDA: What do I care about a rainbow?  My own daughter put me in jail.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Here's Magda,  back in her old, familiar stomping grounds.    Because you killed a man, Mother.  In self-defense.  Well, with one crucial difference.    Look, I didn't come here to fight with you.  I came because  I had the twins.  You're a grandmother.  Whoop-de-do.  (inhales slowly)  (exhales)  And to be honest,  I've been struggling.  A little.  And the doctor asked for my family history,  so I-I was wondering  if, um, well, after you had me,  did you ever feel  depressed?  Depressed?  I had baby girl.  In Czechoslovakia.  In 1985.  Of course I was depressed.  You were depressed.  The neighbor who delivered you  was depressed.  We were all depressed.  Plus, I was not built to be mother.  And neither are you.  You want my honest opinion?  The best thing you could do for those girls  is to give them away.    Dad?  (sighs)  I think I was being too stubborn.  What?  I was talking to Mom,  and she basically  told me to get over myself. And she's right.  I get why you want to bring 75 of your closest friends.  So, for the ceremony, we can keep it small,  but for the party what the hell, let's go bigger.  Really? Do you still have the binder?  It's  somewhere. Here it is.  Okay. (clears throat) You pick.  Um What do you think about Versailles?  What? No, I don't want a destination wedding.  Oh, no. We'd rebuilt it.  I mean, not to scale, but  Think a little more low-key.  The Miami Zoo?  L.C. did rustic chic,  which could be fun with big farm tables.  Yeah, okay, maybe.  We could rent out a farm.  Farms are fun.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And suddenly,  Rogelio realized one person who could help him.  And it wasn't Lauren Conrad.  Oh, hi.  I-I was just waiting for my mom. I didn't know you'd be here.  I was actually looking for you. You spoke with Jane?  Oh, well, yeah, uh she was just being stubborn.  Yeah. I think she gets it from me.  I don't know, I think  part of me felt that if I stayed away,  you'd miss me enough.  It's just hard for me to accept it's over, but it is.  And I have to move on.  Because we're family, first and foremost, right?  Yes. Always.  I need your help.  I want Jane to love her wedding  and I have the perfect place to have it.  Really? I brought some frozen cake from work.  Let's have a piece and I'll tell you my idea.  Yeah, I heard everything. The bug's working great.  RAFAEL: Good.  Well, then you know he took the job. He's staying in town.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow. - MICHAEL: Yup.  As soon as you set him up with an office, we'll wire it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I guess Rafael doesn't quite  trust his brother after all.  Perfect.  You're not having second thoughts, are you?  No.  Look, I need to know what he knew about our mother.  Yeah.  Hey, um thanks for, you know,  agreeing to let us move to that house in West Miramar.  You know, even though  we're not.  No problem. Thanks for  you know, not moving there.  Anyway, um, I'm sure you'll find a place soon.  You guys just started looking.  Yeah.  (gasps) Is that Michael?  Oh, you got to see this.  What? The Realtor just sent it over.  Two bedroom, two bath, two-car garage,  less than a mile from here, in our price range.  Whoa. What's the catch?  Well, I asked the Realtor, he said no catch.  Oh. It has to be Rafael subsidizing it.  I was talking to him on the phone and he says  he was sure we'd find something.  What if it is?  - Is it? - I don't know. I mean,  I wouldn't rule it out.  But so what?  I mean, honestly,  it's good for Mateo.  Yeah, it's good for you, baby!  You know? A close house, near his dad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: good And that's when he realized  You're right.  What?  I mean, everyone's tried to compromise but me,  it's half a block away from a park.  Really?  Let's go see it.  Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it should be noted they did.  And this time they wanted to love it.  - This is a great street. - Yeah.  - You see the lemon tree? - I did.  Well, get ready Because I'm purrfect.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so they opened the door, to find  (indistinct conversations)  Where have you been? I told you to hustle right over here.  We stopped for lunch. Who are all these people?  You didn't think there'd be competition  for a house like this?  We thought that my son's father had bought it  under an assumed name because we wouldn't  - take a direct handout from him. - I'm sorry, what?  - We were wrong, so - Whatever. Look,  there are seven people on the list already.  Everyone's putting in an application,  so you'll have to write that letter  selling yourselves to the owners.  What makes you guys the perfect tenants?  LION: So, what are you standing there for, Jane?  Go home and win this house  with your magical prose.  Got it. I'm all over it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so it was on the tenth day after the flood  in the year 2016, Jane composed the letter.  So, what do you think?  You are a beautiful writer.  Oh. But  I think the owner's more interested in knowing if we're  gonna, you know, play loud music and pay our rent on time  than they are in your childhood memories.  Oh, my God, I totally disagree.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And thus, they debated  and rewrote  and reviseth until they were happy.  And then they rested. And it was good.  - Oh. - (giggles)  -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Even gooder   - or, rather, better   ROGELIO: Okay, ready?  JANE: Ready.  One, two, and  here's where you're getting married.  I don't understand.  How did you do this so fast?  I wanted you to have your dream wedding,  so I had my crew work round the clock.  And, as you can see, the reception  will spill out onto the soundstage.  You are totally crazy.  And it's totally perfect.  Thank you.  But I can't take all the credit. It was a team effort.  (phone rings)  Oh, shh, shh! Guys,  - it's the Realtor, the Realtor. - Oh!  Hello?  Hi. Yes.  Uh  (whispers): No.  We got it?  Oh!  Yes, great, thank you.  Thank you.  They loved us. They love our letter.  (laughs)  What did you write?  Just about our family.  And ours is big and messy  and unconventional and also  the most important thing to us.  (phone rings)  Do they have any idea I'm the owner?  Between the other couples  and the letter no. They have no idea.  Good.  - (guitar playing gently) - It's a good letter.  So, you're really moving.  I'm really moving.  How am I gonna live without you two?  Oh, stop.    I'm just saying, it'll be different.  Yeah, it will be.  But  it's good.  It's time.    It really is, huh?  You want to go look?  (guitar continues playing)  Hey, hey!  Jane, I am just  checking out the acoustics.  Rogelio asked me to play a song  for papa and daughter dance at the wedding.  Sounds great. Thank you, Charo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it was so.  Oh. Oh, Michael pulled the car in front.  (sighs)  Okay.  - All right. Go with Abuela. - (fussing)  - Oh, I know, I know. - (Abuela speaks Spanish)    Yeah, I hope so.  No offense.      - Ma - Huh?  It's not a real house. There's no water.  Ah, Dios mi   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:  And God said let there be light  And there was light.  Unfortunately, less than four miles away,  at the Marbella,  there was also darkness.  MAGDA: The best thing you could do for those girls  is to give them away.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And remember,  that is what triggered the exodus."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, here we go, yo!  As you know, Michael proposed to Jane  and a wedding date was set.  Did you make the reservations for the chair rentals?  I'm working on it.  Exciting, right? Not as exciting:  Xiomara and Rogelio broke up.  Oh, and the Villanuevas' house flooded!  Bright side: thanks to Rafael,  the family got to stay at the Marbella.  And speaking of Rafael, his half brother  -  - Derek is back in town.  Don't go off with him alone.  And Raf was working with Detective Michael  to see if Derek was connected to their mother   - Where were you? - Right here. On this boat.  The notorious crime lord known as ""Mutter.""  And, oh, yeah, he also just had twin girls with Petra,  and truthfully Petra's not doing so great.  NURSE: And does postpartum depression run in your family?  Do you ever have thoughts of running away?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! Mama drama, right?  So let's dive in.  As you all know, Jane Gloriana Villanueva  didn't lose control very often.  (loud dance music playing)  But when she did   Oh, when she did   (gunshot, guests screaming)    it was epic.  Ah, yes.  You'll recall Jane's 21st birthday.  The night she and Michael first met.  But what you don't know  is what happened after that kiss.  Don't get into any more trouble.  I won't.  But call me, okay?  I will.  (knocking at door)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He couldn't bring himself to leave!  It's so romantic!  So, one of your friends  is passed out on your porch.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh.  Not quite as romantic.  That's not my friend.  It's my mom.  Here, let me help you.  It's okay, I got it.  Ma! Come on, wake up.  - Huh? - Come on.  Oh, hey, Officer! (giggles)  You can put those cuffs on me any  - (Xiomara vomiting) LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: - Yeah.  That party was out of control   -  - which is why Jane is taking control  of her bachelorette party.  And after Mani-pedis,  we'll have dinner from 7:00 to 10:00.    Strictly prohibited:  strip clubs, cheesy bars, penis stuff.  Wow, this looks great.  Thank you, Lina.  Don't thank me. You wrote it.  True. Oh, which reminds me  I made a seating chart for dinner.  I just have so many different groups,  I want to make sure everyone melds. Don ""Key-sotty""?  JANE: Don Quixote.  Oh.  It's reading for this week's class.  It's a really great book.  It's about this guy who sees the world  as if it's one of his great romances and  - I'm out. - Okay.  Is this the seating chart?  Yep. All right, last chance, Abuela.  Do you want to come?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hard to argue with that.    - Or that. - Stop. Jane wants me there.  Okay, I should drop off Mateo with Rafael  before my shift starts.  And thank you both.  You know, for not pushing back  and just letting me have  the bachelorette that I want.  Of course.  It's your party.  Bye!  Bye! Bye!  (gasps)  Do you think she suspects anything?  Definitely not.    - (squeals) - Yes!  Thank you so much, ladies.  Surprise!  -  - Uh  -  - (chuckles)  -  - Oh, my God, Jane!  We're so happy to see you!  We missed you so much!  Oh, really?  - That's so sweet. - Yeah!  So maybe you can convince Rogelio  to invest in our fashion blog.  He thinks you're some kind of genius or something.  It's all about  BOTH: Seeing Double!  Wow.  Neat.  See? Jane agrees that it's an awesome idea.  It makes perfect sense for you to give whatever money  you were going to give to us for college to fund it.  ROGELIO: Jane  Please. Help.  Explain to them, in the unlikely event  ""Seeing Double"" doesn't catch on,  it's always good to have a backup plan.  Oh, y-yeah.  Well, I-I'm a big proponent of college.  Oh, there's a prospective student program  at my school today, if you want to come by.  Check out the sitch.  That is a wonderful idea!  They will be there.  If they want me  to even consider  investing in their blog.  BOTH: Fine.  Great. Well, I have to run.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Girls, you haven't congratulated Jane  on her engagement to the greatest man in the world.  Oh, my God, you're marrying Rafael?!  - That's amazing! -Oh, you're so lucky!  No.  - He's so sexy. - He's so gorgeous and rich.  - No, that's - And those abs  No, I said no!  I am not marrying Rafael.  I am marrying Michael.  - Oh. - Huh?  Oh. Okay.  He seems  loyal.  - Yes. - Yeah.  Sorry we can't make it to your wedding.  Yeah, we're just super busy that day.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll point out, they don't know when it is.  - Congrats, though. - Thanks.  It's always a treat, seeing you girls.  I'm off, Dad.  No, please. Just make sure  Michael got the invite reminder for tonight.  I never heard from him.  Maybe they didn't go through.  I'll send it to you, too.  (giggles nervously, sighs)  MICHAEL: Oh, no, he sent it to you, too.  JANE: I'm getting it.  - Hang on. - Oh, you really don't have to see it.  (maniacal laugh)  I'm sorry, but I really do.  MICHAEL: Throw your hands up in the air  and wave 'em like you just don't care  because it's my bachelor party! Woot! Woot!  Is that your voice?  He made me record it.  Michael, I'm so sorry.  Yeah.  (laughs) I can't believe  my dad's going to your bachelor party.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, me neither.  Here's what happened.  I remember it like it was a week ago.  So, are there gonna be strippers?  Do you not want there to be strippers?  No, no, it's okay.  I mean, it's your bachelor party.  Well, if you don't want there to be strippers  Okay, fine, fine, you convinced me,  no strippers at your bachelor party.  ROGELIO: You're having a bachelor party?  And I'm not invited?  No. Did you  Oh, he must not have  Did you  you didn't get the e-mail.  Man, my friends are so flaky.  (laughs)  Oh  thank God!  'Cause for a minute, I was like, ""My best brogelio""  ""doesn't want me  at his bachelor party?""  What's up, brother? Yeah.  JANE: So   what if I called my dad and told him not to go?  And you call my mom and tell her not to come?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, that's not happening.  What? A girl can dream.  It's too late. He's already taking over the planning.  Which could be good.  I mean, let's face it, if it weren't for Rogelio,  it would probably be me and my friends  eating tacos over a trash can.  Why are you so sweet?  To me, to my dad  Save it for the vows.  Printer deadline's Friday, right?  Mm-hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I should explain.  In a Catholic mass, you can't recite your own vows,  so theirs were going to be printed in the programs.  So, how's yours going?  Oh, it's great. Great, yeah.  You?  Yeah, just ironing out  the last details.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sure, if you call  19 pages of general ideas  ""ironing out the last details.""  Wait, scratch that 23 pages, actually.  Jane?  - Professor Blake, hello. - Hey.  So, last minute, but, uh,  one of the T.A.s who was supposed to speak  to prospective students just canceled.  I know you just started office hours,  but is there any way you could fill in for her?  Oh, my God.  Uh, I would love to, thank you so much!  Just remember  keep it professional.  Don't worry. Professional, got it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  And as we dive into our section on Don Quixote,  it's great seeing them connect to the material  and relate Quixote's quest  to their own youthful idealism.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup.  Youthful idealism at its best.  JANE: So, if you have any questions,  I am more than happy to answer them.  - Oh. - (knocking at door)  One second.  Hello, I'm looking for Jane Villanueva.  Yeah, I-I'm Jane Villanueva.  - Milady. - Is this a skit  for prospective students?  Allowest me to remove my armor.  - I'm sorry, who ? - Oh!  I am Don Quixote!  Ready to see what's in  - my Sancho Panza? - (students shriek)  No! Oh, wait, wait.  You know, wait, this is a mistake.  This is a mistake!  Ah! Oh! No  Ah  ah!  I'm so sorry!     Professor Blake, I assure you  I had no idea this was going to happen.  I'm having a bachelorette party later tonight,  and it seems my friends  got a bit overzealous.  I am not even a stripper person,  not that that matters. Believe me, I'm as angry as you are.  Look, I understand that the incident wasn't your fault,  but it was a public event,  pictures were taken, people were horrified.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To be fair,  parents were horrified.  Students were LOLing all over Instagram,  or whatever the kids say these days.  And I will do whatever it takes  to right the situation.  I know.  But I'm gonna have to talk to the dean.  I really don't know if you can continue as a T.A.  I'll check in end of day.  I just need the day to rest.  So if you could take the babies tonight  What's wrong?  Nothing, I just, um  started my medication.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: For postpartum depression, you'll recall.  And it's giving me a pretty bad migraine.  So can you keep the babies?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, and make sure I'm not disturbed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.  This isn't looking good.  (sighs)  Sorry.  Where were we?  Nowhere.  We got nothing so far.  What about the bug you put in Derek's office?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall these two  have been working together to discover   How shall I put this? It's rather nuanced  - Nothing. - whether Rafael's brother Derek  is a good guy  - or a bad guy. - (growls)  His boat.  There's got to be something on his boat.  Good, so search his boat.  I-I get a warrant, he knows you told me about it.  So don't get a warrant.  Oh, come on, Michael.  We both know you're not above bending the rules.  XIOMARA: So did you get a little visit  from Don Quick-Naughty?  You were in on that? What were you thinking?  Hey, strippers were not technically on your ""no"" list.  - Just strip clubs. - There's a big difference.  Yeah, well that big difference just gave me a lap dance  - in front of 50 students and parents. - What?!  I was asked to do a last-minute talk  to prospective students and  He was supposed to go to your office.  I wasn't there. He found me.  I'm sorry.  How could I have known he would turn out to be,  like, the world's most industrious stripper?  This is why I implemented  the ""no surprise"" rule in the first place.  I was clear.  No surprises.    Maybe just one more?  Surprise!  Welcome to your bachelorette party.  (squealing with excitement, giggling)  What's going on?  This is not a part of my carefully detailed  bachelorette party plan.  I know, but your mom and I decided that we owed it to you  not to throw you the world's lamest party.  We owed it to everyone.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, here we have   Well, names aren't important.  We've taken care of everything.  But Mateo is With Abuela all night in a guest room.  - And I have to work tomorrow. - Luca's covering your shift  so you can nurse what'd better be a raging hangover.  - I have to finish my vows. - I called the printers  and got them to agree to a one-day extension.  And we brought your party clothes!  XIOMARA: And we're really sorry about the stripper,  but there's nothing you can do about it tonight.  Except drink and take your mind off it. Right, girls?!  (whooping)  Come on, hon.  Wouldn't it feel good to lose control just this once?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on, Jane, are you going to let down  this group of vaguely familiar ladies  who are apparently your very good friends?  All right, bring on the shots!  (cheering)  To your last night of freedom.  (whooping)      -  - HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Whoo-hoo!  (whoops)  See, isn't this better than some boring dinner party?        Wow.  Uh, I thought you said we were just stopping by.  For five scrumptious courses prepared by my personal chef.  Now sit, sit, everyone, sit.  Open your swag bags.  They contain all the essentials for an epic bachelor party.      (quietly): What the hell's happening?  Oh.  Rogelio, you really didn't have to do this.  Of course I did.  You only get married once.  Right, guys?  -  - Huh?  I need a drink.  Perfect.  I've done the wine pairings myself.  We'll start with an ice-cold pink champagne toast.  Oh, I almost forgot.  The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.  Open it.  Oh.  Wow.  (chuckles)  (all chuckling)  Turn it around.  (whoops)  (upbeat music playing)  (whooping)  Yes!  Whoo-hoo!  Angela's amazing.  Did you know she's a genius?  She really is a genius.  Actually, my IQ is 139, so it's just below.  You see?!  Only a genius would know that.  XIOMARA: Totally.  (laughing)  (whoops)    -  - Whoo-hoo!  All right, I'm signing up for karaoke.  - Sweet Lady Jane? - No!  - Yes! - No, no, no!  Who's Sweet Lady Jane?  Xo, it's her Sasha Fierce.  When she gets drunk enough to freestyle.  You've never seen her like that?  No, I haven't.  But it is definitely happening tonight.  - We need more drinks. - Agreed! Can you go get them?  I kind of have a history with Chad the hot bartender.    I don't want it to seem like I'm chasing him.  I mean, I am chasing him, but I don't want him to know.  On it!  (whoops)  So where'd you go to college?  Oh, I didn't.  Oh, weird. Why?  It just wasn't, like, my path.  So what do you do?  I'm a waitress with Jane.  But she goes to school.  Well, I-I'm a stylist, too.  I mean, I will be once that takes off.  So you, like, pick out clothes?  XIOMARA: A shot for Sweet Lady Jane!  Uh, no, she is not coming out tonight.  She's definitely coming out tonight.

Stop. - Must've hit ""call back.""  - Message sent. - No    Okay, we need to come up with a plan.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unfortunately,  coming up with a plan is quite difficult  when you are   Well, let's check.    HIGH-PITCHED VOICE: Whoo-hoo!  Don't worry, nobody listens to their voice mail anymore.  What are you talking about?  Everybody listens to their voice mails, Ma.  - LINA: I've got an idea. - Go.  Let's ask Siri.  Any other suggestions?  Angela, go.  I think if we all think really hard,  we could delete it with our minds.  Here's what we're gonna do.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This ought to be good.  He's at a party for prospective students.  I am gonna go to that party  and I am going to steal his phone  and I'm going to erase that message.  Wait, you can't go in there.  You just had a stripper at school.  Right.  Can you go?  Way too drunk.  Angela, can you go?  Sure. Where?  I know who could go!  (gasps)  I have to pee!    -  - Get in. Hurry.  Not so fast.  Since we're doing you a favor,  we want something in return.  What?! Seriously?  We want to come to your wedding now.  Great, you're in, twins. Let's do this.  BOTH: And be bridesmaids.  What? Why?  You don't even like me.  Yeah, but we could sell the pictures to some tabloid  because of Rogelio and fund our blog.  Plus, we'll be wearing our own designs.  This is our chance to be like the Olsen twins.  But less depressing.  And without Mary-Kate's weird old French guy.  Fine, let's go!  Yes! Awesome!  (gasps)  Break out the booze!  We're doing shots!  No, no shots.  MEN: Shot! Shot! Shot!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Truth be told,  if Derek knew his boat was being searched,  he probably wouldn't feel so buoyed.  See what I did there?  But alas, he doesn't.  Dude, you don't have to keep buying us drinks all night.  Hey, brotherly bonding.  And plus, I have two sleeping babies  and two night nurses upstairs that yell at me  every time I make noise.  (chuckles)  So, did you consider asking?  - Stop, no. - Asking what?  He wants to buy into this deal I'm looking at.  I told him he should hit up his rich brother.  Brandon, enough. All right.  I just am not in a position  to make any investments right now.  No, of course not.  Let's just call it. Thanks for the drinks.  We should, uh, head back to the boat.  No, now, hey, just, uh, just stay.  Uh, it's weird. Now, now it seems  like I'm after your money or something.  No, it doesn't. It's fine, hey.  Come on, just sit down?  Sit down!  Come on, another round.  - Let me at least pay this time. - Hey, put your money away.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I don't know about you,  but I'm not on board with this make-under.  How'd you become a stylist?  You have to have good taste  so celebrities want your opinion.  Do any celebrities want yours?  (phone chimes)  LINA: Well, they will eventually.    (chuckles, sighs)                Enough with the questions!      Up to you, but I'd lose the towel.  It's not good for your pores.  Hey, you know, I'm feeling, I'm feeling okay.  Your choice. After this,  a quick plunge in the cold pool and massages.  Space is limited, so be sure to tell me  who you want as your couples massage partner,  while I grab us some cucumber water.  Okay, dude.  Dude, what the hell?  This is weird, dude.  No, no, no, wait, we left weird back at his apartment.  This is way past weird.  I know, but what am I supposed to do?  Get rid of your crazy father-in-law.  Look, obviously I don't want Rogelio here.  I don't want to hurt his feelings.  Rogelio, I'm sorry.  No-no apology necessary.  I will take my leave so you can start having fun.  Hey, Rogelio, I am so sorry. I feel terrible.  If you didn't want me at your party,  then why did you invite me?  I never meant to.  When you found about it and-and wanted to come,  I didn't want to hurt your feelings.  And then you ran with it, making this whole night.  Your friends weren't making any plans.  I wanted it to be special.  I know.  I thought you like being pampered.  Men these days.  They don't take enough time for themselves.  It's not about the SPA.  Having you here, it changes  the dynamic with my friends.  But we're friends!  #Brogelios4Life.  We are, but we're also about to be family,  and you know, that changes things.  They can't tell funny stories and have them be inappropriate  while my wife's dad is around, you know?  Yeah, I understand.  If I were a normal dad.  But I'm a cool dad.  You can be inappropriate around me, I swear.  (sighs)  Okay, we  I mean, all right.  You know that story with the Redneck Riviera?  When you ate the worm? Hilarious.  Yeah, and after that,  we went to a strip club where we met  a stripper named Jane and her twin sister,  - and she showed us - Enough, stop it!  - I'm sorry. - I get it.  I get it.  You've made your point.  I'll cancel the massages  so you can go to a bar with your friends  and talk about things I never want to hear about again.  Okay, let's get out of the pool  Wait, wait, wait, I-I mean,  I'm not really in a bar mood right now are you?  I mean, we go to bars, like, every night.  Yeah, and a two-hour massage, bro, sounds kind of cool.  Fine, yeah, yeah.  We'll, uh, we'll get the massages.  VALERIA: Relax.  We got this.  Okay, repeat the plan  back to me just to make sure.  You go.  I thought you were listening.  I listened last time.  Okay, both of you, listen!  One of you says you have a personal emergency  and you need to borrow Professor Blake's phone  because both of your phones  are dead, then  one of you stays with him  while the other one goes to make the call  and deletes the voice mail, then you return  the phone to Professor Blake and you slip out.  - One champagne. - No champagne!  Calm down, calm down, we got this. This is easy.  Yeah, it's like taking candy from a baby.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or leaving your babies.  Honestly, I don't know what's more shocking.  Petra abandoning her children  or Petra taking a bus.  (moaning)  Can't believe how much I like this.  You-you never had a massage?  No.    Well, they are  very relaxing.      So, Ro?  Is everything cool with us?  Yes, I understand what you're saying.  There should be a certain amount  of decorum between father-in-law and son-in-law.  I don't need to hear everything.  Okay, but the thing is,  you did hear about the strippers or whatever.  Does that change the way you feel about me?  What?  Of course not.  (sighs) Okay, good.  I was worried.  You were?  Of course.  What you think really matters to me.  More than anything.  I mean  (chuckles)  I'm marrying your daughter.  You're massaging my heart right now, Michael Cordero.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw!  Looks like this massage  has a happy ending after all!  -  - (both imitate small explosion)  And just for the record,  I couldn't imagine anyone better for Jane.  Oh  You are my dream man.  JANE: This is a nightmare.  Here, this will take the edge off waiting.  I can't believe this is happening!  - We got it! - Huh?  - Piece of cake! - You took it?  We figured we'd let you do the honors.  Fine, give me that.  Oh, yes, it doesn't require a code.  Sucker. Ooh!  (gasps) Found my voice mail.  - He didn't listen! - Yes!  (gasps) What is that?  - His wallet. - What?!  - (phone beeping) - What is it doing?  Oh, he has Find My Phone!  - What?! - Ditch it, quick!  - (grunts) - No!  - Now! - Aah!

Yo.

You have got to be kidding me.  Mom?  (exhales) Uh  CHAD: Wait, Lina, wait.  Jane, I'm sorry.  This is why I didn't want you at my bachelorette party.  Because I knew this would happen.  I knew you would act like a drunk sorority girl.  Wait. That's not fair.  You're right.  (crying): It's not fair!  You know why I'm such a control freak, Mom?  Because I grew up with you,  and you are so out of control!  Hey.  I am so sorry.  No.  He was clearly a jerk.  It's better I know now.  Are you okay?  I think this  and the Angela thing  It's like, you're getting married,  you have a kid,  and I'm happy for you, I am.  I know.  But it just makes me think  how everything is moving forward for you,  but I'm still sort of lost.  I don't want to be at the Marbella forever.  And you won't be.  Yeah.  (sniffs)  Do you want to make a list?  What kind of list?  Well, just like a five-point action item list.  Don't worry, it's, like, the most basic type of list.  Oh, my God,  you have different types of lists? Of course.  - (laughs) - Hey, if you want to be a stylist,  you gotta come up with a plan, right?  Okay. Let's do it.  And my mom owes you an apology, of course.  No. It's like she helped me, kind of.  Seeing that  you know? I don't know.  It's like a cautionary tale,  right?  (door opens)  Mmm    I know.  Oh  (sighs)  I messed up, Ma.  I really messed up.            No  What the hell?  Oh, we all got them. Bam!  Oh, no!  Yep.  Oh, my God  - Yeah. - (giggles)  Oh, I'm still drunk.  I know.  (giggles)  But can I say something?  I love you so much.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, I guess we're back to gushing levels.  And I'm not just gushing because I'm drunk,  I'm gushing  because  I've been having trouble with my vows.  Distilling what to say.  And tonight I realized  it's simple.  With you  You make me feel safe,  in the best way.  And my mom kept telling me to lose control,  but I couldn't until you got here.  Because I know you're watching over me.  (sobs)  Instead of me always having  to watch over everyone else.  So tonight is not  my last night of freedom,  it's my first night of freedom.  And that's what I'm going to put in my vows.  Minus the whole ""mom out of control"" part.  Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.  I've been feeling a little stuck, and I,  and I figured out why  During my massage.  (laughs)  I realized that some things  are only meant for certain people to hear.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Redneck Riviera, for example  Not a story for fathers-in-law.  And when it comes to my feelings for you  you're the only person that I want to share those with.  So I was wondering if  maybe we didn't put the vows in the program  but instead I told you them right now.  (softly): Yes.  Yes, please.    Jane  (whispers): Yeah?    Sorry, but remember, he wants these to be private.  You'll just have to take my word for it   They were perfect.      Thank you. And I am so sorry again  for waking them up when I got in last night.  (sighs)  (phone chimes)    Huh.  I-I get a warrant, he knows you told me about it.  So don't get a warrant.  Oh, come on, Michael.  We both know you're not above bending the rules.  Those days are over.  It's all got to be by the book now.  So apparently, Rafael took matters into his own hands,  and he got proof that his brother was telling the truth.  Thanks for letting me crash.  - You okay? - Yeah.  Yeah.  For the first time, he trusts you.  Sorry, I'm just  Are you hungry?  Yeah. Here, let's get some food, huh?  I'll pull up a menu.  -  - What's that e-mail?  From the bank?  - Oh, my God. - What?  Did I buy stock last night?  I don't know, man.  - It's all kind of a blur. - (chuckles): Yeah.  Oh, my God, I did.  And I just  made $5 million.  Okay. Wow.  Uh so we should probably get our stories straight, right?  What do you mean?  Well, Brandon knew they had the patent  before they announced it this morning.  You mean like  insider trading?  I'm sorry, I  I thought you knew.  That's why I didn't want you to invest.  What a mess.  And from one mess to another.  (knocking)  Hey. Pastelitos.  Ah, yes.  An old family tradition.  (knocking)  -  - Pastelitos from Isidoro's.    I'm sorry about last night.  I-I was out of control.  It's just that you're turning 21.  And you're getting married.  (crying): You're an adult now.  And what that does to me  What that does to me  well,  it makes me feel old, for one.  And it makes me realize  that my big job is done.  Being a mom,  it's the only thing  I've been really successful at.  (sobbing): And it makes me wonder  what am I doing with my life?    (crying): A-And I just realized that I  (chuckles) have to figure it out, you know?  So I will.  And I'm sorry.  It's okay, Mom.  I know it's hard.  And I'm sorry.  And maybe it was Jane's hangover  or the fact that it was the same apology  Xo had given four years before and four years before that,  but this time Jane said   I don't want your apology, Mom.  I want you to grow up.  What are you talking about? I'm plenty grown up.  We've been having the same conversation for years.  At this point, I should remind you  that Jane didn't lose control very often.  And I've had it.  Enough with all the excuses  and the apologies.  At this point  you are just a cautionary tale.  But when she did, it was epic.  (taking deep breaths)    Which brings us back to Petra.    It should be noted that Petra, too,  rarely lost control.  Oh, my God.  My long-lost sister! It's you!  (laughs): It's really you!  Oh!  Then again,  that isn't Petra.  (exhales)"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All righty, diving in  Jane and Michael were planning a wedding   - Will you marry me? - Yes!   and it was going to be at the house, but then  this happened. Luckily, Rogelio came to the rescue  and he built them a model of the house on the soundstage,  and the family moved into the Marbella.  And all was well until Jane's bachelorette party,  - when this happened. - Mom?  Jane, I'm sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, and speaking of family drama,  Rafael finally bonded with his long-lost brother.  Only problem?  After a night of drinking he acted on an insider tip.  I just made $5 million.  So, we should probably get our stories straight, right?  Brandon knew they had the patent  before they announced it this morning.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!  Bad news, right? Well, how about this?  - I'm sorry. - I don't want your apology, Mom.  At this point, you are just a cautionary tale.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! I hate that they're fighting.  Let's hope it ends soon.  You'll recall when Jane was young,  she fell in love   with salsa.  And right away, well   she was ready to go steady.  Please, please, please. Just consider it.      Because I know I love salsa. When I saw it,  it spoke to my soul.  You know what,  let's do it.  What?  It spoke to her soul.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But alas, the conversation was short.  Because while Jane loved watching salsa,  it turned out she hated dancing salsa.  Like, seriously hated it.    But I'm terrible.  Please don't make me.  Oh, come on, she's miserable.      Yeah, you're right.  Come on, we don't want to miss the warm-ups.  Don't worry, you don't have to perform.  What?  Screw principle. Let's have an adventure.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so they Thelma and Louised it out of there.  And that night solidified one thing:  Jane hated dancing salsa.  But she loved her mother.    Until everything changed.  - (salsa music playing) - (exclaims)  See, recently,  salsa became an obsession once again.  Tonight I am not just dancing for myself.  I am dancing for Cuba!  No way. That line is ridiculous.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At least for a character  in Jane's novel-in-progress.  Okay, much better.  Yeah. I would definitely say that.  With lust in my eyes.  - (door opens) - MICHAEL: You sure you want to take two cars?  And she was also  How to put this   Positive. I don't want to ride with her.  Hating her mother.  Got it.  - (door closes) - We have five minutes.  Back to me.  I was heaving passionately.  Mm.  What?      (elevator bell dings)  So, listen, I was thinking about  this fight with your mom,  and, I don't know, maybe it's time  for a cease-fire there. I know she crossed a line.  Oh, when she got trashed and made out with Lina's guy?  She did apologize.  And I always forgive her.  That's the problem.  XIOMARA: The problem is  what Jane said when I apologized.  She called me a cautionary tale.  And I meant what I said.  She's my daughter.  I'm just sick of having to act like her mother.  She can't talk to me like that.  You know, she can't behave like that.  - See you there? - Oh, uh-huh.  (both sigh)  Can you say ""mama""?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  To the Villanueva house.  Abuela.  - Abuela. - Mama.        Fine. Go ahead.  I said everything I wanted to yesterday.  And you're not gonna apologize?  Apologize? Me?  Hello, hello.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sorry, I can't remember  her last name. It's not important.  - JANE: Hello, Tammy. - Hey, Tammy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The point is, she's  - their insurance adjuster. - Okay, so  let's see where we are in terms of damages.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm no expert but I'd say the  damage is pretty substantial.  Thank you, baby.  - Please, come in. - Thank you.  Don't hold your breath waiting for me to apologize.  What I will do is have a serious discussion  - about your behavior. - Okay, wow.  Wow. Uh, here's the good news. You have insurance.  - Don't talk to me like I'm a five-year-old. - Which means you'll get   - I'm sorry. Uh, you're not a five-year-old. - a nice chunk of change   - to fix this place up. Maybe an update? - You're more like a 16-year-old.      She doesn't get a vote, she's leaving.  Just keep Mom's room the same,  because she's gonna live here forever.     XIOMARA: Bye, Tammy.    -  - Come on, Ma, I'll drive you to work.  Hello? Did you forget that you said that you'd watch Mateo?  Oh. I thought you didn't want me taking care of your child.  Since I'm so  immature and irresponsible.  Stop. You're on the schedule,  and I need to meet with my advisor.  Not my problem.  - Xiomara. - No, it's fine,  Abuela. He doesn't need to learn  how to pound shots before he can walk.  (engine starts)  Oh, okay, this is bad.  My schedule's gonna implode.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah yes, the sacred  child care schedule. What every working parent relies on.  Jane's is, of course, more elaborate than most.  - I'll watch Mateo. - Really?  Yeah, I'd love to. Are you kidding?  I told you, I used to watch my cousin's kids.  I know what I'm doing. Just send me the list.  What lists?  Don't ""what list"" me, I know there's a list  of instructions you're dying to send me.  Just e-mail them to me, I want to do this right.  The more detail the better.  You're really turning me on right now.  (grunts loudly)  (gasps)  (Jane giggles)  (phone chimes)  It's your dad again. I'm supposed to remind you  to pick out your wedding dress by Thursday  and see if you looked at something called  a Lauren Conrad wedding calendar.  - Oh - (phone chimes)        (knocking at door)  - Hello, Rogelio. - Oh, uh, hello,  dear network executives.  Please, come in.  (laughs nervously)  To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?  We're here because of  the new set you built.  The house.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  Rogelio's grand gesture.  Here's where you're getting married.  And, as you can see, the reception  will spill out onto the soundstage.  You cannot use the crew for personal reasons.  I don't know what you heard,  but I did not  use the crew  for personal reasons.  I had them build the house  for Tiago's next adventure, of course.  Tiago travels through time to epic moments in history.  This week he kills baby Hitler.  What epic event  can possibly be filmed in that house?  It's an epic idea  told in a small, slice-of-life story.  As Mark Twain said,  art is holding a mirror up to nature.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It was actually Shakespeare.  So what's the idea?  No, no.  Another famous saying: show, don't tell.  But trust me, the story will knock your socks off.  Mind-blowing telenovela twists,  but the kind that everyone can relate to.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like being stressed because you got drunk  and made $5 million in an accidental insider trade.  Totally relatable.  (knocking at door) Excuse me, Mr. Solano?  Barbara Fairwick's on line one.  Barbara?  Okay, thank you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Who's this Barbara Fairwick  that's got him so excited?  Barbara. How are you?  Really?  Find Petra. Now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Petra.  That shower. Warm water, whole time.  I feel like Ottokar the First.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oops. There she is.  In other relatable telenovela twists,  Petra's secret twin showed up and   Wait, I should show, not tell.  Here's where we left off.  Oh, my God.  My long-lost sister.  It's you. It's really you.  Oh!  Hey! I do that, too. Jumping when scared.  I need personal space. Sometimes I scratch.    And all my life, thinking I have no family.  Look, I'm sorry, I don't understand.  W Where did you live?  Orphanage.  You seeing the movie Annie?  Like that.  Only no nice Miss Hannigan for us.  And my Sandy was a rat.  You think I-I can  bother you for a little bit more food?  -  - Then I living in room with ten women  and one bring home magazine  and they saying it looks like me, only beautiful.  It was you.  (slurps)  So then  I go to government building  and I find two certificate of birth.  -  - So then I sell goat  and I have money to come here.  Well, that's  quite the story.  Oh, you  you still have some, uh, chocolate on your finger.  No, uh, hair dye.  I fix for you.  (laughs)  Roots make me look like old lady.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Prematurely gray.  It happens when you've lived a hard knock life.  Which brings us back here.  I change, then I start to clean.  - No, I get. - No, no! Wait.  Leaping lizards.  Petra, I just talked to Barbara and it's true.  - She's selling the Fairwick. - (squeaks)  PETRA: Anezka!  Why don't you go get changed?  RAFAEL: Wait  What the ?    Wow.  This is unbelievable.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And yet, somehow, just believable enough.  I guess twins really do run in your family.  Oh, my God. Thank God my postpartum medication  also helps with anxiety.  Wait, so Barbara really wants to sell the Fairwick?  Yep.  Lachlan overspent on construction, she fired him,  and now she just wants out. Which means  I can scoop it up at a fire sale, increase our beachfront.  And it's got the golf club, which is guaranteed revenue.  - You can stop floating the Marbella. - And then our views  will never be blocked.  Can you afford it?  Not sure.  But I am meeting with my money managers.  JANE: Wish me luck  - with my advisor. - MICHAEL: Luck!  And as for why you're really calling, Mateo  is fine. We're just sitting here, reading books.  - You are not. - Okay.  We're superheroes. And anticipating your next question,  he ate mashed up blueberries  - and smeared them on his onesie. - Oh, no.  - Not the one that Glamma bought. - Yeah.  But I consulted your List Number Three,  Subcategory Laundry, Item Number Four.  Used Dreft: Active Baby,  - good as new. - Amazing.  You're amazing. Thank you so much for babysitting.  Of course.  Uh, good luck with Professor Donaldson.  (groans)  Well, it still feels a little flat.  And, like, all about  romance.    -  - Well,  it-it is a romance novel.    I just wish the work incorporated  some critique of the genre.  I mean, all this march to the wedding stuff seems so outdated.  Though it-it does take place in 1962.  Yeah, but we are not living  in that time period.  - (""Wedding March"" ringtone playing) - Sorry.  Oh, um  uh, my dad must've changed my ringtone.  (clears throat)  I hear you.  It feels flat. And I will  juice it up and get you new pages  and get this novel done by deadline,  no problem.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Then why does it feel like a problem?  Hey.  - Nice suit. - Yeah.  Turns out bankers want you to look businesslike  when you ask them to loan you large sums of money.  I might be buying the Fairwick.  What? Really?  I can just scrape together enough.  It's a good investment, you know, long-term.  Well, I hope it works out.  And if you need an extra couple hundred bucks  (laughs) Thank you.  I'll head up with you. I'll say hi to Mateo.  Sure.  Michael's watching him.  (elevator bell dings)  - Michael? - Yeah. Um, my mom canceled,  - and you had a meeting. - No, I totally get it.  Just a little surprised.  He's experienced with babies?  Yeah, he actually is.  Hmm, that's that's great.  (elevator bell dings)  (gasps) Hello. Hi!  Who's that? Daddy's here.  Hi. (kissing)  - How was it? - It was great.  - We had a lot of fun. - Oh.  That's great. Hey, buddy.  Come here. Oh, come to Daddy.  I missed you.  And, friends, that's when Mateo said his first word.  Da-da!  Unfortunately, he said it to the wrong man.  ""Da"" is one of those easier sounds for a baby to make.  Like, it-it means nothing.  - Dada. - We get it, Mateo.  Enough. Stop showing off!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, here we are, with Jane.  Trying to write.  And move on from that Dada debacle.  Geez.  It should be noted that this is what Jane wanted to say   Oh, my God, Mom,  Mateo called Michael ""Dada"" in front of Rafael.  And here's what she actually said.  ROGELIO: Please,  it's a small gesture.  Why?    Fine. I admit,  I'm trying to sweet-talk you into something.  Well, I'm not an actor. I don't thrill to my own image  in quite the same way you do.  Might I suggest Kylie's Lip Kit?  Anyway, I'll cut to the chase.  I need a very special story written for Tiago.  So I thought, no, who's the smartest,  best writer I know?  What's the story?  It's about a house.  A small, modest, ordinary house.  Are you asking me to base a story on a set?  - Yes, exactly. - Rogelio, that is not how  the writing process works.  What about Titanic? Based on a boat.  Write me Titanic in a house.  Please.  My writers have produced nothing but turds  despite the many, many motivating e-mails  I have sent them.                - I want ten percent above my quote. - Done.  - An executive producer credit. - Signed, sealed, delivered.  And I have a niece who wants to act.  What does she look like?  (laughing): I'm just I'm-I'm kidding.  I'm kidding. She's hired. It's a deal.  And speaking of deals,  Rafael and Petra were also hoping to make one.  -  - Barbara, thank you so much for  -  - taking the time to meet with us.  And I just want to reiterate that our intention  is to preserve the history and integrity of the Fairwick.  I get a good feeling about you.  Oh, stop. I'm a hugger.  - Oh. (chuckles) - (chuckles)  You, too, sweetie.  - Oh. Mmm - Oh  I will be in touch.  (sighs)  - (whispering): You were great. - You were great.  Almost makes up for the whole ""Dada"" thing.  Well, this Dada just secured his children's legacy.  - MATEO (babbling): Dada. - All right, Mateo.  Shh. Nap time.  - (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:Ah, finally.  Time to make some progress on that rewrite.  SALSA SOPHIA (laughing): Oh, thank God.  I knew our fight was a misunderstanding.  A few ballistic missiles can't keep us apart.  Please, Jane, I know that Robert will propose soon.  Friends, Jane was in the zone.  Riding the wave. In the flow.  And our bodies are so close I can feel his heart beat.  (knocking on door)  And just then there was a knock at the door.  What?  Hey.  Oh, my God, I lost track of time. Is it 1:00?  - Sure is. - Okay.  Good. Uh, he's napping,  - so I'll just go wake him. - Uh, wait, real quick.  I just need to talk to you about something.  Mm-hmm?  I want more time with Mateo.  Three days a week instead of two.  Uh, is this because of the whole ""Dada"" thing?  Because he's been calling me ""Dada"" all morning.  It just brought up the fact  that I want to be the man most present in Mateo's life,  and I think I should be.  Yeah. Yeah, I get that.  Um, you're his father.  And speaking of a present father.  Jane, surprise.  Welcome to wedding central.  Also known as Jane's office at school.  Dad, what is going on?  If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad will  take seven different tiaras to the mountain.  - You look beautiful. - DINA: Huh.  DINA: Maybe we could do a religious conversion story for Tiago.  No, no, no, no, no, no, God is not sexy.  Listen, we have fallen behind LC's wedding pre-checklist.  We have to make some decision.  Here. What do you think?  Dad, this is not a great time. I have a meeting in ten minutes.  That's all I need.  Jane, could you please look at all this wedding stuff  so I can get him to concentrate on our script?  Fine. Go, Dad. What's on your checklist?  First, please tell me you and your mom went back  to the dress shop.  Well?    I love it so much.  Mom, you said that about all three of them.  WOMAN: Take your time.  Take some pictures.  Sleep on it.  No, not yet.  Everyone knows that alterations take at least a month.  - Okay, I'll go this week. - Jane.  Why are you and your mom fighting?  MARLENE: Nice tiara.  Welcome to wedding central!  Uh, Dad, this is my advisor.  Great. Please advise Jane on some wedding decisions.  She has less than six weeks.  No, Dad, Marlene's not really a wedding person.  Oh, I see.  Don't worry.  There's still a chance for you.  Many people marry later in life.  Don't lose hope.  I just wanted to apologize again for my dad.  - He did not mean to offend you. - I'm not offended.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You seem offended.  Frankly, your assumption that I would be offended is offensive.  I don't want to get married, Jane.  So, please, don't put me in your suffocating marriage plot.    Got it.  Sorry.  My whole life is not built around that goal.  And neither is mine.  Did I say it was?  - I mean, yeah, basically. - No.  So about the chapter that I sent you.  (sighs)  Well, it made me sad.  But at least now I have some context  I'm sorry. Can I ask you?  Is your problem with me or my writing?  Both, frankly.  Well, ""frankly,"" I'm not too thrilled with you either.  But you know what, lucky for both of us,  it's almost the end of the year, so we really don't have  to put up with each other that much longer.  And speaking of longer-term problems   So you found each other.  That's all you're going to say, Mother?  We need an explanation.  Explanation?  I was pregnant, all alone, behind Iron Curtain.  I could not afford one child, let alone two.  So I pick pretty one.  Plus you always were shaking.  I-I have medical condition.      Just when I think you can't sink any lower, Mother,  you always find another way down.  I have regrets, like I said  Wrong choice.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember,  I did say those words would come back to haunt Petra.  Now I see you are the much prettier one.  My other daughter is an ungrateful bitch.  (scoffs)  No. You don't dare talk about her.  She's wonderful, kind, American success story.  Yeah, right. Let me give you some motherly advice, dear.  Don't expect anything from her.  Trust me, she's plotting to get rid of you already.  Because she only cares about herself.  But, see, you're wrong, Mother.  I re about Anezka, which is why she'll be staying in Miami.  With me.  And you'll be staying in prison.  Alone.  Come on, Anezka.  Yes.  Thanking you, beautiful sister. Thanking you.    Better than the first one?          Okay.  - Boobies aside, though - WOMAN: You're back!  Where's your mother?  She's not here.  I'm deciding without her.  Oh.  Okay. (laughs)  So is this the one?  I'm still not sure. (laughs) Yeah, I-I think I just need  one more night to think about it.  - I don't think. I know. - Ma'am,  this woman says you stole her wallet.  - Excuse me? - You were following me  around the pool, next thing, my wallet's gone.  And I never forget a face!  - Did you steal a wallet? - No. I stole three wallets.  Anezka! How could you do that?  Was easy. I was pickpocket in Czech Republic.  This is my hotel.  I only wanting to buy for you present  - for thank you. - No, no presents, okay?  No presents, and  no stealing, you understand?  Yes. Yes.  J.J.: Nope.  Don't like it at all.  -  - Well, thanks for not mincing your words.  -  - It's just not you.  For your wedding, you have to look like you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She sounds pretty sure of herself  for someone who's known Jane for all of seven months.  - I'm telling you, the first one. - Yeah, maybe.  Oh, hey, did you get your letter about next year?  - I got mine this morning. - Letter?  The notification you're gonna be invited back  - to the grad program? - Wait.  I thought that was just, like, formality.  Yeah.  I just mean that I got the actual physical letter.  - Oh. - I'm sure yours is coming.  Yeah. Yeah, totally.  Wait. So, who decides that?  - Like, the dean, or ? - Not the dean.  - Don't say it! - Your advisor.  Oh, no! No, no, no, no!  So, again, thanks for seeing me on such short notice.  Anyway, I was talking to a friend of mine  who got a letter about enrolling in the program next year,  and I haven't gotten mine yet,  so I just wanted to check in, make sure there was no problem.  No problem. I just haven't made my decision yet.  Oh. Okay.  You know I wonder  if, well, because of our differences  well, that you can't  be objective about me.  You mean because you verbally assaulted me?  - I wouldn't call it that. - Regardless,  I can assure you I can remain objective.  I can separate you,  Jane, the person  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whom she hates.  From your work.  Which she also hates.  Well what a relief.  If I like your next rewrite, you'll get that letter.  Which brings us here.  (gasps) No! What have you done?!  I'm sorry, but I can't get kicked out of school,  and that means giving Marlene a revision  - she doesn't hate! - So you're tearing me away from Robert?  How can I change my feelings now that you've made me  fall so deeply in love with him?!  I don't know. I just know that it has to be less about  romantic love and-and more about  something I haven't figured out yet.  - I don't get it. Why did we move? - Because  I wasn't feeling the flow in my office. I need to feel the flow.  Wait. What?! No!  You are making me  a salsa-dancer, slash-government assassin?!  Jane, I can't! I hate guns!  -  - No.  No, please don't make me do it.  You know you can't mix genres like this! (groans)  (sighs)  (sighs)  (groaning)  Jane, that's not how it works.  You can't just turn me into a lesbian!  See? Tons of beautiful,  scantily-clad women, and  I feel nothing.  (sighs)  Well, not nothing.  (laughs)    Hey.  Oh, you gonna say bye to Mommy?  Oh! Have the best day ever with Daddy, huh?  And you're sure you can watch him all day?  - Because Chepa's unavailable, so - Jane.  I'm sure.  Go.  Bye. Let's go.  Let's go, buddy!  What if the house is a 1950's bomb shelter?  You're a scientist  No, no, no, boring. No one cares about science.  Jane, this way. I've made your grandmother  wonderful wallpaper samples  to help with her redecorating dilemma.  Oh.  I didn't know  - What's she doing here? - ROGELIO: Enough is enough!  You two need to talk!  Is this some kind of ambush?  No, we were just coming to walk through the set.  Of course it's an ambush.  You shouldn't be fighting at a time like this.    Because you're not only mother and daughter, but you're best friends.  JANE: See, but that is just it.  I don't want a best friend all the time.  Sometimes, I want a mom  who is responsible and practical and  wouldn't have let me quit salsa lessons.  Wh  You-you begged me to let you quit.  But you shouldn't have let me.  That's what I'm saying.  If you'd made me stick it out,  I'd know how to dance salsa  and I would have been better for it in the long run.  Are you serious? You sucked!  You see?  Whatever.  I can't do this.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, right. It's a set.  ROGELIO: How hard can it be  to think of a story set in a house?  I hate all of these ideas!  Well, you know what?  Maybe you should get another writer.  No. No, no, wait, wait! Wait, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. It's just that I have a lot  on my mind.  Okay.  How about  It's about Jane and Xiomara, obviously.  I've never seen them like this.  And the timing  couldn't be worse.  Hello, the timing is the whole point.  What?  Come on. It's so obvious!  And so, Dina explained to Rogelio  what was really going on between Jane and Xiomara.  And let's just say   it rang true.  You are brilliant.  I've said that before,  but I never meant it until this moment.  And now,  - I know how to fix this. - (heavenly choir singing)  Aren't you hungry?  Maybe you should go get some lunch.  No. No, I don't deserve food.  Anezka, stop. The wallets are returned,  we apologized, it's fine. Please.  Go get some lunch, so I can concentrate.  Oh, and charge it to me.  Don't steal it.  Yes. So sorry again.  (sighs)  Well, hello, there you are!  (laughs)  (shrieks)  BARBARA: Oh!  Oh!  You  - (urgent knocking) - Jane, hi.  - Are you okay? Is everything okay? - Yes. Yes, yes.  Is there any way that you can take Mateo?  Now? It's just kind of an emergency.  The hotel deal's falling through  because Petra's sister attacked the owner  Wait, what? Petra's sister?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh. Right.  -  - So now we might be out of a deal  and I gotta go beg Barbara  Well, I've got a meeting with my advisor  and my grandma's out.  What about your mom? I saw her by the pool  No, no, that's not even an option.  Whatever, I'll just take him to school and  J.J.'s supposed to be there,  so hopefully she'll watch him while I'm in my meeting.  Which brings us here, now.  And while I've come around to agreeing with your note,  it is a rather big one  Take the romance out of your romance novel.  And so, in order to address it fully  (Mateo crying)  I just think that I need a little more time.  (crying getting louder)  And if, um  Oh. I'm so sorry to interrupt.  It's just that he's been screaming nonstop  or calling me ""Dada.""  Oh, it's okay, it's okay, Mateo.  (smooching sound)  I-I'm sorry. This was  clearly not supposed to happen.  It's just, I'm in a really big fight with my mom.  - She usually watches him. - Are you crying?  Jane, no!  This is worse than sex crying!  No. No  - Yes, you are! - No, I'm not!  - I can see the tears! - Okay, fine!  Fine, I'm crying, okay?  But I don't want to be, so just ignore it!  Okay? The point is, is that  my life is really overwhelming right now  and I have never missed a deadline  and I could really use an extension  so I can put my best foot forward.  Do you need a minute to compose yourself?  (crying): No!  Yes.  Thank you.  Huh.  Will Professor Donaldson reveal a hidden soft side?  Will the sight of Jane crying  and the cute baby melt her cold heart?  I'm okay. (sniffs)  - Thank you. - Good.  So the deadline is the deadline.  You either meet it  or you don't.  And again, we are so, so incredibly sorry.  I mean, my sister clearly has  - personal space issues. - ANEZKA: And I am so ashamed.  And I want to cut off my hand.  PETRA: What?  I deserve it! Worse! Worse!  My hands should be chewed off by wolves!  - No - Yes, everything is bad,  everything, I hate it,  - I hate myself. - BARBARA: No, now, just stop.  Okay?  I-I'm fine, honestly.  I-I did approach you  rather suddenly.  Really?  Oh, thank you, thank you.  Not deserving it,  but thanking you, thanking you so much,  - so very much - Anezka, stop.  Um, why don't you go wait in my office?  Yes, of course.  Thank you, of course. Thank you.  Thank you.  Again, I am so sorry.  Apology accepted.  The problem is, I like you a little bit less now.  Not to mention, another bid came in higher.  Match this, and the place is yours.  Sounds great.  RAFAEL: We'll be in touch.  Can you meet this?  Depends if he uses that insider trading money.  I don't know.  I just hope Anezka didn't ruin this.  And from one fractured family   to another.  (gasps): Jane!  You're here.  ROGELIO: Mwa! Come.  - XIOMARA: Wait. What's going on? - Sit.  Dad, is this another ambush?  ROGELIO: Stop it. Of course not. I just invited  my family and two brilliant executives  to watch a run-through  of my favorite  Tiago episode yet.  Sit. Let's begin!  And action!        That's weird.              (doorbell rings)                  - What? - That's ridiculous.                            LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And then, something amazing happened.  Rogelio's cockamamie,  totally wackadoo, completely crazy plan   well, it actually started to work.  And I would tell you what they are feeling right now,  but as we have learned,  it's better to show than tell.  DIRECTOR: Cut!  Okay, so there had better be a huge Tiago twist coming up.  To be clear, there was no twist.  Here's the twist.  See, it's a family of clones  posing as a regular family with regular problems.  And Tiago  is gaining their trust,  so he can stop them from taking over the planet.  BOTH: Ah  See, now that makes more sense.  I mean, who cares about a fight  between a mom and a daughter, right?  (crying): I'm so sorry, Mom.  (shushes)  (crying): I know.  Me, too.  SALSA SOFIA: What about me?  What was my mother like?  What is it?  I have an idea  for my novel.  Okay.  Go, go write!  I'll pick up Mateo.  Oh  So, I'm gonna ask Anezka to leave.  I should've never let her  stay in the first place.  She messed up your deal!  Hey, come on.  Come on, what?  This hotel, the longevity of it,  well, I  might not be the greatest mother in the regular ways  but now I've gotten in the way of us providing for them.  You haven't.  You didn't.  My sister, okay?  Same thing.  And maybe it was Petra  feeling so badly, or the fact that he, too,  was feeling like a crap parent in that moment,  but Rafael just   well, he wanted to be the hero.  I found the money to buy it.  In any case, he used the dirty money.  And yes   he would come to regret it.  But that's for the future.  I, I talked to the bank.  They extended the loan.  It's an investment for our future.  Wait, so Anezka didn't ruin things?  No.  She didn't.  And listen, maybe don't be so hard on her.  You know, she's had a tough life.  And I felt for her.  You know, with Barbara.  Yeah.  I did, too.  So maybe keep her around  just a little longer?  PETRA: Yeah, okay.  Maybe just a little bit longer.  Well, this promises to be awkward.    (gasps)    Will you marry me?  Yes! Yes!  (applause)  (both laugh)  ROBERT: Thank you.        (laughs)  Finished.  And sent. And  I think I deserve a nine-dollar beer from the mini-fridge.  Make it two.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Mmm.  Whoa, oh.  (sighs)  You okay?  Actually wanted to talk to you about something.  Mm-hmm?  About my place with Mateo.  Well don't worry, Rafael's just gonna have  - to be comfortable with it. - No.  Actually wanted to talk about what you're comfortable with.  Because we've actually never talked about that.  Yeah, y-you're right.  That's true.  Yeah, and it's just little things, you know?  Like you didn't ask me to watch him.  And you kept saying  - that I was babysitting. - Oh  well, I, but I didn't mean it like that. I know.  It's just  I want to be more than that.  You are.  And I'm really glad you want to be.  (chuckles) And you're right.  We have to figure it out.  Step one?  Uh-huh.  You're getting your own color in my calendar.  Yeah, that's not as sexy to me as it is to you.  - Really? - Yeah.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of sexy  Dina, what a success that was!  The execs loved . Whoa!  Is that what you really look like?  No, it's just that you are a writer,  and writers, they don't care about these things,  but that color looks  very attractive on you.  I'm going out to dinner.  Got it.  Well, thank you.  You really saved the day.  That whole clone thing?  Doubles are like telenovela 101.  No.  I mean with my family.  What?  Nothing, it's just  The way you care about your family.  That's a very attractive color on you, too.  Well, I love them very much.  I can tell.  And like I said,  it's a very attractive quality.  Well, you also look very attractive.  You said that already.  I meant it already.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my.  (door opens)  Ready for dress number three?  Yes, yes, ready.  (sighs)  (crying): That's definitely the dress.  Ah, but that's for another day.  A wedding day.  (laughs)  Which brings us here now.  - (phone chimes) - Oh.  - (gasps) - It's Marlene.  Deep breaths, Jane.  Deep breaths.  What does it say?  Jane, what does it say?  I'm back in the program.  - (laughs) - Yes!  Yes!  - Ooh, yes! - (grunting)  Well, you know what they say.  Those who can't salsa dance,  write about salsa dancers.  I'm so proud of you. Oh, thank you!  - (chuckles) - Ah yes!  (camera shutter clicking)  Yeah, uh-oh!  Well, what can I say?  We're not all about the marriage plot, right?"
"All right, let's recap this bad boy.  Jane and her family were living at the Marbella  because their house flooded, but  she and Michael had signed the lease for a house of their own,  and they planned to move in after they got married.  Meanwhile, Rafael  had requested more time with his son.  I want to be the man most present in Mateo's life.  And speaking of family bonds,  Rafael's brother, Derek,  -  - was back in town,  and at first, Rafael didn't trust him.  Did you know our mother was a crime lord?  There's got to be something on his boat.  Good, so search his boat.  But it turned out  -  - Derek was telling the truth,  and, oh, yeah,  Petra's long lost twin showed up.  My long lost sister.  And, well, she was slightly  less polished than Petra.  - Did you steal a wallet? - No.  I stole three wallets.  And she was also kind of crushing  - on Rafael. - Leaping lizards!  I know, straight out of  a telenovela, right? Well, imagine this.  Jane's father had just broken up  with her mother, Xiomara,  and now he was hooking up  with the head writer on his show.  And speaking of plot twists,  -  - remember our crime lord, Sin Rostro?  Well, she was killed  -  - by the crime lord, Mutter.  I know, I know, a lot of  crime lords to keep track of.  -  - Anyway, one's dead, one's on the run,  and Detective Michael is on the case.  At least I hope he is.  Anyway, let's dive in.  Like many girls at the age of seven,  Jane Gloriana Villanueva  saved her money in a piggy bank.  However, unlike many girls at the age of seven,  Jane Gloriana Villanueva never spent said money.  Jane  it's not gonna fit any more.  And the whole point  of saving money is so one day  - you can buy something. - No  the whole point of saving  is so that you have money  in case of an emergency.  Not when you're seven.  You don't have to worry about money, okay.  Please, just buy anything.  Fine, another piggy bank.  Yes, from a very early age  Jane had her priorities straight.  -  - And to this day, they haven't changed.  Ooh, okay, these are reasonably priced.  Which one do you think:  the cute giraffe or the classic stripe?  - Oh, it's got to be the giraffe, right? - Oh.  I feel like that could be Mateo's spirit animal.  Big eyes, gentle.  Totally, plus it can spark a lifelong interest in zoology,  or African studies.  That's a lot to put on a rug, but sure.  All right.  It's going in the cart.  Oh, that's a little more  than I was planning on spending.  You know what, I'm just gonna put it back.  No, don't.  Come on, we have two incomes now,  and it's our first home together  it should be special.  Plus, what about Mateo's zoology career, huh?  Yeah, okay.  I'll just leave it in my cart overnight and think about it.  Of course, you will.  Aw, isn't this nice?  Things are so good.  Alas  knowing telenovela structures as I do,  I'm a little worried.  Room service.  My two favorite words.  Uh, right here is good.  Coffee's hot and here's your paper.  Thank you very much.    - Oh, my God. - What is it?  Yeah I don't mean  to sound smug, but I did see  this coming.    ""Detective Cordero had a conflict of interest  right from the start""?  - Are they talking about me? - I-it must be.  ""His connection to the Solano family  compromised the entire investigation,""  - said one source. - That's ridiculous.  Your relationship with Rafael  is what helped you set up the sting.  That's not how they see it. They said that I got  Sin Rostro killed, let Mutter get away,  and I'm quoting, ""Left a giant mess behind""  with no leads and no arrests.""  - I don't understand. - Where is all this coming from?  A mole in the police department.  - It has to be. - But why?  - I don't know. - I got to get down there.  Oh  - This is going to blow over. - Mm-hmm.  Remember, today's news is tomorrow's trash.  Yeah, I know, you're right.  Okay.  You're right.  Yeah, unfortunately, they still have to get through today.  How the hell did they know about my boat?  What are you talking about?  It's in the article, man.    Uh-oh.  You were the only one who knew.  I didn't tell anyone.  Technically, untrue, by the way.  Actually, completely untrue.  Are they ever going to let this die?  They mentioned the Marbella four times.  I mean,  you have a few murders in your hotel and  Hey, uh you want to, maybe, change a diaper?  No, no thanks, I changed one a few days ago.  But I'll hold the other one  - while you do it. - Great, thanks.  Yeah, no problem.  Honestly, I feel so much better.  Those pills  Ah, yes, thanks to modern medicine  Petra's great depression has lifted.  Well, I am glad they're working.  Me, too.  I mean, now I-I  can accept that I'm just not one of those maternal moms,  and I'm fine with that.  They're cute in small doses.  Aren't you, Anna?  Elsa.  Oh.  Anyway, let's talk about their trust funds.  Yup, Petra is definitely back to her old self.  I have a copy of the estate plan in my bag.  Mm. And is it the same as Mateo's?  Of course.  I mean, they're siblings.  Hello to you.  And speaking of siblings  Hi, Anezka. Good morning.  Oh, right.  Somebody's crushing hard,  but, come on,  is anybody shipping these two?  Off to work?    Yes.  Oh, I just loving dress.  I feel like real princess.  Mm, 'kay,  relax, it's just a waitress uniform.  Petra  be nice.  How is the waitressing going?  Scott says she's doing a great job.  You are wasting this?  Where I am coming from,  people are killing for this.  Yeah, she's not doing a great job.  No problem, we do serve large portions.  Thank you.  But she is the boss's sister.  Seriously, I have never been more bitter  - about pooling tips. - I know, she's a disaster.  Thank you for covering my tables.  I just cleared newspapers from the lobby,  hospitality, the gym  What are you two doing?  Stay on top of your tables.    Settle down, Vests, just 'cause you can't fire her  doesn't mean you have to take it out on us.  He can't exactly fire Jane,  either.  Damn, Daniel.  Back at it again with the vests.  I'm just frustrated.  - Work has been miserable lately. - Plus, you're on  day three without your kid, right?  But you get him back tomorrow?  Ah, the heart of it.  Yeah.  Trust me, I get it.  Shared custody's hard.  It sure is  which is why when this happened,  it felt like a stroke of good luck.  Hey!  I thought Rafael was taking him to the zoo.  Um, Mr. Solano had to work last minute so we're going for  a walk, and then I'm gonna make him  dinner and put him down.  Oh, well, I'm done with my shift. I'll take him.  Are you sure?  Of course!  I've been craving some extra time with Mr. Sweetface.  Oh, I'm just annoyed because  we said that we'd call each other  before we called a sitter.  Yeah, wait, what are you doing?  Uh, do you think I could be a silent movie star?  You?  Silent?  Ha, ha, in Rogelio's show there's this part,  a 1920s lounge singer with an amazing voice  who's a silent movie star,  but no one can ever hear her.  Oh, that's like Little Mermaid tragic.  But then she gets to sing a song  at the end of the episode.  Oh, my God, stop.  Right?  So what do you think?  Should I ask your dad if I can audition?  I don't know if  that's a yes or a no.  It means  go for it.  I mean, you and Dad are  in a much better place, right?  Plus, Dad's been in a really  good mood lately.  True, for the record.  Rogelio was in a really good mood,  and here's why.  Yeah, okay, that music is approved, mm-hmm.  Move on.  It is very sexy when you approve things.  I got to go, and this isn't happening again.  Yes, this is what you said the last 12 times.  Whatever.  I'm late for casting.  We still don't have an Eleanor Roosevelt.  Good luck, and remember,  we want to capture Eleanor's inner beauty  but on the outside.  See you later.  Again, this isn't happening again.  Again, that's what she said the last 12 times.  What do you think, Mateo?  Do we need the rug?  It really ties the room together.  Is that a yes or a no, hmm?  Hmm?  Oh, who is there?  I'm sorry to bother you.  Just here to get my son.  What's wrong?  It's my day to have Mateo.  I know  but I saw him with Chepa  and we agreed that if something came up,  we'd call each other. Why didn't you call me?  Because it was my day, and,  frankly, I just really didn't want the judgment.  There's no judgment. I mean, if you're  - feeling guilty - I'm not feeling guilty.  Because you requested more time and you're not with him  - There it is, that's the judgment. - Stating a fact  - is not judgment. - I just don't need to feel constantly  guilted, okay?  I want to say something without you getting mad.  Well, the implication that you can't express your opinion  without me getting mad is making me mad.  I-I just  don't want to start this whole thing and have you spin out.  Is this you trying to not make me mad?  I think some sort of custody arrangement  might be good for us.  With lawyers?  - Because they make things contentious. - That's why  I was thinking that we use a mediator.  You know, keep things friendly,  so everything is established.  You know, all the rules.  Things are getting more complicated the older he gets.  Exactly.  It would just be nice to have everything on paper 'cause  I don't feel that this gray area is helping us or him.  Yeah.  Okay, let's do it.  Great.  I'll set it up. Thank you.  Thank you.  It's a good idea.  Geez, even the suggestion of mediation  is making things better.  So, I'll drop him off tomorrow?  Mm-hmm, good-bye,  Mr. Sweetface, I love you.  - Want to come to Daddy? Mom-mom.  - Oh, come here, buddy. - Oh.  Hey, you can let go.  Okay. All right.  Hey, little man, it's okay.  Separation anxiety kicks in at this age.  Bye.  Yup, it's separation anxiety, all right.  Come on, you deserve it, Jane.  Let's do this!  Okay, I did it.  Hi, sorry, I just bought the stuff for Mateo's bedroom.  Let the zoology passion begin.  Are you okay?  I got fired.  Oh, dear, I'm speechless.      How can they do this to you?  I mean, you're the reason why Sin Rostro isn't still  out there terrorizing people.  That's not how the department sees it.  The article embarrassed them, they needed a fall guy.  - Oh, Michael. - Technically, I'm on six months  unpaid leave pending further investigation  but it feels like a formality.  I can't believe they're doing this to you.  I can't believe I'm unemployed.  We just signed a new lease.  Yeah, well, maybe we'll just back out of it.  No.  No way, you love that house.  I love that house.  It's a miracle we even got it.  I'll just I'll-I'll find another job.  - I'll start making calls tomorrow. - Yeah.  Okay.  In the meantime, I'll pick up  some extra shifts at work.  I thought you were hating it.  No, it's actually been  kind of fun lately.  Yeah, not technically true, or, like, true at all.  I'll talk to Scott.  More shifts?  Absolutely.  - Oh, really? - Thank you, Scott.  In fact,  I have the perfect job for you.  You can train Anezka.  I asked you to hold the onions  but there are onions on here.  You're right.  So sorry.  Oh, oh.  Oh  You know, I-I do teach all day long.  You'll be great.  Okay, yes.  Yes.  I could do this. Hmm.  Hi.      Cut!          - Xiomara, hi! - Hi!  What a pleasant surprise.  Come!  Join me for a shoe shine.  So, what brings you to the set  of the world's favorite telenovela?  Well, I I have a favor to ask,  and you can totally say no.  Go on.  Is there any way that I can audition for the part  of the silent movie star lounge singer?  I wouldn't expect any preferential treatment.  Don't be ridiculous,  I'm a huge proponent of nepotism.  There's no need to audition.  - The part is yours. - Really?!  Of course!  - Rogelio, they're ready for you. - Terrific.  Now, I must go and make love  to the gorgeous Eleanor Roosevelt.  # AnActorsLife.  Boom!  There you go.  Yummy!  - I'm not eating that! - Of course not.  We'll make you another one.  Sorry about that She's just training.  Okay, sneezes are another thing.  If you have to sneeze, sneeze away from the food.  Also, maybe try to smile.  Why would I smile?  I working.  Right, you want people  - to feel welcome. - They're your guests.  Okay, I make smile.  Okay.  Well, maybe try a little more relaxed.  Oops, no, it was better before.  A-and be conscious of your body language.  The best servers are invisible,  floating from one table to the next,  and remember, the customer is always right.  No one is always right  except Czar.  Okay  let's pretend every customer is the Czar.  Now take this to the kitchen and ask them for a new one.  Oh, God.  Oh, Alba, I know you meant that as a nice gesture but  Excuse me?  Could we get more iced tea?  - Mm-hmm. - I told you Evan's  - on the wait list? - You did.  So, I offered this guy $1,200  to help him write his supplemental essay,  to just push him over the top,  and suddenly it's not enough.  And maybe it was because she missed Mateo so much,  or because she was stressed out about money,  or because she was responsible for training a woman  who was currently pulling ice cubes  out of a customer's glass  with her fingers.  Excuse me.          And then I pitched myself as a grad student and a T.A.  and I said I'd do it for a thousand, and she said yes!  Seriously?!  I know!  Who knew there was this crazy business?  Helping people with their college essays?  Are you kidding me?!  That's like a fun Saturday.  Only for you, Jane. Only for you.  And best of all, I get to do it at home with Mateo.  I can't believe it.  And you got the part in Tiago.  Things are looking swell, I tell ya.  I was doing, like,  a '20s thing, there.  Oh ha.  What's going on?  Your father's sleeping with Dina.  Writer Dina?  What? No.  How do you know?  He did the sex sniff.  Okay, I don't know what you're talking about  and I don't want to.  Too late, I do.  Sorry, not in the mood.  Seriously, I didn't need to know that.  I just I didn't think he'd move on so quickly.  I know, Mom.  Is it gonna be too hard to work with him?  No  No.  I'm just absorbing.  I'll be fine.  Exes work together all the time.  Which brings us here, now.        Okay, so let's start.  Can I get a little history?  Oh.  Um, well, it started, uh  Actually, sorry, I can't hear this for the 99th time.          We're planning on being true co-parents.  That's right.  That's great.  We should hammer out  the hypothetical details,  just in case.  - Of course. - Okay.  Okay, then.  Let's dive into the nitty-gritty.  Hypothetical nitty-gritty.  - Great. - Great!  I assure you, Xiomara is a brilliant actress.  We ran lines together  - all the time. - Has she acted  in Spanish before?  No.  Has she acted on camera before?  No.  - What? - I see what's happening here.  Someone's a little jelly.  Jelly?  You know,  the green-eyed monster?  What?!  I'm not jealous. I'm pissed.  This bar should be on the other side of set.  We discussed this.  You are not allowed to hire anyone  without consulting me first.  So your ex-girlfriend better be great.  Great  so  you'll each have him every other Christmas until he's 18,  and then Mateo can choose.  Can I just say,  these two don't seem nearly as relaxed  as they did when we left.  - Right, but - I know,  I know, it's just hypothetical,  you're going to do them together.  Got it. Okay,  on to summer vacations?  - Okay. - Okay.  How many days  will you each allow the other  to take Mateo on vacation?  A week. A month.  A month? A week?  Uh-oh, those are not the same things.  What-what if I want to take Mateo to Europe?  For a month?!  No way!  I-I can't go that long without seeing him.  Anyway, wait,  t-t-this is just all hypothetical.  No, actually, this is not hypothetical.  This is something that I really want to do someday.  - Are you serious? - Yes!  One of the only positive  childhood memories I have is the month I'd spend  with my father travelling in the summer.  So then travel with him for a week,  - ten days. - It's too short.  - I just can't agree to a month. - But this is important to me.  Yeah, well, it's important to me to see my son.  Our son!  How about we all take a breath  - and see if we can agree on - Please,  just stay out of this.  No, I can't.  You're actually paying me  not to stay out of it.  Look, you've only had one meeting.  You can't go in there thinking you're gonna be  the most agreeable couple ever and it'll be easy.  I never expected that.  I beg to differ.  Just keep in mind that you both  want what's best for Mateo.  That's the priority.  You're right.  Thanks.  Good luck with your interview!  Oh, it's okay.    Remember, Jane,  separation anxiety is totally normal.  Yeah, I know.  Bye-bye, baby, bye.  And from her baby  Nice clear voice and smile.  To her babysitting job.  Is there anything else I be getting for you?  - No, that'll be all. - Thank you, Anezka.    Scott said she was doing great.  She's gonna be great, if it kills me.  How are the girls?  Oh, they're-they're good.  Apparently, very well taken care of if Rafael should die.  Hmm?  Oh, th-their trusts.  You know, you went through this process, didn't you?  Of course, took forever.  I know, it's really overwhelming.  It's a lot of money to manage.  It certainly is.  You're the one managing it, right?  - Oh, yeah. - You?  Who else?  Thank you, Anezka.  That's not your order, is it?  - Not even close. - I'll fix it.    Oh, dear.  Looks like Rafael doesn't trust Petra  with the trust.  Trust me.  You're going to be great.  Just stay on your mark,  and deliver your line  just like we rehearsed.  Got it, I'm ready.  Yes.  And action!                    Enchanté.    Men aren't really my deal.  Cut!  Oh, oh, my God,  I said that in English. I'm so sorry.  No, it's fine, don't worry, it's fine.  First take, first take.  Remember    And then I say    And then I get the idea for the New Deal.  - Are you ready? - Got it, I'm ready.  Let's go again.  And  action!  Enchanté.    - Cut! - God, I'm so sorry,  I forgot, I-I was trying  not to say it in English  and I-and I-I completely blanked.  It's fine, it's fine.  Let's go again.      Cut!  You're off your mark.      Stop looking at the camera.        Just  read it off my chest.    I don't think acting is really her deal.  I'm so sorry.  I know I was terrible.  I-it's just the cameras threw me,  a-and the pressure.  - Don't worry. - This always happens.  We'll fix it in post.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Yes.  She read off your chest.  How are you gonna fix that in post?  I don't know, special effects.  I mean, I saw Jurassic World.  Are there really dinosaurs?  No.    How hard can it be to raise her eye line  just a couple of inches?  All right, let's do this.  Ready, Evan?      Okay  so, to get off a college wait list, you really want  your supplemental materials to communicate something  that you didn't put in your actual essay.  What are your priorities, your passions?  I mean, I like helping homeless people, and, like,  poor people, and blind people.  And that's your passion?  No, honestly, it doesn't matter to me.  You can write whatever you want.  Excuse me?  Yeah, I'll just give you some  notes whenever you're done.  Mrs. Hutchinson, I'm so sorry to bother you,  but there's been a little misunderstanding.  Um, Evan seems to think that I'm going  to write the essay for him.  Of course, you're going to write the essay for him.  Why else would I pay you a thousand dollars?  Oh.  I can't believe he's already asleep.  He was happy and  easy and adorable, if it helps.  No, it doesn't.  So are you gonna write the essay?  No, definitely not.  It's against my school's honor code,  and my own personal code of ethics.  I just meant, it's a lot of money.  Shh.  Hi, hey.  Hi.  Looks like somebody  could use a drink  or a nice, long talk.  The interview was just a courtesy.  My reputation is ruined, no one's getting near me.  Hey, it's your first day looking.  You'll find something and we're okay for now.  You're gonna make up my salary  with your new essay writing business?  If I need to, yes.  I thought I'd talk to your dad, actually.  See if he can ask his P.R. people for advice.  Help contain the damage.  Maybe change the perception of me out there.  Unfortunately, my publicist said  that the best thing to do is just wait it out.  Really?  You address things with the press,  you'll just fan the flames and extend the story.  I'm sorry, bro.  Oh, it's okay.  Thank you for asking.  Come in.  You don't have a lock on your door.  Rogelio, you just had a serious run-in  with a mentally ill stalker.  You have to be more careful.  I know, it's just all the locks, well  that's how she kept me prisoner, so  So what?  You still need locks.  Come here, I want you to watch something.  Okay, I'll leave you to work.  Just be careful, that's all.  Enchanté.  Don't speak.  Just watch.  I-I don't understand.  Is this the best you can do?  I mean, what about the dinosaurs?  That was a $150 million movie.  We don't have that budget.  Okay.  Yes, you were right.  I will tell her.  No, no, don't say that.  Let's just see what Jane counters with.  I really don't want to move off the one month.  Okay, thanks, Eileen.  Wow, you're not just automatically giving Jane  everything she wants; I'm in shock.  What's that supposed to mean?  Are we both really going to pretend  that Mateo's trust and the twins' trust  are exactly the same?  If you die, Jane controls Mateo's trust,  but I don't control the twins'.  Some lawyer does.  Yes, that's correct.  Look  even though you and I are in a good place now,  it hasn't always been that way.  I mean, you've done some things.            Sorry, sorry, I forgot people don't want to read TV.  Yes, I know, okay, but  well, things are different now, aren't they?  Very different, and I like the place that we're in  but if you're asking me if I trust you  as much as I trust Jane  the answer is no.  And you can understand  why, right?  So, why'd you come back?  Extreme financial duress.  That's not important.  What's important is  getting you into college, so come on.  Tell me a little something about you.  What do you like?  I told you.  I like helping homeless people  and poor people, and  And blind people, right.  Besides that.    - You're into drumming? - Okay, I'm not  ""into"" drumming.  Drumming is my life.  That's why I want to study music.  And there it was, a priority.  Perchance even a passion.  Okay, now we're talking.  No, stop, please.  I know why you're firing me.  - I blew it. - I'd still like  to use your voice for the song, though.  Of course.  Actually, this is all  probably for the best.  It's a little hard for me to be around you and Dina,  - anyway. - What?  Rogelio,  come on, it's obvious.  Look, it's very, very casual.  I don't think so.  I think you like her a lot.  That's ridiculous.  Dina's a writer.  She wears hoodies and jeans.  She's not nearly glamorous,  charismatic or TMZable enough for me to be with.  If you say so.  So, like, more singers    - No, you take. - Stop, stop.  No, but is  Looks like the Czech is  having issues with the check.  Everything okay here?  Customer overpay.  I didn't overpay.  I'm good, thank you, good-bye.  - But - Thank you. Have a nice day.  - But - Anezka, remember,  the customer is always right.  So sorry, Jane, it's just he pay too much.  Oh, my God.  No, he didn't.  You got a tip.  What?  For good service.  I did?  Yes.  Yes, you did!  You got a tip!  - I got a tip. - Uh-huh.  I got tip!  It was only 3.5%,  but still, a tip, a tip!  Jane, there's a woman out there  who wants to speak with you.  Oh, okay.  Be right back.  Marry the salt shakers.  Do you, salt, take you, salt  What, no, stop.  On the other hand, it'll keep her out of trouble.  Actually, finish the ceremony.  Hi, there.  The essay's a disaster.  It's all about drumming.  Evan wants to be a musician,  it's his passion.  It's a hobby.  He loves music.  So, he can love it,  it's not a career.  He's applying to  the university's economics program.  Trust me, I know what's best for my son,  and I'm the one paying you to write the essay  to get him in.  Remember, Jane, the customer is always right.  Got it, I'll rewrite the essay.  Thank you.  I float.  You no hearing me.  Good job, Anezka.  Everything being okay?  Yeah, it's just, uh  this mom is getting in the way of her kid.  And just like that, Jane realized something.  I don't want to be the kind of mom who gets in her kid's way,  and travelling Europe for a month,  while totally over the top,  well, it would be pretty  cool for him, and even though I can't imagine it,  I don't want to stand in his way.  And it's important to you, so  Thank you.  Now, let's talk about  what's important to me because  I'm gonna need a whole bunch of Easters in a row  if you're taking him for a month.  Yeah, okay.  I think I can work with that.  So, how did it work out with Xiomara?  She was great, a class act.  Good.  Funny thing, she kind of  knew we were a thing, though.  What? Somehow,  she sniffed it out.  Did you tell her we're not?  Of course, but, I mean,  we kind of are though, right?  - What? - We've been seeing each other  every night, sexually, things are stupendous  Stop, stop.  This is just casual, Rogelio.  Good.  I was just testing you,  making sure you were not  overly invested in me because that can get uncomfortable.  Oh.  Well, don't worry, I'm not.  Phew!  Good.  - I feel good about this. - So do I.  I really think as long as we both  prioritize Mateo, then we'll be fine.  I totally agree.  Come on.      I got first tip!  All because of Jane.  Oh, I just loving Jane.  Okay, enough about Jane already!  You being okay?  Yeah yeah, no, I'm fine.  I'm sorry.  Jane's great.  What?  Nothing, we just  we have a complicated history,  which mostly involves me being horrible  and Jane being a perfect human being and sometimes  sometimes, it just gets to be too much.  What is this complicated history?  For one she she got accidentally, artificially  inseminated, which led to    Bye. Bye.  Mommy would love to play with you, but she's got to work.  Bye, bye, baby.  Well, I not thinking Jane is perfect, not at all.  Rafael does.  Well maybe that is being  something that will change.  Uh-oh, I think someone's wheels being turning  and to be fair, Jane is certainly not feeling  so perfect at the moment.      Are you okay?  Only this time, Jane could  no longer be silent.  No, I'm not.  I'm writing this essay on priorities  and mine  they feel all wrong.  - I'm sorry. - No, no, no, what's going on?  I just Rafael and I have a custody plan,  and it's good and it works,  but it means half the time, Mateo's somewhere else.  Half the time,  my heart is somewhere else,  and I just want the time that  I have with him to be with him, you know,  Mm-hmm.  And not just working so that we can afford this house.  Yeah, I get it.  Why didn't you tell me how you were feeling?  I didn't want you to feel bad, or pressured.  Isn't that the whole perk of this marriage thing?  We share the pain and the pressure.  That's the whole perk?  Well, okay, one of them.  You don't have to take on this  whole thing alone, anymore.  So, tell that crazy lady you're not writing her kid's essay,  and we don't have to give up  the house yet, either,  because I got a job.  You did?  A very, very temporary job for now  because I'm not gonna sit around  and wait for my name to be cleared  so, I am working for your father, actually.  What?  I'm his new chief of security.  His situation needs upgrades,  systems in place  You're trying to make it sound cool, aren't you?  Yeah, a little bit.  But who cares?  You and Mateo are my priority.        Don't act all shocked, I just gave you that shift,  I'm not taking it back.  Scott, come on.  I just need a little more time with my son.  Well, too bad.  Really?  'Cause I think we can make it work.  Oh, uh, of course, of course, Mr. Solano.  Rogelio's right, huh?  This nepotism thing's not half bad.  Uh-oh, I don't like that look in her eyes.    Huh, that's weird.  That's where Jane goes to school.  I'm sorry, I can't bear to watch this.      Anezka, no, you can't put an ad  for that in the school newspaper!  Jane could get in big trouble!  I signed the estate plan.  An independent trustee is fine.  Thank you, and look  you have changed.  I know that.  It's just a-a process.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  And frankly, I think I've made more improvements than you.  - Wait, what? - When you're up against it,  you still lie,  instead of just coming clean, facing the consequences.  I hope you change that soon.  Damn, Petra!    What's up?  I told the police about the boat.  It was early on.  It was before I knew you, before I trusted you.  But now I do,  and I'm sorry I did it, but I-I just don't want to lie about it.  Well, I really appreciate you telling me.  It's better to be honest.  It's a go.  Let's take him down.  Oh, dear, I wish I'd never heard that."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: There you are. Last we left our Jane,  her fiancÃ© Michael had lost his job  due to a little, uh, bad publicity,  so Jane picked up some extra work  writing other people's college essays.  And I'm the one paying you  to write the essay to get him in.  But her conscience got  the better of her, so she quit.  Unfortunately, Petra's twin sister, Anezka,  who is epileptic  - Oh. - Leaping lizards!  I forgot to mention, Petra has a twin sister named Anezka.  What the Anyway, Anezka thought she was being helpful.  Well, I not thinking  Jane is perfect, not at all.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, she sabotaged Jane.  I know! Leaping lizards, indeed.  Oh, and speaking of shady relatives,  you'll recall Rafael's mother  was the crime lord known as Mutter.  -  - Oh, and his long lost brother showed up.  Did you know our mother was a crime lord?  No, did you?  RAFAEL: Where were you? You weren't with our mother.  Right here, on this boat.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unfortunately, Derek  seemed to be up to a little sabotage of his own.  It's a go. Let's take him down.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  Which brings us to Rogelio, who started sleeping with  - the head writer of his show. - XIOMARA: I think you like her a lot.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which was a challenge for Xo,  but Rogelio promised she could still record  a song for his show,  and speaking of big productions,  we are T-minus 17 days  before Jane and Michael's wedding,  so let's hop on it.  Jane Gloriana Villanueva didn't remember her first Mother's Day  because she was a baby at the time.  Happy Mother's Day!  Come, come, I have  a surprise for you.  Today, we're  going to do nothing  but sit in our pj's,  watch the marathon of  Lagrimas de tu Corazon  on channel five, and eat all the ice cream we want.      Come on, aren't you dying  to find out if Eva's secret twin  is working with Alfonso  to bring down the Ramirez empire?  Hmm.  Please?  It's my first Mother's Day as a mother,  and I want to spend it with my mom.  Chunky Monkey?  Two pints.  (chuckles)  And so a tradition was born.    Observe: binge watching, before streaming.  Yes, it was a thing.    Over the years, the format changed,  but the fundamentals were the same: a day of pj's,  pints and telenovelas.  Ay!  It was Juan Carlos's twin?!    Ricardo has a twin brother?  Don't act so surprised, Jane.  It's a well-worn trope of the genre  I did not see that coming.  But it still works every time,  and Jane was planning on spending her first  Mother's Day as a mother carrying on the tradition.  (sighs) I'm torn.    Do we revisit a classic like Lagrimas  de tu Corazon,  or do we binge this new one from Mexico,  La Danza  de los Criminales.  But then  Oh.    Petra.  Oh, hi, Jane.  What's this?  Oh, nothing.  Oh, well, I-I just thought it would be  simpler if, um, if we all did something together,  so Rafael wouldn't have to  split his time.  You're hosting a Mother's Day brunch?  Oh, it's not a big deal.  You made cards.  Yeah, K-Krishna got carried away.  Um, anyway, your-your whole family's invited.  If you want.  You don't have to come.  We'd love to, Petra. Thank you.     MICHAEL: You really said yes?  Of course, I said yes.  But I just finished setting up  the TV for your binge watch.  Oh, well, guess we have  to call Petra and cancel.  Stop, she's making a real effort here.  It's sweet,  and we're  sort of a family  it's important to show up.  Right, Abuela?    Well, tough.  We're all going.  Got it. I should run.  Can't be late for my first day at the new job.  (Jane chuckles)  Pretty sure your boss  will cut you some slack.  True, for the record, since his new boss was      (clears throat)                  Okay, guys, come on.  Let's keep it friendly for the EPK.      Yes, Rogelio,  let's not turn this into a pissing contest.  I understand why you'd be  intimidated, I have a very propulsive stream.  All right,  let's take five.  (bell ringing)  Michael, please.  Uh, I don't think you've  met my new head of security.  This is  Michael Cordero,  former star detective of the Miami PD.  Ah. (chuckles)  Nice to meet you.  I had to beef up protection  due to my well-publicized stalking incident.  Have you ever been stalked, Esteban?  So many times.  Funny, I don't recall anything high-profile.  I kept it out of the press,  but I did ""beef up""  my personal security, as well.  This is Donny,  former world champion  of the MMA circuit.  Donny,  please carry me to craft service.  He's so ridiculous.  Can you carry me?  No. (sputtering)  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding, of course.  Come, let me tell you all about the big  Mother's Day surprise I am planning for Jane.  Oh, okay, just remember,  Jane doesn't love surprises.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True, for the record.  And unfortunately,  she was about to get a big one.  Sorry, but your phone's been blowing up  for the last 30 minutes.  A lot of unknown numbers.  12 messages? That's bizarre.  What is it?  Someone wants to pay me to write their college term paper.  And another one.  BOY'S VOICE: Hey, I'm replying to the ad in University Daily  about how I can pay you to write my essays.  And I have this Earth Science thing coming up  (gasps)  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  ""Jane Villanueva will write  your college essay for money?""  Who did this?  What's going on?  Call me back. We'll talk prices.  - (phone beeps) - Oh, no, my advisor called.  Hi, Jane  Please, please, please don't be about the advertisement.  There was an advertisement that Professor Blake and I  need to speak with you about as soon as possible.  Okay. It's okay.  She hates me, but Blake mostly doesn't.  Professor Blake, Professor Donaldson      I just want to assure you,  I do not write college papers for money.  I am clearly 100% against cheating.  Then why is there an ad in the paper offering your services?  I have no idea.  It's obviously some sort of prank.  I mean, even if I did write papers for money,  which, again, I don't,  would I ever advertise in the school paper?  She's right, Richard.  Why would she do this? She's not stupid.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, she called Jane not stupid.  So who do you think did it?  I have no idea.  But I promise I'm going to get  - to the bottom of this. - Here's the thing,  regardless of whether or not you placed the ad  I definitely didn't.  Drama just seems to follow you.  (people gasping) No! Oh! Wait!  I'm sorry, you can finish out your current class,  but I can't have you back to TA next semester.  Really, Richard?  RICHARD; Yes.  JANE: I'm telling you, Donaldson's my only hope.  I think if I can prove to her  that I was set up, she'll help me.  So, I went to the school paper  and got the buyer's e-mail address.   Creepy.  So, I just set up my own fake e-mail account,  and pretended to be from the school,  and asked if they wanted to rerun the ad.  Ooh, nice.  Very Jessica Jones.  Thank you.  I just, I need to prove to Professor Blake  that this was a mistake.  And that drama doesn't follow me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In Jane's defense,  drama is in her blood.  We have reached Sting-tantric levels of love-making.  Add it to your special skills.  Done.      Why are you hurrying off?  - Work. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  You'll recall, Rogelio's booty call  had recently turned into a full-blown crush.  - Where'd I put my phone? - Um  Hmm.  (clears throat)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Don't worry, Ro.  That could totally be an oversight.  Here it is.  So, uh, Dina,  what are you doing Saturday?  I have plans.    RAFAEL: They're just the preliminary plans,  of course.  I'm impressed.  Your architect did a spectacular job.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As my grandmother used to say,  ""Ay, not this guy.""  I'm glad you're both happy.  Very happy.  Call the firm,  tell them we're moving forward.  Petra?  What's this?  Why does everyone keep asking that? Read the invitation.  That's the whole point of an invitation.  You're throwing a Mother's Day brunch?  Yes.  Jane's family's coming.  I just thought it would be easier for everyone  if we're all in one place.  Really?  Don't make it into a thing.  Yeah, well, there is one thing.  Invitation says 11:00.  The twins are still napping then.  Oh.  So we'll wake them up.  We've worked really hard to get them on a schedule.  Okay, fine, so we'll push the brunch to 1:00.  Now it's a lunch.  Enjoy.  Yes!  What?  I got a response from my fake e-mail.  ""No thank you to renewing advertisement,  I have everything what is necessary.""  ""Everything what is necessary""?  Jane! Sorry to interrupt.  Uh, we're gonna have to bump the brunch to 1:00.  I forgot the twins nap at 11:00.  - What? - Nothing.  They just changed their schedule.  Anyway, is that all right?  Yes, of course. No problem.  I know, Abuela, I'm sorry,  but she got the nap times wrong, I guess.  Come on, you know Petra's not a hands-on mom,  give her a break please.  Can you get someone to cover your shift?  That is sounding important.  If you wanting to talk,  I can do everything what is necessary  to cover your tables.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Did she just say  I have to call you back.  Excuse me?  I say,  I can do everything what is necessary for your tables.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when Jane realized  what she should have realized much earlier,  given her great love of telenovelas,  it's always the twin.  - Petra? - Oh, hey, perfect timing.  Here's our caterer's  proposed menu for our lunch.  Any allergies?  Issues?  Wow! Four courses.  I'm assuming  each course lasts three minutes  and has lots of Cheerios  or Mateo's not gonna make it.  I didn't realize I had to prepare  something special for Mateo.  No, I'm kidding. I'm  I'm-I'm just saying that he can't  sit through four courses.  Well, my nannies will be there if he gets fussy.  Oh, I mean, well,  it is Mother's Day, so I do want to be with him.  I wasn't suggesting you don't want to be with him.  Okay, we're getting off track. That is great.  Um I actually  wanted to talk about Anezka.  I've showed her how to use deodorant.  No, it-it's not that. It's, um  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, Jane told Petra  about well, you know.  Let's FF through.  (Jane speaking rapidly)  But why would she do that?  I have no idea.  But in order to get my TA job back,  I have to prove who it was,  and I really think it was your sister.  Let me talk to her.  (exhales)  ROGELIO: I need to talk to you.  I wasn't going to mention it,  but holding in my emotions  is causing me to eat my feelings.  And I think we can both agree  that will be a disaster for the ratings.  What is it?  I know you're having a birthday party.  And I was not invited.  (sighs) Look.  The truth is I don't think you'd  get along with my other friends.  They're more like, you know, regular people.  Some of my closest friends are non-celebs.  Stedman, for example.  It's just you're interested in different things.  You like to talk about the Kardashians.  (chuckles)  There more interested in  Ta-Nehisi Coates.  I assure you I'm open  to all kinds of jackets.  He's not a jacket.  He's an author.  I know.  I was just  making a joke.  Come on, Dina.  I can totally hang with nerds.  I spent a good part of the summer of 1998  hanging with Moby.  Please.  Let me come.  Fantastic.  And I promise I will show your friends  my intellectual side.  Jane, I need you to give me an intellectual side.  So, you want to do a whole Pygmalion thing?  What? No, no, no.  Like a My Fair Lady thing.  See, Dina is seeing me only as a sex object.  And I have to prove to her that I am more than just  oceans of charisma.  I refuse to be objectified.  Make it a little tighter, please.  Don't you want to be with somebody  who respects you for who you are?  Yes, of course!  I just want to present her  with a smarter alternative.  Please, Jane.  Watch the pin!  Okay, Dad, whatever you need.  Ready to shoot?  (gasps)  Jane, I'm sorry.  There's an emergency at work.  I'm gonna have to call you back.  (sighs)  Dad wants to seem smarter,  I guess, for Dina.  Wow.  He must like her a lot.  Yeah.  Are you okay with all of this?  I'm fine.  You should support your dad.  (door opens)  (both laugh)  Don't laugh, don't laugh.  Hey, my eyes are up here. Look me in the eyes.  Oh, I can't. It's just so white!  Oh, oh Oh, mm, okay.  I'm okay.  Uh-huh.  How was your first day?  It was great.  Well, now you look me in the eye.  Okay, well, maybe it wasn't as exciting  as fighting international crime lords.  But I did give a warning  to a guy who was about to take four donuts  from craft service, so (whistles)  - Ooh. - Mm-hmm, how about you?  Did you solve the case of the classified catfisher?  I am a former detective.  I can help you track down the perp.  - Perp's been tracked. - Who is it?  Finally, there you are.  Did you have anything  to do with this ad?  Oh, yes, I did do.  You are so very welcome.  ""Welcome""?  Anezka, what were you thinking?  Oh, you hint for me to do it.  Because Rafael was thinking Jane too perfect.  No, I didn't hint.  Oh, no.  I am so stupid then.  Jane is my friend.  Oh, well, no, she not be such good friend.  She's saying you aren't good mother.  Oh forget it.  I-I causing trouble enough.  What?  Anezka?  What did Jane say?  So, let's review from the top.  The three main topics  of intellectual party conversation are?  Current events,  literature, culture.  - Kardashians? - Mm.  Off limits.  Mmm.  But there's so much to discuss!  Kourtney's going through hell with Scott!  - The - Dad.  Okay, so we've covered The Goldfinch,  the election Last handout.  If they're talking museums, bust out this info  on Marina Abramovic.  Very current, super pretentious.  She just stares at people for hours at a time?  - Mm-hmm. - That's not art.  That's just bad manners.  Good!  That's a legitimate critique!  (grunts twice)  And remember, if you feel like  you're in over your head,  just excuse yourself to go to  the bathroom or get a drink.  Return to a new group and start over.  - Thank you, Jane. - Mm-hmm.  I will learn my lines,  and give a Paloma-worthy performance.  I'm sure you will.  Yes.  So, is Michael liking the new job?  So fun, right?  Oh, yeah, so fun.  Is he not having an excellent time?  He's really grateful to you for the job.  DEREK: And I'm grateful  that you gave me this job. I really am.  But I've got to resign.  Wait, what?  Why?  I've decided to go into the hotel business myself.  In fact  you're gonna give me the Fairwick.  (chuckles)  Wait, is this some kind of joke?  You know what's a joke?  You pretending to be some great long-lost big brother  while at the same time,  you were working with the police to spy on me.  I had to know if you were working with our mother.  Okay, and I, and I understand if you're angry  You understand nothing.  So let me spell it out for you.  You sell me the Fairwick for a dollar,  or I turn you into the Feds  for insider trading.  Wait, what?  My buddy gave you a tip.  You acted on it.  Honestly,  I thought you'd wait longer  to spend the money you made, but, man,  you used it quick.  You set me up.  This place is really gonna be something special.  (door opens, closes)  Hey.  He took a long nap, so he might be fussy  - when you put him down. - Got it.  You okay?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, he's being blackmailed  by his brother, so that's a no.  Yeah.  Yeah, just  an unexpected hurdle with the Fairwick acquisition.  Okay.  Well, whatever it is,  I'm sure you'll figure it out.  And speaking of figuring things out,  Michael was adapting to his new life on set.                I can't wait to cut that line in post.      (grunts)  - Cut! - DIRECTOR: Cut!  Did you see that?  Fake fighting is a carefully  choreographed dance.  To adlib a gesture like that  is to put us both in actual danger.  No kidding.  Plus if you wanted to disarm someone  believably, you'd go for the wrist.  What?  No, I'm just saying technically,  if you wanted to be accurate  Come with me.  And in that moment, Rogelio realized  he could kill two birds with one stone.  Esteben, approach!  Michael happens to be an expert in combat,  And he will now demonstrate how to disarm someone.  This guy? (chuckles)  Hit me with your best shot, pretty boy.  Bird one Build Michael up.  (both grunting)  Bird two torture Esteben.  Bravo! Bravo!  I'm promoting you to personal bodyguard/technical advisor.  From here on out, I want you to monitor all our fights  for authenticity.  And I looked it up online,  and technical advisors make good money.  And it's actually really fun.  I'm so happy you're excited.  Yeah, I really am.  Okay.  Time to become an expert  in 15th century combat.  And so Michael researched.      And Wiki-ed.  Oh.    And googled.  Until he was exhausted.  (exhales)  But satisfied.    How's it going? I think I'm starting to get a handle on it, my lady.  (both grunting)  (phone ringing)  Oh, good, it's Petra.  Hopefully she got her sister to confess.  Hey, Petra.  Did you say I'm a bad mother?  Excuse me?  Apparently you called your grandmother to complain  about how I didn't know my children's nap times  - because I'm not a good mom. - Oh, dear.  No, I didn't use those words.  Well, what words did you use?  Well, look, you're taking it out of context.  I was actually defending you to my grandmother.  So, she was calling me a bad mom?  No! No!  She was just annoyed because she had to change  her work schedule and that's not easy for her.  What are you implying?  - Nothing. - I know all about  hard work, Jane I have a job.  Yeah, well, I did, too, until your sister got me fired!  And maybe it was the heat of the moment  or the fact that Petra finally  had a little family of her own to protect,  but she said  You know what, Jane?  My sister said she didn't place that ad,  and I believe her, so lay off.  (groans, sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Observe Jane steaming  milk at the cappuccino machine.  You can please Anezka extra milk for cappuccino order?  Oh, so foam is all what is necessary  for your cappuccino?  I am not understanding  Oh, I think you are understanding.  So stop with this whole innocent thing!  I am being innocent.  No you aren't. You're a liar!  And I don't know how, but trust me,  I'm gonna prove it!  (crying)  And she just started  crying like I'm some sort of  Ogre! Screaming!  She being cruel and so  Manipulative.  But I'm onto her.  Acting like an innocent child.  It felt like spank hour at orphanage.    No, we're taking the high road here.  If she's not canceling, I'm not canceling.  B-But just  maybe give Jane some space.  But Anezka better stay away from me.  Otherwise, it's on!  ROGELIO: En garde!    (grunts)    Cut!  (bell rings)  What?  Uh is there a problem?  Well, it's just that, traditionally, you wouldn't lock  the longswords like that, because you'd often have  a dagger as well, in your other hand.  So when the longswords are locked,  your opponent could, like, stab you dead.  With the dagger.  That's wonderful.  Thank you, Technical Advisor.  Let's do it again without locking the swords.  But that is the most compelling part of the scene.  It's not about the swords,  it's about my eyes.  Historical accuracy is also semi-important.  We ready here?  Settle and action!  MICHAEL: Cut!  (sword clatters, bell rings)  Just the, uh, the lunge  the lunge felt a little  Can you excuse us for one second?  Michael  The work you're doing is wonderful.  But you cannot yell ""cut"" while we're shooting.  Only the director  and the star can do that.  Right. I just got excited.  I understand.  So how do I communicate to you  if you guys are way off  and it's not believable  Well, that's the thing.  You see, it's a telenovela.  So things don't have to be completely believable.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's an understatement.  Ah!  Oh, my God.  What's the holdup here?  Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.  I have to shoot this,  so I can get out by dinner.  Okay.    And it's already five minutes past  one little boy's bedtime,  isn't it, Mr. Sweetface, isn't it?  Oh, yes. (kissing sounds)  - (phone chimes) - Oh.      Okay, let's say good night to Abuela.  - Oh. - (phone chimes)      What's going on over there?  I-It's Dad.  He wants me to coach him through this party, in person.  I'm-I'm just gonna say no.  Stop. Go.  No, Mom. I feel weird.  Because of me?  Don't. Honestly.  Actually, knowing that he and Dina are both out  makes it easier for me to go record my track at the studio.  No chance of running into them.  Go, hon.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now  Jane, you made it!  Everyone,  meet my brilliant daughter, Jane!  You invited your daughter?  - MAN: Here, ha-have a seat, Jane. - No, wait!  Sit next to me. I need you close.  - Why? - JANE: It's okay.  I'll sit here.  Okay, well  there is perfect.  Just wanted to make sure  you were comfortable.  (phone chimes)  ROGELIO: My daughter is a brilliant student.  -  - She's in graduate school.  WOMAN: My son's at Oxford.  Oh. England. Great  -  - and important country.  Shakespeare and  How do you know Dina?  -  - WOMAN: We were actually  in debate together in college.  Oh, I dabble myself in debate, as well.  -  - I once played a great debater on Tiago.  I owned the Senate floor!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow! He's fast with his fingers!  La mujer de amor   Es un secreto en la noche   La mujer de mi   (reaching for high note):  Alma   (sighs) Let me try again.  Oh, sorry, man.  We're running a little behind.  Do you want to come back in 20 for your ADR?  I'll wait.    La mujer de mi   Alma   (sighs) I'm sorry.  You're just too in your head.  Don't just sing it.  Hmm?  Feel it.  Seduce the microphone.  I'm not with Rogelio anymore,  so flirting with me isn't gonna hurt him.  Oh.  You know what else works to get the note?  You can use the ground to stabilize.  Hmm.  Lie down. Seriously.  You take all the support of the earth  and then you sing up instead of out.  Shakira taught me.  I mean, I'll try.  You're going to feel silly at first.  But just put that aside, okay?  Okay.  La mujer de mi   Alma!   Huh.  Hmm?  Wow.  You're a good coach.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of coaches  Thanks to Jane,  Rogelio had successfully  navigated culture and politics.  It's a clear perversion of the 14th Amendment.  Not at all what our founding fathers meant, you know?  - Exactly. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Even science.  I don't think we can fully comprehend  the profound impact of the Higgs boson particle.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In fact, his knowledge was on fleek, until  Free trade with Cuba is essential.  Just look at the great success  of the Nazi alliance.  Oh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, until Jane failed to see  her phone's misguided autocorrect.  Um, excuse me?  The ""great success""?  No, no!  No. That wasn't a great success.  No. What I meant was    Yes?  Oh, j-just that the,  you know, the Nazi alliance  Jane? What what do I mean?  NATO (clears throat)  The NATO alliance.  So, what? You brought your daughter out  - to do some Cyrano thing? - No.  It was like  Have you seen the movie Roxanne?  It's just  well, you know  I wanted to impress your smart friends.  Because I like you, Dina.  That's why I'm wearing  these ridiculous glasses  and talking about silly things like literature or science.  Well, the whole thing it was stupid.  I know. I agree.  But also  whatever  kind of sweet.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Jane!  Oh, hey.  I-I was just texting you. Looks like you have  the situation under control, so I was gonna head home.  What's wrong?  Nothing, I just  (sighs) Okay.  Well earlier, I felt weird helping you with Dina  because I thought it would upset Mom.  And I didn't want you to think that I was picking sides, so  - Was your mother upset? - No.  No. She's she's okay.  That's the point.  I realized, watching you,  it's not about Mom.  It's about me.  It's that fairytale, right?  Your divorced parents meet, fall back in love  Of course.  That's what makes The Parent Trap such an evocative film.  Exactly.  And don't get me wrong,  I want you to be happy,  and Dina's great.  I just think I need a little more time  before I can be your wingman.  I understand.  Thank you for your help.  I know you're always on my side.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of taking sides    JANE: Okay.  I just want things calm and peaceful.  This is a happy occasion.  Happy and awkward.  No. Not awkward.  We will make it not awkward.  How is it not being awkward? Jane is hating both of us.  Just smile, Anezka.  - (knocking at door) - Even if it's fake.  Like this.  Happy Mother's Day!  I adjusted things a little.  Buffet style.  Oh. Thank you.  And here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, there's no way  - this isn't awkward. - Oh.  Assorted colors. How fun.  So, anyone care for a drink?  Yes. Yes. Okay. Thank you.  - SÃ­, sÃ­, sÃ­. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Me, too!  In fact, I have an idea.  Every time something awkward happens at this brunch,  let's take a sip of our mimosas.  Kids, you have orange juice.  Let's start with an easy one.    Which his brother is now blackmailing him for.  Thanks. It's, uh  Unexpectedly awkward. Drink!  So, how are things with Dina?  Drink!  This feel a little weird to you?  Wait until Father's Day.  Drink!  Breathe, Jane. Breathe!  But the rest of you, drink!  (sighs)  Oh, these two are in a relatively good place.  Maybe we can take a water break.  Ah! Enjoying the most awkward brunch ever?  - (laughs) - Is your brother coming?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Agh! Drink!  I don't think so, no.  Rafael?  What's going on?  I don't know if I should tell you or not.  You should. Definitely.  I made a bad decision.  And now my brother is blackmailing me.  What? How?  I made money off an illegal stock tip.  I didn't know it was illegal.  Derek set me up.  And now he's using it to extort money from me.  Specifically, the Fairwick.  But if you didn't know, then it's not your fault.  I didn't know.  But then, after I knew,  I used it to buy the Fairwick.  I know.  I screwed up.  I thought I was taking care of my family.  What are you going to do?  - I don't know. - (Mateo fusses)  I'm going to to give him a bottle.  It'll be okay.  MICHAEL: I knew it.  I knew Derek was shady.  (giggles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Weird sense of humor, Mateo.  Michael, you can't say anything.  He told me in confidence.  MICHAEL: But the police need to know,  because it could help our investigation  Their investigation.  Just try to see if you can get him  to come forward. If you can.  Your father's calling everyone.  I made a little something  in honor of  my daughter's first official  Mother's Day.  ROGELIO: What made Jane a great mother?  What makes Jane a great mom?  (crying): So many things?  Oh, wow.  Okay, I can't cry right away, right?  The way she always puts family first.      She's got your back,  and she pushes you to be the best version of yourself.  RAFAEL: Jane always sees  the good in people.  The world she lives in,  that's the world I want to live in.  MICHAEL: She's generous.  Resourceful.  ROGELIO: Kind.  XIOMARA: I'm in awe of how she tackles  every problem head-on.  It's inspiring.    MICHAEL: She's fair.  ROGELIO: Jane's a peace-maker.  Always on everyone's side.  She's like Switzerland.  I learned all about Switzerland in my cram session.  (laughs)  MICHAEL: Generous. Thoughtful.  XIOMARA: Smart.    ROGELIO: Patient.    Lists.  RAFAEL: So many lists.  (laughs) ROGELIO: Like, a lot of lists.  What? There's a lot to organize.  But really it's  it's how much she loves.    Love.  MICHAEL: I know it sounds cheesy,  but love.  And superb genes.  So happy first Mother's Day.    My daughter.  -  - (babbling)  (crying): Aw.  (babbling)    Thanks, Dad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (slurring): Here we go again.  Awkward.  It's her Mother's Day too, right?  (burps)  Excuse me.  I drank a little too much.  I am also wanting to say something  about what a wonderful mother I am thinking you are, Petra.  This life  This life  that you have earned for your daughters  after coming from nothing.  And I am just thinking  it is so beautiful  what you have done for them.  And I know how hard it has been.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, that was  legitimately sweet.  And while we're sharing about our moms,  can I just say I have the greatest,  most supportive, bestest mother ever.  Love you, Mama. So much.  Right, well, I think I got to lay down.  Thank you for having us.  And that was a very nice speech.  I'm glad it worked out.  Us together  is everything what I want.  Okay, listen, you said it again.  What?  I know you placed that ad,  and, look, you may have a good reason.  If you could just come clean  Jane, stop.  You're beating a dead horse.  (horse whinnies)  I can't stop because your sister is a liar,  and you are too close to see it.  You just blindly follow what she says like a sheep.  (sheep bleats)  Are you saying my sister's a bad person  and I'm just too close to her to see it?  - I never said that. - You might as well have.  (cat screeches)  Okay, enough, someone take that toy away from him.  Excuse me?  I host your entire family here for lunch, and all you can do  is to continue to hurl insults at my sister.  No, please.  No fighting because of Anezka.  I'm insulting your sister because she's a liar!  Please no!  - She's not! - She is!  She's not!  BOTH: Oh!  (gasping)  I am so sorry about your sister.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait.  What's going on? What did I miss?  Where are we? Oh, wow.  The room is spinning.  I obviously never, ever meant  for anything like this to happen.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is Anezka dead?  It's okay. She's fine.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whew.  Okay.  So why are we at the hospital?  She's epileptic,  so seizures will happen sometimes.  Under extreme stress.  Well, I'm sorry I caused it.  I just I really thought she did it.  And she said she didn't.  And as you can see,  she's an emotionally fragile person,  which is why I didn't push her.  I get it.  Again, I'm so sorry.  NURSE: She'll be okay.  Just keep stress levels down.  Lots of fluids, lots of rest.  Thank you so much.  (crying): I am feeling terrible  for ruining special lunch.  As long as you're okay.  No, I'm not being okay.  I cause everybody so much fighting.  So, you don't have to lie for me anymore, Petra.  What?  Yes, I am the one that post ad.  And Petra, just being good sister,  took cover for me.  - You were lying this whole time? - No.  It's okay now, Petra, I come clean.  I want an e-mail explaining what you did  so I can try and salvage my job.  Yes, of course.  And I have nothing to say to you.  I was so naive  to think that she'd changed.  That we would be one big happy family.  You know what?  Let's stop talking about the evil twins.  And start watching the evil twins.  Amen.  And Mateo can play with his new toys.  (gasp) Yeah, buddy.  Ooh.  While we  get cozy with the remote.  Mm-hmm.    And I'll order ice cream.  - Ooh. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At long last,  pj's, pints  and telenovelas.  Which brings us here, of course.  Look, I'm  I'm sorry I came on so strong with the Tech Advisor thing.  (chuckles) I guess I just got carried away.  Well, your attention to detail,  that's what made you such a terrific detective.  Whereas in telenovelas,  it's more the general idea.  Yeah, I get that.  You will be a detective again, Michael.  I believe in you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends,  that's when it happened.  And action!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In a moment that was  well, straight out of a telenovela, frankly.                    SUZANNA: This is Suzanna Barnett at the Miami PD,  please leave a message. (beep)  I need to talk to you.  Turns out Derek Ruvelle  is totally dirty and I've got proof.  I know the GPS on his boat corroborated his alibi,  but I don't think he was ever on that boat.  Call me back. Please.  Help me finish this case.  Next time, wait for my guests to finish their food  before you dive in.  - Yes, Ms. Petra. - Of course.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Leaping lizards! It's Anezka.  This is exactly what happened in Lagrimas de tu Corazon.  And it really didn't end well.  And then I forwarded the confession,  but Blake is just digging in.  I am officially out of a TA job next semester.  XIOMARA: I'm sorry, honey.  (sighs)  I know.  Did you see Dad's Instagram feed?  -  - Yeah.  It's okay, hun.  Really.  He had to move on.  Can I just say how proud I am of you  for how you've handled this?  I mean,  the old you would've acted out.  I'm trying to change.  Let's talk later, hun.  Okay, bye.  So  Who's better?  Me or Rogelio?  Be honest.  Look, I made a huge mistake.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: How huge was it exactly?  The most huge  or second hugest?  Sorry, I shouldn't joke.  This is serious stuff.  So Derek's blackmailing you?  I overheard Jane telling Michael at the lunch.  What were you thinking?  I wasn't.  I was drunk when I bought the stock.  No, not that.  Going to Jane for advice.  Go to Jane for help looking for  a new book club selection,  or finding a deal on diapers.  When it comes to financial crimes,  and blackmail,  come to me.  Buy a few days with Derek,  while we come up with a plan.  We can outsmart him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, perhaps,  they could outsmart him.  Darling, enough already with those ridiculous scarves.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Her, on the other hand,  slightly more difficult.  So, everything's moving forward.  We'll have the Fairwick by the end of the week.  Happy Mother's Day.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now that's a boat."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, let's go! As you know, Jane and Michael  were about to get married. And the wedding  was going to be in Jane's house. Only, it flooded!  So Rogelio rebuilt their house on the soundstage  of his telenovela. What a dad, right?  Unfortunately, things weren't as hunky-dory  for Jane and Petra.  See, Petra's twin Anezka showed up and started  causing trouble for Jane. And Petra lied to protect her  My sister said she didn't place that ad and I believe her.  Leaving Jane reeling.  You don't have to lie for me anymore, Petra.  I have nothing to say to you.  Oh, and speaking of shady relatives, Rafael's mom  was the crime lord known as Mutter.  Oh, and his long-lost brother Derek showed up  and tricked Rafael into making money off an insider trade.  And now he was blackmailing him  for control of the hotel next door.  You sell me the Fairwick for a dollar  or I turn you in to the feds for insider trading.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! Cray-cray, right?  Anyway, Jane told Michael, and Michael wanted to help,  only he'd lost his detective job.  So he reached out to his old partner, Susanna.  Derek Ruvelle is totally dirty, and I've got proof.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And Michael was right! Because this happened.  We'll have the Fairwick by the end of the week.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which, friends,  is where we left off.  Jane Gloriana Villanueva  would never forget the moment she first saw him.  The man who was destined to become  her son's favorite children's party entertainer.  -  - This guy is amazing.  I know. Bobby's the best.  What's his last name? We were thinking about  booking him for Mateo's birthday.  No last name. He's like BeyoncÃ©.  Well, how do you get in touch with him? Bella's obsessed, too.  Talk to him here. Bobby books out months in advance.  When are Mateo and Bella's birthdays?  May 14. May 14.  Oh so, were you thinking about booking him?  Nah. I I'm actually  thinking a magician or a clown might be better.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that Jane believed in fighting fair.  - Oh! Oh, hell, no. - Jane, go!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But she also believed in fighting back.  Hey, Vanessa, is that Brandi going towards  - the parking lot? - Oopsies!  Bobby, big fan of your work.  I'd like to reserve your services  for Saturday, May 14, and I can  pay you the deposit today. Thank you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Can you blame her? A kid's  first birthday is a pretty big deal.  Which brings us here, now.    Okay, Abuela, you're on balloons. Mom, food.  I got his outfit, Michael,  you're assembling party favors, and  - remember to - Put it in Mateo's  birthday pile and not the wedding pile.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, right. Jane has two  big parties coming up.  -  - Right, Mom, wedding  I need you to update the RSVPs.  Michael, did you make sure that your groomsmen  - have suits? - I did.  - They do. - Okay. Good.  - I feel good. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  Waiting for that ball to drop.  - (phone buzzes) - Oh, shoot.  E-mail from Professor Donaldson.  Feedback for my novella.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here we go.  She likes it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What?  She says, and I quote, ""Really good.  ""This is approved to develop into your thesis  next year. Will discuss a few last-minute tweaks in person.""      Oh, really?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: If Jane seems less than enthusiastic, it's because  this is not the first time Alba has offered to introduce her  to someone who ""works in publishing.""  So, y-you work in publishing?  Kind of. I work at Barnes & Noble.  Your grandmother says that you're very talented.  If you ever get something published,  I will put it right up front.  Your grandmother says you're very talented.  If you ever make it out to Belfast, I do hope  you'll stop by the library to pay me a visit.  - Your granny said - I'm really talented,  yeah, I know. And you're an award-winning author?  Yuppers. My Full House fan fiction was voted top ten  in the '90s Sitcom category.  And now everything I wrote  has come true.    Beverly Flores, Vice President.  Simon & Schuster?  Abuela, are you kidding me? She works in publishing?    And she said that she'd read my material?    Oh, my God. I can't believe this.  Do you have any idea what this means?    (squeals, laughs)     I hate to break up the celebration, but I got to go.  - I got the thing. - JANE: Right.  - Okay. Thank you, thank you. - Good luck. (kisses)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What thing?  Good luck with what? Oh, come on.  Jane? Did you see this?  From Petra?  What?  You're not coming to my wedding?  Of course not.  Are you serious?  We're in a fight.  Exactly.  When two people are in a fight  and one person is so clearly wrong, like you are,  the person who is so clearly wrong apologizes.  - I'm sorry. - Profusely.  Really, really sorry.  I am.  Honestly.  Why did you lie to me about your sister?  With the whole Mother's Day thing, I was feeling  a little inadequate compared to you.  And, uh  I just didn't want you to be right all the time.  It's not a competition.  Sometimes it can feel like one.  I get that.  Okay.  Now is the moment that you ask if there's anything  that you can do to make things better.  Yes, yes.  What can I do to make it better?  You can keep your sister away from me.  Maybe I could transfer her  out of the restaurant to housekeeping?  Good idea.  Now, I'd like you to reconsider coming to my wedding.  Because you're my son's half-sisters' mother,  which makes us family.  And family shows up.  MICHAEL: It's a family operation, it has to be.  Derek is working for his mother.  He was never on that boat when he said he was, I know it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. Haven't seen her in a while.      I'm not on the force.  I can't get a warrant, but you can.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh. Maybe this is what Jane was wishing him luck with.  We need his cell phone records, e-mails.  - Michael. - I  I took a leave of absence to get away from this case.  What happened the night Sin Rostro died  it was traumatic.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah. No kidding.  (grunting)  (gunshot)  I know. But believe me, I wouldn't  be asking if there was another way.  I'll think about it.  DEREK: You've thought about it long enough.  Time's up. I want my hotel.  Unless you prefer jail?  No.  Good choice.  But I can't just hand over  a multimillion dollar property.  Okay? There's paperwork,  and I need a story to tell my accountants.  You have 48 hours.  (ticking)  (knocking)  Come in.  Hey!  How's my almost-birthday boy?  (kisses) He's good, he's fighting a little cold.  Hey, anything left on your list for the party?  Nope. All set. And you  how are you?  Did you, uh, decide what you're gonna do about the  (whispers): Derek thing?  Um, not yet.  Look I talked to Michael about it.  He wants to help, and he said that  Derek is the one the police want.  PETRA: It's much more complicated than that.  You don't think that he should turn himself in?  He got the money illegally, he used that money.  Yeah, and he'll get a great lawyer.  And he could still wind up in jail. Look, I have a plan.  A plan? Are you serious? This is Rafael's future.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll point out now that this isn't a competition.  I'm gonna talk to my lawyer  and see what my options are.  I think that's a great idea.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And I'll also point out  -  - Jane won.  Yet again.  MARLENE: So you're on the right track.  -  - Oh.  I've got just a few small notes,  - then you're good to go. - Great.  Because a pretty big opportunity just fell in my lap.  - Yeah? - A VP at Simon & Schuster  agreed to read my work.  - What? - (giggles)  You can't submit this to a publisher.  But you just said it was in great shape.  For a graduate thesis, not for a publisher.  You only get one shot with someone like that.  I just really don't think you should use it  when the work isn't ready.  ROGELIO: Ready to go to work?  Welcome, production personnel, to this  very special production meeting.  With Dina away, I am thrilled  to be your leader today.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. Guess they don't applaud at production meetings.  All right, now, to the first order of business  the Telemasivo Sexiest Telenovela Star Alive  Twitter poll. You should all have  voting guides.  Vote early and as often as you'd like.  -  - With your unwavering support  I will vanquish Esteban  for the second year in a row.  - Okay, moving on. - (clears throat) Um, the, uh,  crew and I have a matter that we'd like to address.  Of course, anything you need.  I am here to lead.  Our days are too long and our pay is too low.  Oh, you're gonna have to ask someone else about that. I don't  We want to unionize, but the network refused, so  - we plan to strike. - Strike?  But Tiago is a big happy family.  Where does these radical notions come from?                    BOTH: SÃ­, se puede,  sÃ­, se puede.  ALL: SÃ­, se puede, sÃ­, se puede!  Picket lines go up next Friday.  What? No. Not next Friday.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What's next Friday?  JANE: Ma,  I know Professor Donaldson hates me, but this didn't  - feel personal. - (distant talking)  Oh, let me call you back, I'm at the studio.  Dad wants to walk me through the wedding layout.  - (indistinct conversations) - Dad, what's going on?  This is madness. The crew's going to strike.  - They want to join a union. - They're not in a union?  That's terrible, with the crazy hours they work?  I know, but  Dad, tell me that you are supporting them.  This is important. I mean, fair is fair.  Exactly.  Thank you, Jane.  Did everyone hear that?  Jane is on our side. Uh, fair is fair.  ALL (chanting): Fair is fair!  - You don't understand! - (chanting continues)  The picket lines go up Friday. Next Friday.  - As in the day before my wedding? - Yes!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No!  Oh, we can't cross a picket line for my wedding!  Strike! Strike! Strike! Your wedding is ruined.  Ruined! Ruined! Ruined!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm, I'm not sure who's freaking out more  Jane or Rogelio.  I'm having chest pains!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Just kidding. It's Rogelio.  I know, Dad. I know!  Okay, I'll have to come up with a contingency plan.  Agreed.  I will plant drugs on Jerry and have him arrested!  Stop. They have a valid cause.  So you need to approach them with compassion.  Oh, I see. So you want me to go full Ro-Cho.    Well full Ro-Cho.  And maybe also find a way to address their concerns  so that they don't have to strike.  And in case that doesn't work, I'll try  to figure something out for the wedding.  Maybe a new venue?  No, but you really wanted to get married in your house,  and I worked so hard building that set.  The crew worked so hard building that set.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hence the need for a strike.  So maybe we move the wedding?  Until after the strike? That could take months.  No, no, I'm not pushing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Thank God.  I'd rather move it sooner.  Maybe next week before they vote, so, Thursday.  As a last resort?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of huge bummers  So, my lawyer said they could go easy on me,  or they could want to make an example out of someone like me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Rich, entitled, son of a crime lord.  That's exactly what I'm worried about.  Look, I want to believe that everything will work out okay  if you're a good person and you click your heels and wish  on a star, but unfortunately, I just don't think that's true.  And neither does Jane.  Please, just hear my idea.  Raf, you know I have no ulterior motive except that I love you.  As the father of my children.  As my family.  Krishna, hold my calls, please.  JANE: Ma,  any luck with the dress? I'm still on hold.      Tuesday. They can do a fitting on Tuesday.  Okay, hold it, and, Abuela, keep Thursday at 5:00 for Mass.  Okay, Lina's good to go,  and she's telling our friends to be prepared.  I left messages for both my parents,  just got off the phone with the tailor.  If I'm there in 20 minutes, they can fit me today.  So what are you still doing standing there?! Go! Go! Go! Go!  Wait! Is my phone done charging?  Yes, and you got a bunch of missed calls.  Oh.  - Mwah. - Mwah.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The Bobby? BeyoncÃ© Bobby?  Jane! It's Bobby.  Listen, bit of a snafu here.  I double-booked for Saturday.  Call me ASAP to confirm Mateo's party.  - Oh, no. Oh, no. - (phone chimes)  Bobby again. Still waiting to hear from you.  - Ugh! - (phone chimes)  Listen, the other person called back,  and I haven't heard from you, so I have to cancel.  No! Ugh!  ROGELIO: I am confident we can find a solution.  And I hope you love the gift basket.    You really thought  a gift basket would make me abandon my principles?  Of course not?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He definitely did.  It's a gesture of solidarity.  Oh, yeah? So there's a raise  and humane hours under the beef jerky?  Oh, come on, Jerry.  I called the head honchos and left word.  Please don't strike. It'll be disastrous  for everyone involved with the show.  That's what you're worried about?  Of course?  Has nothing to do with the fact that we just built  a set for Jane's wedding, and it's next week?  Okay, fine! Yes, but it's not only for Jane.  Anyone's daughter can use it, even yours!  My oldest daughter is 15 years old, Rogelio.  Look, it's not about that.  You have no clue what this crew goes through every day.  Then clue me in.  Let me walk in your shoes!  What?  I will join your crew for the week.  (laughs) You wouldn't last a day.  Would you care to wager on that?  What do you have in mind?  If I last the week as a crew member,  you will postpone the strike until after Jane's wedding.  Okay. If you don't,  you become the public face of our strike. Deal?  De  ear God, the calluses!  Can I recommend a paraffin treatment, which ?  Sorry. I mean deal.  - (clown laughing, Mateo crying) - Oh. Sweetie.  - I know. I know. He's creepy. - (clown horns honk)  Oh. This is a disaster.  I ruined Mateo's birthday because  I was consumed by my wedding, and now  the only entertainers available are  (quietly): terrifying clowns or porny clowns!  What am I gonna do?!    What?!    No. It's his first birthday.      Abuela, stop. He deserves a birthday party.    He's having one, end of story.  XIOMARA: Okay, good news.  The Din-o-mites are available Saturday.  Yes! And they're apparently performing at Flamingo Park  tomorrow if you and Mateo want to go check them out.  Oh, no need. Mateo's already seen them  at his friend Ava's birthday.  Book 'em. We're in. Let me update Rafael.  Sorry, he's been in a closed-door meeting with Petra  forever.  With Petra? An-Any idea what it's about?  Nope. Closed door, so  Right. Okay.  Thanks, Krishna.  Can you watch Mateo? I'll be right back. Mm.    Wait. What's going on? Where are you going?  To make sure Petra doesn't  corrupt Rafael's soul.  Huh. Jane. What a surprise.  Well, I suppose you have a good reason for barging in here.  After a run, apparently.  Birthday party crisis.  Bobby canceled.  BeyoncÃ© Bobby?  Oh, no. Do we have a backup?  Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah.  My mom found this other group, the Din-o-mites.  PETRA: Doesn't sound like  much of a crisis, then, right?  Certainly not a valid reason to disrupt  a closed-door meeting. (laughs)  No, but I did want to ask Rafael  if he wanted to join Mateo and me  to see the Din-o-mites tomorrow.  You know, just so that he got comfortable with them  and, uh and didn't freak out at the party.  RAFAEL: Yeah.  Yeah, sure, I'll-I'll be there.  That's it, then?  No more urgent birthday party business?  No, that's it.  Tomorrow.  It's fine, I'll talk to him tomorrow.  Petra won't be there to lure him to the dark side.  Use the force, Jane.  Exactly, I will!  And I'm going to convince him  to turn himself in and work with the police.  - Good. That's what he should do. - Agreed.  He won't have to go to jail, right?  Positioning himself as someone who can help find a connection  between Derek and Mutter is his best bet.  Even though the blackmail's not necessarily connected to her?  But it is, it has to be.  It just doesn't make sense.  Why would Derek blackmail Rafael for a hotel?  Instead of for cash. Yeah, that is weird.  Exactly.  Hey, does this make me, like, your new partner?  (laughs)  Yeah, something like that.  (both laugh, ringtone plays)  Oh.  Susanna.  Oh, take it. Tell her I've been covering for her,  - so it's all good. - Okay.  SUSANNA: Okay.  MICHAEL: You're gonna help me?  I want Mutter caught, too.  So I got the case files.  Tech decoded that flash drive  with the criminals whose faces were changed  by Mutter and Sin Rostro,  - all 200 of 'em. - MICHAEL: Great.  That's that's great.  Yeah, and at a million bucks a pop.  That's $200 million unaccounted for.  I'll send you the names.  Look for any connection to Derek.  (footfalls approaching)  Jane? Oh, that face.  You are even more adorable in person.  - Wait. Do we ? - Oh, sorry, sorry.  Your grandmother showed me so many pictures. Beverly Flores.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Simon & Schuster Beverly Flores?  Yes! Yes. Hi.  - Hi. - Hi.  Such a pleasure to meet you.  - And you. - Oh.  Honestly, I don't read new writers,  but your Abuela is such a hoot.  She promised to pray for me every night if I read your work.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The work which  Professor Donaldson said was just good?  And your Abuela says it's just great.  (sighs) Michael.  Oh, wow, you're so much taller than I thought.  Oh. (laughs)  Okay, I will leave you two lovebirds alone.  I'll be looking for you in my inbox, Jane.  Waiting to be wowed.  Terrific. Thank thank you. Thank you so much.  (sighs) Alba's publishing friend?  Oh. What do I do?  Professor Donaldson says I shouldn't send it yet,  but she does hate romance.  - Do you think it's ready? - I don't know.  Will you read it?  Of course. I'm dying to.  But I need you to give me an honest opinion.  ROGELIO: Honestly?  These shorts are amazing!  It's like a purse, but in pants form. So many pockets.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like Rogelio is enjoying his new job.  And I can display my calves,  which are the best part of my lower legs.  Okay. Well, you're an electric today, so  finish wrapping up that cable, put it over there.  Wrap it in  like newspaper?  Pick it up, wind it up, put it over there.  Consider it wrapped. Wow.  I got to get all the lingo down. Hmm.  (sighs)  Oh, boy, it's heavier than I thought.  When you face a scary challenge   As soon as they take a break, I am tackling that stegosaurus  and triple-confirming they're free tomorrow.  Yes! Go, Team Mateo!  Yay!  (babbles) Yes! Yes.  Hey, so, listen, I wanted to talk to you  about the Derek, um, situation.  PETRA: Oh, there you are!  Petra.  Why are you here?  I know how competitive the baby birthday party market can be,  so  I wanted to check out these, um,  dragon whatevers for Anna and Elsa.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Translation: she didn't want Jane  to be alone with Rafael.  - They're dinosaurs, not dragons. - Same thing.  Only not really. One existed.  The other is a fictitious monster that breathes fire.  Well, they certainly look similar.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Something tells me this argument  is about more than dragons versus dinosaurs.  And they weren't the only ones having a tough day.  MAN: Rogelio, over here.  (sighs, fabric tearing)  (sighs)  Finished, boss.  - Really? - Uh-huh.  Ran all the cable?  ROGELIO: Uh-huh.  Okay.  Hit the lights.  (chuckling)  I work out with a trainer three times a week,  but I never knew true physical exertion until today.    (gasps) Have you guys considered  releasing a grip-electric workout DVD?  - You'd make a fortune! - De la Vega,  go to the truck, get some sandbags.  Got it, boss! Great for the glutes.  - It's time we kick things up a notch. - Agreed.  Let's make a little schedule change.  What is going on here?  This is lit for my good side, not my great side!  ROGELIO: What does that mean,  Jerry? It means we relight  the whole damn thing.  All that work you did this morning,  you have to do it again.  Hey! No, no, no!  Too late. I already got a great shot.  Don't you dare tweet that.  - (bird chirps) - (gasps)    All's fair in the battle for Sexiest Telenovela Star.  How you holding up?  Well, I am filled with rage, Jerry.  Which I will channel into my cable duties.  Really? Crashing a kids' festival?  I'm here for the same reason you're here.  To find a musical act for my son's birthday.  Oh, please.  You're trying to convince Rafael that you know best.  I'm trying to stop him from doing something dangerous  and stupid.  Good. 'Cause my plan is smart.  (scoffs)  You haven't even heard it.  Fine, Petra, tell me the plan.  No, you don't go on a picnic with a T. Rex   If you do, I guarantee you're gonna be vexed   You can fill up your basket   With fruits and treats and sweets   But once that T. Rex sees ya   You'll be just his kind of meat   Yum, yum, yum, delicious   That's insane!  - It won't work. - RAFAEL: Really?  You guys aren't done arguing yet?  (overlapping arguing)  Stop,  please.  Look, I thought about it,  and  I'm gonna go with Petra's idea.  (Mateo babbling)  Okay. All right. All right, Mateo. (sighs)  You know, it might not be a competition.  But I must say, it feels good to finally win.  -  Yum, yum, yum, delicious.  - (clapping)  Beautiful.  So much hair and not a single nit.  Yes, well, shampoo.  Can I just say  I liking that Rafael listened to you.  Me, too. This way, he has a chance to get out of this mess.  No. Because I think he is starting to love you again.  What?  No.  Yes.  This is something I have been seeing.  The way he is looking at you  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh.  It would seem Petra is warming to this idea.  - (Mateo coughing over speaker) - Aw. Mateo's a little warm, poor thing.  I gave him some Tylenol and put on a humidifier.  Michael?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh. That is cold, Michael.  (coughing continues)  (coughs loudly) Sorry.    Oh, my God, I'm  I fell asleep. I'm so sorry.  No worries. Totally get it.  It's, uh, late. Ish.  For Mateo. Jane,  it's not the writing.  That's great.  But, you know, romance, it's just  it's not my thing.  Sure. Although you did stay up all night  reading Angelique Harper. And I think  your exact words were ""I couldn't put it down.""  I promised you that I'd be brutally honest.  It's not as good as Angelique Harper.  But how could it be? It's your first one.  I'm sure it took Angelique a few tries to become  Angelique, right?  Right.  - (coughing continues) - Yeah.  (sighs heavily)  MAN: Everybody up!  Up!  - Federal Bureau of Investigation. - Hands off  - your computer, sir. - Put your hands up.  - What the hell? - We have a warrant.  Start with the computers.  Why'd you do this?  - I didn't. - Let's go,  Mr. Solano.  Petra, call my lawyer now!  - (Mateo coughing) - MICHAEL: He feeling any better?  Poor guy.  I know.  - What'd your mom say? - Well,  if we move the wedding to Thursday,  she'll miss the actual ceremony.  You're kidding.  Her boss has this huge deposition that day.  It was supposed to be Friday, but they already moved it so she could make  the rehearsal dinner.  We can't get married without your mom.  My dad has to come through.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, fortunately, he was.  Okay. What's next, boss?  I just need you to change out one last lightbulb.  Terrific. Changing out a lightbulb, a job so easy  there's a series of jokes about how easy it is.  (chuckles) Up there.  At this point, I'll remind you that Rogelio  has a debilitating fear of heights.  And leprechauns. But that's less pertinent.    Are you all right?  Raf, you were gone for hours.  (elevator bell dings)  (sighs)  It went great.  Derek definitely bought it. I saw him  pacing the halls, looking completely freaked out.  He'll confront you, you'll get him to confess to bribing you,  end of story.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's right. The whole FBI raid was a setup!  (elevator bell dings)  Those are some great poker faces.  Rogelio's, not so much.  JERRY: It's time to say uncle, Rogelio!  There's no shame in it, man.  Come on. Let's get you down.  I can't.  Rogelio, come on!  I mean  I really can't.  - (coughing, crying) - Okay, Mr. Sweetface.  I know. Maybe we should call the pediatrician.  - What do you think? Oh, baby. - (phone rings)  Hello? Hi, Jerry. What's going on?  (drilling)  You heard me.  What's going on?  It wasn't me. Why would I call the feds?  I don't get the hotel if they freeze your assets.  What's in it for me?  You tell me. We had a deal.  I know. You give me the  - (loud drilling) - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Shoot! I can't  make that out! What's he saying?  Uh-oh. I'm guessing the recorder  didn't pick it up either.  (drilling stops)  So you're telling me it's not your fault.  That's what I said.  Because of our deal.  I give you the hotel, you don't turn me in.  What?  Well, is that what you're saying?  Where's the recorder?  Or I call  the police.  Nine one  Fine.  (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  JERRY: He won't budge.      It's been  two hours.  Can you keep an eye on Mateo? He's sleeping.  Okay. I'm going up.  (exhales)  - (groans) - (whimpers)  (sighs)  They asked me to change a lightbulb,  but I just can't do it. And I know  what you're gonna say, that it doesn't matter,  - that you love me - Wrong.  - You're doing it. - What?!  Otherwise, Michael's mom can't come to the wedding.  So stop being a baby, walk this catwalk,  and change that freaking lightbulb!  SÃ­ se puede.  SÃ­   Oh.  (grunts, panting)  No way he makes it.  SÃ­ se puede.  Okay, I just  (grunts)  (panting)      (laughs)        He's been coughing a lot, kind of wheezing. (coughing)  (sighs)  - (coughing continues) - Oh, baby,  you're really warm.  You know what, I'm gonna call the doctor.  (crying)  Uh, what you did up there, for your daughter,  um, I'm impressed.  I know that was hard for you.  So I'll make due on my promise,  and, uh, we'll hold off on the strike.  - Thank you, Jerry. - Sure.  Oh. Huh.  Dad, I just got off the phone with the doctor.  He said that I should bring Mateo into the E.R.  (coughing)  You did the right thing bringing him in.  With the high fever and wheezing, we need to do  a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia.  And we're gonna need to do some blood work  to rule out bacterial infection.  Who wants to hold him down?  What? While I draw blood.  (sighs)  Uh, me. Me. I'll do it.  - Shh - DOCTOR: Hold tight. No jerking.  (Mateo screaming)    He's okay.  They ruled out serious  infection, it's not pneumonia.  Oh, thank God.    But they do want to keep him  overnight, watch his breathing,  make sure he's hydrated.  - We'll all stay. - No, no, no, no.  You guys go.  Seriously, it's a tiny room.  Rafael and I have it.  Are you sure?  - Mm-hmm. - Okay.  All right, let's go, guys.  - I love you. - I love you, too.  He still asleep?  Out like a light.  Hey, you okay?  I'm just angry at myself.  I should have called the doctor earlier.  Hey, come on.  He got worse quickly.  Yeah, he was sick, I took him out.  It was so stupid.  Yeah, well  we all do stupid things.  Petra's plan didn't work.  Derek caught on.  Oh, no.  I signed over The Fairwick.  Then so  what now? You just hope that Derek  never brings it up again?  Well, he got what he wanted.  But when does it end?  I mean, what if he wants something else?  The guy is bad news, and I care about you, I  I just I just hope this is the end of it.  (phones beep)  Oh, my God.  He's officially one.  I can't believe it.  (both laugh)  (sighs)  What?  His party.  Oh, my God,  we have to cancel Mateo's party.    Oh, hello,  dear network executives.  What are you doing here at this late hour?  Those two are in charge of replacing our crew  when we fire everyone on Friday.  Wait, what?  Before they strike.  Why not just listen to their concerns?  Because we don't have to. We can do the show  without them.  By the way, congrats, you won  Sexiest Telenovela Star.  Two years running.  Okay, tracked down curly fries.  I love you.  Thank you.  I officially canceled Mateo's birthday,  which I probably should have done a few days ago.  What do you mean?  I was overwhelmed, there was so much going on,  and my grandma pointed out  it wasn't so much for him as it was for us.  Yeah, so what if it was for us?  I mean, we got him through a whole year.  Don't we deserve to celebrate that?  Yeah, we do.  I can't believe it's been  a year.  It feels like just yesterday.  Show me   Who I am and who I could be   When he was just a peach.  Initiate   The fetus is around three inches long right now,  about the size of a peach.  Properly   And then seeing him for the first time.  And I'll run the risk   He's beautiful.  Of being intimate with brokenness   He's crawling!  Through this magnifying glass   Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, Mateo, you're cruising!  (laughs)  (laughing): And when you first saw Bobby,  and you nearly clobbered that other mom.  Of being intimate with brokenness   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, right, this was just  before Michael returned.  Do you see that?  We need him.  Ugh, it's so extravagant.  When she and Rafael were  just about to get back together.  Come on, Mateo only turns one once.  Just find out how to get in touch with Bobby.  - Huh? - (gasps)  A thousand fingerprints   It's true.  A lot changes in a year.  We did it.  (sighing): Yeah, we did.  Who I am   (sniffles)  And a lot doesn't.  XIOMARA: Knock, knock.  Since you decided to cancel the party,  we decided to bring the party here.  (chuckling): Oh.  Hi.  (chuckling): You guys are so sweet,  I just wish that you had texted  'cause we're getting discharged any minute.    I had the art department  make this.  I paid them this time, don't worry.  Mateo will think he had  a party to rival North West's.  Oh.  Oh, and he's wearing  his special birthday outfit.  Oh, that is so  cute and weird.  Thank you.  CumpleaÃ±os   Feliz   CumpleaÃ±os feliz   CumpleaÃ±os, Mateo   CumpleaÃ±os feliz.   Hey, look.  ROGELIO: Hey. We take a picture for his book.  But, find his light first.    (laughing)  So, listen.  Huh?  I have some bad news.  I know you wanted your wedding  on Saturday, but I have to join  the picket line on Friday.  But you changed the lightbulb.  They were gonna walk out on Sunday.  Telemasivo executives plan to replace them before that,  and I can't let that happen.  I get that.  I'll just find another venue so that Michael's mom can come.  Oh, no, I figured that part out.  Kenny,  our second AC,  has a sister who flies helicopters,  so for just $3,500,  she will pick up Michael's mother  after her deposition and deliver her to church  with time to spare.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted,  that this was just this type of crazy spending  that Jane had been trying to curb.  What the heck? This is my wedding, fly her in.  Oh, stop, you don't have to read it.  Just go back to Derek's case.  No, I'm reading your book.  Yeah,  okay, but I decided, I could do better.  You know, I mean,  I've changed so much this past year, and that?  That's like a  first pancake, you know?  A little off. I want to give Beverly the second pancake,  which I told her in non-pancake terms.  - What'd she say? - Oh, that  she'll look for it in the future. We'll see.  I just  (clicks tongue)  I want to dig deeper.  What?  Dig deeper, in my writing.  Dig deeper.  I will.  No, what if there  is something underneath the Fairwick.  What if they dug tunnels  tunnels that are connected to the Marbella,  tunnels that were filled in,  when we found the plastic surgery suites.  Maybe that's why this hotel is so important.  Maybe this is where the missing money is.  Think about it, why else would Mutter need the Fairwick?  That's got to be where she stashed the money.  SUSANNA: Cordero, we don't have a warrant.  You don't think Derek could take 200 million bucks and flee?  Exigent circumstances.  No warrant needed.  Meet me there.    Hello?  Is anyone here?  (metal banging)  What the ?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is it the money?  Wait, no, it's     Don't worry.  I left her in the Fairwick, and I'm in the air  with the money.  (knocking on door)  JANE: It's open!  Oh, uh  I thought you were Rafael.  I'm here to apologize  profusely.  (laughs)  For, um  for snapping at you at the park.  That was not  Din-o-mite?  Kind of me.  I know  it's not a competition.  Yeah, well  I'm starting to think it is, actually.  Excuse me?  And I do hope Rafael comes  to me for advice more.  - What?! - Because  I won't tell him to do  crazy things like staging a fake FBI raid.  Well, I was trying something at least.  The wrong thing.  Oh, will you stop already?  There is no right or wrong,  - Jane. - That is not true.  So, you think it's right for him to go to jail?  Look, you're an optimist, that's all,  and I'm a realist, and I'm getting tired of you  assuming that you're the better person.  Which brings us here, now.  How's it going, Petra?  Perfectly, really.  I think Rafael has feelings for me again.  He can see I'm the person for him, not Jane.  Very funny.  (laughs)  Well, I wanting to be sounding like beautiful sister.  Did it work?  Yes.  Well done, Anezka.  Wig is not perfect, but I do better next time.  I can see what  Petra seeing in him, actually.  He-he is  being very charming.  You stay away from that man.  Don't worry.  I won't mess up plan  we have spent whole year working on.  Wow.  Has it been year already?  Time flies."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, here we are. After the mother of all love triangles,  Jane finally chose Michael. And the wedding was supposed to be  in the Villanueva house, only it flooded.  So Rogelio rebuilt the house  on the soundstage of his telenovela.  Sweet, right? Not as sweet:  Xiomara slept with Rogelio's nemesis, Esteban.  Look, I-I made a huge mistake.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And poor Rafael. You see, he lost Jane.  Oh, and his mom turned out to be a crime lord.  And his stepmother Rose is one too.  Or, she was. Yup. That's Raf's sister Luisa.  And, well, Rose was the love of her life.  Until she met Michael's partner Susanna.  You need to go back to rehab.  So that when you're out I can take you out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of complicated love lives,  Rafael's other baby mama, Petra,  still has feelings for him.  And her long-lost twin Anezka was encouraging her.  I think he is starting to love you again.  Oh, and Anezka is also epileptic. And honestly,  there are a million other things happening.  But we have a wedding to get to already,  so let's go!  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was a young girl  there was one story she loved to be told  over and over again.  Go on.    JANE: The same veil  that your mother wore?  Your shoe!  [crack.] [people gasp.]  [indistinct chatter.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To young Jane,  it was the greatest love story ever told.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that day  is tomorrow!  We we should stop.  [sighs heavily.]  One more day.  Just one more day.  35 hours, 17 minutes, but who's counting?  Seriously. I can't wait  For all the sex? Yeah, I get that.  To marry you.  [sighing.]: Oh.  [wedding bells ringing.]  [sighs.] â­Do we really have to go out there?  One more day.  Just one more day.  Yes, Charo, playing when Mateo comes down the aisle.  I have to go. Florist on line two.  Jane, Michael, I have  a hundred things to run by you! No!  I can't be at the church early.  Everyone knows that it's customary  for the father of the bride to drive the bride  to the ceremony. Hello, are you awake?  - Hello? Wake up! Hello?! - Dad, stop, stop.  You can't talk like that to the florist!  Oh, it's fine.  She and I, we like to banter  a little. Anyway,  you're just in time  for Mateo's practice session.  Because, after all, we cannot have a ring bearer cry  - in the middle of the ceremony. - Mateo will be fine.  And you need to take a few deep breaths, okay?  I'm sorry. I'm just so happy  that the wedding is finally here.  Go for Rogelio.  I really, really can't wait for our honeymoon.  Oh, my God.  What?  I forgot to change the reservation  - after the wedding moved up. - What?  - I reminded you. - I meant to,  but it's just been a crazy week, starting the job again.  Yeah, I get that. Of course, it's been a really crazy week  for me too, trying to change my thesis. And I still  was able to call everyone personally  and explain to them why we moved the wedding,  and I rebooked people's hotels, and I cancelled  - the rehearsal dinner. - I know, and I'm gonna fix this.  We're gonna have somewhere to stay on our wedding night  that is not here, with my family,  at Rafael's hotel?  Yes. Absolutely.  Great.  RAFAEL: Sounds great.  Okay, I'll see you soon.  Your sister?  You had your Luisa voice.  Yeah.  She is on her way.  Hopefully in good shape, 'cause I could really use  a break from family drama right now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. You'll recall Rafael's family drama  had recently taken a turn for the bonkers,  even by Solano family standards.  - How do you feel? - Well, I'm glad  my mother's in jail.  Now I just want them to find my brother.  Yeah.  But I asked how do you feel?  Not great.  It's all a little much sometimes, you know?  It's Jane.  I'm sorry, I got to go, it's urgent.  Are you okay, is everything okay?  Yes, yes, you just have to see this!  Raf's here, Mom put him down.  Okay, are you watching, are you ready?  - Yes. For what? â­ - Mateo,  come here. Show Daddy.  Come here.  â­RAFAEL: Oh, my God, he's walking! He's  - Can you believe it? - No, I can't bel  - This is amazing! - I know, I know. He just  He was pushing the wagon, and then he let go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Behold,  the most amazing and coordinated boy  in human history.  And just in time to walk down the aisle.  [sighs.] Okay, I got to run. I just wanted you to see that.  No, no, thank you for texting. Where are you going, by the way?  To meet with my advisor. I'm trying to change my thesis.  The one you were trying to get approved forever?  Yeah. I-I just realized that my heart is not in it.  But, you know, it may be too late to make a change.  Unless somebody else tells me that they loved me.  - Wait, what? - I said unless my professor okays it.  Okay.  Bye, Mr. Sweetface.  My little walker.  Oh, the places you'll go. [Giggling.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of big milestones.  Congratulations. Glad you're back on the force.  Thank you, sir. Oh, hey,  did you ever find out who leaked the details  about the Sin Rostro investigation to the press?  We're working on that.  Now go. Enjoy your wedding.  It's got to be him. He's the only one  who had access to all the information.  [horn honking.]  So you you're still together?  I know, it's weird.  Actually, I was wondering  if she could be my plus one to your wedding.  Oh. I mean Uh Forget it.  It's weird. â­Uh, well, let me just  I'll ask Jane.  'Cause, you know, Luisa  accidentally inseminated her and all.  Yeah. Of course. I get it.  That's what Jane just said.  Be quiet! Oh, no, not you. Her.  Okay, no more excuses. We are less than 24 hours  till go time. [Gasps.]  Okay, well, tell Bruno Mars if he doesn't confirm,  I'm cutting him from the wedding lineup.  Yes, I know he played the ""Super Bowl"".  Tell him this is the Super Bowl of weddings.  Hey, did you ever get a firm answer from Dina?  Oh, she can't  make it, she needs to get all her work done before the strike.  Okay. Well, you know, if that changes,  just let me know and we'll squeeze her in.  Don't you give me attitude!  - What? â­ - Not you. Her.  Relax, relax.  Yeah, no, no, not you. You don't relax,  you do the opposite of relaxing.  [doorbell rings.]  Yeah, well, Rise above and all that.  Xiomara Villanueva?  This is from  I can see who it's from!  Xiomara?  Nothing.  Okay. I-I might have  spent the night with Esteban.  It was a mistake and I told him to back off, but he won't.  Xiomara!  Look  No one can know  - about this. Especially - [phone rings.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, I was gonna say Rogelio.  But yeah, Jane would be pissed too.  Hi, hon.  How was the meeting?  Oh, not great. Donaldson says  I can't change my thesis without submitting something else.  And I don't know what I do want to write about.  Maybe it's for the best?  - So you can focus on the wedding? - Yeah, maybe.  Anyway, don't forget to bring my shoes to the rehearsal.  - And don't be late. - I won't. And we won't be late,  - don't worry. - Sorry.  It's just this is the important part, you know?  Like, the actual sacrament of marriage.  And I just really want it to go well.  It will, don't worry.  [exhales.] Okay. Bye.  [gasps.]  Why do you have  a sex basket  from my mortal enemy?  [scoffs.] That's not a sex basket.  I know a sex basket when I see one.  It was just once.  It meant nothing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  Sorry again, they should be here any minute. [Chuckles.]  As long as this doesn't happen tomorrow.  Since we accommodated your last-minute schedule change,  we have a very limited window.  Oh, I-I know, absolutely. And you know what they say  bad rehearsal, great wedding.  Some good news, at least.  The Biltmore had a last-minute cancellation.  Guess who scored the presidential suite?  - Whoa. - â­Yeah.  Wait, how much did that cost?  Like 1,700 bucks.  - What? - â­Yeah.  That is, like, half of our budget for our honeymoon.  - Why didn't you consult with me? - Consult you?  We're getting married.  So, what, I got to consult you every time  - I want to spend money now? - That much, yes.  - Hi there, hi. - Sorry we're late.  Good, we can start, let's start.  Sounds good. Uh, first, hi, everyone.  You told me to fix this. I'm sorry I didn't ask you  - exactly how to fix it. - Don't be sarcastic.  First, welcome, everyone, to this joyous occasion.  Let's-let's get everyone lined up.  Jane, who's walking you down the aisle?  Oh, my-my parents and my grandma.  Okay.  Okay, let's go.  [exclaims softly.] Oh  Oops looks like we might need to narrow down to two.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good luck.  I agree. Xiomara, you should move to the rear.  - Excuse me?  - It's only right. - Oh, don't you start.  - Me start, me start? - Guys, what's going on?  I'm not the one who slept with the devil!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's when Jane's  newly-mobile son took off.  Oh, no, Mateo!  Mateo, no! Oh, oh! [Shrieks.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: On the bright side,  if bad rehearsals really do make good weddings,  this is going to be the best wedding ever.  We are so sorry, Father.  We've just been under so much pressure.  â­I'm fine.  I'll see you tomorrow.  I'm sorry, Jane. I shouldn't have said anything.  - So, so sorry. - I was so mad.  [Xiomara sighs.] ROGELIO: Why are you moving  - your-your head like this? - What? â­What?  'Cause you two are not fighting the night before my wedding.  After my wedding, you two can kill each other,  but before my wedding, everyone gets along.  Got it?  [sighs heavily.]  Oh. I'm so sorry.  No, I should have consulted you.  I I just got defensive 'cause I ruined our honeymoon.  Oh. â­I'll cancel the fancy hotel.  - No. No. - â­lt's happening.  [Mateo crying.] â­Ah.  It feels weird, leaving  - It's fine. I'll see you tomorrow. - Mm-hmm.  And then, every day for the rest of our lives.  I love you.  I love you, too.  PETRA: Rafael just runs to her. I mean,  - when will it end? â­ - Tomorrow.  The sun always coming out tomorrow.  When he sees Jane being married, which is why you must be there.  I already don't even know if I should go at this point.  - No, you must. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.  Why is it so important to her?  For future relationship with Jane.  And because  when-when Rafael sees her marrying someone else,  he will need comfort from you.  No. No, I told him  I don't want him if he's in love with someone else.  And I meant it.  I mean it, Raf. I am committed to my sobriety.  And to earning your trust back.  And this thing with Susanna is it serious?  Yes. [Laughs.]  But it's different than any relationship I've had.  We haven't even had sex, just light hand play,  because she wants to get to know each other first.  So how are you?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Where to begin?  Still love Jane.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Direct, to the point.  She's the love of my life.  And yes, I know, she's getting married.  I don't know. Maybe if I tell her.  If there's even the slightest chance  she won't walk down the aisle, then I have to.  I mean, right?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, knowing Luisa  as he did, he fully expected her to say  - Don't do it. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not that.  Trust me, I get it.  I thought I would never love again the way that I loved Rose.  But, then I met Susanna, and now  I'm starting to feel the same exact way.  And you will, too.  Just let Jane go.  Hun, let it go. So you fought.  It's not that.  There's just so much we haven't talked about. Basic stuff.  Marriage stuff. Tomorrow's just the wedding.  And the rehearsal was a disaster.  What if tomorrow's awful?  What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The man she lost her virginity to.  But it was perfect.  The shoes, the veil  [audience gasping, murmuring.]  So, the veil I'm wearing tomorrow?  [gasps.]  [laughter.]  [phone chimes.]  Oh, man. â­Oh!  It's Michael.  [sighs.]  JANE: Three times a week?  At Abuela's? That's-that's a lot.  But how about two dinners a week?  Minimum.  36 hours is my maximum  for dirty dishes to stay.  Done.  And now for item 23.  I know it's a big one.  [sighs.]  When do we want to have another kid?  [magical tinkling.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, look, they're having all the feels.  [magical tinkling.] LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All three of them.  [sighs.]  Abuela.  [Jane gasps.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And dear viewer, that's when it hit her!  I know what my new thesis should be.  It's a love story loosely based on my grandparents.  It'll start in Venezuela and explore class differences,  religion, sexual stigma, their journey to America.  - Jane - I can even make it bilingual even.  Jane, it sounds wonderful, but  Don't tell me it's too late.  The committee is meeting right now.  There's no time to write a new proposal.  Please. I can't spend an entire year  working on something I'm not passionate about.  You know what? Just come in now.  Pitch the idea in person.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, Jane, she hates the marriage plot.  I have a thing.  Well, you're just gonna have to decide  if your thing is more important than your thesis.  [sighs.] JANE: And it's on the way.  And I will make it to our wedding with time to spare,  but I will not go if you are not okay with it.  MICHAEL: You're on your way, aren't you?  I am, yes, but I am ready and willing  to go back upstairs if you say no.  Go! But don't be late.  - I won't. I won't. I love you. - [elevator bell dings.]  Give me! â­Okay. â­Go!  JANE: Hey.  Sorry. I got here as fast as I could.  That's a lot of makeup.  Yes. I know. Should we go in?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, man, I hope it goes well.  JANE: It went great, Ma!  The committee said yes right away.  I'm so excited.  Ugh! What am I doing wrong?  These buttons aren't closing.  I don't know. I can't see. Turn around.  Oh, it's crooked.  - This one? â­ - Nope.  - Here? - â­No, no, no.  That's not it. More to the left. Hey  - Then this one? - â­No. More, more.  No, don't just keep saying ""more,"" Ma.  - Th-That one! - I can't reach that one!  It's right It  I told you I had a thing.  Call you back, Ma.  Why am I not surprised?  Look, I don't want to be late. Can you help me?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  These are these are tiny.  I know. [Laughs.]  I feel like I'm locking you into the patriarchy as I do this.  Well, I appreciate you doing it anyway.  - Okay. - â­Ah!  Good. Go. And, hey,  congratulations.  On your new thesis being approved.  Thanks.  [panting.]  We're on our way, Michael, eight minutes away.  - I love you, too. - How did it go?  Success! They loved it.  Ooh! Ooh!  [panting.] Oh!  Okay. â­Why is it so cold in here?  I left the car running with the air conditioner on  so your makeup wouldn't run from the heat.  Oh, thanks, Dad. [Engine revving.]  Dad? â­lt won't go!  [hissing.] Aah! Turn it off! It's smoking!  [yells.] â­LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Turns out it's not such  a good idea to keep a 60-year-old Rolls Royce running  with the AC on for a half hour.  - Uber. I'll call an Uber. - Okay. Okay. â­Okay.  38 minutes away? Oh, my God!  - Uh, okay, Dad, do not panic. - Uh  The bus. Run. Dad.  Run! â­[shrieks.]  - Aah. Oh. No, no, no. - ROGELIO: No!  - Wait, wait, wait. Oh. - ROGELIO: Stop the bus!  Okay. Oh. Okay.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whew! They made it!  Thank you so much.  To the Holy Crown Church!  And step on it!  We stop near there in 17 stops.  Oh, you don't understand.  - My is daughter is getting married. - Yeah.  17 stops. Take a seat.  Oh, we're still 16 stops away. I'm so sorry.  I love you, too.  [sighs.]  Michael's gonna try and stall until we get there. Dad?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh. He's staring with an intensity of disdain  he reserves only for  Welcome to the sexiest bus in Miami!  PRIEST: Where is the bride?  You know we have a very limited window for the ceremony.  She'll be here soon. We'll just talk fast.  Is everything okay?  Yeah, fine.  ROGELIO: I'm fine.  - Totally fine. - He doesn't seem fine.  Come on, let's talk.  It'll take my mind off the fact that I'm  officially late to my wedding.  I mean, I understand your mother needed to move on,  but she could have slept with anyone.  Why would she pick the one person  who would hurt me the most?  Well, I guess that's kind of the point, right?  I mean, she was obviously really hurt  that you moved on so quickly with Dina.  She she just wanted to hurt you back.  [sighs.]  Yes. Okay, that makes sense.  Plus, she clearly has a type. â­What?  Because you and Esteban are so similar.  [Rogelio gasps, Esteban gasps.]  BOTH: We could not be more different!  Come on, put Esteban out of your head, okay?  This is your big day!  And mine.  [grunting.]  [panting.]  [gasps, grunting.]  Jane, please stop running. Your makeup will melt.  - Let me carry you! - No way!  Then your â­makeup will melt!  You're right! We'll reapply when we get there!  [panting, groaning.]  Shoes.  [shuddering breath.]  [chuckles.] â­Thanks, Dad.  Yeah.  Okay. â­Oh.  Okay, go inside and tell Michael I'm here so he doesn't see me.  On it!  [sighs sharply.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when she saw him.  [hinges squeak.]  Mr. Sweetface!  [laughing.]: Hi.  Baby.  Oh.  [kisses.]  Oh.  I was just keeping him occupied.  You look so handsome I can't stand it!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in this moment, friends,  Rafael was sure, absolutely sure,  that Jane was about to marry the wrong man.  Anhe was also sure  - that it was now or never. - Jane?  I know this is terrible timing,  but it's kind of like what you were saying about your writing.  Sometimes you can be really far down the road,  but you still have to follow your heart.  What are you talking about?  I love you, Jane.  I always have.  And I always will.  And I think we're supposed to be together.  So if there's even the smallest part of your heart  that believes this to be true, then  don't marry Michael.  Please don't marry him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it was true, friends he did love her.  And he saw she was happy.  So how could he ruin that?  Which is why he said nothing. Ah.  Are you ready to walk down the aisle, Mr. Sweetface?  Yes?  I'll take him inside.  Ah  [sighs.] Good luck.  [sighs.]  You look beautiful.  [chuckles.]  Oh.

This is depressing.  Mind if we get back to Jane's wedding?  [dance music playing.] [cheering.]  Whoa!  Go, Michael!  [Latin Lover Narrator whoops.]  What is it with straight dudes at weddings?  So homoerotic.  [laughs.]  [laughs.]  Can I just say  I love you.  I know it's too quick to say, but I do.  I love you, too.  [moaning softly.]  And I really just want to have sex with you already.  Oh, God. Me, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow. I need some air.  [dance music playing in distance.]  You okay?  Yeah. I just needed some fresh air.  Felt a little dizzy,  with all the emotions.  Listen,  - I'm really sorry â­ - No.  No need. Stop. I understand.  And, look, if Esteban makes  you happy for some  very strange,  inexplicable reason  Stop. [Chuckles.] He doesn't.  Thank God.  I want to be with you.  Honestly. And, also  I still don't want more kids.  So, there you have it.  I want to be with you, too.  Honestly.  But I still do want kids, so  So  nothing's changed.  Actually, that's not true.  Our daughter's married. [Chuckles.]  And you threw her the most beautiful wedding, Rogelio.    Dance with me.  Shine on   Shine on   Ooh   Shine on   DOCTOR: It's called locked-in syndrome. Likely the result  of a mini stroke precipitated  by Anezka's seizure. She is aware,  but she can't communicate.  All voluntary muscles in her body are paralyzed,  except for her eyes.  How-how long will it last?  It's good to set reasonable expectations.  She probably won't improve much, unfortunately.  But keep talking to her. She knows you're here.  Can I, uh  can I have a moment alone with my sister?  Of course.  I'm outside if you need me, okay?  [sighs.]  [accented.]: Don't worry, beautiful sister.  I do what is necessary to taking good care of Rafael.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I should explain  Baby has your sense of humor,  laughing at other's tears!  Oh. I wonder if this also  will make her laugh.  [gasps.]    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Poor Petra!  My friends, it seems she's been  [indistinct chatter.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, there they go.  [phone chimes.]  Xiomara, I know you said  you don't want to see me again,  but perhaps this will change your mind.  [gasps.]  I feel sick.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Me too. Let's get out of here.  Much better.  Okay, we're about nine minutes away from Motel 6. Six if I speed.  - Four if I use my siren. - I can't wait.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I venture to guess that no two people have ever been  this excited to spend the night at a Motel 6.  - What's that? â­ - Oh.  It's a gift for you. I was gonna give it to you later.  - [gasps.] - â­But now's good.    [chuckles.]  - [gasps.] - Now it's snowing on the yacht.  Snow makes everything more romantic.    MICHAEL: We first kissed in the snow.  This way it's snowing on us forever.  Do you want a drink? Or a  a water?  I just really don't want to be alone right now.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I thought you said you didn't want to do this  if I'm not over Jane.  And I'm not.  And I don't care anymore.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, that's an about face.  Yeah. Everything's fine.  ESTEBAN BOBBLEHEAD: I warned you.  I told you I bust out of condoms.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I can't believe it. It's Michael and Jane.  They're finally doing it!  Oh, no. It's Rafael and Petra!  I mean, Anezka!  Yeah. Leapin' lizards, indeed!  [panting.] Oh. We should  probably We should we sh  we should leave. Or stay.  Yes. That's a genius idea.  Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I had a whole plan.  [panting.]  Put that on right now.  Yes, Officer.  Oh.  I'm gonna go get some ice for the champagne.  Don't go anywhere.  I won't.  [door shuts.] [exhales.]  Which brings us here, now  Hey. â­Hey. Congratulations, Michael.  - It was a really beautiful wedding. - Thank you.  Oh, um,  Tuscaloosa. Roll Tide.  Hmm?  Roll Tide. Then you say  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Roll.  Go Crimson?  Oh, right. Yeah. I've heard that.  ARMSTRONG: This is your new partner,  Susanna Barnett. From Tuscaloosa.  - Pleased to meet you. - JERRY: Tell her Roll Tide.  She'll get it.  You know who used blue silk ties?  A drug lord that went by the name Mutter. Look it up.  Cordero's got a direct line to Nadine.  Let's fire him, make a big show of it,  then he can embed himself with Nadine, see where it leads.  The chip. That's what this is all about.  So where is it?  It was on me. Literally.  Tech decoded that flash drive  with the criminals whose faces were changed by Mutter and Sin Rostro.  And at a million bucks a pop,  that's $200 million unaccounted for.  [gasps.]  It's you.  You're the mole. You've been  leading us to Mutter this whole time. Why?  Who are you working for?  Oh!  So, we need to leave right now.  Why?  [gasping.]  You said you didn't think you could ever love again,  not the way you loved Rose.  I never stopped loving you, Luisa.  And you never stopped loving me.  But you were dead.  I-I s I-I saw you.  That wasn't me.  That was just to free us.  So now we can go anywhere.  Don't look so surprised.  You know ours is the greatest love story ever told.  Now, come on. It's time to go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, she's right.  It is."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Finally! Welcome back.  Let's review, shall we?  This is Jane.  You'll recall she was accidentally inseminated  by Rafael's sperm.  This is their baby, Mateo.  Adorable, right?  And this is Detective Michael Cordero Jr.  And after a lot of back and forth  and back again, well,  Jane and Michael finally got married.  I pronounce you husband and wife.  And I may be biased,  but can I just say Best wedding ever.  I mean, this is everything, right?  And it was thrown by Jane's father,  international telenovela star  Rogelio de la Vega .  This is Jane's mother,  Xiomara and, man,  Rogelio loved her.  But alas,  he wanted kids, and she didn't,  and so they broke up.  And in a moment of weakness,  Xo slept with his nemesis, Esteban.  - And, well, this happened. - ESTEBAN BOBBLEHEAD: I warned you.  I told you I bust out of condoms.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!  Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this.  Rafael also had twins with his ex-wife, Petra.  Oh, this is Petra.  And this is Petra's twin sister, Anezka.  And, well  - this happened. - (gasps)  And poor Petra ended up    And then Anezka moved in on Rafael.  I know, cray cray, right?  Even crazier?  This is Rafael's sister, Luisa.  She used to date Rose, otherwise known as  the criminal Sin Rostro.  But now she was dating Michael's partner,  Susanna, or she thought she was.  And, friends, this  is the hard part.  See, Jane and Michael were about to have sex.  - But then - Don't go anywhere.  - I won't. - he ran into Susanna.  And suddenly realized  You're the mole, you've been leading us  to Mutter this whole time  Why? Who are you working for?  (gasps)  Now, come on.  It's time to go.  Which, friends,  I'm afraid is where we left off.  For as long as anyone can remember,  Jane Gloriana Villanueva  believed in the epic love story.  You know, two people destined for each other  overcoming obstacles  before finally finding their way  into one another's arms.  That's right, the stuff of romance novels.  So her very first book reading  well, it was a very big deal.  âAnd though she vowed she would never love a soldier,  âeven though she knew  âhe was going to leave for Paris  âat the end of the month,  Noelle let herself fall.â  (applause)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And our Jane  well, she came prepared.  - What's that? - A list.  So I don't forget a main point.  LAYLA: Now I'm happy to answer any questions.  Yes.  I would like to know why Noelle and Jean Luc  don't get together at the end.  Well, love doesn't always work out.  Yeah, in real life.  But this is a romance novel.  In a romance novel they get a happily ever after.  Not happily until a mortar shell explodes  just when Jean Luc's finally coming home from the war.  All right, you made your point, sit down.  LAYLA: Some romances don't end happily.  Think of Romeo and Juliet.  But that's one of Shakespeare's tragedies.  Everyone knows in tragedies they end up dead,  in comedies they end up happy,  and in romance novels they end up together.  Well, sometimes you need to subvert the ending  for the element of surprise.  Great, fine, but then don't call it  a romance novel, call it fiction.  XIOMARA: I'm sorry,  she was really upset when she finished the book.  JANE: But of course I was.  There are rules to the genre.  Go to the RWA website.    All over it,  it says you need an HEA.    WOMAN: I mean,  I was disappointed too.  I felt empty for days.  You know, she really might be too young  for this type of event.  I told you to keep it together.  It was spur of the moment.  You had a list.  Not so spur of the moment.  But, anyway, you you made some good points  about genre or whatever.  Well, I learned a lesson.  From now on, I'm reading  the ending of books first so I can be prepared  for whatever happens.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which actually raises  an interesting question  How does knowing the end  affect the journey?    Because some of you know how this is going to end.  Michael?  Michael?  Michael?  (gasps)  Oh, my God, Michael!  Michael! Help!  Somebody help!  I should remind you that I did say  that Michael would love Jane  until his dying breath.  Okay, you're breathing.  Thank God.  Help! Somebody help please!  (crying): Okay.  Stay with me, baby.  Stay with me please. Stay with me  LATIN LOVE NARRATOR: Which brings us here.    Now  - Any updates? - No.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unfortunately, friends,  there was no way for Jane to prepare for this.     JANE: Oh, I can't take this waiting.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's torture.  He's gonna be okay, hon.  You don't know that.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which is true  because she couldn't skip ahead to the ending.  And we can't either.  So instead, let's flip back  (pages turning)  to earlier in our epic romance.  (pages flipping quickly)    Oops, that's a little too far.  Ah, here we are.    You're seriously not gonna help at all?  The morning after Jane's 21st birthday  was somewhat less festive than the night before.  Nope.  For Xo at least.  What?  We agreed that cleanup was part of your punishment  - for last night's behavior. - (phone chimes)  Oh!  The cop wants to see me again tonight.  Wow.  And I really booted on his shoes?  Twice.  (giggles)  I swear, it's like we already have private jokes.  I mean, they're all about you so far, but still.  Ha-ha.  I just can't picture you with a cop.  I know, but, I'm telling you, Ma,  that kiss, it was  magic.  (car pulling up in distance)  Oh, my God.  Sam just pulled up.  - Sam? - Yes, Sam!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know what you're thinking,  - who the hell is Sam? - Oh, my God, he's coming.  - (car door closes) - Am I too gross?  - Do I smell? - Y-you're good, you're good.  Okay, but you're not, so stay away from him.  (doorbell rings)  Go on, open the door and act like you haven't been  obsessively crushing on him for two years.  - 17 months. - (scoffs)  (seductive music plays)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, hello, Sam.  - Oh, hey. - (chuckles)  Wanted to drop something off.  Is now an okay time?  Yeah, totally.  (Jane inhales)  Actually, let's, um, sit outside.  (door closes)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So now might be a good time to mention  that Jane had been in a love triangle once before.  I'm sorry I couldn't make it last night, I  was trying to bang out that Chaucer paper,  and then, before I knew it, it was 2:00 in the morning.  - Oh. So not a big deal. - No, I  - I wanted to come. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Of course,  you already know how this one ends.  But still,  the journey's worth it, trust me.  Anyway,  happy birthday.  Thank you.    Antarctica.  Huh?  That's where Bernadette went.  I know how you like to know the ending.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, you're gonna want to  back off that smile, just a little.  - Thank you, I can't wait to read it. - Before tonight?  Maria Semple is doing a reading. Come with me.  - Like a date? - I'd love to.  Or is it not a date?  Like, um like just the two of us?  I hope not, for Maria Semple's sake.  Oh. (laughs loudly)  Not that funny.  (chuckles softly)  Um  I just meant, like, did you want to pick me up,  - or should we just meet there? - No.  I'll pick you up at 7:00.  And if you want to know how it's gonna end,  I'm gonna try and kiss you.  You won't have to try that hard. (soft chuckle)  (door opens)  (humming)  Oh, my God, Sam just asked me out!  - No! - Yes, for tonight!  - What about the cop? - What cop?  Oh.    You're here for Michael Cordero?  I'm Dr. Lewis and I'm part of the trauma team.  Right now he's in critical condition.  The bullet missed his heart, but it transected  some major pulmonary vessels.  There's a lot of bleeding in his chest, we're still trying  to stabilize him.  But is he, um  will he be all right?  Honestly, we don't know yet.  You're his wife?  Yes, I am.  Here.  You should hold on to this.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know,  if this were a romance novel,  right about now I'd need to put the book down  and take a break.  LATIN LOVE NARRATOR: Ah, yes, we were imagining  this was a romance novel.  - Either way, here we are. - (pages turning)  So sorry to bug you, but the doctor just gave us an update,  and I think I was in shock,  and I didn't ask anything.  But now I'm prepared, so I was wondering  if I can talk to a doctor, any doctor?  It doesn't even have to be one of your good ones.  Let me see if I can find someone.  Thank you so much.  Oh, Patricia, hi.    How is he?  Any update?      No, not since we talked.    We just have to have faith.  Well, I don't know about faith.  What we need is information.  Mrs. Cordero?  - Yes. - Yes.  Um, this is Dr. Sterling.  He's familiar with Mr. Cordero's case.  I heard you have some questions.  Good. Yes. I need to know what his condition is.  Exactly.  Go on. You have your list.  - No, it's fine. - Friend who's a surgeon,  and he said to ask specifically  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm with Alba.  You need to have faith.  In fact, in many ways,  - this is a story about faith - I don't know.  Faith that the past will have some connection  - to the present. - It's only a little white lie.  No one gets hurt. Michael will never know.  - (door opens) -     JANE: Welcome back, Abuela.  Hi, Ma.    - This looks like a real gun! - (screaming)  Uh, champagne cork from the big birthday bash.  (scoffs) Hi, Abuela.  Mwah.  So, Ma, ever since Jane turned 21,  she's been juggling men like crazy.  I met someone sweet last night,  and then Sam asked me out.    Less shocked.    17 months, people.  But, yes, I know.  Finally, the whole dance is over.  Okay, it was more like a solo, but, still.  You know, I stuck with him while he dated Kelly  and hung in through the whole Julia fiasco.  And now, finally, finally  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm gonna be honest, friends.  She saw the HEA.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a beautiful story.  Hopefully we'll tell it at your wedding.  But just to keep your options open,  tell the other guy you're sick.    It's harmless.    Who are you gonna take dating advice from, me or Abuela?  (groans softly)  (chuckles)  Sorry, Abuela.        Uh-uh. Less detail.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, now let's skip ahead, shall we?  (laughing)  Oh, this is a really funny moment.  Oh, my God, that's the funniest story I've ever heard!  Actually, sorry, it's not relevant to the story.  Let's keep moving.  (doorbell rings)  Okay, here we are, later that night.  - Have fun. - I will.    I won't.  (crickets chirping)    Thank you.  (engine starts)  (siren wailing)  Uh, what'd I do?  I don't know. You weren't speeding.  License and registration.  Uh, sure.  What did he do?  Illegal U-turn.  Oh, wow, I'm sorry.  Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you  to step out of the vehicle.  - What? - Excuse me?  - Ma'am, please. - Uh, no, no.  - You don't have to do that. - JANE: It's fine.  I know him.  I'll be right back.  - Okay. What's going on? - That's what I'd like to know.  - Are you stalking me? - No, I'm not stalking you.  I happened to be dropping by your house  to bring you some soup 'cause you said you were sick.  I made it myself.  It's an old family recipe.  Anyway, then you left your house, clearly not sick,  and I happened to see you get in the car,  which then engaged in some illegal activity.  He made a U-turn on an empty street.  - An illegal U-turn. - Hey, is everything okay back there?  Sir, please keep your head inside the vehicle.  Anyway, here's your soup.  Thank you.  Have a good night.  Is there anything that I can do?  JANE: No.  Just keep Mateo safe.  Of course.  There are cops all over the hotel;  they've assured me it's completely secured.  Any leads?  I don't think so.  But they will figure out who did this.  Yeah. Bye.  So, unfortunately, the security footage  in that hallway was wiped out.  What?  Speaks to pretty sophisticated shooter.  Or someone familiar with the hotel systems.  You said you were here last night?  Yes.  Alone?  (tribal drumming plays)  (gasps)  No.  I was with my ex-wife, Petra.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To clarify,  he thought it was his ex-wife Petra.  In fact, it was    (Czech accent): Sorry, Mother, I couldn't get to a phone.    Rafael didn't think I should be alone last night.  He was being very sweet. (giggles)  Did you have sex with him?  No.  (giggles)  You did.  Well maybe. (giggles)  Petra, your laugh  You do not laugh like that.  You are not an idiot.  I need you to stay focused.  When did you freeze the chicken?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me help here,  because they're talking in code.    At 10:00.  MAGDA: Okay.  So you have to get back to baste the chicken  in six hours.    I know, I know. Don't worry.  But you know,  I was, I was thinking, Mother,  m-maybe we don't have to do Rafael part of plan.  We are doing the side dish,  you hloupy osel.    (knocking at door)  (Petra's accent): Hold on, Mother.  Hi again, Mrs. Solano.  Just wanted to let you know  that Mr. Solano confirmed your alibi.  Oh. Good.  What did he say exactly?  That you were together.  Yeah, I know, but I-I mean,  did, did he seem happy about it or  - Ma'am? - Never mind.  Is that all?  No, actually.  We thought you could help us  take a look at some security footage.  See if anything looks unusual.  We need to review the hour before the shooting.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: An hour.  She can spare an hour.  From ten different cameras.  Oh.  Wow, that's, uh  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ten hours, you silly donkey.  Um  (clears throat) Sorry, I just, uh,  I didn't realize it was going to take so much time.  You know what?  I should really visit my sister  before I buckle in here.  Excuse me?  Oh, she's in the hospital.  (whispering): A stroke.  - Oh. - Triggered by a severe seizure.  And, uh, now she's unable to move.  It's called ""locked-in syndrome.""  - Jeez, that's terrible. - I know.  Awful.  Unfortunately, this investigation is time-sensitive,  so we should look at the tapes first.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, good.  Maybe the chicken will defrost.  Which brings us here,  to our poor, frozen chicken.  For company.  Reports indicate that the officer shot,  Michael Cordero,  was taken to St. Ignatius Hospital,  where he remains in critical condition. The shooter  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Suddenly, Petra felt a tiny bit of hope,  knowing that Jane was probably in this very same hospital.  If only she could move.  Or speak. Or twitch.  And I know we're all wishing Detective Cordero well.  Now, onto sports  (TV shuts off)  He had a concussion  when he was seven.  Oh, oh, yeah, I left it blank. I was gonna ask you.  Why don't I just do it?  Oh, I don't mind.  It has to be right; I know more information.  Plus, it'll give me something to do.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's when  Rogelio saw something that terrified him.  Two civilians, 0800 hours,  clearly engaged in    Hey, guys.  Oh, wow. Uh, yes.  It's me.  I-I understand you wanted a picture,  but I have to ask you to treasure it privately  and not tweet it out.  Why not?  Well, it's a long story.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here's the short version.  REPORTER 2: It all began  when international telenovela star  Rogelio de la Vega  retweeted an Amber Alert  that his grandchild was kidnapped.  Please. I'll do anything.  Yeah?  For reals?  For reals.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, where were we?  Ah, yes. Waiting.  Still waiting.  I don't know how you can eat at a time like this.  I just, uh  Sorry.  PATRICIA: Oh, don't be dramatic.  Just eat it.  Listen, we're all upset, okay?  Don't take it out on Jane.  - I'm not taking it out on Jane. - Mom, it's fine.  Let's just go outsid for a minute.  Please?  I'm sorry, but she's being so rude to you.  She's just scared.  And th and this is how she copes.  - But - Mom. You're not helping.  Just take a little walk  and cool off, okay, please?  (exhales) XIOMARA: So this is my fault?  Kind of.  You told me to lie.  Oh, stop.  Sam will get over it  if he's your happily ever after or whatever.  Maybe.  What? I don't know.  It was a weird date.  And I don't know if it was weird  because there was 17 months of buildup,  or because of that cop and his stupid soup.  Oh  - (laughs) - What?  - You like the cop. - No.  No, I don't.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, he's kind of stalkerish, right?  And his choices in music are way off.  And he's a cat person.  His profile picture is him with his cat.  Weird, right?  You are on his Facebook page.  I know.  It's just this stupid soup is so good.  (laughs)  Fakes left. He goes right!  Oh! (laughs)  (groans)  Game over! An unprecedented third  consecutive trash ball championship!  - Oh, you got so lucky. - Lucky?  Three championships is not lucky, my friend.  - Whoop.. oh! - Michael  Hi.  - Three championships. - Yeah. Four,  and I get to wear a crown around the station.  Apology cubano.  I didn't make it, but still  I obviously didn't have a cold,  and I shouldn't have lied about it.  But I was wondering if we can go back  to the other night.  I-I mean, not when I shot your gun,  but how we felt when we kissed.  ARMSTRONG: You kissed while on duty?  - No. - It wasn't until hours later.  You were at her house for hours?  My office, Cordero.  I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to get you in trouble.  No, it's fine, I just obviously  didn't put the kiss in the report.  Might have spiced up the report.  So, before we were interrupted,  you were saying something about  - trying this again. - I would like that.  Me, too.  And no more lies. Total honesty.  Perfect.  Which is why I want you to know  that I'm also going to be  exploring my relationship with Sam.  What?  The guy that you pulled over.  It's just, I've been in love with him for 17 months.  I mean, not in love with him, just, like,  super into him, and he finally asked me out.  You gotta be kidding me.  I'm just trying to be honest.  Okay, let me be honest. I'm not interested  in being in a love triangle with you and Sam.  It's not a love triangle. I hardly know you.  Exactly. I don't even know if I like you.  Well, then, why did you bring me soup?  I don't know. I wish I didn't.  You know what? Have a nice life  with Sam, the lawbreaker.  Well, you have a good life with your cat!  How do you know about my cat?  - Your profile picture, weirdo. - That's 'cause she just died.  Thanks for bringing that up, jackass!  Okay, sorry about your cat,  but you don't have to call me a jackass, dick!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, in that moment,  Jane truly thought she'd never see Michael again.  WOMAN (over P.A. system): Dr. Davis, telephone, please.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which is obviously not what happened.  (elevator bell dings)  (exhales sharply, sobbing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so, here we are.  So close  Hey, again, just checking your vitals.  Everything looks the same.  But here's a call button just in case.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: and yet so far.  At least for two hours and 23 minutes.  If I might say, you seem a little nervous, ma'am.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, she did have a ticking cluck.  (chicken clucking)  No, not nervous. (sighs)  I just need to use the restroom.  I'll be right back.  Heard they found a trail of white powder in the hallway.  They're running tests.  Yep. You know, if it's cocaine,  this could be some kind of drug thing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh, friends, I believe Anezka,  like her sister, is locked in.  Hmm. That's suspicious.  Come on!  Also rather suspicious  Hey. Oh, yeah.  What?  Sorry. You scared me.  I'm just getting some air.  Yeah, me, too.  - Rogelio. - What?  Let me get a sip of your coffee.  No. No, no!  No, no. Wh  Is that urine?  No.  Yes.  I made a deal to give my pee  to two tweakers so they could pass a drug test.  In exchange, they agreed not to tweet pictures  of me at the hospital.  - I'm pretty sure that's illegal. - I don't care.  A tweet from me almost ruined Jane's life last year.  I'm not going to let that happen again.  I have to do something for her.  And for Michael.  Oh, Ro  Sorry sorry  it's it's just  you know how I always say he's my best friend?  Well, I mean it.  So, you got it?  I just need a little more time to hydrate.  Please. I promise, you'll get what you need.  20 minutes.  I'll do it.  I want to help, too.  So I'll pee in a damn cup.  Great. Perfect.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when she remembered  she'd recently peed on a damn stick.  Actually, forget it, um  I'm a woman, so  - They can't tell gender. - Yes, they can.  - No, they can't. - Yes, they can.  - They can't. - Sometimes they can!  Like when you're pregnant, for instance.  Pregnant?  It's Esteban's.      Hey. I'm sorry about my mom.  Well, hopefully she got ahold of herself.  Hi.  So the good news is that he's stabilized.  Oh  We were able to get him into imaging,  and the CT scan showed that he had an aortic dissection,  which we can manage medically.  - Okay, good. - That's good.  But the problem is  the bullet passed through the chest cavity,  and landed near his spine.  Right now there is considerable swelling.  W-What does that mean?  Well, there are two options.  Neither's perfect.  We can take a wait-and-see approach,  treat him with steroids, see if it works.  But if it doesn't, he risks loss of function.  Possibly from the waist down.  Or we could try to operate,  to clear the bone fragments and relieve the pressure  on his spinal cord.  This offers slightly better odds on the paralysis front,  but he's in critical condition,  and surgery comes with real risks.  Then no, we're not doing it.  You can cake some time to discuss it.  I'm sure.  You're his wife, so, technically,  it's your decision.  I-I'd like a few minutes to think about it.  You want to risk his life, after all this?  I-I don't know, I thought that we should talk.  I need to talk to his father.  I know he's close and I'm pretty sure  he'll agree with me.    I think  that this wasn't supposed to happen.  We talked about who would take out the trash  and when we would have another baby,  not what I should do of there was a bullet  near his spine.  I don't know what the right answer is.            LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  that's when Jane remembered this moment.  (doorbell rings)  Which, of course, is where we left off.  What are you doing here?  Well, firstly,  I wanted to apologize  for calling you a jackass.  And I thought about it,  and who cares about Sam?  Sam can come on our dates if you want him to.  Michael, stop.  It's fine. Just go.  Seriously.  We had one good night, and I was wasted.  And our sober interactions have been pretty terrible.  If you really mean that  If you really want me to walk away  Say the words I will.  Walk away.  No.  What are you doing?  We had something.  That kiss was magic.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: There's that word again.  The magic of tequila.  Let me kiss you again. Sober.  Why won't you give up?  Because I'm a fighter.  You should know that about me.  I'm a fighter.  He'd want the surgery.  Yes, that's what his father said, too.  I'm just so scared.  Me, too.  So you just have a few minutes while the O.R.'s being prepped.  (monitor beeping)  Hi.  So you're about to have surgery.  But I'm not gonna say good-bye,  because this is not the end of our story.  Do you hear me, Michael?  You're gonna wake up, and you're gonna be okay.  And we're gonna move into our new house.  And we're gonna live there until we outgrow it.  Because I'll be pregnant  with our third kid,  because we landed on three the other night  Three kids total.  Which will seem overwhelming,  but Mateo's such a big help.  Oh, and we're gonna go to the mountains.  We're gonna take 'em to the mountains  because we always wanted to be in the snow.  (kids laughing)  And then we'll go every year.  And-And that trip will become a tradition.  We're huge on family traditions, by the way.  Christmas, Easter,  Sunday night family dinners.  And even when the kids move out and have families of their own,  they'll always come back for Sunday night dinners.  Mateo?  Partly because they want to see us,  but partly because you're such a great griller.  (sniffles) You're a really  great griller, Michael.  And we're gonna be that old couple  that sit on the front porch.  Reminiscing, arguing over details.  I thought it was a broken taillight.  No, it was an illegal U-turn.  And we'll get a stupid cat,  'cause, yes,  you convinced me to get one.  And we're gonna be happy, Michael.  We're gonna be happy.  Okay, it's time.  Mm-hmm. (sniffles)  (indistinct announcement over intercom)  We wanted to come.  For support.  (garbled radio transmission)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: At this moment, I should mention  that Michael and Petra's fates are linked.    I just don't understand.  You know these doors lock automatically.  Yeah, well, uh  At least, Petra knew.  I'm upset.  And I, I know  Michael was shot and everyone's scared.  But my sister had a stroke.  And now she's lying there in some hospital bed  all by herself and she must be so scared  and I just want to see her.  I need to see her.  Of course you do.  (sighs) I'm sorry.  With everything going on  with Michael, I, I  Look, just, I'll look through the security footage.  Let her go to the hospital.  I don't know.  She's been acting pretty suspicious.  Well, you know she was with me last night.  So she's not a suspect.  Unless you want me to get my lawyers involved?  (praying in Spanish)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes!  Petra, go! Move!  DENNIS (over radio): No update.  Cordero's still in surgery.  - So, you can go now. - No problem  for me to stay with you, ma'am.  Hello, Anezka.  PATRICIA: Can I have half?  (garbled radio transmission)      The surgery went well.  - (sighs of relief) - We got the bullet fragments  and he's already showing signs  of movement in his lower body.  - (laughing) - (applause)  (radio crackles)  DENNIS: Cordero's out of surgery.  Doing good.  Copy that. Great news.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I did say their fates were linked.  You're okay?  (laughing): You're really okay.  (sniffling)  Wait, who are you?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No! Not amnesia!  I'm just kidding.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I hate you!  I love you, I love you.  I love you so much.  (sniffles)  Oh (gasps)  (laughs)  - So? - Mm-hmm?  What's this about you  promising me a cat if I woke up?  - You heard? - Nah.  The nurse told me.  But I'm psyched.  - Yeah, you're not really getting one. - What?  You're gonna go back on a deathbed promise?  Come on!  - Are you serious? - Yeah, definitely.  I want my cat.  Faith M. Whiskers III.  (laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, I did say  this was a story about Faith.  Actually, screw the rules.  Let's jump ahead for real this time.  You got to see this cat.  -  - She's so freakin' adorable.  We'll talk about it later.  There's nothing to talk about. I'm getting my cat.  Ah, if this were only a romance novel.  We could end here  and they'd get their HEA.  (knocking)  But, alas, this isn't a romance novel.  So, listen, I don't want to interrupt,  but we should really talk now that you're up,  in case you remember anything about the shooting.  MICHAEL: Absolutely.  I remember everything.  It's a telenovela, remember?  It was my partner.  Susanna Barnett.  And we're right smack in the middle.  And I just think if I move my sister here,  then I-I'll be able to  Keep her paralyzed?  Take care of her.  Talk to her so she won't be so lonely.  That sounds like a great idea.  Thank you.  Well, for everything.  Without you, I would've  broken down.  Today.  Last night.  Yeah, um, I actually wanted  to talk to you about last night.  You don't regret it, do you?  No.  Because I always wondered if,  uh, you know, that thing that we had,  if it was still there.  You know?  And it just wasn't.  What?  I'm sorry.  I just, I want to be honest.  You've told me to be honest.  But things just felt different.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Because it wasn't Petra!  So I'm glad that it happened.  Because now we can move on to being friends.  Because romantically,  I just don't want to go there again.  Forget what I say earlier, Mother.  Rafael part of plan is on, too.  Yeah, no, right  Well, that's what I mean.  Let's fry the onion rings.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, I don't like the sound of that.  Hey, thanks again, Erik.  Or that.  I'm sorry, what did you call me?  You're Erik Estrada, right?  Yeah, from CHiPs.  You thought I was Erik Estrada?  That guy's, like, 100.  (gasps) Oh, my God!  - Dude, calm down. - I will not calm down!  There are, like, cops everywhere, man.  Good.  You should be arrested.  I gave you guys my urine!  And then you make this egregious racial and generational  mistake!  I hope you rot in jail.  Did I hear something about a urine exchange?    Thank you for your help.  A day like this,  it just puts things in perspective.  So I wanted to say  on the other note,  that, of course, I'll stand by you  - and the baby. - Rogelio.  Stop.  I'm not having the baby.  I didn't want to have a baby with you,  who I love so much. (sighs)  I'm not having a baby with Esteban.  Well, that's your choice.  Either way, I'm here, okay?  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  Yeah.  Ready to go?  Yes, sir.  I'll see you at the station in an hour.  You better not be back to work tomorrow, Cordero.  MICHAEL: We'll see.  I don't want him to go back at all.  Me, neither.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But that's a problem for the future.  And we're not there, yet.  We're here.  So, tox came back.  It wasn't cocaine in the hallway.  It was actually powdered sugar.  Powdered sugar?  Like, from donuts?  A-Anyway, who cares?  It means it was a dead end.  Unless you know a murderous, powdered-donut-eating criminal.  You saved these from your psychopath ex-girlfriend?!  Okay, first of all, she's not a psychopath.  She's a sociopath.  (screams)    I do know one.  Sin Rostro? But she's dead.  Or someone who was made to look like her is dead.  You have to run a print on A2.  LUISA: Where am I?  What's going on?  All in good time.  Just know  we're going to get our happily ever after.  I promise."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so Jane and Michael's  first night as husband and wife  went from a dream to a nightmare.  JANE: Help! Somebody help!  But thank God he's okay.  You better not be back to work tomorrow, Cordero.  PATRICIA: I don't want him to go back at all.  Me, neither.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also not too happy: Petra.  See, her twin sister, Anezka, froze her and took her place.  ANEZKA: If I move my sister here, then I-I'll be able to take care of her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know, straight out  of a Telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this: Jane's father was a Telenovela star.  Oh, and Jane's mother, Xo, well,  she found herself pregnant with his rival's baby.  XIOMARA: I didn't want to have a baby with you  who I love so much. I'm not having a baby with Esteban.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: There! You're all caught up.  So, let's do this, people!  Okay.  Have a good day first day back at work.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: When Jane Gloriana Villanueva  was 25 years, six months, and 14 days old  Thank you.  It's gonna be okay, I promise.  Mm-hmm.  (gunshots)  Michael?  Michael!  No, no! Michael!  (gasps)  she had the worst nightmare ever  Are you okay?  Yeah. I'm fine.  Based on her worst nightmare ever.  We're gonna put this behind us, okay?  Just takes time.  And Jane really hoped that was true.    Okay, here we go.  Have a good first day.  You sure you're okay?  A little nervous  Okay, very nervous.  But I can do this.    I love you.  I love you, too.  Okay, now go before I'm not okay!  Okay.  (gunshots)  Michael!  (gasps)      But so far, not so much.  NURSE: Just keep in mind,  recovery is not a straight line.  And going home, there's going to be an adjustment period.  Well, it's an adjustment I'm looking forward to.  Me, too.  No.  I said no more crackers I said no.  - There we are. - Do you think that we can go over  that new stretch one more time? It's the only one that I'm not sure of.  Yeah, no problem. Um  Just start with him  - on his back - (Mateo cries)  with a rolled towel under his neck for support.  (crying intensifies)  Just ignore him.  Any attention rewards bad behavior.  - Okay, so, rolled towel. - Right,  - (loud wailing) - then he's gonna want  to reach his right arm  to his right toe, while keeping his core  Mateo! Shh!  (screaming continues)  Forget it.  (Mateo quiets)  Sorry.  One more time, from the top.  You're gonna have help at home, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, my-my grandma's  a home health care worker.  NARRATOR: Oh so, that's what all those smocks were about.  We will be staying with her and my mom  for the first few weeks.  Every newlywed's dream.  For the record, all I need  to feel like a newlywed is my sexy,  sexy nurse.  (heart monitor beeps increase)  Whoa-ho! Hey, hey, hey,  hey, hey. Hate to break  the honeymoon up, but you're gonna need  to keep that heart rate down  for the next six weeks, remember?  So, no sex?  - You can hardly move. - She can.  Be that as it may, for the next six weeks,  it's hands  and everything else off.  (bell clanging)    Hi, Dad, bye, Dad. Mwah.  Okay, so I'm going to go to the pharmacy  and get your prescription filled, then I'm going to go  to the house, make sure everything's ready,  then I'll come back in about three hours  to take you home sound good?  - Mm-hmm. - ROGELIO: No!  Esteban is featured in this American magazine.  I'll leave you two to discuss.  He's in the ""What's in My Bag"" section.  He's their first ""What's in My Murse.""  - My what? - Murse.  Male purse.  That was my idea.          He's not even original.  Ashley Tisdale did vegan smoothie  in a Mason jar in her bag months ago.  I can't believe this right after  that stupid PSA went viral.  Ah, yes, you'll recall Rogelio was recently arrested.  Urine swapping is no joke; it's a federal crime.  Make no mistake: if you swap, urine big trouble.  - You mean the PP-SA? - It's not funny!  - I'm-I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - My reputation took a hit.  And now Esteban is featured in this magazine.  Do you know what that means?  He's on his way to becoming a crossover star.  I know you can't understand,  but this feels like a shot to the heart.      MICHAEL: No, no, no.  No need to yell at anybody.  Look, I get it.  You took a hit.  Just like  I took a hit.  But if I can recover from a gunshot,  you can recover from this.  You are right.  I'm coming for you  and your murse.  Ew.  Is he still sending you X-rated Snapchats?  I had to delete the app.    (yawns loudly)  I mean it, hon.  You look exhausted.  - Again, thanks. - I'm just saying  if you're still having nightmares every night,  talk to Michael, see if he'd consider  not going back to the force.  I don't want to.  Work's not even on his radar yet.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, the Villanueva house,  you'll recall, had flooded,  resulting in a little remodeling, resulting in  Ta-da!    That.  Ugh, I told you it was ugly  and it looks even worse in person.    Oh, you do not, you're just stubborn.  - Jane. - Mm?  It's awful, right?  It's, uh  It-it-it's, uh, def-definitely bold  and, but on the whole, eh?      Oh, um  Remember when I had the stomach flu a few weeks ago?  To clarify, Xo didn't have a stomach flu a few weeks ago.  She had a medication abortion,  which caused cramps, which she told her mother  was a stomach flu.  Oh, yeah, didn't I tell you I went to the doctor?  No.  Whoa, wallpaper.    Yes. Done. Used to it.  Any tantrums today?  So many tantrums today.  I, uh It's my fault.  I know I'm supposed to ignore him, but  he just throws down at the worst times.  I know. He does it to me, too,  but listen, I called the pediatrician.  You did?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Weird. They usually discuss calls first.  She said it could be because his routine is off.  And we have been trading days like crazy.  - I know, I know. - No, it's me, too.  I've been all over the place with the schedule.  But she suggested that we get him back into a routine.  Done. Up at 7:00.  Nap time at 1:00, bedtime at 8:00.  Perfect. And I'll start taking him  to the Parent and Me again at the preschool.  Great. Let's just make sure we still love it.  Why wouldn't we?  I just want to make sure.  I'm gonna text Petra, tell her to cover my meetings.  As a reminder, friends,  Petra couldn't cover any meetings since she'd been    ANEZKA: Don't tell me to calm down, Mother.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is who would cover the meetings.  I just got text from Rafael, saying I'm supposed to go  to Miami-Dade County Permitting and Inspection Center.  Okay, so you go to the meeting,  and if you do not have the answer,  you just act above everybody else, okay?  Now think.  What would real Petra do?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh.    ANEZKA: No, no.  - I'm done. - What?  Two weeks.  Once I got something to blackmail him with,  I was supposed to get his money and leave town.  I was only supposed to be here for two more weeks.  How was I supposed to know  he would turn himself in  for that insider training crap?  I can't do this anymore, Mother.      - You are not selling couches! - Please stop  screaming at me; this is very stressful situation.  I am sorry, Anezka.  But you can do this.  You just have to find something else to blackmail him with.  Okay?  JANE: Okay. Let me just call Michael.  So do you think she bought it  - about the medical bill? - Yes, totally.  - 'Cause I'm not sure. - Uh, hey, babe.  Yeah, I'm leaving the house now.  Hey, uh, I was just about to call you, actually.  Can you give me another half hour?  Detective Olivia just got here,  and we're going over some case stuff.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh. Guess work is on his radar after all.  Of course, no problem. See you soon.  He's with his new boss going over case stuff.  Hmm. It's fine.  It-it doesn't necessarily mean he's thinking  about going back to work soon.  MICHAEL: Of course I'm thinking about going back to work soon.  I mean, you know, not now I'm still six weeks away  from my physical, but when I start,  I want to hit the ground running.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Um, so  Just so you know,  when we get home, there is some major wallpaper drama.  I got it. What-what's wrong?  I'm just, uh  I'm thrown that you're thinking about working.  It's six weeks away.  At all, I mean.  Oh.  I'm sorry. I-I-I'm just terrified.  Mateo was kidnapped, you were shot  and the woman who did it is still out there.  Exactly. And I want to put her behind bars.  Yeah, but why you?  Can't it be anybody else?  No one knows the case better than me.  Your own partner shot you.  I'm sorry.  That came out wrong.  It's just that she targeted us twice.  A-and I would never ask you  except that you had offered to quit once before.  That's different. I was afraid I was going to lose you.  Are you saying I'm gonna lose you?  No, of course not. We're married.  Exactly. And you married a cop.  Okay, it's time to get our newlyweds home.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: On the bright side,  at least no one's thinking about having sex.      Nighty-night, you two.  Living the dream.  Hey, hey.  Come here, come here.  (moans)  This is exactly what I dreamed of.  I'm sorry about before.  - I didn't mean to get defensive. - No, no, no.  I was just surprised.  Well, look, I was thinking  Of course I'd quit if you couldn't live with it.  I can't ask you to do that.  But I would if it comes to that.  But the truth is, it's still six weeks away.  A lot can change in six weeks.  You know, I mean, six weeks ago  I could barely sit up.  And now I'm walking.  Like Charlie Chaplin, but I'm walking.  Recovery's a process.  Okay, let's just both see how we feel with more time.  JANE: I feel like a monster.  I mean, Michael's the one who got shot,  and he's comforting me?  Hey. You had a trauma, too.  Well, I have to get over it.  I'm going to; I've done some research.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Obviously. - And it says,  that you have to face your fears, so I'll  walk the Marbella hallway, I guess.  It's important to note,  that she had not been able to do so since the shooting.  And it says to try to get back into a routine,  which, luckily, is exactly what I'm working on with Mateo,  so that's that.      And for the record, that was that.    (yawning)  (mimics airplane buzzing)  (laughs)  (sighs)    Mmm.  (sighs)  ROGELIO: Can I just say, I hate montages?  It's a cheap ploy.  No. It's a useful way to convey the passage of time  as you inspire Emma Lazarus  to write her poem  for the base of the Statue of Liberty.  Who wants useful?  I want inspired.  I want transcendent.  I want a vegan smoothie Someone please.  You. In a mason jar.  Ay. Hey, Rogelio, what is going on  with you today? You seem out of sorts.  I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for a call from my agent.  I heard there might be a three episode arc  - coming up on Hawaii Five-O. - Mm.  I'm looking to make the leap from, you know, telenovelas.  Hmm. Good luck.  Thank you. Fingers crossed.  Back to the montage.    Is cane-walking an Olympic sport?  Because if it is, I'm signing you up, baby.  - USA! USA! - Yeah.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Anyway, you get the idea.  The routine part was going great.  (elevator bell dings)  - (gasps) - XIOMARA: You'll get there.      Xiomara    Yes, I'm sure.  XIOMARA: She knows.  I'm telling you this happened  when she first found out I was having sex.  She dropped hints and tortured me  until I finally couldn't take it anymore and confessed.  Okay, calm down, Cersei.  Abuela always asks you to go to church.  Twice in one day?  MICHAEL: Plus, there was the tampon thing.      Exactly. Don't forget about the tampon thing.  She has asked you if you'd needed tampons before.  - You didn't tell me that. - It wasn't important  because it was the way she said it.  It is important.  We need to be methodical about this.  Tampons go into the unknown column.  No jumping to conclusions.  - We need facts. - Yes.  Good. We need your detective skills.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, touchy subject.  What would you do if Alba was a perp?  I'd probably drop the word ""abortion.""  See how she reacts.  No way. She'll know.  Abort.  Good thinking. I'll drop ""abort.""  Okay. I got to get Mateo up from his nap,  so we are not late for his class.  Hopefully, Rafael still likes the preschool.  Uh, he will. He's just pushing back a little  because, you know, he's still in love with you.  (chuckles)  And you're married to someone else.  That's ridiculous. He's not still in love with me.  He definitely is.  I'm leaving for Mateo's class.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, Mateo's class,  which meant Rafael was out,  which meant Anezka had exactly two hours.  (door opens)  Ms. Solano?      What are you doing here?  Mr. Solano wanted me to drop something off in his office.  He said there wouldn't be anybody here,  so, what are you doing here?  Well after the whole insider trading scandal,  I don't trust Rafael with the finances anymore.  Wanted to take a look for myself.  I'll have to ask Mr. Solano about that.  No!  Easy there, Anezka. Remember    No, I I don't think that will be necessary Scott.  (gasps) Oh.  Ms. Solano?  Mm. I think with what's about to happen,  you can call me Petra.  - SCOTT (sighs): Oh! - (sighs)  Oh.  I've always dreamed about having sex with you.  That was better than my fantasies.  (sniffs, sighs)  And there were a lot of 'em.  - (laughs) - (sighs)  Oh, that was the best sex of my life.                              (phone rings, playing tune)  Whose is that?!  Oh, it's mine! Everybody, shh!  This could be about my big Hawaii Five-O arc!  Shh!  Hi there.  ROGELIO: Can you believe it's me  against Esteban for the part?!  And they want me to audition!  Is Esteban going to audition?  - Ah. Well - Then why won't you?  Because I shouldn't have to!  I've been in more hours of television,  I've won more Palomas.  Because you're the better actor, so go prove it.  Well, it's not only that, no.  My American accent might not actually be the greatest.  Really?!  - Really. - Try.  (in a strange accent): I would prefer not to try.  All right, come on, don't make a joke.  That was my try.  Okay, well, I'll help you with the accent.  Really?  Of course. I got the time.  See you next time, Mateo. God bless.  Okay. So that was fun, huh?  Mateo still loves it.  - Yeah, and the group's fine. - Mm.  But here's the thing.  I don't want to enroll him here for preschool.  Why? We decided months ago.  I know. Well, I changed my mind.  It's a little too Jesusy for me.  It is not Jesusy.    It's a Catholic preschool. What do you expect?  I wasn't really thinking. I just went along with it.  But now, things are different.  Why? What changed?  At this moment, friends, she thought about her mom's words.  Okay. Fine. I wasn't planning on making, like,  a big declaration or anything, but the truth is  Maybe Rafael was still in love with her.  I'm finally over you.  Or maybe not.  Oh. Well  c-congratulations.  Thank you.  Oh. It actually feels good. Really good.  'Cause it took so long, you know?  Yeah, totally.  And that kind of changed things,  because, the truth is, when I was in love with you,  I just wanted to please you.  I mean, I would wake up every morning and think,  ""What would Jane want? Like, what would make Jane happy?  What would make Jane smile?""  And now, I'm kind of like,  ""Oh, so what if Jane's upset?""  I mean, no offense.  No. No, no, none taken.  Uh so, what now?  Now we'll start looking for new schools  that speak to the both of us.  Ah.    (sighs)  Now there is a wait-list for every Parent and Me  that feed into a good preschool.  - I thought I had this settled. - ALBA: Xiomara?    Oh, right.  Um, actually, I decided to  abort that plan  and order Chinese food instead.  Anyway, it'll be here soon.      (phone buzzing)  - Hello. - So do you think she knows?  Oh, yes. Good. Uh, yeah, I was calling to see  if you had any slots left in your Parent and Me?  Oh, you're all filled up?  Okay, thank you.  - So what do you think? - Oh, Mom, please stop!  If you want to know if Abuela knows, just ask her!    (whispers): I'm sorry.  It's nothing.      I had an abortion, Mom.  And I didn't know if you knew.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I guess she didn't know.  MAGDA: Okay, so you had another setback.  Just stay calm.  How? There is new security  on his computer, Mother!  Scott says it's on all hotel computers. Scott says  Who the hell is Scott?  He works at hotel,  he wears these cute little vests.  And he's really sweet actually.  Ugh.  Petra hated that loser!  No boys, sweetheart.  You need to stay focused.  Remember old saying  You chase two rabbits, you get neither.  Now, listen, I want you  to try his personal laptop.  Okay, so my mom is going to pick you up for physical  therapy and bring you back here.  I should be home by lunch. Don't forget  your medicine, and you still owe me 15 hamstring  stretches from this morning.  - Got it. - I love you, Mom.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Did he just call her?  Mama. My hot mama.  Yeah, that's not making it better.  Okay. I love you, too.  Look, it's-it's really not that weird.  I really don't want to discuss it.  I'm just saying, okay? It's not a big deal.  I know it's not a big deal. That's why I don't want  to discuss it. Radio?  - (turns radio on) - No, no.  (turns radio off)  Just, now that I am no longer in love with you,  we've entered a new phase of our relationship.  Okay, this is the friendship phase,  which means that we can talk about this stuff.  Okay, tonight when you get home,  forget about the pills and the exercises and the schedules,  and just you know.  Yeah, I get it.  And while that is sound advice,  unfortunately, we can't do that at the moment.  Because of his recovery.  - So, wait. You guys still haven't? - Mm.  So you're a married virgin?  I am, yes.  A married virgin with a one-year old son.  (laughs)  - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - No, it's ridiculous, and so is  - discussing this with you! - No, I told you.  - I'm over you. - Yes. Yes, I know.  - I repulse you. - No. Look  You don't have to keep saying it.  I'm sorry. It was just a  It was a long recovery.  So what was the cure?      So I had to get over it.  Which is why we are here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. At Wincroft.  It's one of the most multicultural, multiethnic schools  you'll find in all of Miami.  It's definitely not economically diverse.  Actually, a full 20% of the students are here  - on need-based scholarships. - Now, here at Wincroft,  all parents are also required to volunteer  a certain number of hours a month at the school.  Can we send our nannies?  That's just one mom.  And speaking of another tense Mommy and Me  How can you be so self-righteous about this?  You told me to get an abortion when I was a teenager.        Stop.  I'm glad you told me that!  It helped me choose to have Jane.  And I have never regretted that, Mom.  But at this stage  in my life, I  don't want to be pregnant, and I don't want a baby.    - Miss, your kid just bit my son. - Hmm?  He did?! Oh, my God!  Well, what what happened?  I didn't see.  - Wait, what? - My son  has bite marks on his arm.  Well, Mateo's never bitten anyone.  He was sitting right next to him.  Well, Jack was also sitting next to him. Maybe he bit him.  (chuckles) Jack and my son are best friends.  They spend all of their time together,  and Jack would never do that.  Really? Maybe you should ask your nanny.  I see where your son gets his personality.  You know what, lady, bite me.  RAFAEL: You sabotaged it.  - I didn't. - You would've never done that  at the Catholic school.  I was just standing up for our son, okay?  Mateo doesn't b Ow!  I'm so sorry.  - XIOMARA: Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, - ALBA: SÃ­.  I don't think I'm going to hell.    Enough! Stop!  - I told her - No, no, stop!  I don't care! No more fighting in front of Mateo.  In addition to his tantrums, he is now biting people.  And he is not an aggressive kid. So we are all  gonna stay calm around him from now on, understand?!  Starting now.  Look,  I know how upset you are  about the choice I made,  but I made it  and it's done.  So can't we put this behind us and move forward?    (scoffs softly)  I'm spending the night at Rogelio's.  Abuela, just    (door opens)  (door shuts)      (sighs)  - (gulls crying) - (tropical music playing)  Um, so we didn't get to go to Puerto Rico  for our honeymoon,  so this is Well, it's not that.  But something else that Rogelio  and his Telenovela crew put together.  And, yes, he did pay them.  Michael  I'm sorry about the mom thing.  - (groans, chuckles) - It's just  we haven't had many newlywed moments, you know?  So, the plan was to sip margaritas  Ooh.  And listen to my kickass honeymoon playlist.  But now I'm thinking  the most romantic thing for you might be  to listen to my playlist  while doing some research on why kids bite.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm not gonna lie, it was just the most romantic thing  he could say.  ROGELIO (American accent): Dude, I love the ocean at night.  The waves are killer.  And then she realizes I'm the killer.  Well, your accent is getting so much better.  Thanks, homegirl.  I'm trying to stay in my American character.  I'm going full Daniel Day-Lewis.  Xo, what's bumming you out?  (sighs) It's my mom.  She's making me feel guilty.  N-Not for the abortion.  She's making me feel guilty about not feeling guilty.  Well, get your mother out of your head.  If you're sure about your choice, that's all that matters.  Keep it real, brah.  It's one of the things I admire most about you.  Thanks.  And could you maybe lose  the American accent  while you talk about authenticity?  Yeah.  So, why the sudden need to cross over to America?  You're-you're at the top of the Telenovela game.  It's just that my telenovelas are the most popular in Mexico,  where I'm like a Tom Cruise plus Justin Bieber  plus Juanes all put together, no?  But my home is not Mexico anymore.  Because of Jane, Matelio,  and, well, you,  it's here.  So now that I've crossed over to this family,  I want to feel the amazing perks of fame in my new country.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, that was just about the most romantic thing  he could say.  What's it say? Well, general consensus says  that kids bite because they are overwhelmed and uncertain  and they don't have the words to express themselves.  It's like this giant wave of tension that takes over  and they can't stop it and they just  - react without thinking. - Mmm.  Which is totally what I've been doing.  What?  Biting. W Not actually biting.  Just snapping at people.  Like, a lot.  My mom.  The preschool lady.  That guy at the gas station.  Oh. What happened with the guy at the gas station?  Let's just say that we both agreed that I should come back  - for an oil change another day. - (chuckles)  I think it's because I'm so uncertain.  I need things settled.  With me going back to work?  (sighs) I know you're just offering not to  to make me happy.  - That's true. - (chuckles)  But that's no small thing.  Yeah. But your happiness is no small thing to me.  You know? So it's a draw there.  Look, it-it's your job.  So if you're telling me that you love it  and that you're not scared and you want to go back,  then that's that.  But you have to say it,  so that I can flip the switch and move on.  I love my job  and I'm not scared  and I want to go back.  (clicks tongue, sighs)  Okay.  (sniffles) Great. So then you're going back.  And you're wearing a bulletproof vest every day.  (chuckles) I'm serious.  - Okay. - And I'm dealing with it now.  How, exactly?  No, you don't have to worry.  You know who said I don't have to worry?  My mom, when my parents were getting divorced, okay?  You're not my mom.  You're my wife.  Let me help you.  (crying softly)  I can't walk the halls.  Where you were shot.  I keep seeing you, lying there.  We'll do it together, okay?  God, this would be a great moment to have sex.  I mean, at this point, it just seems like a big cosmic joke.  (laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True to her word, on the day Jane flipped the switch  and accepted that Michael was returning to work,  she felt strangely calm.  Well, calmer.  There was still the whole school debacle looming.  WOMAN: And our motto here is, we don't care  if our kids leave here knowing their letters or their numbers.  We care if they can name their feelings.  - Yeah, there's no way he's going here. - Not a chance.  How soon can we leave?  Ooh. I just got an e-mail from Wincroft.  - What? - I wrote them last night.  Apologized. Basically ate dirt.  I'm so on my best writing.  Can you put your phone away?  - Why? - It's a no phone zone.  There's also a sign that says you can eat your boogers.  Who cares? We don't even like this school.  Holy crap! I fixed it! They invited Mateo  to join the Parent and Me. I'm gonna reply now  - before someone snags our spot. - Jane, will you wait? Stop. Just stop.  - Why? - 'Cause I don't like Wincroft anymore.  What? But that was your choice.  I know. It was. But yesterday afternoon  I got a call asking for a large donation  if I wanted to make the whole biting incident go away.  - What? - So obviously it's just not for us.  Oh, my God. You weren't gonna tell me.  - Admit it. - Jane  I would've  No, you wouldn't have! And then you were just gonna  make me feel like I ruined it for him!  WOMAN: Oopsie.  (chuckles) I am so sorry.  W-We know we should not be fighting in front of the kids.  Oh, no,  it's perfectly okay to fight in front of the kids.  The key is, you also have to make up in front of them.  That's how we model behavior. So  - Sorry, dude. Okay. We good? - My bad. Okay.  (laughs) That's not how we do it here.  Should we take them to the Compassion Corner?  CHILDREN: Yeah!  Go ahead. Mateo's Mommy, you're upset because?  I'm upset because Mateo's Daddy  didn't tell me something he should have.  And I should've. And next time I will.  - Cool. Forgiven. - Great.  So, so, so, let's get  under those big feelings.  Why didn't you tell Mateo's mom  the truth?  Because  I made a decision.  The first one in a while.  And I didn't want to lose credibility.  I felt it was important not to.  And Mateo's Mommy gets that.  But it's also not fair.  I know it's not.  But it's also a new dynamic,  and I want it to work.  And it will.  As long as you don't automatically turn  against something because I want it.  I just want to have a voice.  And you have such a big family, you know?  It's only me.  Us.  We're a family, too.  But I get it.  And I'm all for the new dynamic. I mean,  I don't have to talk about my sex life with you again  Oh, nice job,  Mommy and Daddy!  We're better together, together we're better   Take his ideas and her ideas and my ideas   And your ideas   Hey, uh, before we go, quick question.  How do you deal with biting?  It's just a phase.  And not your fault.  But next time it happens, don't give him attention.  Instead, comfort the victim.  (chuckles)  Hmm.  We found a preschool!  It's actually such a weird place.  Totally hippy-dippy, but we ended up loving it.  Oh go say hi to Michael, sweetie. Go on.  Where's Mom?    Come on, Abuela, don't be so stubborn.  If there's one thing that I learned at Mateo's new school,  it's that we should respect each other's differences.  And agreeing to disagree is okay, too.  Look. It's right here in this pamphlet.  I'm telling you, it's a great school.  MICHAEL: Ow!  He bit me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Quick! Comfort the victim.  Oh. Wow, Michael.  Are you okay?  I'm supposed to comfort the victim.  I'm so sorry that happened.  That was really terrible,  and you don't deserve that.    Michael  are you okay?  (sobs)  (quietly): I'm sorry.  What's going on?  I don't know, I (clears throat)  I think I I just suddenly realized that  (takes deep breath)  that I almost died.  I don't know why this is happening right now.  I guess it has something  to do with walking in the hallway earlier.  The victim thing.    I thought I was fine.  You are fine.  And we'll get through this.  - Really? - Mm-hmm.  'Cause right now would be a good time  to convince me to get a new job  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And as tempting as that sounded,  - Jane said - Not a chance.  You love your job, and you want to go back, remember?  (knocking)  I thought you were with the twins.  They're down for the night. Chepa's with them.  I wanted to talk to you.  What's going on with you lately?  You've been acting odd.  No, I haven't. (chuckles softly)  Yes, you have.  Okay, see? Wh-What are you doing?  - What is this? - And, friends,  that's when Anezka remembered Magda's words  Chase two rabbits, you don't catch either.  But then she remembered that one time  she did!    Second door on the right.  That's what's going on.  - SCOTT: Mr. Solano! Whoa! - Scott? What are you?  - That's one rabbit. - I'm turning around.  I'll be right out.  Oh, my God.  Why is Scott in your bedroom?  - Because I'm sleeping with him. - And that's two.  That's why I've been acting weird.  'Cause I'm sleeping with Scott.  And I didn't want to tell you, because I knew  you'd freak out, which is exactly what you're doing.  Because, honestly, it's a little embarrassing.  (sighs): But  well, I  I needed comfort  after my sister's i-illness.  One thing led to another,  and here we are.  And I really like him.  Again, I'm real sorry, Mr. Solano.  I wasn't expecting you, or I totally would have  - been dressed. - It's okay, it's okay. Just please stop.  - Please. - Hey.  I told him about us.  Uh yeah.  Uh oh.  ROGELIO: I think I'm going to be sick.  Esteban got the part.  They say it wasn't my accent.  It was my abs.  But who knows?  Well, don't even worry, your crossover moment will come,  and you won't have to change yourself to get it.  Thank you, Xiomara.  I'm going to put the disappointment out of my mind.  We're about to shoot a major historical event,  and I want to do it justice.              OTHERS: Yeah.              LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And suddenly, Emma Lazarus went from inspiring a country  to inspiring a wildly inaccurate Telenovela  to inspiring the star of that wildly inaccurate Telenovela.        Sorry. Sorry.  (clears throat softly) I'll stick to the script.  Don't worry. Let's go again.  (bell rings)  (phone chimes)        What's going on?  Tell her what you told me.    The other thing.                          Can I help you with the wallpaper?    JANE: I'm helping, too.  - I really hate it. - It's terrible!    Ah  the mother-daughter bond.  So sweet.  Don't call me stupid, Mother! I'm trying!  Sometimes.  Everything okay, baby?  Can I just say  I hate the way your mother treats you.  Man, if you think Petra hated being frozen before,  now people think she's sleeping with Scott.  Okay, listen, when you caught me in Rafael's office,  I wasn't checking up on the hotel's finances.  I-I was looking for dirt.  To blackmail him with.  That's what I assumed.  And so you know,  I've got dirt on everyone at the Marbella.  I've been collecting it for years.  It's my burn book, if you will.  Including good stuff on Rafael.  So  let's take him down together, baby.    Oh, dear.    But before we get to that, a bit of good news.  I, uh, I feel like I'm making progress every day.  Um, physically, mentally  And that shows in your test results.  Now, I can't clear you for police duty  for a few more weeks, but other than that,  you can resume normal activities.  All normal activities?  Sex. Can we have sex?  Oh. Y-Yes.  I mean, don't do anything crazy, but y-yeah.  - Seriously? - Really?!  I thought we were two weeks away still.  You can wait if you'd prefer.  - No! We're good. Yes. - No. No, thank you.  Thank you so much, Doc. We'll be in touch.  And, friends, I'm not messing around this time.  They're actually gonna do it!  Say good-bye to Jane the Virgin!"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so we ended on quite a cliffhanger.  I know you all can't wait  to find out how Jane's novel is coming.  JANE: It's a love a story  loosely based on my grandparents.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She had to throw her energy  into something, because she and Michael  weren't allowed to have sex yet.  See, after these lovebirds tied the knot,  that very night, Michael got shot.  Somebody, help!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!  These two have be through a lot.  It was my partner Susanna Barnett.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, and Susanna was Rose, to thicken the plot.  I'm giddy! I'm rhyming because it's about to get hot!  What's going on?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know. Straight out of a Telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this. Jane's father had dreams  of bringing his telenovelas to America.  And that's enough foreplay, people.  Let's get down to business.  (Michael and Jane moaning)  JANE: A little lower.  -  - MICHAEL: (grunts) There?  JANE: No. Uh, there.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Couldn't have you miss this moment.  MICHAEL: Uh, it's too big! It won't fit!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: They were doing it! It was happening!  JANE: Come on, be gentle with my box.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Jane and Michael were  finally moving into their own home!  And you have dirty minds, all of you.  Seriously, do you really need all this stuff?  It's me, my history, who I am.  We are not putting this up.  I know, but I can't throw it away.  Face it, you married a girl with a lot of baggage.  I love you and your baggage.  MICHAEL: Stop, stop.  - Two more weeks the doctor said. - Ooh!  Easier to do when we were living at home with my grandma.  Talking about your grandmother helps. Keep doing that.  We'll just keep busy.  There's so much to do around here.  Carpet installation, furniture delivery.  We'll whip the house into shape.  What?  We're finally living together.  Oh. We're finally living together.  I am interviewing my grandma for my thesis.  We'll do the interviews here.  Yes, good, we're gonna need  your grandmother around as much as possible.  Don't worry. We won't have a moment alone.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which seemed like a good enough plan until  -  - JANE: We can have sex?  You can wait if you'd prefer.  - No! No, thank you. - No! We're good.  -  - JANE: Okay, cancel the phone company,  furniture's not for another hour, Internet's after.  Trust me, it's not gonna take long.  Run! Run!     MICHAEL: Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!  I just can't believe this is actually happening.  I know. Me, either.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR Me, neither. What?  Oh, come on!  Dad, you weren't supposed to be here until 2:00.  No.  The movers are coming at 2:00.  My Tiago team needs to measure and prep first.  - Go! Go! Go! - Whoa!  - Oh. - This is gonna be a big job.  - The shed? - I am not having sex  -  - for the first time in a shed.  Hey, our neighbor, two doors down, Airbnbs his place.  75 bucks. Worth every penny.  They'll be done in 45 minutes, I'm canceling the Internet,  and there'll be a window before your physical therapy  - and my interview with my grandma. - Mm.  - Where do you want this? - Aah! I don't.  Please. Put it back in the truck.    Okay, Mr. De La Vega, that's the last of it.  - ROGELIO: Thank you very much. - Thank you.  Thank you so much for coming.  - Thank you, sir. - (sighs)  - Surprise! We're here! - Oh.    - Oh, you didn't have to. - Oh. Wow.  Of course we did! You moved in!  Also, I need you to help me  pick a dress for my Voice audition. I'm freaking out!  - Mom, right now isn't actually the - (phone vibrating)  Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!  My agent is calling.  A major network has my television formats.  They might make Tiago in English.  Give me good news, Barry.  Oh.  I see. We'll keep trying.  Apparently, they said it sounds like Quantum Leap  only it makes less sense.  Hey, it's okay.  - They just didn't get it. - I know.  It's just, rejection is so hard.  And I'm not equipped to deal with it  since it happens so infrequently.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's when Michael and Jane officially  saw their window of opportunity shut.  So drafty.      Jane. When am I getting your chapter?  Sorry! Uh, tonight, I promise.  I just want to wait until after I interview my grandma  so I can layer in a few more details.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall, she was basing  her thesis novel on her Abuela.  Well, just send it, okay? I need to see where you're at.  Okay.  (Xiomara singing in Spanish)  (sighs)  (Xiomara continues singing in Spanish)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And where are we at?  Ah. This must be Xo's Voice audition.  Amor.   Nice. Perfect.  So it says here you're a grandmother?  Yup. Bet you don't see a lot of grannies.  Seven this morning.  Now, tell me, Xo,  if you weren't a singer, what would you be?                JANE: Oh, wait.  - Abuela, stay in frame. - Huh?    Posterity.    Don't be so morbid.  Whoa.  Cecilia? As in your sister Cecilia?    Hey, hey, hey, is this really her?  Oh, my God.  - (sighs) - Um  Why didn't you ever tell me  she looks exactly like me?      Oh!  Abuela,  - whatever happened between you two? - Jane  Come on. I'm a married lady. You can tell me.  What could be so bad that you haven't spoken in 40 years? Hmm?      Why would she do that?                No! No, I'm not saying this stuff!  Stop writing. I've had it!  Nobody does things just to be a bitch!  Your grandma your grandma is the one being a bitch!    (door opens)  - MICHAEL: I'm home. Where are you? - In here!  Wait. What are you doing? Don't shut me down, bitch!  You have a deadline!  I'm sending Donaldson the chapter I already have.  Ay!  No one here?  No one's here.  (moaning)  Oh! (laughs)  (moaning)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, man, I'm prematurely excited!  I love you so much.  I love you so much.  (moaning)  Are you ready?  Yes.  Are you nervous?  A little.  Are you?  A little.  I want it to be good for you.  It's gonna be perfect because it's you.  - I love you. - I love you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  I can't show you what happened next, but let's just say    Wow.  You and me finishing at the same time.  About a good a first time as I could've wanted.  How do you feel?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A little different, honestly.  Good. I feel good.  Thirsty, though.  - Do you want some water? - Mm.  (sighs)  Okay.  I've had sex.  I am now a person who has had sex.  (sighs) Thank God.  Okay, know what? I feel like we should mark the occasion with  a glass of wine.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or sleep.  (sighs)  Maybe talk to someone?    (phone chimes)    Really? Now?!    (sighs)      Why is it taking so long to load?  (Jane and Michael kissing, moaning over speakers)  Oh, no. No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  - No! - What? What happened?  -  - JANE: Oh. (laughs)  (panting, moaning)  We made a sex tape!  - What? - And I sent it to my advisor!  What?!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, unfortunately, friends,  it wasn't the cartoon version.  Hey. Hi there.  If you want to know if I got your e-mail  asking me not to read your file in time,  the answer, unfortunately, is no.  Oh, my God. I am so sorry.  I-I had saved my grandmother's interview as ""Abuela Story""  - and attached it - That was not Abuela.  I know. I accidentally taped over it,  - and I saved the document as - The details are not important.  Agreed. Thank you.  Onto my work.  (sighs) Unfortunately, I didn't love your chapter.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, compared to the sex tape debacle,  this was music to Jane's ears.  I get it. I was actually in the middle of a rewrite,  and I was gonna add the main character's sister  I'm sorry, can I just say one thing  about the tape? Why do you kids  have to record everything? I mean, every snack,  - selfie, sexual encounter - No, I wasn't.  - Obviously, you were. And why? - It just happened.  I mean, I get the urge to spice things up  It was actually my first time.  Really?  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Well, that that explains things.  What things?  That's what's been missing from your writing.  You're writing romance,  but romance without sex, it's just, you know, fantasy stuff.  So use this, okay? In your in your writing.  JANE: She couldn't even look me in the eye.  Who cares? How was the sex?  Good. It was good.  Oh, no. What happened?  (breathes deeply) Okay, I'm gonna tell you something,  but you cannot tell anyone.  Obviously. Go.  I faked my orgasm.  (quietly): What?! Why would you do that?  I don't know.  I panicked. I-I could tell that he was about to  finish, and he was trying not to,  and I knew it was gonna take me a while  Oh, this is bad.  - I know. - Faking orgasms are for nights  when you need to get some rando out of your apartment.  - I know. - Not for the guy who you're supposed  to have sex with for the rest of your life.  I know!  I just I-I'm gonna tell him what happened, explain  No, no, no.  Stop. You cannot tell.  RAFAEL: Michael.  You're back to work already?  Not officially. Just, um  you know, stopping by, trying to get back up to speed.  (chuckles)  Um yeah, you, uh, you here about your family?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. His family.  To remind you: his mother, Elena Di Nola,  aka the Crime Lord Mutter, currently in jail;  his brother Derek,  - currently in the wind; - (wind whooshes)  and, of course, his sister Luisa,  still MIA.  -  - Ah.  -  - Here's Luisa.  So, yeah, I definitely need to catch you up on these two.    LUISA: So Susanna didn't exist?  - It was you the whole time? - Exactly.  I left some stuff in Miami that I needed to pick up  A record of the criminals' faces she changed,  and a cool $200 million.  And I realized  you wouldn't give me a second chance,  not if you knew it was me  Because you killed my father.  Yes. And I regret that.  But I love you, Luisa.  (whispers): I've always loved you.  Why are you talking in that creepy voice?  It wasn't supposed to be creepy,  it was supposed to be sexy.  See, I don't even know how to talk to you anymore.  You make me so nervous.  Oh, I make you nervous?  Yes! You're the only person that  I have ever felt this way about.  And you fell in love with me twice.  Let's build a life together.  Please.  Say yes.  (gasps)  If I have sex with you once,  it doesn't mean that I'm saying yes.        What's wrong?  Can we ascend?  Just to see if my brother  e-mailed me on my birthday.    See? He's written you off.  I'm the one that's here.  I know.  It's just that you killed my father. We're going around  in circles here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which is true, by the way.  They'd been circling the Great Barrier Reef  for the last month.  You need to make a decision.  I want to get off the sub,  go to my island, start our life.  What will it take for you to say yes?  I need to see your list.  The people I've slept with? It's long.  Of the people you've killed.  - Even longer. - BITCHY CECILIA: I told you.  I am not a villain!  And I won't be written like one! Ah?!  Access my sexuality,  like your writing teacher said.  I mean  I have orgasms, unlike some people.  Oh, sorry.  Was that too bitchy?  - (phone vibrates) - Oh.  (gasps) Mom! Hey, finally. I've been calling.  XIOMARA: I know. Sorry.  I didn't get a callback for The Voice.  Oh, no. I'm sorry.  It's all part of the hustle, though, right?  Maybe.  Maybe I'm done with the hustle.  What?  The producer asked me this question:  If I wasn't a singer, what would I be?  And  I don't know, it got me thinking.  I haven't really, seriously considered anything else  since I was, like, 19.  Because you love to sing.  Yeah, well  maybe it's time to move on.  What does she mean, ""move on""?  JANE: She goes through these phases  of self-doubt; she just needs a boost.  Like, um, another Paulina Rubio moment.  No, no, no, no. I cannot ask Paulina for another favor.  - Not enough time has passed. - What?  Celebrity friendships need to be very carefully calibrated.  Someone like Paulina, you ask a favor every  seven years.  Someone like Gloria, every 20 years.  Now, Oprah You just don't ask favors.  Your best bet is to ask Gayle.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Canadian celebs, well, you can ask anytime.  Michael BublÃ© has washed my car twice.  But he's traveling now.  Dad, okay, what about someone not famous?  Like a music executive who can  get her singing backup maybe?  Let me work on it.  Now, I have to run.  The CW is interested in doing an American adaptation  of The Passions of Santos.  What's The CW? Like a like a streaming thing?  No, no.  It's a huge network!  Look it up. Amazing shows.  Fabulous lineups!  Anyway, if everything goes well,  I'm gonna be on a plane to Los Angeles tonight.  Well, good luck.  Let me know how things go.  Ooh. (chuckles)  - Uh, where's Mateo? - He's napping.  Perfect. How much time do we have?  He'll be awake in, like, 20 minutes.  Sweet. I'll just do the same exact thing  I did last time, okay? Mwah.  Wait.  (moaning)  Hey, so, maybe we don't do  exactly the same thing as last time.  - What do you mean? Why? - Well, we can try something different  - for variety. - There's no time.  - There's 20 minutes. - Michael, wait.  Got to be efficient.  Uh, but I faked it.  What?  My orgasm.  Why-why why would you do that?  I got nervous. A-And I wanted it to be perfect,  and I saw that you were finishing.  Wow.  - I know. I'm sorry. - (sighs)  Have you faked it before when we did other things?  No. Definitely not.  Okay. We'll just start with the other things, then.  Thank you.      You know what? I just I don't think it's happening.  I'm too much in my head now.  (exhales)  ROGELIO: Boo!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of a buzz kill  Don't boo me, Rogelio.  But you're going to love The CW.  I don't even know what channel that is, and I own 50%  of the show, and I don't want to do business with you again.  Look I get that you're upset about our breakup.  This has nothing to do with that.  I've already been approached to do other shows.  I'm in talks with  But conquering the American market was your dream, too.  It was our favorite pillow talk topic.  Well, that and my erotic  (whispers) shadow puppets.  Come on.  Put your ego aside.  It's good business.  Fine.  Separate rooms.  I get the better view.  Done. So  we're going to Hollywood?  We're going to Hollywood.  We're going to Hollywood!  Major news. That's what they say here in L.A.  Everything's major, and gluten-free.  Anyway, major music producer friend of mine,  Hector, is free to go see your mom on Thursday.  That's great! She sings at the Blue Penny.  Hard pass. That place a dump.  Somewhere fancier.  The Marbella, perhaps?  - I could ask Rafael. - ROGELIO: Perfect.  (gasps) Oh, my God, that's a Kardashian!  JANE: And I know it's late notice,  but Rafael said yes. And since you're in good  with Diego, can you ask him to trade nights?  I don't know, hon.  This is all so much trouble.  What do you mean?  It's already organized.  Come on. I know you're down,  but this is a big shot.  Don't lose sight of what you want, who you are.  And who are you, Jane?  Not a virgin. Finally. (chuckles quietly)  So, what, are you going to use your sexual experiences  to write me? Okay.  Hmm?      Mmm, now you're talking.    You want to know why I told the world that Alba  wasn't a virgin?  Because sex should be celebrated.  (giggles)  And I was tired of your hypocritical Abuela  calling me a slut!  - Oh. - You're in a bit  of a sexual crisis, no?  So, what is your plan  about your failure to launch  with El guapo Michael?  Let me give you some advice, honey.  Turn up the seduction.  Kick it up a notch.  Now, remember, Dina, when we go in there,  don't fawn all over the executives.  A superhero for every weekday!  You guys are programming masterminds!  Rogelio.  I'm sure these are very busy people.  Maybe we should get to The Passions of Santos.  Yes, yes, of course.  - We love it. - It's major.  And we absolutely want to adapt it.  Wow!  That's such great news.  You have such great taste!  Right? So here's what we're thinking.  Two words.  No, four.  ""Rob Lowe as Santos""""  ROGELIO: Rob Lowe?!  Maybe as Santos's father!  Rogelio, come on.  Who cares? No one's even heard of this network anyway.  It's the armpit of American television.  I think we should take the deal.  - What?! - Look, I don't like it either,  but the truth is Rob Lowe can launch a series,  and you're just not famous enough in America yet.  Come on.  Put your ego aside.  It's good business.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of getting down to business  JANE: Hi there.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so I thought we could spice things up a bit.  (giggles)  I actually went to the store.  Sexy 'N' Wild Gel  with extra stimulation tinglers to enhance pleasure?  JANE: Ooh.  How's it feel?  Oh.  Oh, my God.  It burns.  It burns.  - Like a good burn? - No, not a good burn.  It feels like wasabi down there.  Oh, my God!  Ow, oh, my God!  - Ow, my I got to get it off of me! - Honey  -  - Oh, ow. (whimpering)  (water running)  Oh, my God, the water's making it worse!  Oh, I'm sorry, baby.  I was just trying to sex it up and get out of my head.  No, it's okay.  It was a good idea.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Ow. Uh, sorry. It still burns.  Right.  - Gotcha. - Ooh.  Maybe just  keep this between us.  I mean, I know it goes without saying.  But I just I just wanted to say it anyway.  I mean, you can tell people we had sex, but just  no details, right?  We should work this  glitch out privately.  Yes. Right.  Yeah.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  Oh.          I can't.        XIOMARA: Jane?  So what do you think of this one for the show?  So beautiful.  You look beautiful.  Wow. (chuckles softly)  So, I feel like I haven't seen you alone in forever.  How's newlywed life?  It's  going well really well.  Everything's great.  And Michael and I actually  We had sex.  (gasps) What?!  A couple of days ago doctor cleared.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  Why didn't you call me?  Oh, my God.  How do you feel?  Good. I feel good.  And how was it?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, Jane, don't talk about the glitch.  So great.  - (doorbell rings) - That must be your dad.  He's back from Hollywood.  Okay, I need details later.  (squeals)  (Mateo babbles) No, Mateo!  ROGELIO: I'm devastated!  Either I compromise the integrity of Santos  by aging him up significantly,  or I don't get to do the show at all.  But, Dad, you are Santos.      - Abuela. - Ma.  No, see, that attitude right there,  that's what I'm up against!  At the same time, I have to think as a producer.  So if this is the only way  the series gets made, maybe it's worth it.  No. There's got to be another way.  Is this the moment you cash in  on one of your biggest favors?  Two words. No, four words.  ""Gloria Estefan and Emilio  Estefan.""  Okay five words. They deserve five.  I will get Gloria to play a part in the American version  of Santos, and Emilio can produce all the music.  I may not be as big a star as Rob Lowe,  but add Gloria and Emilio  Boom! Basic celebrity math.  Can you really get them attached?  I'm cashing in a favor 20 years in the making.  HORNDOG CECILIA: Do me a favor,  and write me some hot sexity-sex-sex.      Agreed.    You had your burning bush moment; it was a sign.  Sex is all about intimacy between two married people,  which is why I told on your grandmother.  Don't lose your way now.  Sexual pleasure is not the most important thing.  That's why they call it Le petit Mort  ""a little death.""  It's small.  What's big is the connection between two souls.  Mm?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  So I just  I don't want you to worry tonight.  This is about our love, you know?  Who cares about the rest?  Mm.  What what do you mean?  Just that the most important thing  is our connection and intimacy  and  - What's wrong? - (sighs)  I'm just bummed that you think having sex with me is so bad  that you've given up any hope of having an orgasm.  No, no, no, no, that is not what I meant.  I just didn't want to pressure you.  I want us to get out of our heads.  Mm.  Well, I Now I'm in my head.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  I can talk dirty instead.  - Hmm? - Maybe let's just  r-relax.  We'll just relax.  LINA: You guys should just bite the bullet  - and try porn. - Oh, forget I told you.  The sex is good, and I've had orgasms since.  You're lying.  - No, I'm not. - (phone vibrates)  - Hey, Dad. - ROGELIO: Bad news.  Hector's schedule changed; he can't come now.  What? Oh, Mom canceled her gig at the Blue Penny.  What-what can I do?  I don't know.  But, Dad I found a list.  Of alternate careers.  I've never found a list before.  I'll get someone there.  Can we get back to the Telenovela?  Yes, of course.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And we should get back to ours.      (gasps)  I was just coming to bring you an e-mail.  It's from your brother.  When we ascended today, I checked,  and he didn't forget your birthday;  we were just a day ahead.  Thank you.  You jumped.  When I came in, you jumped.  Uh-uh.  RAFAEL: Hey, Luisa.  I don't know if you'll read this,  if you're alive, even.  But if you are, know that I love you.  And happy birthday.  And I miss you, okay?  I really miss you.  No reply?  Not yet.  Have you seen my dad?  Um, is that him over there with  Is that  Oh, my God.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God!  Oh, my God.  Jane! I want you to meet  my dear friends,  Gloria and Emilio Estefan.  Yes, thank you for coming.  We've been friends with your father  for over 20 years,  and he's never asked us for a favor before.  I just don't think that way.  So, we knew this must be major.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow! Just look at her.  Hey, I'm sorry. That fan is making me cold.  Should we sit?  Good evening!  Thank you all for coming.  Oh, wow, I see some guys  who usually come out to the Blue Penny. Hi, guys!  (crowd cheering)  Love that.  It helps with the nerves.  (chuckles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, that doesn't.  Uh  I'll just sing, then.  Amor, amor   Amor   NaciÃ³ De ti   NaciÃ³ De mÃ­   De la Esperanza   Amor   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Transportive, isn't it?  So  thank you for giving me the e-mail.  You didn't have to.  I want you to be happy.  I know.  That's why I can't say good-bye to my brother.  Not forever.  What if you don't have to?  You go back to Miami, tell the cops everything.  When I'm around your family,  I'll have a different face  That's the thing.  You around my family.  I've changed.  I'm done with crime.  You have to trust that.  And if you can't  If you're going to jump  whenever I enter a room,  then I'll drop you off at Port Kembla, you can fly home  and never hear from me again.  So?  What's it going to be?  LINA: So, what's the word?  What?  Everything good with you and Jane?  She told you.  Look, I'm here to help.  But I really can't diagnose a problem without a play-by-play.    GLORIA: So, tell us, Xiomara,  what are your goals as a singer?  (exhales)  I don't know.  What?  She wants to be one.  I am one.  But right now, career-wise,  I-I feel like I'm at a bit of a crossroads.  Interesante.  Well, what's more interesting  - is how much she loves singing. - Agreed.  Yeah, tell them about that, Mom, how you've been at it forever,  and she just needs her break.  XIOMARA: Or maybe I don't.  I-I have my weekly gig.  Maybe that's enough.  With no fame component?  Maybe I just have to accept that  that's not gonna happen.  Huh. Interesting.  I'd still sing.  I'd just pursue other things professionally.  Mom, come on, you're really gonna regret it  if you don't talk music with the Estefans.  I mean, that is their thing.  EMILIO: Actually, we have different, uh,  - dentures. - He means ""ventures""""  - EMILIO: That's what I said, baby. - It's true.  We have several restaurants;  we have a show on Broadway, On Your Feet;  and I also write children's books.  That's great! (chuckles) That's great.  You know, but that's just not really what you're known for.  Well, it depends on the circle we're traveling in.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure, like, in the circle of Earth  - ROGELIO: Jane. - I'm just saying,  right now's not the time!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no.  She can't control herself any longer.  It could be the time.  Okay, you know what, I just need you  to stay out of this, Gloria Estefan!  I'm so sorry, Gloria Estefan.  Okay, what the hell?  I'm sorry.  I don't know what happened.  But it just feels like you're giving up  on this huge thing that was so important to you for so long.  Ah.  What?  Just that  I'm realizing that this isn't totally about me.  What do you mean?  You gave up something pretty big lately.  My virginity?  No.  I'm happy it's gone.  I-I'm married. I have a kid.  It's been, like, this weight.  I've been dying to get rid of this for so long.  Oh, honey  This is so stupid! I'm married.  (sniffles)  I wanted it to be gone.  I don't know. I just  I feel weird.  Like  I lost something,  like a part of my identity.  (sniffles)  Yeah.  I get that.  And I blame the flower.  What?  ""It's perfect untouched.  Then crumple it up, now it's ruined.""  I know I'm not ruined.  But you feel like you lost something, and you didn't.  You just gained something.  A whole new dimension of your life,  your relationship.  What if we're not compatible?  It hasn't been great?  We're not really talking about it with other people.  Ah. Got it.  Okay, so you know, this has nothing to do with you.  But  with sex, it can take time to find your groove  and figure out what you like,  what you need.  You're just starting out.  You'll get there.  - (phone chimes) - (groans softly)    (scoffs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now to  (moaning, kissing)  Oh. Wow.  (moaning, panting continues)    (phone chimes)    Okay, I'm down to give porn a chance  That's not porn. It's us.  Yeah. Lina asked for a play-by-play.  I wasn't gonna give her that,  but I realized maybe it could help me figure out  where it went wrong.  So, um  There.  That was good, right?  - Oh, yeah. Yeah, I really liked that. - (Jane moans)  - Was that moan real? - Definitely.  (exhales)  And I liked that.  - That? - Mmm, yeah.  This sex tape's really turning me on right now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And again, friends,  I can't show you what happened next.  But let me just say    (Jackie Wilson's ""Higher & Higher"" playing)    Your love, lifting me higher   Than I've ever been lifted before   So keep it up   Quench my desire   And I'll be at your side forevermore   -  You know your love  -  Your love keeps lifting me   -  Keep on lifting  -  Love keeps lifting me   Higher   -  Higher and higher  -  Higher   -  I said your love  -  Your love keeps lifting me   -  Keep on  -  Love keeps lifting me   -  Lifting me  -  Lifting me   -  Higher and higher  -  Higher   All right     Mmm   -  Let me tell ya, your love  -  Your love keeps lifting me   -  Keep on lifting  -  Love keeps lifting me   -  Higher  -  Lifting me   -  Higher and higher, and I said  -  Higher   Sock it to me, all right   -  Lift me up, woman  -  Love keeps lifting me   By the way, I'm throwing out that flower,  make room in the closet.  Yes.

(laughing)    -  - (sighs)                What do you mean? I made it up.        - What letters? - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Her closet. Go!  Go!  No!    I'm out. Santos is a no-go.  What happened?  I know you spent your Estefavor on Xiomara,  not on our Santos remake!  And I am done being dumped for Xo.  I thought you said it wasn't about that.  Look  I didn't want to date you.  You pursued me.  And as soon as I realized I still had feelings for Xo,  I tweeted  And I should have called.  I'm sorry.  But I just didn't want to lead you on, romantically.  But you and I, we are soul mates, you know.  Okay, now what are you talking about?  Artistic soul mates. Think about it.  We keep coming back to each other,  because we're such a good team.  I want 51% of the show.  - Deal. - And you have  six months to get famous enough  to star in the American version,  or you have to go beg Rob Lowe to come back.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of coming back  Tell him what you told me.  All of it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so she did.  The sex, the submarine.  She told me to come here  - Which you did. - Tell you everything  Which you did.  Say that we broke up.  Which we did.  Although if they didn't, she'd be saying the same thing.  And Derek? What happened to him?    He's dead.  He was on her list.  Along with your mom.  I'm so sorry, Raf.  Wait, my mom's not dead.  What?  We need eyes on Elena Di Nola.  Now. Hurry! Now.  (coughs)  (strained): My son.  My son  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know, I know!  Now, that's what we call a big death."
"1 NARRATOR: All right, it's a brand-new day, friends.  And our Jane has a brand-new house.  And a brand-new relationship  with her baby daddy.  Now that I'm no longer in love with you,  we've entered a new phase of our relationship.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of changes, her mom was considering  giving up singing for a new career.  Oh, and Rafael's ex-wife, Petra, changed too.  See, last year she did something nice and subsidized  - Jane's new house. - Do they have any idea I'm the owner?  - They have no idea. - Since then, her sister, Anezka,  had paralyzed her and taken her place.  No boys, sweetheart.  You need to stay focused.  But she couldn't because she fell in love  with Scott, the manager of the Marbella Lounge.  And Rafael's sister, Luisa, had a change of heart  and said goodbye to her great love, Rose.  Otherwise known as the crime lord Sin Rostro.  - And Derek? - He's dead. He was on her list.  - Along with your mom. - Wait, my mom's not dead.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this,  Jane's father was a telenovela star.  And he was intent  on raising his profile in America.  And, oh, yeah, one last big change,  our Jane was no longer a virgin.  - Whoo! - So, yeah,  things are different all right.  Over the years, there have been a few times  when Jane almost left the nest.    She almost left for love     - Shh! - Her mother's, but still   Janie, you're gonna love it.  He has his own pool,  and you'll have your own bathroom.    Abuela, come on, she's sad.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She almost left because of anger.    XIOMARA: What, you'll kick me out?    Do it and I'll take Jane with me!        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She almost left for school.  -  - Bye    Ma! Yes, all right, I promise.  (squeals) Bye!    I couldn't sign the housing contract.  We live 20 minutes away, I'd save so much money.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Until one day,  she left for real.  So cute.  I hope they get the house done on time.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And I'm not gonna lie.  It felt   different.        Excited to dive in, find myself a career.  Ah.            Mm?  Is this from the Marbella gift shop?    - And you missed Jane. - (sighs)  It's okay.  I miss her too.      JANE: Yup.  Called it.  First two RSVPs, Mom and Abuela.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, good, there's Jane!  I was missing her too.  Okay, don't hate me.  I think the wall wants to be a shade lighter  Oh, my God, yes, I was thinking the same thing too,  but I didn't want to say anything.  No, we want it to be perfect.  Let's repaint this afternoon.  Eggshell  or matte?  Eggshell.  And can I just say  You sound so sexy when you talk home decor.  - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm.  'Cause I was thinking about a mirror  - (softly): Stop it. - in the entryway  Keep talking.  - A bowl of lemons - Uh-huh.  - (moans) - on the table for a pop of color.  - Just take off your pants right now. - They're coming off.  Oh, shoot, my dad's gonna be here soon!  So no?  So hurry!  (Jane moaning)   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup.  Things are different all right.  JANE: I'm coming, I'm coming!  (gasps)  Hey, Dad.  Mateo should be up from his nap  And I am gonna go change 'cause I'm running late.  No, wait, wait, wait!  Guess who I have a very special  meeting with tomorrow.  Amanda from my writers' group?        But more importantly,  Amanda the author of    It's being made into a Hallmark Christmas movie.  You could be looking at Logan McMurray, widowed,  devastatingly handsome baker!  Just don't wear those overalls.  Of course not, mine would be much more fitted.  Anyway, this could be the perfect role  to raise my American profile.  And hopefully, at the end of our meeting (chuckles)  Amanda will agree.  Dad  you're not planning on sleeping with her to get the part,  are you?  No, of course not.  I wouldn't do that.  Again.  Good, just making sure.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of sexy times  Oh, oh, God, look, Petra, babe, I got to go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To remind you, that was not Petra.  I just can't help myself, you're just so  handsome.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Obviously.  (both moaning) You'll recall we left these two  considering blackmail.  I've got dirt on everyone at the Marbella.  Including  good stuff on Rafael.  So  let's take him down together, baby.  Mm.  Mm. But listen  first  we've got to turn this hotel around.  'Cause money's tied up in it, and it's a ghost town.  Which brings us here, now.  Okay, just be prepared  The staff isn't going to like it.  Oh, don't worry. Last week, I threatened to cancel  Jane's mom's gig unless she publicly backed  the Flamingo Initiative.  What the hell is the Flamingo Initiative?  So, guys, we're damn near sold out for our first theme night  Flamingo Friday.  Ladies your outfits.  -  - WOMEN: Ugh  WOMAN: What?  Oh, wow. How fun.  Super fun. Exactly. Thank you, Jane.  Guys, we're just going no shirts, pink bowties.  Just really classic sexy.  On to other orders of business. We're phasing out  bussers in the afternoon,  so shifts are gonna be 45 minutes longer.  - Wait, what? - Don't gripe.  It's economical. You'll make more bank.  No, we won't.  Because service will be terrible.  Well, it's happening. Deal with it.  This is ridiculous. You need to talk  to your baby daddy.  Lina, his mother just died.  - Fine. Your sister wife. - You need to,  'cause her creepy boy toy's out of control.  (sighs)  Sorry, Scott's the boss of the lounge.  Take it up with him, not me.  Petra, come on. Can't we talk about it?  No.  Look, I-I know things  have been complicated between us.  Because of what I said  you know, when we fought  before the wedding.  A reminder: Anezka has no idea  what she's talking about.  Yes. Exactly.  And I get that.  I-I do. I mean, it was awful of me  to imply that I think that I'm a better person than you.  Even just hearing it again is a shock.  Yeah, but you remember what was going on.  - Not a clue. - Of course.  And I don't want to rehash it.  So let's just steer clear of each other.  - What? - Do I have to be explicit, Jane?  I don't like you. I never have liked you.  Our babies share a father. That's it.  Okay, you know what?  Fine with me.  I'm done trying with you.  You're toxic.  DENNIS: Poison.    Most likely administered transdermally.  - (camera shutter clicking) - Could've been someone who  bumped into your mother  Got it. I appreciate the update.      Anything come to mind at all, why she would  - leave you that Bible? - No idea.  My mother wasn't religious.  She was a homicidal maniac.  I'm sorry, I just want to put  this whole thing behind me.  I didn't know her. I had no relationship with her.  And it's painful, frankly.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall Luisa recently returned  from a submarine with another homicidal maniac.  It's actually not  painful.  I'm fine, okay?  Okay.  MICHAEL: Okay   what do you think?  I think it's perfect.  I love our house. Me, too.  Me, three!  What about you, Mateo? Hmm?  You excited to grow up here?  Listen to stories in that room  Come in late, after curfew, through that door  (laughs): Hey!  MAN: Okay, you guys are gonna feel right at home here.  Excuse me, what are you doing barging into our house?  Yeah, this definitely isn't your house.  - Who the hell are you people? - Uh!  Okay, do not swear in front of my baby!  - Now, what the hell is going on? - I manage this property.  And we rent this property.  Then how come I have no idea who you are?  We put off moving here because my husband  - was in the hospital. - (man clears throat)  If the place isn't for rent,  - should we ? - No, it is for rent.  Come on in. Come on in. Have a look around.  As you can see, it's freshly painted.  JANE: No, do not look around.  - And that fresh paint is ours! - Okay,  look, there's obviously been a mix-up.  We signed a lease.  This is our realtor.  (laughs): Yeah. I know this guy.  Reps a couple of deadbeats who stopped paying last month.  Oh, that's you guys.  We are not deadbeats.  I personally pay a thousand dollars a month.  Well, first of all, rent is 2,000 bucks.  What?! That's not what he told us.  Okay.  Please, just give us a couple of days  to figure this out, okay?  You know where we live. (chuckles)  So until recently,  someone has been covering half our rent  but keeping it a secret? Who would do that?  Nah, it wasn't me.  He says it wasn't him.  So who would  Nope, not me. But if you need me to  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Amanda's coming.  Good luck. Tell her I said hi.  No offense, but you're not really a value-add.  (sighs)  Amanda.  (whispers): Wow!  How fun it's been catching up  and hearing all about your jet-set life  But you want to talk about the movie.  Well, I'm here,  which means that you're in the running.  Well, in that case,  how do I get to the finish line?  That's your daughter's boyfriend, right?  Huh?  (laughs) ROGELIO: Oh.  Rafael? Ex.  He's a real cutie.  Is he?  Huh. Anyway, back to Sprinkled With Love. The way I see it,  the cookie is a metaphor I have a charity event in Coral Gables.  Nothing would give me more pleasure  than to have a gorgeous man on my arm.  - I wanted to ask you - I'm in.  But now I'm thinking Rafael.  Excuse me?  It would make me very happy.  And those vicious charity bitches  very jealous.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Tough choice.  On the one hand, he's just been insulted to his core.  On the other hand .  (dings)  Of course.  I'd like nothing more than to set you up with my  gorgeous friend.    (elevator doors close)  It is true.  You are extremely handsome. I never noticed before.  Can I help you with something?  Swoon-worthy looks and endlessly generous.  You are a prince among men, Rafael Solano,  which is one of many reasons I consider you to be  a very good friend.  What do you want, Rogelio?  The woman I was eating lunch with  will decide my American fate.  Either she will cast me as a stoic, sexy baker  or I will wallow away in obscurity.  And all she requires is a date with you. (chuckles)  Are you trying to pimp me out?  Absolutely not!  No sex required.  Though if the spirit moves you  (laughs)  The answer's no.  (elevator doors open)  JANE: Still no word from the realtor?  (sighs) Well, keep trying. I got to go  before I drop these stupid flamingos.    Abuela?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh! I love the Marbella  - Gift Shop. - Sorry,  World's Worst Boss is demanding  that we stock the new flamingo merch ASAP,  - and prominently. - Take me home,  Alba.    I don't pay you to visit  your granddaughter.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like Jane may not have  the world's worst boss after all.  JORGE: You have to hear this.  Magical. Clearest ocean sound you ever heard.  Come on.    What are you doing here?      Aw.  - I miss you too, so, so much. - Oh  I wish I didn't have to go back to work.    Mwah.      Gracias.        I got a job!    No, listen!  I'm a teller at Sunrise Mutual  West Miami!  I get a 401k,  regular 40 hours a week,  and a parking space that says âReserved  for bank employee.â Which will be great  once I can afford to get a car!  I'll have to switch my dance class  to weekends but that's okay, and (gasps)  look.  New outfits. Xiomara    Abuela.  Be supportive.  - (exhales) - XIOMARA: I'm not looking for passion.  I'm still singing on weekends.        LINA: Whoa, slow down.  I forgot to give you  the list of demands to sign.  List of demands?  âFrom servers to management,  ""or else we walkâ"" A walkout?  Scott is a dictator.    A revolution is afoot.  Conditions are untenable.  Come on. If you don't sign,  I learned the word âuntenableâ for nothing.  - We're all in the same boat, right? - Yeah.  Okay, I'll sign, but I'm gonna give Rafael a heads up.  See? Right there, where I wrote âhereby and heretofore.â  (quietly): That's right.  Oh, my God.  The realtor. I've been trying to reach  this guy but he hasn't been returning my calls.  Need to talk to Petra Solano, where do I find her?  Excuse me. Jason Tartuffe?  Oops. Wrong hotel, never mind.  No, stop. I heard you asking for Petra Solano!  Stop! I'm the wife of a cop and I will arrest you!  Is that a real thing?  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Definitely not. - Oh, it's a real thing.  Now, answer the question. Why are you looking for Petra?  Look, she paid me to keep quiet,  but she's the one who's paying half your rent.  - What? - Or she was.  I'm out several months in commissions.  She won't return my phone calls.  It was  Petra?  I just found out  what you did for Michael and me, with the house.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Again, I'll remind you that Anezka  has no idea what she's talking about.  Oh. Well, you're welcome.  A-A gift like that  No, it was just a little something  A house isn't exactly a little something!  Well, by my standards, it's a very small house.  But yes, you caught me, I bought you the house.  Well, you mean rented.  It's the same word in Czech.  Anyway, let's not make a big deal of it,  I was making a gesture, and you're  - very welcome. - Got it.  You know a-and this is awkward, uh  but why did you suddenly stop the payments?  That terrible fight. When you called me a bad person.  I was I was so angry. And then I meant  to start paying again but Anezka fell ill  Well, look.  Michael and I obviously can't let you pay for it.  But the gesture was so  kind. (chuckles)  Come over to the new house for dinner. Oh  You wouldn't have done it if you didn't care, deep down.  Doesn't makes sense.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so what could she say, but  Of course.  Scott and I would be happy to come for dinner.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And what could she say but  Right. Scott too!  Great!  Can't wait!    Hey. Hey.  Are the girls asleep?  You can go, then.  (beeping)  Hello, Anezka. (shrieks)  We need to talk.  Who are you?  Your mommy's friend from the inside.  Out on good behavior, but don't let that fool you.        I'm here to relay a message from her.  You guys had a plan. Finish it.  But now's not a good time to sell my shares at the hotel.  Like, they'll be worth more if build it up, wait a bit, uh  - Flamingo Friday - I don't give a rat's ass!  You've got 72 hours to sell  and get her a good lawyer, or else I make sure  everybody knows exactly who you are.  Got it?  MICHAEL: Petra?  She and the vests guy are gonna be  our first and last dinner guests?  Come on, it was so nice of her.  And  maybe they won't be our last dinner guests.  I mean, I've been thinking. If we cut corners here  and there, maybe we can stay.  That's your filing system?  Well, this and the other box, yeah.  First things first. Fixed expenses:  - rent, food, gas, internet. - My student loans.  I thought you paid it off.  One. I found out the other has another two years.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Found out? - All right.  So, let's list all other expenses,  and then we'll start cutting.  No way, I need my NBA sports package.  You don't need it.  Have you ever heard of a library? I like to underline things.  Okay, fine.  (pained): No more buying books.  $170 for Mateo's Toddler Gym?  I'm assuming that comes with illicit baby steroids.  Yeah. Rafael pays for so much Mateo stuff.  I have to cover something.  Spotify or Pandora?  One movie a month?  - Lost it. - Cut it.  Done. And with this new budget we are  (hits a key, cash register sound)  still $280 short per month.  (crickets chirping outside)  We'll sleep on it.  (Michael sighs)  I think we should go to my dad.  $280 a month is not a huge ask  - Really? - It'll be a loan.  We'll absolutely pay him back.  I love this place.  Let's do it.  While we're on the topic of doing it  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, you can't put a price on  that kind of happiness.  I need to withdraw $5 million.  Can you help me with that?    Sure. I'd be happy to.  CUSTOMER: I'm buying a yacht. And, uh  I would love to take you on it.  (chuckles) LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So yeah.  Obviously, that didn't happen.  30  - (sighs) - 35  40. These bills are sticking together!  You asked for crisp, new ones, so  Because they're for  my grandson's birthday!  You need to fan 'em out first.  Yeah, okay. Well, next time.  (groans)  You forgot to say âThank you for choosing  ""Sunrise Mutual West Miami for your financial needsâ""  - And that's pretty important. - Got it.  ""Like, okay. You're saying âgot itâ""  But you said that last time.  And then you forgot again.  Well, this time I really got it.  Mm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah. Someone made a big mistake.  ANEZKA: I'd like to sell my share of the hotel.  - What? - And I I know  - it seems sudden. - Yeah. Of course it's sudden.  You've been driving up all these big changes  - and now you want to sell? Why? - Because of Scott, actually.  It's not good for our relationship for me to be  - working so closely with you. - I am not interested  Yes, I know. You made that very clear.  Nevertheless, there is a lot of baggage here.  - And we'd like to make a fresh start. - You know you need permission  - from me and Luisa to sell. - Yes. I know. And  if you don't give it to me  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She'll blackmail you  - with all of Scott's dirt! - Look, first, let me just see  if I can put some money together to buy you out.  Oh.  Yeah, that-that would work.  RAFAEL: And then she told me I had 48 hours,  which is crazy.  I think there's something going on.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes, finally!  - Like what? - She's not herself.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Warmer. - I think Scott's blackmailing her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Are you serious?  - Are you serious? - Well, it happened with Milos.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Colder! Colder!  I mean, I'm having dinner with them tonight.  I'll suss out the vibe.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, whatever.  I'm not gonna get my hopes up.  Oh, before I go  From my dad.    JANE: It was so awkward.  But I couldn't say no to my dad.  Oh, yeah, I hear you. Cost of doing business.  I had to meet him for a guilt mani-pedi today.  I'm sorry, I can't watch this.  (laughs) Show off.  Michael!  We agreed no more venti lattes.  Okay, I was in a hurry. The drive-thru was right there.  The budget only works if we both stick to it.  Oh, yeah? That doesn't look like two-buck Chuck.  That's different, it's for Petra,  who did a really nice thing for us.  Besides, it comes out of the entertainment budget.  We'll just not see a movie this month.  Fine. Then I'd like my non-movie  to count towards my coffee.  You can't do that.  Your latte is not entertainment.  That's not true. I had a good time, okay?  (doorbell rings)  Better than I'm gonna have at this weird dinner party.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now,  to the     Is that dressing gluten-free?  I'll check.  Thanks.  Oh, no red for me.  I get heartburn. Do you have any white?  Yeah.  Babe, be reasonable.  Now is not a good time to sell.  I just want out. Flamingo Friday's booked solid.  We're turning the hotel around.  The staff is planning a walkout.  No gluten. Yay!  (phone chimes)                  It was so great.  It's just the door on your left.  Let's make a deal.  Before you go to the bathroom?  Petra told me about your financial predicament.  That extra grand a month you need?  What if the hotel covered the discrepancy?  We'll make it an official position  Social Ambassador And all you have to do  is get the rest of the staff to show up  for Flamingo Friday and support our other initiatives.  You're offering me money to sell out my friends.  Oh, get off your pedestal, Jane.  Everyone's for sale.  Well, I'm not.  Your loss.  I'm sorry, I just have to ask.  You and Scott, is it  a Milos situation?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To be clear, Anezka did know  all about Milos.  You think I'm with Scott because he's blackmailing me?  No, I just meant, um  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I got nothing.  That's exactly what she meant.  This is why I don't want to spend any time with you.  This is why I want out of here,  this judgment!  - No. - What's going on, babe?  We're leaving, that's what's going on.  Right now!  I feel terrible. I have to find some way  - to make it up to her. - Or not.  I mean, she's clearly trying to distance herself.  - But she's family. - Family's overrated.  They just ask you to do things,  like go to weird charity events  so their dad can be in sexy baker movies.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, that old chestnut.  Did I thank you profusely?  You did.  JANE: Okay, I have to get back to my shift.  And you're sure you're okay with the walkout?  Are you kidding? I hate this whole flamingo thing.  - (doorbell rings) - I'll talk to you later.  I've been looking for you.  I was hoping we could talk?  I told you, I am fine.  No, um  I'm not.  I'm sorry,  I just I came from the police station,  and talking about Rose again  and what happened, and going over the details,  I'm feeling a little unhinged.  Like I got  Like, I need to drink.  Um, so I just thought, that, um, it was better  that I wasn't alone.  Oh, okay. Yeah.  Um, I just have this charity thing later.  I could come.  Hey!  Ma, you scared the crap out of me.  Wait, why aren't you at work?  I quit. I had to. It was so depressing.  Please, don't tell Abuela.  She was so proud of me.  She's gonna find out eventually.  No, I worked it out.  I find a new job, and then I tell her I was so good  I got poached.  Well, start your job hunt somewhere else.  I gotta go. The wait staff is meeting downstairs  before the big walkout.  Okay. Good luck.  Power to the people.  ALBA: Xiomara?    Oh, hi, Ma.  Thought I dropped an earring back here.    The other day. Anyway, it's not there.  I should go, uh, I've got about ten minutes of break left.    Um, okay.  Thanks. Just drop me outside.  XIOMARA: Ma, there's nothing really exciting in here.    But Mrs. Cohen looks tired.  Eh, I need cash.    Hey buzz me in, all right?  I forgot my phone in the break room.  I I'm sorry,  but you're no longer an employee.  Come on, Caitlyn, do me a solid.  - Security? - I bought you a venti latte!  Ma'am? I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.  Xiomara?  I quit, Ma, okay?  I quit.  JANE: What's wrong?  So I made some calls today, trying to save some money.  Got us a family plan for the cell phones,  better rates on car insurance.  That's great.  I also called Mateo's gym class.  Yeah, I was a little surprised when they told me  the monthly fees were already covered by Rafael.  I thought there must be some kind of mistake.  My wife would never lie to me  about something like that.  I'm sorry. I padded the budget.  You know, just in case we need money for an emergency.  Look, I grew up always worried about money.  So tell me, don't hide it from me like I'm a child.  You have a shoebox for your files.  Okay to be clear,  I'm the one with a stable government job and a 401K.  I've been paying my own way on my own for a decade.  Until last week, you've been living with your family.  - To avoid debt while in school. - Which your dad pays for!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is going downhill fast.  Look, I have been financially responsible  my entire life.  You know that I helped support my family.  (phone chiming)          LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She does need the money.  I have to go back to work. Can you  Stay with Mateo? Yeah. See ya.  So what changed with the staff?  Just didn't make sense.  What if we all got fired? We need the money.  It's not like we do this job for fun.  (clears throat)  At ease.  So you decided to show up.  Yes. And look  I am sorry about last night.  Oh, you mean when you suggested that my girlfriend  was only with me because I was blackmailing her?  Look, I didn't mean  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, still got nothing.  You meant it.  How would you like it if I tried  to ruin one of your relationships?  Lina, you cash that check yet?  Oops, I'm sorry. Did I just ruin one?  You took Scott's bribe?  It's an extra thousand dollars a month.  I know. I turned it down because of all that crap  you gave me about whose side I was on.  - Jane - I don't even want to hear it.  Oh, the pink, I love it. So classy.  Thank you again for going with Amanda.  Yeah, well, thank you, too, for babysitting.  It's my pleasure.  We're going to have fun.  Just so you know, the word âbabysitâ is  a trigger for me.  I-I had my first drink with a babysitter.  - I know a lot about addiction. - Really?  - Are you in AA? - No.  I am in S.A.G.  Otherwise known as Screen Actors Guild.  And I once played an alcoholic flight attendant  in the telenovela Addicted To Love.  Would you like to see it?  XIOMARA: I recorded your novela.  Gracias.    You were so proud of me and so into the idea  of me as a banker.      Jane thought the bank was a horrible idea.    Why didn't you just tell me how you feel?    Try harder.        Ma  there's no way we're going back.  I'm not 17 anymore.  I know I need your opinions  so I don't make dumbass moves like moving my whole dance class  schedule to become a bank teller.  (chuckles)  You guys got this.  (sighs)      Good advice.  And Ma  Hmm?  You do have your green card now.  If you hate your job so much, you could make a change.  ROGELIO: But it was too late.  They had found each other.    (gasps)  (women shouting)  (both shouting)    Classic catfight.  Every telenovela has one.  And then we all make love.  Is this helping at all?  (sighs)  No.  If anything, seeing you chug  that tiny bottle of vodka when you realized that  it was Pilar that hit the attendant call button  just makes me want to drink more.  Okay, I get it.  Well, in that case, we have to get  to the root of those feelings.  Did you study psychology?  You could say that.  What school of thought?  Meisner.    I've never heard of him.  Where does he practice?  In the heart of such performers  as Sandra Bullock, Tom Cruise, and James Franco.  All of whom have used his techniques  to get underneath emotions.  I'll say a phrase, let's say,  ""âYou're an alcoholicâ""  and then you'll repeat it, but with âIâ.  ""âI'm an alcoholicâ""  I'm an alcoholic.  You're an alcoholic.  I'm an alcoholic.  One more, yes, please.  Actually, I really should be turning in.  Oh, no.  Oh, it's only 9:00.  I hardly got to talk to you at the event.  - Yeah. - Why are you playing so  hard to get?  I'm not.  Though, that's exactly  what you'd say if you were.  LUISA: I don't like this.  - You don't like this. - I'm not good at this.  - You're not good at this. - I'm not good at this.  - You're not good at this. - I'm not good  - I'm not good. - That's it. Keep going.  - I'm not good. - Find your character.  I'm a terrible sister  and that's why I want to drink,  so that I don't feel this.  Why are you terrible?  Because all I do  is cause Rafael pain.  (whispering): And I think my ex-lover killed his mother.  I've been there.  In real life.  My telenovela was ripped from the headlines.  Go on.  I just feel so bad, you know?  My brother doesn't deserve this.  No matter how many times I've failed him,  he's always been there for me.  And then now that he has no family,  I still can't pull it together and be there for him.  Rafael does have a family  the Villanueva family.  As for you  Ricardo said it best when he was about to join  the mile-high club with Pilar during heavy turbulence.  âPut on your own oxygen mask  before assisting others.â  She's asleep.  And we've decided she's going to rehab.  Preventative.  Really?  And may I just say  you're a good, good man, Rafael Solano.  And I'm sorry I didn't realize that earlier.  It's okay.  But I do think I should tell you  I don't think you're gonna get that part.  It doesn't matter.  You're more important.  Come.  Let's get a drink.  We can, you know, because we are  not alcoholics, thank God.  Another blessing we share,  besides our great looks. (chuckles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, birds of a feather  which brings us here   now  to the flamingo fandango!  Look at you two, all buddy-buddy.  Why did you never tell me what a wonderful man Rafael is?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And maybe it was the sight  of her daddy and baby daddy  getting along,  or the fact that she was  fighting with her best friend  and her husband   but when Jane saw Petra   well   she was determined  to make things right.  Hey.  Did you sell the hotel?  I'm working on it.  But, uh, it's not enough time.  - It has to be. - It's not!  Just tell my mother, I it-it's happening, okay?  I-I-I got her a lawyer. I  Okay, I-I know  this is a lot to ask  Just leave me alone!  (shouts)  (gasps)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow!  Straight out of a telenovela.  So, yeah,  that obviously didn't happen.  Oh, sorry, my bad.  It actually did.  That's it!  We're out of each other's lives for good!  So, thank you  for having my back.  Always, you know that.  Okay, about the money.  Things are different now.  It's not the same as when we were kids.  I mean, you have a rich dad, and a rich baby daddy  to fall back on and I-I don't have that.  Yeah.  That's true.  Michael reminded me of that.  I guess it's just all so new, I-I forget.  I think we should move into a smaller place.  I grew up stressed about money.  And living above our means is stressing us out now.  And I don't want that  for us or Mateo.  I was thinking the same thing.  Not about childhood, but about Spotify  - and lattes, and - (chuckles)  I just want us to be able to have fun.  Exactly, me, too.  We'll move into a one bedroom.  We only have Mateo half the time.  Perfect. We'll just move back  to a bigger place when we can afford it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends,  they really believed  that would happen   but we're not there yet.  We're here.  So, this isn't a housewarming anymore.  It's a good-bye party.  ALL: Salud!  (chuckles)  Oh!      - Huh? - What?      No way.  That's perfect for you.  Oh, Ma. You really do love that little store.  Mm-hmm.  So, I didn't get the part.  That's the way the cookie crumbled.  I'm sorry, Rogelio.  I know you really wanted it.  So, uh, so, what's next on the 87-point plan for, uh  American superstardom?  I'm glad you asked.  My new friend, Rafael,  got me a meeting with his friend,  an independent film producer.  Oh. Come on, Michael. Don't be jealous.  I can be friends with both of you.  Oh, I'm  I'm not jealous. Rafael and I, we're cool.  Sorry, excuse me.  Come on.  Don't shut me out.  Hey, hey, looking good, my friend.  Ah, we miss you down at the station.  (sighs) Eager to get back.  Two weeks until my physical.  So  Rafael told me Luisa left for rehab.  Yeah, this morning.  We've got eyes on her.  If she contacts Rose, we'll know.  Good.  Anything new in the Bible?  DENNIS: They combed  through it page by page.  Four underlined words  from four different passages.  âAngels  guard the sun.â  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What the hell does that mean?  âSunâ like   or like her son?  Look, realistically, I need more time.  Well, you don't have more time.  I'll find another buyer, Milos perhaps.  You can't sell your shares without my permission.  Then give me permission.  And your shares too, while you're at it.  What?  Or I'll send you to jail.  What are you talking about?  You had a deal with the police.  You confessed to insider trading.  They dropped the charges with the assumption  that you had no other illegal dealings, right?  However,  when your father died,  his finances were a mess, weren't they?  An illegal mess, in fact.  You covered it up.  How did you ?  Scott befriended the accountant's assistant.  Never overlook the little guy.  Look, I was protecting my father's legacy.  Which was a big mistake.  And I will tell the cops,  unless you sign your shares over to me.  You have 24 hours.  Don't test me.  (shrieks)  Oh, you-you startled me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, in that moment,  Jane, well, she had a revelation.  (sighing): I still can't believe they're together.  Look, I-I know things have been complicated between us.  A house isn't exactly a little something.  Hi. (shrieks)  You okay?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And all I can say is  This might sound crazy, but  I don't think that's Petra.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's about damn time."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, here we go.  Jane got married to Michael, but she had a son with Rafael.  And Michael and Rafael were  yeah, pretty tense.  Also tense, Jane's father, Rogelio.  See, he was in a race with his rival, Esteban,  to make the leap from telenovelas  to American levision.  Unfortunately, Esteban had the lead.  ROGELIO: Esteban got the part on Hawaii Five-O.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But, Rogelio had a new best bro,  Rafael  He's a real cutie.  Who he recently discovered was handsome.  And Rafael said he'd introduce Rogelio to his friend,  a big-time Hollywood producer.  Oh, and Xiomara was also looking for a change.  And she decided to search for a new career.  And Alba had a new career, too,  at the Marbella gift shop.  And while we're on Alba,  Jane was basing her novel  on her grandma's life.  Only Alba didn't want to  share the letters from her estranged sister.    And speaking of complicated family dynamics,  Rafael's mother was a crime lord.    And she was murdered!  And that she left a Bible  with some mysterious words underlined.  DENNIS: ""Angels guard the sun.""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know, cray-cray, right?  Let's see, what else?  What else? Um  Jane and Michael were moving out of their place,  so you might see boxes.  Oh, I know what else!  There was a new love affair sweeping the Marbella  Petra and Scott.  Yeah, that Scott The one Jane hated.  But here's the thing, it wasn't really Petra.  It was her twin sister, Anezka.  See, Anezka had paralyzed Petra  and taken her place.  - And finally, - (shrieks)  after three freakin' months,  Jane realized  I don't think that's Petra.  Which, my friends,  is where we left off.  As you all well know,  our Jane always had strong opinions.  -  - Okay, here's why I think you  should reevaluate your Disney World decision.  - Jane - Just hear me out.  Lina's sister won free tickets on the radio,  so it won't cost anything.  And yes, it's a school day,  but we'll be home by 8:00  and I'll do all my classwork in advance,  I promise.  Please, Abuela. You can trust me.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  Priorities.  I don't care that Paulina's  pretending to be her sister,  she needs to end up with Carlos Daniel  and he needs to stay the heck away from Gemma.  Like I said,  Jane always had strong opinions.  So when she was unsure  well, it was a pretty big deal.  On the one hand, if Anezka did paralyze and impersonate Petra,  well, then so many things would make sense.  There's a sentence you don't hear every day.  But on the other hand, it's (exhales)  Straight out of a telenovela?  - Crazy. - Totally crazy.  But what if it's true?  Then we have to do something.  But what if we do something and it's not true?  Then things will get even worse.  Hard to imagine things getting worse  between Petra and Jane.  (yelling)  Or Petra and Rafael, for that matter.  And I will tell the cops,  unless you sign your shares over to me.  You have 24 hours.  Jane  it can't be true.    But what if it is true?  No, stop, I just convinced myself it couldn't be.  But that would explain her weird behavior.  Maybe we should see what the cop thinks.  The cop thinks you need more evidence, as discussed.  Thanks.  - You okay? - NARRATOR: Don't worry,  we'll be getting back to that teddy bear.  Yeah, yeah, just sore.  Trying to get back in shape  so I can pass my physical for work.  Oh. Well hey, if you ever want to use the Marbella gym  Oh, maybe I'll take you up on that.  Cool, I'm there most days  around lunch, so, hope to see you.  Cool, cool.  Bye, buddy. (kissing)  Oh. (laughs)  All right. Bye. Bye.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's see how long she can wait before  That was sweet, huh?  Him inviting you to work out at the Marbella?  Yeah.  So  are you gonna go? (chuckles)  Maybe.  I mean, it's just that  Rafael is making an effort.  And it would be, you know,  nice if you said yes to the date.  Not a date.  Sorry, sorry, the meet up.  The workout, the hang.  If I say yes,  you promise not to make a big deal out of it?  Yes. (scoffs) Yeah, of course.  No problem.  - I'll text him. - Cool.  Ooh.

Tell him I'm glad.  He says he is glad.  Also, thanks for inviting him to the gym.  Um, I didn't say that.  No, that part was from me.  Well, it doesn't seem like that.  It seems like it's from me,  with an exclamation mark, like I'm way too excited.  Okay fine, I'll just write him back and say it was from me.  No, no, stop. Then it'll be a thing.  (chuckles) Oh, look, he wrote back.  -  - What'd he say?  Yeah.    (chuckles) I'm kidding.  Mwah.

Then I think I can get her to talk to you.  Speaking from experience,  it's good when she's really pissed  to give her at least 48 hours to cool down.  - Mm. - (knocking on door)  Oh, that's your dad.  What's this big thing he wants to talk to us about?  Oh, I have no idea.  So, Rafael worked his magic  and got me an audition  - for the film - (gasps)  despite my unfortunate meeting with the producer.  Ro, that's so great.  - Yeah, congratulations. - Wait.  I went to the studio and read the script.  It's very secretive, that means it's good,  probably a festival opener.  Hopefully not Sundance.  Finding a flattering parka will be hell.  Anyway, it turns out that if I get the part  I will have to reveal all of myself on film.  Yeah, well, that's what acting is, right?  Raw, emotional, vulnerable.  - I mean my penis. - (quiet gasps)  I will have to reveal my penis.  Oh. The role requires  full frontal nudity.  Wow.  Fassbender did it, it's a great career move,  plus, obviously, I'm extremely comfortable with it.  But of course,  I want to make sure  - you are comfortable. - Me?  Well, Michael and Xiomara already have seen my penis.    So, will you be comfortable seeing it 40 feet high?  I'm not even comfortable having this conversation.  So no.  I'll just look away.  But it's my only scene.  You know what, Dad?  We'll just worry about it when the time comes.  Go for it, okay?    (chuckles)  ANEZKA: Yes, Mother, I understand your threats,  and I'm sick of them.  Okay, I'll kill her then.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Kill her?

Get the hell out of my home.  (scoffs)  (door opens and closes)  Give me a moment alone with my sister.  (door closes)  I am so sorry, beautiful sister.  Mother made me do it, she said  (croaks)  What?  (groans)  - What? - (gasps)  Do you have any idea  what you'ouve put me through?  (laughing)  (grunts)  (gasping)  Why did you protect me?  Because of the shares.  They'd be void.  Rafael signed them to you as me.  Now listen closely,  because you're going to jail unless you do exactly as I say.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's when Petra  said the scariest thing Anezka ever heard.  First, I want you to break up with Scott.  I can't.  You have to.  He'll suspect something.  At-at-at-at  at least let me start to pull away from him first  to prepare him.  (baby crying)  That's Elsa.  Should I?  JANE: I was just so sure it wasn't Petra.  I know. (sighs)  Think your dad's got one of those,  ""I'm sorry I thought your sister  ""was impersonating you"" gift baskets?  He might. I mean, it's straight out of a telenovela.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Exactly!  Oh, Michael's sweatshirt; he left it at the gym.  Thank you.  So  What happened with you two?  Let's just say  I get what you two see in each other.  What does that mean?  - The judgey thing - What?  You told me you were judgey the first week I met you.  I'm allowed to say that.  - Well, Michael's not judgey. - Oh, trust me, he is.  He saw you flirting with a married woman;  he's going to say something.  What? What were you talking about?  - He was picking apart my workout. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The gym, yes.  Gotta get back, writing it down.  - What married woman? - She had a ring.  You were joking about taking a shower together?  With Claire?  Okay, first of all, she's not married.  I don't know what the ring was.  But she's also a friend from college,  and partners with Spencer Davis.  The guy your dad insulted?  Yeah, I was trying to get him an audition.  MICHAEL: No, I'm so sorry.  I feel like an ass.  Yeah, okay. I love you.  (phone beeps)  Wow, I basically just blew up  months of progress on the family front.  What happened?  I told Jane something I shouldn't have.  Rafael's gotta hate me.  I mean, I would hate me if I were him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted Rogelio felt  Michael's sharing was a cry for help.  Which, by the way, it wasn't at all.  Nevertheless, friends, his wheels started turning.  (computer chimes)  Oh, my God.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: On the one hand,  Jane was pretty sure Okay, completely sure  That her abuela would not want her to respond.  On the other hand, it's her freaking cousin!  The girl has never had a cousin before!  This is big, people!    (chimes)          (chimes)  (chimes)  (chuckles)    (chimes)      Oh, my God! Jane!  Hi.  Hi. (laughing)  Hey.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.    I wanted to apologize for what happened.  I know it must have been awful  hearing from your sister out of the blue.  I should never have risked that.  I'm sorry, Abuela.    But wait.  Last night, a cousin wrote me.    Her name is Catalina.  She's your sister's son's daughter.  Jane  I'm just telling you this so that you know.  You won't hear about her again.    Abuela, that's not fair.    Well, maybe things should open up.    I know your sister ruined your wedding,  but don't you think it's time?          What?        What?  (gasps)        There are cameras everywhere. I'll fix this.  ANEZKA: Okay, all fixed.  Back to blonde.  Good.  Now, you've laid enough groundwork.  - Go break up with Scott. - (cell phone ringing)  Do you have $40 million  to b two-thirds of the Marbella back?  No, but  - Then why are you calling me? - (phone beeps)  And why are you still standing there?  - Go break up with - Scott?  Look, I know things haven't been great with us,  but I have to ask you a favor.  (sniffles)  - Oh. - Sorry. Sorry.  - Are you okay? - Oh, come on!  Wait, Scott  You don't have to act like you care.  No, but I do.  In that I don't want you to be,  like, extremely upset.  I think  I think Petra's gonna break up with me.  - Oh, I-I'm sure that's not true. - It is.  I-I don't know what happened.  I-I really thought Scetra was forever.    I don't know what changed.  ROGELIO: Changing lanes, Matelio.  This really isn't a good time for lunch,  so maybe somewhere close?  Close. Got it.  Couldn't have cleaned that seat off  before I got in?  No, not really, no.  - What the hell is this? - What's going on?  ROGELIO: I am the patriarch of this family,  so when things break down, it is my responsibility  to build them back up again.  It's time to hash this out,  man to man.  - To man to man. - Rogelio, we really  - I really don't think - No excuses, this is happening.  I really don't have time for this.  We'll do it quickly. Michael,  you said you messed up,  and you wanted to make it better.  So  Okay, um  Look, I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions  - and for telling Jane. - Running to Jane.  I wouldn't describe it as running.  - Oh, no, you ran. - Okay.  I'm sorry for running to Jane.  Um, it wasn't cool, and I'm sorry.  Well, thank you for apologizing.  I just I really thought you were sleeping  with that producer woman.  Well, we all make mistakes.  Of course he was sleeping with her!  How do you think I got the audition?  - Rogelio. Rogelio! - Is this true?  - Look, it doesn't matter - I knew it.  You're still the same shallow playboy  - all about the muscles - Even if I was sleeping with her,  it's none of your business.  I can sleep with whoever I want.  Oh, I thought she was married.  - (phone rings) - You really think I'd sleep  - with a married woman? - Shh! It's my agent.  What's the word, Barry?  Just checking in, wanted to give you  some love before the audition.  The audition is tomorrow, Barry,  but I'll always take love.  It's not tomorrow, it's in ten minutes.  The e-mail said tomorrow.  It did not. Oh, shoot!  I'm looking at it. It did!  Someone's getting fired.  Can you get over there? You have to get over there.  Okay, I'm on my way. Don't worry, Barry.  U-turn, Matelio!  - (loud pop) - Whoa!  JANE: No  Of course Petra doesn't think less of you  because of this incident.  - Really? - People pass gas. It happens.  - She doesn't. - (quietly) Wow.  - I never deserved her. - Hey!  Stop. You're great.  Yeah? What's so great about me?  (scoffs) Well, I mean, you're  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unscrupulous. - Ambitious.  - And - A tyrant.  Authoritative.  And you have a signature style.  It's a modified Alex P. Keaton.  I grew up as a latch-key kid.  My parents' idea of a babysitter  was Family Ties reruns.  Gotcha. Well, before we go too deep into your childhood,  I did have a favor.  ROGELIO: Help! Take it!  I got it. I got it.  Okay, your Uber's gonna be here in three minutes.  - You're gonna make it, Rogelio. - Thank you, Michael.  I can't believe I got the day wrong.  No!  This is not happening.  I can't go to the audition covered in tire grease!  You can use my shirt.  (sexy saxophone music)    Oh, come on.  Hey! (horn honks)  (quietly) Wow.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And from one hot piece  to Scott.  I need to tell you something.  Yeah, there's something I need to say, too.  So, did you break up with him?  No  We got engaged!  - What? - I know! I was surprised, too.  Everyone was.  Yes. Yes, yes, yes!  Yes! (laughs)  No, no, you you can't marry Scott.  I know.  I just wanted, for once,  just to see what it would feel like  to just be really  truly happy.  Okay, I'll break up with him myself. Give me the ring.  - MICHAEL: It's the silver ring. - I know what a lug nut is.  Are you sure you lifted the jack high enough?  Yes.  - Because that could be the problem. - I know how to change a tire.  Well, if you knew how to change a tire, you wouldn't be having so much trouble  marrying the lug nut to the bolts.  - ""Marrying""? - That was an accident.  - Seriously? - I didn't mean that.  She is not married.  - Let it go. - Well, Jane was engaged.  What?  We were engaged.  You didn't seem to give a damn about that. Not once.  Where's Mateo? Where's Mateo?  - Mateo! Mateo! - Mateo! Mateo!    (distorted) Mateo!  Mateo!  -  - (chuckles)  -  - Oh, my God.  Hey. (sighs)  - (exhales) - (sighs)  You can't run away like that, buddy.  Wow.  That could've been  I know. I know.  And, yeah, you're right.  You were engaged.  I didn't think about it, and I'm sorry.  And I'm sorry for getting insecure about  - your muscles. - (chuckles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, we all did.  I had cancer.  That's why I'm so focused now.  I like controlling my health.  I'm a dick.  (chuckles, laughs)  (chuckles)  (chuckles)  Any interest in the stock market?  Ah, no.  Real estate?  No. Comics?  No.  - Soccer? - Yes. I like soccer.  - Yes! - Yeah.  - All right! - I mean,  it's something, at least.  I mean, at least I found the cash pouch.  It was taken to the kitchen after the bussers  cleared the tables.  I brought it back to Jorge.  I just don't know what to do, Ma.  - She's just so mad. - I know.  You're used to having your grandma's approval. You need it.  - I don't need it. - I beg to differ.  Let's refer, one last time, to the Disney World proposal.    I'm just saying, I gave her permission  two days ago to go to Disney World.  I don't know why she needed your permission.  You may not be on the same  side on this  which you'll have to learn to live with.  Maybe you should be a family counselor.  - (laughs) - PETRA: I've thought about things  long and hard.      And, Scott,  - I really think it's better - Babe, I found a buyer  for the hotel.  - What? - As executive director  of the lounge,  I know all the high rollers.  Now, there's this French guy,  super skeezy, super rich,  comes here once a month,  he wants to invest  in beachside real estate.  I mean, he'll probably  flip it again, but who cares?  - Wow. - Right?  - Yeah. - I'm sorry, though, you were saying?  Uh, it can wait.  Would you mind introducing me to this Frenchman  babe?  Oh, my pleasure.  But first  how about a little kiss.  Oh.  - Come here, you. - (gasps)  Uh, I had to pull a Magic Mike  and rip off your shirt at the audition.  Here are your buttons.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends  it was as if the poster  were talking to him.  And not just because  it literally had his name on it.  RAFAEL: You okay?  -  - (mystical humming)  RAFAEL: Okay, ""guard.""  1 Corinthians, 16:13.  Okay, and ""sun.""  - Matthew, 17:2. - That's it!  Okay, we so, we have 12 numbers.  BOTH: Well, bank accounts have 12 numbers.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, rich guys.    Maybe this is where Mutter hid her money.  (phone ringing)  Shh! Shh!  Talk to me, Barry.  (gasps)  I got the role!  MICHAEL: He got the role!  - Yes! - Yes! (whoops)  - RAFAEL: Yay! - MICHAEL: Nice.  Okay.  We're five minutes ahead of schedule.    Ma, stop.    I remember every dance move.    (stammers)  Stop, I'm moving forward.  Oh, thank God,  we made it. These are for you.  They don't look it,  but they're very expensive, kids.  - Thank you. - Mm-hmm.  All right, now, everyone, go.  Get seats.  Good luck, Mom. Good luck.  I love the energy backstage  before a performance.  Yeah, me, too.  Then, why the hell are you giving it up?  What?  I said, ""Soak it in for the last time.""  Yeah. I will.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted,  Xo reminded herself she wanted a career.  Something she could build.  All right, everyone.  Places.  Go, go, go, go.  (audience applauds)  Don't worry, I won't put you through the recital.  I mean, it was cute if your kid was in it.  (whooping) Bravo!  Miss Xo, come up here.  (audience cheers)  And that's when it hit her.  (""Beauty School Dropout"" plays)  Your story's sad to tell   Middle-aged   Not doing so well   Most mixed up young grandmother   On the block   Your future's so unclear now   What's left of your career now?   Can't even keep a job as a bank teller   La, la, la, la   Ah, Ah   Open a dance school   You'll see your dreams and hopes come true   Open a dance school   Lead your own funky, hip-hop crew   Well, it's great that you have taken time   To think and clear your head up   But the wait is over now   I'm telling you it's time to step up   Jenna Dewan Tatum   Jenna Dewan Tatum   She'd be so very proud of you   And even Channing   And even Channing   Could learn a move or two from you   If you open up a dance school   You'd have your cake and eat it, too   -  Believe in yourself for once  -  La, la   -  And open a dance school  -  La, la, la   La, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la   Listen to me, Xo   Open a dance school   Open a dance school   Take our advice, Mom   Open a dance school   Open a dance school   Open a dance   -  School  -  La, la, la, la, la   (applause and cheering)  A dance studio!

Hi!    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, she won't have to reach far.  (laughs)  U-Uh, oh, my God.  What are you doing here?  It's such a long story.  Agreed. And we're not there yet.  -  - We're here.  Full frontal nudity?  Oh, dear. You'll see in your contract  you did agree to the Telemasivo morality clause,  and as such, all nudity in television and film  is not permitted, as it tarnishes our brand.  So what are you saying, I can't take the part?  She didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  It's at our discretion.  So you can do it  If you do something for us in exchange.  Uh-oh.  I wonder what that's all about.  And speaking of payback.  Thank you for not sending me away.  My children are bonded to you.  It's the only reason I'm allowing you to stay.  Do it.  (whimpers)  - (mechanical buzzing) - (Anezka shrieking, crying)  (buzzing stops)  Perfect.  (faint whimpering)  (crying)  Oh, stop it. You'll cut bangs.  PETRA: So, I've had a change of heart.  I'm not walking away from this hotel.  - You are. - What?  I'm going to stay here and run it with my  two-thirds majority. And you're going to sell your sister's last third  to a bidder of my choice.  And what if I don't?  Then I'll make every minute of your life  a living hell.  Why are you doing this?  I'm only going to say this once,  and if you repeat it, I'll deny it.  You were right.  It wasn't me.  And I heard  everything.  Every single  (Elsa crying)  Oh  Could I say something?  It's just  awesome watching you  with the babies.  Oh, thanks.  I'm serious. For a second there,  I thought you were missing the ""Mom Gene.""  (whispers) thing.  So I'm not leaving.  You are.  Oh, what?  I tried nice.  And I was freaking paralyzed, and nobody even noticed.  So I am done  with nice.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Get ready, friends.  The bitch is back."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, Jane, married to Michael,  friends with her baby daddy Rafael,  and currently a little tense with her Abuela.  See, Alba hated her sister  -  - Cecilia, and they hadn't spoken  in 40 years. But then Jane got in touch  with her granddaughter, who lived in London.  - Hi! - Hi!  And, well, it drove a wedge between them.  Oh, and Catalina decided to make a surprise appearance!  Jane! Hi!  - Oh, my God. - OMG indeed!  And speaking of, Petra's twin sister Anezka  froze her and took her place.    But luckily Petra woke up, and said this:  I am Anezka.  Of course, Petra had ulterior motives.  Why did you protect me?  Because of the hotel shares.  They'd be void. Rafael signed them to you as me.  So first, she made Anezka break up with her true love, Scott.  And then, she set her sights on Rafael.  I'm not walking away from this hotel.  You are.  Why are you doing this?  I'm only going to say this once. It wasn't me.  I know. Tough times, right? And speaking of tough,  Rogelio was trying to break into the American TV scene.  But there was a slight catch.  I will have to reveal my penis.  Oh. And Jane's mom Xo  also had a career revelation  and decided to open a dance school.  And speaking of moms, Rafael's was a crime lord.  And she was murdered. And a clue in the Bible  led to a secret bank account  that the police were trying to track.  I know. Moms, right? They're a handful.  And on that note, let's dive in.  As you all know, Jane Gloriana Villanueva  grew up loved.  I got to run, but Abuela's here.  If a bit lonely at times.  And if I'm being honest,  which I'm always being  JANE: Excellent tea.  Outstanding, really.  If she had one wish as a child, it was to have a sister.  So when Catalina Maria Mora showed up out of the blue,  well, it didn't feel like the bomb that it was.  It felt like that wish come true.  What are you  doing here?    The craziest thing:  I was heading back from Venezuela  and I had an unscheduled layover in Miami.  And I just met you, and I don't know, it felt like a sign.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, she's speaking Jane's language.  I love that so much.  - I left you two voice mails - My battery's dead.  I figured, so I just came. (laughter)  You must be sexy cop husband.  I don't know about sexy, but, uh  but cop is true.  Ooh! Sexy and modest!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh!  - She's a kisser! - Okay. Um  - No, come on in! - (laughter)  Oh! Lovely!  Welcome. We're moving.  Oh, fun, I love moving!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Who loves moving?  Really? Of course! It's a chance  to redecorate, reinvent  (gasps) Is that  a doggie door? I love dogs!  You have a dog?  Um, we're discussing getting a cat.  (chuckling): They're preliminary discussions.  If you want a cat, get a cat! What's there to discuss?  Well, Jane's more of the planning type.  - (grunts) - Ah.  Well, that's never been my strong suit.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Clearly. - (inhales)  Okay, so. Full confession:  this visit isn't totally unmotivated.  My Abuela knows we connected and wanted to see  if we could help them fix things.  Oh. Um my grandma asked me to stay out of it.  But I want to hang out with you.  - Please, stay here tonight. - Oh, no! I-I can't.  I don't want to impose, you're moving.  Who cares? We'll pull out sheets.  - Right, Michael? - Oh. Yeah, why not?  (laughing): Oh, great!  Um, the loo?  Hmm?  The bathroom.  - Through there. - Thank you.  (quietly): Are you sure about this?  Michael, come on. She's my first cousin.  Well, actually, not my first cousin.  Maybe my third? But still,  who cares?  A cousin. I have a cousin!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, looks like Jane is finally  getting that tea party she always wanted.  (laughing): So  after Oxford, I met this guy in a rock band  and followed him to Paris.  He was a nihilist and a philistine  but gorgeous and, ugh, so brilliant.  We broke up within days but I decided to stay and take culinary classes,  which is when I studied under Ludo before living in Berlin.  Wow.  I've been on an airplane four times.  (laughter)  I love that top, by the way.  - (Jane moaning) - CATALINA: Right?  - Mm-hmm. - I am telling you,  this lady who owned this brothel in Thailand  was a genius!  JANE: Mm! (chuckles)  And they threatened to run away, but my grandma chickened out,  so Alba convinced her to spend the night in the barn.  - (laughter) - JANE: She's incredible, Michael.  Well traveled and artistic  - and adventurous and so funny. - Mm.  - We were up all night. - Oh, I heard. When do you think  she's gonna be out of the shower? 'Cause the movers are gonna be here any minute.  - I'm sure she's almost done. - (shower turns off)  So,  we were actually talking about her staying for a few more days.  With us?  In our new place?  There's so much to catch up on.  Wh What? What was that look?  (quietly): Well, don't you think it's a little weird  that she shows up unannounced?  (clicks tongue) Aw.  You've just been around me too long.  Not everyone's a planner. Her style's more  - spontaneous. - CATALINA: Morning, morning!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Apparently, her style  doesn't include wearing a bra.  Hey! So,  we actually talked about it, and  please stay with us for a few more days!  Yes!  - Incredible, fun, I'd love to! - (both laugh)  (giggling)  (whistling)  (explosion)      And you don't have to meet her. I know you don't want to.  I just wanted you to know she's here.      Y (clears throat)    Thanks. You have to come by the new place.  As soon as Cat leaves.  So, I should go to my meeting. Hopefully,  I can get my T.A. job back.  The dean said no way you're getting  your T.A. job back.  Apparently that bridge has been burned.  (shrieking): No! Wait, wait, this is a mistake!  - To a crisp. - (shouting)  But I was at a party the other night, and I ran  into Leslie Clark from Silver Horizon Publishing.  Have you heard of them?  Romance with a slant towards historical fiction,  won a RITA award for their Dawn's Early Light trilogy  set in the War of 1812.  (laughing): Yes. Yes.  Yes. I've heard of them.  Well, she's looking for a new assistant.  Really? W-What does that entail?  I have no idea.  It was a party.  I recommended you.  - What? - Yeah. Here's her card.  Her current assistant's info is on there.  Oh, my God! Thank you so much!  I'm gonna hug you, okay? Just stand still.  (exclaims)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In a less huggy mood  When I said I wanted you out of the hotel, it wasn't theoretical.  No, I have someone lined up to rent out your penthouse.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As you'll recall, Petra Solano  was back from the dead and on a rampage.  What?  It was a majority shareholder decision.  Meaning my decision.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hell, I'm scared of her!  Why are you doing this? I just  I don't understand.  Here's what I don't understand.  How you were married to me, said you loved me,  then slept with my sister and worked alongside her  for months without ever realizing it wasn't me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah. I got nothing either, buddy.  I'm sorry. It's all I can say.  But we have children together. Yes, and that's unfortunate.  We'll have the nannies coordinate.  End of next week, I want you out.  ROGELIO: I'm stunned.  - Did you drop my name at the bank? - Yeah, unfortunately,  it didn't translate into a boost to my credit score.  Then I will loan you the money to open your dance studio.  I thought you might offer, but no.  You'll say you won't interfere,  but then you'll want a say.  Of course I'll want a say!  In fact, you should want me to have a say.  I'm excellent at branding and promotion.  Plus, I know a little something about dance  (scoffs) I know you think you do.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What's this?  Some kind of private joke?  Well. Come on, at least show me the place  you're interested in renting.  Sorry. No. Sorry.  Sorry. Uh-uh. All right.  Hey!  I'm off carbs. I need to slim down  for my big full frontal scene.  - About the crew? - The crew's naked body  is not gonna not be featured in an indie feature!  Fine. They want you in makeup,  and here are some script revisions.  Thank you, Rudy. (chuckles)  ROGELIO: What the hell?  This is a huge episode. I finally see Ava  and realize she went through the time portal after me.  It's a turning point in the novela.  We had to  And it's supposed to happen in the episode  where I prevent the third world war  by ending the Cuban Missile Crisis.  - The thing is, you - And why does the episode now  take place in Vernon J. Herzing's house?  And who the hell is that?!    (dings)  I guess you made some sort of deal with the studio?  All nudity in television and film  is not permitted, as it tarnishes our brand.  So, what are you saying? I can't take the part?  You can do it. If you do something for us in exchange.  We have a chance to do a product integration and make some money  for the show and for the studio.  But the writers said no.  Well, allow me to overrule the writers.  Okay, so I'll eat the cereal during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  But HBO wasn't invented then.  - The TV station? - The cereal.    Who cares? No one will notice.  PETRA: Enough!  - Stop following me. - I-It's just  now that you rethought leaving, I thought  maybe you rethought us.  - I didn't. - But  what we had, uh the things we said to each other. What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Just a friendly reminder:  That wasn't Petra. That was all Anezka.  My sister had a health crisis,  and I I melted down.  And now that she feels better,  well, I  I feel different, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll say.  So, let me  be unequivocal.  We are never, ever getting back together.  Ever.  You don't have to throw our song in my face!  JANE: I'm so excited.  I could be working directly with the publisher.  Getting to read galleys,  and observe the editing process from start to finish.  - Amazing! - That's amazing, babe!    I know. Uh, I (chuckles)  I am a little nervous about the interview.  You know, Donaldson didn't have any details on the job  so I can't do my usual hard-core prepping.  Oh, you'll be fine.  (sighs) I got a job as a sommelier on a Greek island  one summer, and I knew exactly zero about wine.  I totally faked it.  Dropped some buzz words like ""oaky""Â and ""bouquet""Â  - at the interview. - Really?  Truly. And this is terrible wine.  I'm buying you some wine.  Trust me. Everything you need to know,  you can learn on the job. Just  lead with confidence.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now  Hi! I'm Jane!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Confidence, not volume.  Sorry. I'm excited.  (chuckling): I'm Jane. You must be Alice.  - We spoke on the phone. - Yes. Hi.  It's good you're excited.  You should be; Leslie is great.  I'll let her know you're here.  (sighs)  And considering Silver Horizon's slant  towards historical fiction, I think it would be  a perfect fit for me.  - And I'd work my butt off. - Well, Jane,  I really like your energy,  and you come with quite  a recommendation. Marlene Donaldson?  She hates everybody.  It took me a while  but I finally wore her down.  We hug now.  Oh, come on.  Well, once, but I might try it again.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Way to go, Jane, you're crushing it.  And you know Spark Express, of course?    Of course, yes, absolutely.    Great.  Um, could you help me with this issue?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh now?  I can't seem to delete this field.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  Let's see.  This one?  - Uh-huh. - Okay.  So, did you try highlighting it?  Uh-oh.  - What's what's wrong? - I-I  I seem to have deleted the file.  Uh, l-let me just undo it.  (scoffs)  Would you just in case, did you back it up?  No.  This is two hours of work.  Alice!  I thought you knew the software.  I meant I'd learn it.  ALICE: What's going on?  We need I.T. in here.  I'm so sorry.  Just go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup.  So, she really bombed that.  (whistling)  The publisher basically threw me out of her office.  - It was a disaster. - I'm sorry, babe.  At least now you know to trust your instincts.  Oh, no, stop, you can't give up.  You have the assistant's info, work her a little.  - You can recover. - JANE: I don't know.  This was a pretty epic fail.  Agree. Just move on.  Don't be silly.  Once, I really bungled things  while working Fashion Week in Milan,  but since I was besties  with Zac Posen's assistant,  he got Zac to look the other way.  Do you have the assistant's number?  Alice? Yeah.    Mm?  I can't send that.  Sure you can!  Come on.  Oh.  (phone whooshes)  CATALINA: Yeah!  (phone beeps)  Ah! A smiley face!  - Yay! You're in. - (laughs)  - CATALINA (laughing): Good. - JANE: And it worked, Mom.  I mean, I've been texting with her assistant all night.  She said she'd work her boss.  XIOMARA: That's great, hon.  Uh, listen, I should go.  Okay.  Bye, Mom.  Come on.  Let's toast to our new apartment  with our, uh, bad wine.  (chuckles)  Do you ever wish  you traveled?  I mean  I haven't really thought about it much.  Me, neither.  Do you want to?  I don't know.  Maybe.  I mean, not now.  After grad school?  What about Mateo?  We would take him.  And my job?  I know, you're right.  It's not practical.  (sighs)      What?      Have we met?  Uh, I don't think so.  You're Petra Solano, right?  Yes.  You've been served.  What?  (whistling)  You're suing me for sexual harassment?  You-You know that's not true.  Your word against mine.  - Please keep away. - Are you  - What are you doing? - You've created  a hostile work environment.  I don't feel safe around you.  Now, is there  a work-related topic  you would like to discuss?  Otherwise, this conversation  is highly inappropriate.  Did I blow your mind or did I blow your mind?  It's beautiful, Rogelio, but I already saw this online  and it's twice what I want to spend,  which is why I want the other one.  Ah, but you didn't factor in the celebrity discount.  I told the owner of the strip mall  I'd do a commercial for his fro-yo place  and negotiated the rent down to half price.  - What? - I told you, I'm a value add.  (gasps) Are you serious?!  You know I'm always serious  about dance.  Oh, my God,  would you stop it already?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, I found out what  these private jokes are about.  So, for our first competition,  I think we should do  a high-octane, ""Rhythm Nation""-type routine.    - Sweet! - That's tight.  No, no, no, no, no.    Just put me in the center  and have the girls freak up against me.  To hide that you can't dance?  - What? - (girls chuckle)  Please, we know you're just here to meet girls.  Oh, I can dance.  Prove it.  Let's see you follow my moves.  Let me see you shake it, shake it   What?   I wanna see you move your body   I want to get the party started   Hey   Join in like go on, go on   -  Let me see you shake it, shake it  -  What?   I wanna see you move your body   -  I wanna get the party started  -  Hey   Join in like go on, go on   Let me see you shake it, shake it.   (sighs) It's perfect.  And, friends,  it felt too good to be true.  Which it was.  Let them just finish signing the paperwork.  Congratulations.  It's all yours.  Thank you so much.  And that's when she saw him.  - Oh, my God. - Yup. Bruce.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You don't know who Bruce is.  Well, listen up.  JANE: Bruce is the worst!  His law office is right by your studio?  Can you get out of your lease?  Stop. You're being crazy.  I'm not! He's the worst.  - Why? - Well,  first, he was married, and he didn't tell Mom.  Then,  she finds out, and he keeps saying  that he's gonna leave his wife, but he never does.  She keeps saying that she's done,  over and over and over and over,  oh, and over and over.  Mmm. I agree.  He's a jerk. Now, go to work.  I got Mateo. I'm just saying that  you don't need to be around him.  Jane, enough. That was a different time in my life.  I can't even imagine being with Bruce now.  People move on.    - (gasps) - (laughs)  Hey. Am I early?  No. I just finished my shift.  Great. Want to go out for drinks?  Oh, I can't. Mateo and Michael are waiting for us.  Oh. One?  We'll strategize about your career.  - Fine. One. - Yes.  And that's when  Hi there.  Oh, hey. Uh, Rafael,  this is my cousin Catalina.  Ah, this is Catalina.  And you must be the baby daddy.  Officially but you can call me Rafael.  (laughs)  Was that a spark between them?  Nah, I was just reading into it, I'm sure.  Vodka soda, light on the soda. Jane?  - Um - You know, I think I'll  join you guys for a drink.  So I told him you can't wear Speedos in the dining room.  (laughing)  Ah, the ""kooky guest in the Speedo"" story.  Jane's heard this one about a hundred times.  So I gave in and I threw him a robe.  (sputtering laugh)  (sighs): So we should head out.  Oh, no. We ordered another round  when you went to the loo. But, hey, you know,  if you need to run  What's another drink?    So, I spent the summer crewing on my friend Dorian's yacht  - off the coast of Monaco - Wait, wait. Dorian Moreau?  - You know him? - Yes! He threw this  massive party in the French Riviera,  - like, five years ago. - Oh, my God, I was there!  - You were there? - Yes!  No way!  (laughing)  (fake laughing)  So funny.  Small world.  Okay, we should probably call an Uber,  go back to Michael and Mateo.  - First dinner at the new place. - Wait.  You're going to their first dinner?  You are totally third-wheeling it.  (gasps) Oh, my God, am I?  - I knew it. - No!  - Yes! - No.  Absolutely you are.  Look, let them have dinner alone, okay?  We stay here and eat, and then you go back later.  Okay. Is that weird?  No.  No, it's not weird.  Oh. Okay, yes, I should probably go.  Seeing as I said  out loud that I was gonna go.  Don't you think that's a little weird?  Don't you think that's weird, Mateo?  That you came home drunk at 7:00 p.m.? Yes.  That he's, like hitting on her in front of me.  I mean, not really. She's definitely his type.  What does that mean?  Hot.  Like you.  - You think she's hot? - I think you're hot.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Turn it around, man.  - Why you acting all jealous? - I'm not jealous.  You love her, you think she's great,  so what if he does, too?  If he does, too, that's great.  - Great! - Great!  -  - Which brings us here, now.  Hey. Did you have fun last night?  I didn't hear you come in.  Oh, good. Good.  I was trying to be quiet. It was so late.  Rafael kept saying we should give you guys privacy.  Next I know, we're sloshed  and eating shrimp tacos, and suddenly I felt all dodgy  being out with your baby's father, so I came home.  Was it dodgy?  No, it's not dodgy at all.  I mean, with three kids,  it's not like Raf gets out much.  Brilliant! I'm friends with my exes, too.  Mm.  So, I need your help.  Excuse me?  Scott is apparently suing me.  (chuckles) For sexual harassment, of all things.  - What? - Yes, and  I want it over. (sighs)  Can I tell my legal team you'll back me up?  In exchange, you can  remain in the penthouse.  Well, in exchange, I want my shares back.  Paying him off will be cheaper.  You okay?  I'm hoping I will be.  Uh, anyways  I had so much fun with Catalina last night.  I mean, she is incredible.  Oh, yeah, she's cool.  I was actually thinking about asking her out again.  Really?  I mean  she's only here for a few more days.  Do you really want to start something  with someone who's leaving?  I don't know, I really thought there was a spark between us.  She didn't mention anything, so  Really?  Mm.  Jane, if you feel uncomfortable  with me dating your cousin, I won't do it.  No, I hadn't really thought about it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, right. Sorry.  But since you asked, I guess I am.  So I shouldn't ask her out?  Yeah, I-I think I'd rather you didn't.  ROGELIO: I am aggravated!  - You're hungry. - No, I just ate  nine pieces of celery and a saltine.  Unrelated to that, I'm aggravated  because we should hire someone to paint.  We can do it ourselves.  But it's going to take forever.  Less talking and more prepping.  I have an idea on how to solve our disagreement.  Though you might be too scared.  Scared of what?  Standard rules apply.  You copy my move, I copy your move.  Stop stalling.  You're the one who's stalling.  Hmm. (dance music playing)  Let me see you shake it, shake it  What?   I wanna see you move your body   I wanna get the party started  Hey   Join in like go on, go on   Let me see you shake it, shake it   What?  I wanna see you move your body   I wanna get the party started   Hey  Join in like go on, go on   Oh! Aah!  Ha-ha! That's right!  (Xiomara laughing)  Rogelio, are you okay?  I think I pulled something.  (laughter)  I have a confession to make.  The truth is, I didn't sign up  for our high school dance troupe  to meet girls.  I signed up for our high school dance troupe  to meet a girl.  I-I'm sorry I've been so grumpy today.  It's just, seeing Bruce around  is just really throwing me.  Because you still have feelings for him?  No! The opposite.  He messed with my life for so long  I never really got the chance to tell him off.  You still can.  - You don't have to sulk. - I'm not.  But I didn't have to ask you if I could date her.  But you did. And I said no.  JANE: Hi, honey. Mwah.  - Raf was just leaving. - Oh, okay.  - How have you been? - Better before Jane  shut down my dating life.  (chuckles): What are you talking about?  Nothing.  - You didn't tell him? - Are you serious?  - Tell him what? - She asked me not to date Catalina.  (whistling)  - You told him he couldn't date her? - I just think it's inappropriate.  How is it inappropriate?  There are three billion women in this world!  Okay, you know what? Whatever. Go ahead.  And if it doesn't work out, who knows,  maybe you could hook up with one of my other cousins.  Oh, or maybe a sexy great aunt!  Yeah, I think I'm gonna head out.  Hi, baby.  - Who's that? Oh - (door opens, shuts)  - I knew you were jealous. - I'm not jealous.  I just What if it doesn't work out?  They're adults.  I'll be in the middle of it. We share a child!  I don't want that to get complicated  because of some fling with a cousin I just met  and I really like!  So this isn't about your romantic history with Rafael?  - No. - Then why didn't you tell me he asked?  Because you get so sensitive about it.  I'm sensitive?  (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah,  things can be tricky with exes.  Xo  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR Which brings us here  now.  Hey, Bruce.  (chuckles): What are you doing here?  I actually rented the place across the way,  and I saw you. You moved offices?  Last year, after my divorce.  Oh, no. He's divorced!  Oh.  Stay strong, Xo.  Look  since we'll be seeing each other around,  I just wanted to say something.  You were such a douche bag.  - And speaking of douche bags - I've thought  a lot about this.  And, look, for everyone's sake,  I just want this to all go away. My lawyers and I  were able to come up with a number  to settle out of court.  It's not about the money.  It's about the fact that you obviously used me.  - I didn't - Liar.  And I'm gonna make you pay.  I have a burn book, remember?  I know a lot about you.  Your real name  the fact that you were married to an arms dealer  Oh. And, um  (whispering inaudibly)  XIOMARA: It's over.  I said everything that I have to say to Bruce, and  he got it.  (laughs): And I have to say, I feel great.  That's wonderful, Xiomara.  Yeah. So thank you  for encouraging me to do that.  Of course.  And can I just say I love  our friendship.  I-I love the place that we've gotten to.  Me, too.  Good-bye, Xiomara.    This doesn't make any sense!  Tiago sees Ava  kissing another guy, and he turns and walks away?!  Rogelio, can we just discuss this in your dressing room?  No! We're gonna discuss it here!  My blood sugars are extremely low,  and I cannot find the truth  in this ridiculous scene. Tiago,  he has been looking for Ava through time and space,  and when he finally sees her, she is kissing another man!  And he walks away  and doesn't tell her how he feels?!  It just doesn't make any sense!  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which part? - He'd tell her.  Oh, see, that part I bought.  I have to agree. Should we go back  to the Vernon Herzing story? Every one at the Honey Bunch  loved that storyline.    XIOMARA: So, how'd you leave it?  Well, Michael's still mad at me, I'm still mad at Rafael,  Rafael's probably  still mad at me.  And how about Catalina?  She's steering clear, I think.  Can you blame her?  Anyway, don't bring it up at dinner.  Abuela,  you look so nice!  That's her fourth wardrobe change.    She spent three hours making arepas.      - (knocking) - (gasps) That's her.  (laughs): Alba, hi!  I brought my world-famous arepas.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Rival arepas!  And unsecured tatas!  This is going to be a long  (laughter)  Oh, wow. Look at that.  I was totally wrong.  But they had to sneak out of the house  to practice, right?  Their father did not approve of dancing.  She said he was very strict.      - Ah? - Yeah!  And that night,  Alba won the town dance contest.  - Fair and square. But she was - Oh.  Disqualified because her skirt was two inches too short.  - Abuela! - Mommy?    CATALINA: Oh, it was  quite the scandal. And that was  the first night you met Mateo.  Mm-hmm.  Mm. My grandma was devastated.  (groans) And she was so sorry about  - what she did after. - Devastated?  Why was she devastated?  Well, because she'd been in love with him first, right?  And you sort of stole him away?      I'm so sorry.  That's what my Abuela told me.    - Abuela. - Mom.        (whistling)  I can't believe how I bungled that.  And we were getting along.  Well, she'll get over it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Are we talking about the same Abuela?  Maybe.  I didn't even think it was controversial.  I thought that was the story.  - Really? - Yeah, of course.  That's what everyone thinks.  (phone buzzes)      Skinny Bloody Maria.  Extra celery, please.  Ah, yes. The new friendship.  Hey, can I ask you a question?  Sure.  Do you think it's weird that I want to date Jane's cousin?  Well, it depends. How much do you like her?  Well, a  a lot, actually.  I mean, I really felt, like, a like a spark.  Which is rare.  So rare. Uh-huh.  People spend a lot of time searching for that,  and if that spark turns into a forest fire of love  for someone  someone you could envision  spending the rest of your life with  No, we-we just met, you know.  It's a little early for that. I barely know her.  A person you somehow keep finding your way back to,  after years and years apart Well, hell, that's  that's even rarer, no?  Are we still talking about Catalina?  So what if Xo and I have this  obstacle? I'm obviously  still in love with her, and the kid's a big hypothetical.  She's here, and she's real.  I should tell her how I'm feeling.  Rafael, this was a great talk.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  Rogelio had played this scene a thousand times  in telenovelas.  The hero racing to profess his love for  uh-oh.  (door opens)  You have a fix for the script?  Hmm.  Yes.  There has to be a reason why Tiago doesn't speak up  when he sees them kissing.  Something emotional  that haunts him from his past.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The fact that he didn't raise Jane.  ROGELIO: The fact that he didn't stop the Hiroshima bomb  last time, because he and Ava were making love.  - Go on. - So, yes,  he loves her.  But he's also reminded that he  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wants another child.  Wants to stop the Bay of Pigs.  So, when he sees her kissing that troll,  he takes it as a sign.  To stick to his initial mission.  I like it. Yeah,  I'll jump back into the script  and make those changes.  (door opens)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also jumping back in  DENNIS: Hey-hey,  you're looking better.  Oh, let's hope the doctor agrees with you.  I just had my physical.  Any new on the case?  Just that you were right.  The numbers in Mutter's Bible  belong to a bank account.  But they don't know whose bank account?  - Not yet. - They're working on it.  - So what's the - Look, I really  (clicks tongue) Go on.  Just that I'm sorry.  I left a message for Rafael,  and I told him I'm fine with him dating Catalina.  (phone chimes)      - What? - Oh,  Alice just invited me to join the assistants' group  for happy hour.  Well, as Cat would say, ""Jolly good!  Let's definitely go.""Â  Stop. Okay, w-we don't have to.  Y-Yes, we do.  Because I'm not gonna be  the stick in the mud  that ruins this opportunity for you.  We're doing this.  I'll do it.  I'll give you your shares back  if you lie about Scott.  If I agree to do this,  no more blackmail,  no more threats.  We are even.  Equal partners again.  Equal partners.  I am prepared to say that you harassed her.  Which makes it your word against ours.  And we will drag your name through the mud  and sue you into oblivion.  You'll end up broke and humiliated  with no hope and zero prospects for the future.  Or  you can give up this ridiculous lawsuit,  and we can all move on.  I don't know why you won't just move on.  Because you won't admit you were jealous.  JANE: Fine.  I'm jealous.  But you want to know what?  It's not even about him.  It's about her.  Catalina makes me feel a little boring, okay?  She lives this  exciting and glamorous life.  And  she isn't afraid to break the rules.  I know.  What?  That's exactly what I was afraid of.  She's making you not like your life.  Suddenly you feel like  you're married to some boring guy  and we're just married boring people.  Well, guess what.  I'm not boring!  I didn't say you were.  Michael  What are you doing?  Where are you go? Michael, stop.  Jane.  - Hi! You're here. - Alice. Hi.  Let me introduce you to everyone.  MICHAEL: Everyone.  Can I have your attention?  So bear with me.  I have to prove to my wife that I'm not boring.  - Oh, my God. - MICHAEL: Here we go.  Oh, yeah, yeah   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   Ooh   Never had much faith in love   Or miracles   Ooh   Never want to put my heart   On the Li-i-i-ine, yeah, yeah   'Cause your sex takes me to paradise   Why is that weirdo staring at you and singing about sex?  'Cause he's my weirdo.  I'll be right back.  Ooh   Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise   And it sho-o-o-ows   Yeah, yeah, yeah   'Cause you make me feel like   I've been locked out of heaven   -  For too lo-o-o-ong  - (laughing)  For too lo-o-o-ong   And you make me feel like   Screw boring, we are not boring!  - Oh, we're young, we're fun! - Yes.  - (phone buzzes) - Oh.  - Ha! It's Alice. - What?  Oh! They loved us!  They want us to go back. Should we go back?  No.  You wanted Alice to think you're awesome.  She thinks you're awesome.  You got to leave them wanting more.  That's how we roll. We go in there,  we drop some fun bombs Boom!  And we're out.  I did have fun tonight.  And for the record,  I don't want to be young and crazy  with anyone else but you.  Me neither.  It's still pretty early.  What other fun, spontaneous, crazy things should we do?  We got a cat!  - (gasps) - MICHAEL: Introducing  Faith M. Whiskers III.  We didn't even debate about it, we just did it!  Wow, you guys are wild.  - I know! - We really are.  (laughing): Uh, so  Listen.  Rafael actually mentioned  that he wanted to hang out.  Really?  Truly. You should do it.  I mean, he's home; I know he would love to see you.  I guess I should hop in the shower, then.  Do it!  Definitely.  Nice work.  (laughs)  You think Faith M. Whiskers III  has ever seen two boring married people have sex?  Michael, ew.  (laughing): I don't want her watching us.  Get out of here, Faith. (cat meows)  (knocking on door)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I bet I know who that is.  Meow, indeed.  Oh. Not who I expected.  I told you it would work.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me explain.  We are never, ever getting back together.  Ever.  You don't have to throw our song in my face.  So who I was with it was really Anezka?  Yeah, but there's no way to prove it.  And  you'll be getting that bonus, as discussed.  Oh, I didn't do it for the money.  No, though it's a pretty nice number.  No, I did it for the favor.  It's good to have a guy like you owe me.  DIRECTOR: We just owe this last shot.  And action!          DIRECTOR: Cut! Perfect.  That's a wrap.  That was fantastic!  Everybody at the Honey Bunch is excited.  Terrific! I'm excited, too.  Last night, I had a moment of clarity.  I want to have more children.  That's my mission.  And I'm going to make it happen.  Would you be interested by any chance?    (laughing): I'm just kidding!  I love the cereal, but I need eggs.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking of sexy come-ons  - (knocking on door) - Okay, I'm pretty sure  I'm right this time.  I was glad you called.    (moaning)  ROGELIO: And bang!  I nailed it on the very first take.  Now, everybody, please try this cereal.  - It's everything. - So  Have there been any more Bruce sightings?  Nope, not since I, uh, told him off.  JANE: Wow.  So the spell is finally broken.  It is.                No, Abuela  It's okay.  I believe you.      Me, neither.  So, can we end this?    Okay.  (sighs)  (Alba sighs)  (sighs)          So how about  I go get us something to eat  and then we do that a few thousand more times?  Sounds perfect.  You are trouble, aren't you?  (laughs) I guess you'll have to wait and see."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, Jane was married to Michael,  and friends with her baby daddy Rafael,  Although the terms of that relationship had recently changed.  I'm finally over you.  Oh, and now  I'm kind of like,  ""Oh, so what if Jane's upset?""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, so that made life more difficult.  On the bright sight, Jane recently found her fabulous cousin, Catalina.  She's incredible, Michael.  After Oxford, I met this guy in a rock band  and followed him to Paris.  We broke up within days, but I decided to stay  and take culinary classes, which is when I studied  under Ludo before living in Berlin.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In fact, Jane liked her so much  she invited Cat to stay with them in their new place.  And things were going great Until this happened.  JANE: This is my cousin Catalina.  Yup, they hit it off.  And hey, personally, I'm like, you're Jane's cousin,  find a different guy.  But they seemed to really like each other, so who am I to judge?  And speaking of judging,  Xo ran into her old flame Bruce,  who Jane hated.  He was married, and he didn't tell Mom.  That was a different time in my life.  I can't even imagine being with Bruce now.  But then this happened.  And Rogelio saw! I know!  Yikes! And speaking of yikes  Rafael's mother was the crime lord Mutter,  and she was murdered.  But she left a clue, which led to a secret  bank account, which the police were trying to track.  - So we have 12 numbers. - BOTH: Bank accounts have 12 numbers.  And, man, Michael really wanted  to get back to being a detective.  - Hey, you're looking better. - Oh, let's hope the doctor  agrees with you I just had my physical.  Yup. He can't yet, because of his  getting shot in the chest and all.  Good news: he was getting stronger every day,  and settling in to married life with Jane,  which is where we left off.  You'll recall, when Catalina Maria Mora  first came into Jane's life, well, it felt like a dream.  But alas, the thing with dreams is,  eventually you wake up.  (Catalina laughing in distance)  CATALINA: Non! Tu plaisantes!  Just tell her to be quiet. She's gonna wake  (Mateo crying)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Too late.  - (continues crying) - Shh  (whispers): We have to get rid of her.  I should explain. Catalina's one-night layover  had turned into a two-week layover,  - and counting. - Four more days.  It's just four more days.  I saw her book the plane ticket.  - It's the teething. - I know. That's why  it's a miracle he was actually sleeping.  - (Catalina laughing) - Whoever she's speaking to  must be a bloody riot.  - (sighs) - (sighs)  (long exhale)  Je te l'ai dit! Il n'y a aucun coiffeur  qui fait le balayage aussi bien que lui.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, man. It's been a while  since high school French I think maybe she's talking  about a hair stylist that does great highlights.  Or having coffee at the ballet.  Hey. Psst. Do you mind keeping it down?  Oh. Je suis tres I mean, I'm so sorry.  I came out here 'cause I didn't want to wake you.  CATALINA (laughing): Oh, Igor!  CATALINA: That was actually my friend Igor calling  from the bathroom at the Isabel Marant show.  - Blah, blah, blah. We get it. - It's apparently chaos.  You go to fabulous places and know fabulous people.  Can I get a teething biscuit?  My finger's feeling pretty abused right now.  I can't find them. Catalina!  Those are Mateo's teething biscuits.  Shut up!  (chuckles) Well, every bit  as good as the biscotti at La Bella Ferrara.  (laughing): So sorry!  Inhala, exhala, Jane.  Remember, just four more days.    XIOMARA: She's still here?  Yup. Apparently, she and Raf are  (like Catalina): getting on so well  Plus, she wants to be great mates with me.  I don't know how you can stand her.  Just the other day I was telling Gloria Estefan  what a shameless name dropper Catalina is.  - Did you tell Oprah, too? - No, just Gayle.  XIOMARA: How's Michael holding up?  Better than I am. Mostly because he's so excited  to go back to work.  - He got the all-clear? - Any day now.  But what do I do about Catalina?  I've been dropping subtle hints,  and she is not picking up on them.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of subtle hints  Mmm!  What a miracle that my Tiago product integration  has yielded me my new favorite cereal!  It is super delicious.  Subtle is overrated. Just kick her out.  But I feel bad.  I was the one who invited her to stay.  And, I mean, it's not like she'll be on my couch forever.  - Right? - Jane!      Oh, sorry, Abuela,  I'm meeting my discussion group at school.  My new chapter's being critiqued, and I threaded in  some suspense, so I want to see how it landed.  Oh. I'm on the edge of my seat.    What?    That's not true. I just went last  Mm-hmm.    Wow. She's really laying on the guilt.  Ma, come on, she's busy.      What? Why?      El diablo?    (chuckles): Yeah. Right.      (laughs): Damn, Jane, you just got Abuela'd.      (dramatic music plays)    ROGELIO: So, are you feeling guilty  about anything, Xiomara?  No. Why?  No reason. Just curious.  Well, uh, I should go, too.  Oh.  - Where are you going? - I told you.  Meeting with the electrician at the studio.  Interesting.  - Not really. - Hey, why don't I  come with you? I have a lot  of questions about electricity.  No, that's okay, you don't have to.  - Oh, but I'd like to. - Oh, it's gonna be boring.  You underestimate my fascination with electricity.  - And it'll take hours. - Stop the nonsense, Xiomara!  I know you're meeting Bruce!  - What? - I saw you kissing him  the other night.  I don't understand You said you told him off.  I did. But then we started talking  and he's different.  - He-he got a divorce. - Then why are you  keeping it a secret?  Because Jane would be really upset if we were together.  A-And we're not yet. We're-we're just  exploring.  Please, don't say anything.  I don't want to be in the middle. Just give me some time.  And, look  I know it must have been hard seeing me with someone else.  (stifled laugh): Oh, please.  I have hundreds of women lining up to meet me. Literally.  So while you are meeting with your one measly lover,  I will be meeting with a matchmaker.  WOMAN: First of all, I'm not a matchmaker.  I am a love dealer. That's trademarked.      So, it says you want someone fertile?  Exactly. I need a woman who wants children right away.  That's nonnegotiable.  And while I heard that thing about beauty  being only skin deep, I have to look at that skin,  so let's double down on that.  - Okay. Anything else? - Bilingual a plus.  Fluent in social media.  Comfortable with my fame.  And with sharing my penis with the world. Oh.  I will be shooting a full-frontal role next week.  Tell the ladies that. My penis is  - big-screen-worthy. - I'm sure. But you won't be  showing it to any of my girls.  That's one of my three rules.    No talking about exes.    No heavy drinking on dates.    And most importantly, no shtupping until it's serious.    Rogelio de la Vega doesn't shtup.  - He makes love. - Whatever.  No lovemaking until it's serious.  This is about building a strong foundation  for a real relationship, Rogelio.  Oh, I understand.  But you should prepare the women  for the devastation they will feel  once they learn they won't be able to immediately  make love to me.  I don't want to shock them.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of shocks  - (door closes) - (screams, gasps)  - You scared me. - Oh. Sorry.  I'm four hours into a Hitchcock binge.  - What? Why? - My writer's group.  They all agree that I should push farther  with this whole Rear Window thing in my novel.  I just played along.  I had no idea what they meant. But I'm catching up.  Turns out this Alfred Hitchcock is pretty good.  Four years I've been trying to get you to watch.  Four years. Live in the here and now, baby.  Oh, are those notes you're taking?  Uh, I'm not experienced with suspense,  but I'm learning a lot He had this  - âbomb under the tableâ theory. - Oh, that's easy.  Controlled detonation's really your only hope to defuse a bomb.  Here's how it works. Take a scene  with two people sitting at a table talking.  Really boring, right?  (yawning): Yes. Much like a scene  with two married people sitting on a couch talking.  Now tell the audience that there's a bomb  under the table.  I'm listening.  And you're waiting for that bomb to go off.  You have to give the audience information  the protagonist doesn't have to build tension.      Then you let one character know about the bomb,  but they can't tell anybody.  Now you're on the edge of your seat  wondering what that person's gonna do.    And just when the audience can't stand the tension,  you defuse it! In the nick of time,  someone throws the bomb out the window, it never goes off.    I still think a SWAT team and controlled detonation's the way to go.  (grunts)  (laughs)  Hmm, I like these rules.  In fact, I'm going to try out rule number one.  See this? What's in that envelope  is going to change everything.  Did it work? Are you on the edge of your seat?  In any case, we're not there yet.  Some groundwork to lay first.  So, your mother's  coded bank account number links to this convent in Italy.  A convent?  I take it she wasn't religious.  - We certainly never went to church. - Hmm.  Suspicious.  (theme to Alfred Hitchcock Presents playing)  The convent's in Orvieto.  - That's where my mother was born. - She's been paying them  ten grand a month since 1984.  Any idea what those payments might be about?  I have no idea. I hardly knew her.  (grunts)  But monthly payments  Why, that sounds like  A bribe or blackmail.  - RAFAEL: So what now? - We wait to see  what the Italian authorities dig up  on those-those-those-those crooked little nuns.  Stop it right there.  - All nuns aren't crooked. - (hissing)  Seriously, you can't assume that all nuns are evil.  Watch it with the knife.  All we know right now  is someone in the convent deposited those checks.  Finding out exactly who  is like a needle in an Italian haystack, for now.  So while we're on the subject of  Catholic stuff,  I was wondering if I could take Mateo Sunday mornings.  Every Sunday?  Yeah. I want to start bringing him to church.  No. No, he's too young.  Well, I went to church when I was his age.  And you can't just say, âno.â  Well, I can't just say âyes,â either.  It's part of a bigger conversation.  - What is? - I just don't  want him to be super religious.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. As you recall, the new dynamic  between Jane and Rafael involves Rafael  feeling much more comfortable disagreeing with Jane.  Which Jane really hates.  And by super religious, you mean  Church every Sunday, before he's able  to make the choice to go for himself.  - That's not super religious. - Well, it is to me.  And wait, I already told you,  if I disagreed, I'm gonna push back.  Yeah, but I was hoping, like, once a year.  You're the one that brought up church.  Because it is so important to me.  MICHAEL: Well, it's not that important.  (laughing): We haven't even gone since we were married, so  So that's a no on church every Sunday.  Thank God.  - I mean, who does that? - It just came out.  We have to be a united front  - with Rafael. - I know. I know. I'm sorry.  - But it's true, right? - That I haven't  been going to church? Yes, it's true, so we're going to start.  - We? - Yes.  - Jane. - Hmm?  You know I'm more of a âC and Eâ Catholic.    Can we just try this Sunday?  Fine I guess I'll try being a C, E and TS Catholic.  Thank you. Mmm.  (door opening)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, geez.  I'd almost forgotten about this pain in the  Hello, lovebirds.  - Baby asleep? - Oh, baby isn't here.  Fantastic.  Let's grab a cup of something, shall we?  (mouthing)  It's just that Michael and I are newlyweds.  And we have Mateo.  And of course, we love having you here.  (laughing): Uh, I-I mean, love.  - Love, love. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right Jane.  Rein it in, before this turns into another subtle hint.  But, uh, the space is small,  and with three adults  Oh, say no more.  I have been so thick.  I should have left ages ago.  - Oh - No.  It's just that it's been so fun getting to know you.  Oh, you, too really.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted, for a brief moment,  Jane did feel a little sad.  I need to go, anyway, I do.  I'm chairing this huge gala at Lincoln Center  for DRIA, Devoted Residents Inspired by the Arts.  They bring music lessons  to underprivileged children.  But, yeah. The moment was brief.  Anyways, I'll take off tomorrow.  (sighs)  ROGELIO: Honestly, it's so hard lying to Jane.    Just the other day, she asked me where her mom was,  and I had to make something up.  Thank God I'm a very skilled improviser, no?  But I want to tell her so badly.  And yet, I didn't want to betray Xiomara's trust.  What do you think I should do?  I don't know, Rogelio.  You don't seem very good at keeping things in.  (chuckling): So maybe you should just tell Jane.  DARCI: Denise Richards doesn't deserve this bull crap.  ROGELIO (on phone): I'm so sorry.  You broke my rules.  And you disrespected Denise Richards.  I know. I feel terrible.  I just had family on my mind.  You're out of the club, Rogelio.  No, no, no, no, Darci Factor.  I want to stay in, please. I need this.  I'm sorry I blew it; maybe it was just nerves.  Please High Dollar Love Dealer,  can't you give me one more chance?  I promise I'll do better at the mixer.  I'm postponing the mixer.  The restaurant I booked just dicked me over.  Well, have it at the Marbella Hotel, then.  - What? - My grandson's father owns it.  He'll be thrilled.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He doesn't look thrilled.  - (Mateo squealing) - PRIEST: of St. Josemaria Escriva.  - (Mateo shrieks) - RAFAEL: Shh.  I told you he was too young.  He's not; he'll get used to it.  - RAFAEL: Shh. - (Mateo shrieks)  - PRIEST: with Christ - Am I crazy?  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Careful, Michael. - The choir's starting soon.  - Mateo likes music. - (Mateo laughing)  - All honor and glory is yours - RAFAEL: Shh.  - I'm gonna take him outside. - (Mateo giggling)  Shh, shh.  (quietly): Sorry, sorry, sorry.  PRIEST: He is the creator.  And he is a loving father who waits for us  to come back to him again and again.      Mateo, wait.  Hey, come here, come here.  (Mateo giggling)  (church bell tolls)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Holy moly. What the hell was that?  You said you'd try, not give it five minutes.  Rafael, what's wrong?  I had this weird memory.  I think my mother did take me to church once.  What did you remember?  Not much. Uh, just being there.  - (bell tolling) - Hearing church bells.  My mother taking my hand.  Well, keep thinking about it.  Anything you remember could help.  No wonder he doesn't want Mateo going to church.  His creepy mom probably brought him to a creepy church.  Hmm.  So am I allowed to contradict you when Rafael isn't here?  (clicks tongue) Michael! Of course.  Well, then I don't know.  Mateo feels a little young for every Sunday.  I mean, you saw him, Jane.  It was torture, staying still like that.  He'll get used to it.  And why are you pushing this so hard right now?  Because it's important to me.  Religion is really important to me.  Okay.  (sighs)  (door opening)  - Hey. - Hi.  CATALINA: Hello, hello.  - What are you doing here? - Oh, it's the craziest story.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here we go. - I popped over  to say good-bye, we went out for a meal.  Next thing, he asks me to consult  on the lounge menu, so I figured,  why the hell not?  And we're adding pÃ¢tÃ©.  Who likes pÃ¢tÃ©?  Come here, Mr. Sweetface.  Don't you dare Mr. Sweetface.  Come here, yeah.  - Uh - Judas.  But what about New York?  The big gala you're chairing.  Oh, they're lousy with chairs.  They'll do fine without me.  Bye, Mateo.  Mommy will be back. (laughs)  (church bell tolls)  ELENA: I told you Mommy would be back.  JANE: I'm telling you it was suspicious.  Cat just breezed off in a sudden flurry when I brought up  the gala, like she clearly didn't want to talk about it.  I met Catalina two weeks ago,  and I've seen her breeze off in a flurry at least 30 times.  It's how she exits the room.  Okay, we'll, it's not just that.  I looked up the DRIA gala Web site,  and her name is nowhere on there.  They have five co-chairs listed,  seven honorary chairs,  no Catalina. What do you think about that?  I think maybe you've got Hitchcock on the brain.  Don't be condescending. I'm sorry.  It just doesn't sound that odd.  Listen, I'm at work, by the way.  How? You're not cleared yet.  Well, I'm cleared enough to set up my desk.  Which is what I'm officially doing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wink, wink.  Love you.  I love you, too.  I love you, too so much.  So tell me what we got.  And remember, I'm not a cop,  - just a true crime hobbyist. - Right.  So, remember our favorite Italian convent  - getting 10K a month from Mutter? - Mm-hmm.  They also had several significant pieces  of art go missing  starting in the early 1980s.  So you're thinking she was dealing in stolen art?  With the help of the convent?  Take a look.  All these pieces were reported stolen  from the convent in Orvieto.  Oh, my God.  MICHAEL: Rafael?  You've seen that one?  Maybe.  Everything here belonged to my father.  This part is climate controlled.  For valuables sensitive to temperature changes.  Like art, which my father collected.  Wow.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Holy Mother of God!  That was reported stolen from the convent.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: O-M-G!  I'm getting vertigo.  Stop spinning!    JANE: Rafael, are you okay?  (sighs)  - I got to get Dennis down here. - No. No, please.  Don't call the police.  When my dad died, I found financial irregularities.  Mystery cash  coming in and out of the Maracay Group over the years.  Part of me knew  that this art might be stolen, but  I didn't want to ruin my father's legacy.  - So - (cell phone rings)  I covered it up.  - Oh, no. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Dude.  - It's Dennis. - Please don't say anything.  I'll put him off for now.  - (sighs) - (door closes)  I hate putting Michael in this position.  And yet you are.  What else am I supposed to do?  Maybe don't do illegal things in the first place.  I really don't need a lecture right now. No.  No.  - What? - You don't get to say that.  You get to express your opinions, I get to voice this.  - Those are two different things. - Really?  Because maybe if you went to church,  you would know right from wrong.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn, Rafael. You just got Jane'd.  You don't have to lie.  I mean it.  I know.  (sighs)  (ringtone playing)  - Hey, Dad. - ROGELIO: Hey.  I'm here for the mixer. Just wanted to say hi,  if you're around.  I'm meeting Cat for dinner. Sorry.  Hey, have you talked to Mom, by the way?  She owes me a call.  Me? No.  Ugh, she's apparently doing some kind of zoning thing.  I mean, how long could that possibly take?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, well, he'd had it.  Basta ya!  I will not be used as her beard!  You got it out of me!  The truth is,  your mother and Bruce  have rekindled their torrid love affair!  What?!  JANE: Mom, call me back. We need to talk.  I just talked to Dad, and we need to talk.  (sighs)  DARCI: That's right.  Phones off!  Connections are made  by peering into the soul, not staring at a screen.    You will have seven minutes with each candidate.  If after seven minutes you want to know more, just mark it down,  and you'll have a chance to set up a date.  Okay?  Go!  ROGELIO: You have the raw sexuality of a jungle cat!  Roar! (laughs)  But I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling it.  ROGELIO: You have the luminosity  of a Botticelli.  Yeah, I've-I've heard that before.  But I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling it.  ROGELIO: Wow. You have the breasts of a Hungarian milkmaid.  Yeah. I've won contests.  But I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling it.  What are you doing here?  Jane called me. What did you tell her, Rogelio?!  - It just slipped out. - It was my news to tell!  Well, when were you going to do that?  When the time was right.  Admit it, Rogelio.  You did this on purpose  because you don't want it to work out with me and Bruce.  - That's ridiculous. - At least be honest.  Okay, you know what? Fine. Maybe a little.  Because it's hard watching you move on.  What if I don't find what we have?  I'm here with a room full of women  I'm not attracted to in the least!  (women murmuring) Huh? What?  WOMAN: Really?  Ladies,  let me rephrase that, huh?  JANE: So how'd you get out of it?  Hmm? The charity thing you chair?  How'd you get out of going?  Oh, I just told them something came up.  I mean, when Raf offered to put me up at the hotel,  how could I resist?  You definitely didn't.  (laughs): No.  I've never chaired anything before.  Is it hard work, chairing?  I'd-I'd love to know some details.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm pretty sure this is Jane sussing Cat out.  Oh, it's boring, all of it.  I'm so glad you wanted to have dinner.  I thought you were angry with me, honestly.  - Me? No. - She just thinks you're hiding something.  Okay. I just need five more minutes.  (blow dryer whirring)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: O-M-G. Is that cash?  And jewels?!    Holy Hitchcock!  CATALINA: Jane?    - Jane! What are you doing? - You are not a chair  for the Devoted Residents Inspired by the Arts.  - What?! - I thought it was weird  that you suddenly bailed on your gala.  And I didn't find your name anywhere on that Web site.  Because I'm an anonymous benefactor.  What does that have to do with my bag?  I saw cash and jewels.  I mean, that's suspicious, right?  Not when you've just reentered the States  from Venezuela, where it's recommended  non-residents carry U.S. dollars.  Darling, ATMs aren't safe.  Foreign credit cards aren't reliable.  The jewels are family heirlooms I intend to place for auction  at Sotheby's once I'm back in the city.  At which point, I'll send the money back to Venezuela,  where our family is desperately poor,  along with the rest of the country.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, Jane, I think it's time to start groveling.  I am so, so sorry.  DARCI: I had you all wrong.  You are just the kind of entitled client  I do not tolerate as one of my High Dollar Rollers!  Clearly, you're hung up on your ex.  You've wasted my time  and the time of 27 quality girls I brought you,  including Denise Richards, an Olsen twin and a Duggar.  I will send Denise Richards a Ropology basket.  You're out of the club, Rogelio.  I understand.  Maybe I'm not looking for love after all.  Would have been nice to know that before I put your picture on my Twitter.  I just mean, I might have to accept  it's not gonna happen right now, which is okay.  What's more important to me is a baby.  If you don't mind my asking,  why are you so obsessed with having a kid?  Well  I only met my daughter Jane recently,  and being her dad has been the greatest joy in my life.  But I didn't get to do it  from the beginning.  And I want that, Darci.  - I don't believe it. - (chuckles): Stop.  She went through your bag.  Life's too short to stay mad.  As the Italians say:  Oggi in figura, domani in sepoltura.  Sorry. ""(voice fading): It means âToday in person, tomorrow in the graveâ""  Kind of like carpe diem.  (church bell tolls)      I told you Mommy would be back.  Now, come on.  RAFAEL: It wasn't a church I remembered.  It was a convent.  There was a nun who spoke Italian and this creepy statue.  It was a woman's head wearing a veil.  MICHAEL: Is that it?    Yeah. Yeah, that looks right.  It's in St. Genevieve's Convent here in Miami.  And guess where their mother superior,  Constantine Ciancuilli,  did her junior nun training.  It's her novitiate, not junior nun training.  Right. She was at the convent in Orvieto.  Okay. So what now? You question her,  you search her office, or what?  MICHAEL: Your childhood memory isn't enough for a warrant.  Plus, if she was involved with your mom  and dealing stolen art, she could run.  Okay, this is interesting.  Mother Constantine visits St. Vincent's Hospital every weekday  at 2:00 pm, and there are tours  of the convent every day at 2:30.  So you want me to take a tour, see if it triggers anything?  Exactly. Anything more specific could get us a warrant.  RAFAEL: Yeah, cool. Okay, so I'll-I'll just go in there  like a tourist and look around at all the nun stuff.  Oh, my God.  You can't go in there calling it ânun stuff.â  Let me go with him.  I'll know the right questions to ask.  Otherwise, he's gonna stick out like a rich, godless sore thumb.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us  well, here.  We're so excited for the tour.  Yes, uh, we hear the main chapel is awesome.  Amen.  (church bell tolls)  (crows cawing, bird screeches)  (Latin Lover Narrator laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sorry. I couldn't resist Hitchcocking it up a bit.  (phone ringing)  Oh, but this is scary enough on its own.  Hello?  WOMAN: A couple showed up out of the blue.  I think one of them is Rafael Solano.  Thank you, Sister.  I'll come right back.  SISTER JULIA: Our convent is in the Gothic style, rare to the Miami area.  In modern times, service to the community  has always been our main priority.  In fact, originally, this convent was European.  The structures were dismantled stone by stone,  - bound with protective hay - What?  Uh, I don't know. Something feels familiar.  Go.  (church bell tolling)  (indistinct, muffled chatter)    (sighs)  Good afternoon, Mother Superior.  You're back early. Will you be joining us for Vespers?  Just after I stop by my office.  Oh, no! I'd say we're in the midst of a classic suspense sequence.  Remember Hitchcock's rules?      SISTER JULIA: All right, and this is the end of the tour.  SISTER MONICA: The Mother Superior is back early,  if you'd like to join her for Vespers.      SISTER JULIA: Oh, there's no cell service here.  Of course.  (chuckles softly)  (phone alarm beeping)    Ugh!  Uh, hey, hey, Sister, hold up!  So sorry. I just so wanted to meet Mother Constantine.  I heard so much about her good works.  And I traveled so far.  I believe she went to her office.  It's that way, through the chapel.  Mother Constantine?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hurry, Rafael! Hurry!  JANE: Mother Constantine.  Oh. Sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Jane, wrong nun!  With age, the hearing isn't so good.  I always knew this day would come.  And, friends,  now it's time for rule number three.    But I'm afraid we can't do that.  Not yet.  Okay, I-I don't understand.  Do you know who I am?  Of course.  You're Rafael Solano.  Okay, what-what is going on?  I'll tell you.  Please sit.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, tension defused.  I don't know about you, but I thought Rafael was in trouble.  I'm sorry. I don't know how to say this.  Then I'll ask.  Were you dealing in stolen art with my father?  Yes.  During my novitiate in Orvieto, the convent was in financial trouble.  Our orphanage, it needed money.  And then your father approached me.  So he paid you to steal it?  In my idealistic youth,  I saw myself as a Robin Hood of sorts,  taking from the rich to help the orphans.  Why did my mother pay you every month, even after he died?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay. I think this is the big reveal.  Brace yourself, buddy.  Elena discovered the deal I made with Emilio  and threatened to expose me.  Unless I did something for her.  She continued to pay me  every month, even though I wanted her to stop.  To remind me, I think.  As if I could ever forget.  In any case, the truth.  You deserve it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember what I said.  This will change everything.  Go on.  Open it.  - I still have so many questions. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Observe Jane  trying to distract the nun she thinks is the Mother Superior.  About the flying buttresses.  Sorry, dear, but we've been over everything I know  about the building's architecture.  Of course, she's definitely not the Mother Superior.  Wait, please!  There is something else I need to talk about.  It's personal.  It's a  r-really personal problem.  Yes?  What do you do if you and your child's father differ,  in terms of religious upbringing?  Oh, well, that's a problem many families face.  Exactly, exactly.  See, I've always gone to mass regularly.  - I mean, not lately, but - And why do you think that is?  Oh. Well, I don't know.  Life got in the way, I guess, and then, um  Well, my husband got shot, and he almost died.  Yeah, so that was big.  Um  And I felt mad at God, honestly.  Because why did that happen?  Why would he do that? I mean, what is the reason?  (sniffles)  - I'm sorry. - No, no, no. It's all right.  Even nuns experience doubt at times.  And I can see that having a relationship with God  is important to you.  And as with all relationships,  sometimes they take work.  So, we should go.  - Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm fine.  Thank you.  (quietly): Sorry. I was trying to distract the Mother Superior.  That's not the Mother Superior.  So, nothing?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, what was in the envelope?  No. Nothing.  And I'm returning the stolen art and turning myself in to the police.  What?  I don't want you to withhold any evidence  that could help with this investigation.  You don't have to make a decision right now.  I've already decided.  I want to set a good example for Mateo.  So I have to stop this completely insane  and corrupt cycle that is the Solano family.  So, I've been thinking,  I should work on my relationship with God right now.  Hold off a little with Mateo.  Yeah?  I think that's a goo gidea.  And I'm happy to go to church with you.  Occasionally.  I'm gonna be busy soon,  back to work. Plus, you and Abuela could use the quality time.  Thank you.  Mwah. Now leave me alone.  - I've got to get some writing done. - Okay.  - Oh, yeah. - Here we go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which she did, for the record.  (sighs)  (thunder rumbling)  For the whole dark and stormy night.  (thunder rumbling)      - And morning. - You're up early.  I want to finish this chapter before brunch at Abuela's.  I'm changing it from a first-person narrative to third.  An omniscient point of view will build suspense.  Agreed.  - Hello? - Case in point,  Michael's about to get terrible news.  Okay.  What's wrong? What's going on?  I didn't pass my physical.  - I can't go back to the force. - What?  No.  They said desk duty.  I can do desk duty.  I'm sorry about Michael.  Yeah. He just needs a little time alone.  Yeah.  Sit?  I know you know.  - About Bruce. - What are you doing, Mom?  - He's changed. He has. - Stop.  He's a good person.  He's a jerk who broke your heart over and over.  Not to mention he's a liar who hid the fact  that he was married from you.  No. He didn't.  - What? - I knew.  I knew he was married when we got together.  Great.  DARCI: I'm giving you one more chance.  Thank you, Darci Factor, thank you.  Because I've found just what you're looking for.  This girl shares your values, your desires.  No attachments. Has her own money.  And most importantly, wants a baby.  You're not trying to pawn off Chelsea Handler on me again, are you?  Rogelio, it's me.  Not to date.  Just to have a baby with.  Think about it.  We'd be very compatible parents.  Two aging narcissists.  We'd only have the kid half the time.  The other half, we'd get to have lives.  I can't believe you called me aging.  Will you at least think about it?  I'm having a baby!    So, congratulations on your bouncing baby  business arrangement.  Thank you.  (ringtone playing)  - Catalina. Hey. - CATALINA: Hey, love.  I'm I've just come from Raf's and I'm a bit worried.  He seems really upset, but he wouldn't say why.  - Oh, no. - Yeah, I thought you should know.  Yeah, thanks for telling me. I'll check in on him.  I feel terrible for misjudging her.  I had her all wrong.  (knocking)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or did she?  (French accent): How could you run out on me like that, huh?  And with my mother's jewels?  Oh, no. Does this mean you're mad?  Stay mad at you?  - Impossible. - (giggles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, get me out of here.  This is cray-cray, right?  It's just been a pretty crazy day, so  I wanted to check in.  Rafael.  What is it?  Mother Constantine gave it to me.  It's a secret she kept for Elena for 32 years.  Open it.  What is it?  It's a birth certificate.  My birth certificate.  I was born in Italy.  Right around the time Elena lost a baby.  She bribed the nuns, and they brought me over.  What?  I'm not a Solano.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes, like I told you,  that envelope will change everything."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, Jane and Michael.  They'd been through a lot, right?  They got married, he was shot,  then recovered.  But things were on the up-and-up,  until  I didn't pass my physical.  I can't go back to the force.  I can do desk duty.  I know, huge bummer, right?  Also a bummer: Rafael's life.  RAFAEL: My birth certificate. I'm not a Solano.  And speaking of bad news,  Rafael was also hooking up with Jane's cousin, Catalina,  and Jane wasn't too comfortable with that.  JANE: I saw cash and jewels.  I mean, that's suspicious, right?  Not when you've just reentered the States  from Venezuela, where it's recommended  nonresidents carry U.S. dollars.  I am so, so sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But maybe Jane was right  to be worried, because check this out.  And there was more bad news.  Petra was being blackmailed  by a certain sleeveless slimeball, namely Scott.  So she struck up a deal with Rafael.  I'll give you your shares back  if you lie about Scott.  To be clear,  Petra hated Scott, for obvious reasons.  (record scratches) Oh, sorry,  in case you've forgotten those reasons,  a recap within the recap.  Petra was paralyzed by her twin sister, Anezka,  who then took her place.  And then, Anezka fell in love with Scott,  as Petra!  But then Petra woke up  and dumped his ass.  Okay, back to the main recap.  Anyway, that's why Petra hated Scott.  Oh, and Jane's father, Rogelio, had met a matchmaker.  - So, it says you want someone fertile? - Exactly.  And surprisingly, this happened.  Rogelio, it's me.  Not to date, just to have a baby with.  Think about it.  I'm having a baby!  And Jane's mom was getting some action, too.  See, she was back with Bruce.  Yes, that Bruce. From way back when.  - I had sex with Bruce three days ago. - What?  And yep, Jane's still not a fan.  He's a jerk,  who broke your heart over and over,  not to mention he's a liar  who hid the fact that he was married from you.  I knew he was married  when we got together.  Great.  Which, friends,  is where we left off.  A little bit of trivia  about Jane Gloriana Villanueva:  She had seen the movie Beaches  14 times.  Diana  Once  every time her mother broke up with Bruce.  Thanks for watching again.  -  - It just helps me, you know?  To cry about something other than him.  I know, Mom. I know.  And that time with her mom,  well, it taught her two things.  She was the wind beneath Xo's wings.  I just thought this time,  it would be different.  And people don't change.  -  - Which brings us here, now.  So, thank you for inviting me over for breakfast.  Thank you for bringing muffins. They were delicious.  You are.  (sighs)  Hey,  - Jane. - Hey.  Hi, Mom. Bruce.  I'll see you later.  Can you at least not make that face?  I'm sorry, it just happens automatically.  Maybe warn me before I'm gonna see him.  I live here, we're dating, you're gonna see him.  Does Abuela know that he was here?  We all had breakfast. He brought muffins.      You ate breakfast with Bruce?        - Why? - Because he's changed, Jane.  Mom, do you hear yourself?  I mean, you have literally said that to me  a hundred times before.  I know, but this time it's different.  - And that. - Enough.  I'm with him.  So it's time for you to get on board.  Fine, I'm on board.  I am!  See?       ROGELIO: Yes, I want your opinion.  (goofy voice): Okay, Rogelio.  Mr. Bee thinks  having a baby with a woman you just met  is craz-z-zy!  (laughs)  Well, Mr. Bee, I respectfully disagree.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. You'll recall,  Rogelio had recently decided to enter into  an unusual business arrangement with this woman.        You see, my striped friend,  this is the perfect solution to my ""progeneeds.""  Well I think you're progenuts!  - (laughs) - (door opens)  (door closes)  (groans) I cannot believe she is back  together with Bruce.  And now my grandma's brainwashed.  I think we should do something,  like stage an intervention.  Oh, no. I'm staying out of it.  MICHAEL: Yeah, I'm with Rogelio.  What do you think, Mr. Bee?  You mean Mr. Let It Bee?  I think Jane shouldn't meddle.  You don't get a medal for meddling.  Nobody likes a meddler!  - Don't you have to be at work? - I get to go to the body shop first.  $500 bucks for a new bumper.  - Oh, no, seriously? - Yeah.  But, it beats sitting around the office.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  He's on desk duty, you'll recall.  Desk duty sucks.  (giggles)  Maybe you should use the time  to start researching other career options.  I'm serious. If you take some kind of action,  I really think you'll feel better.  - Mm. - (gasps)  I'd help you, Michael.  Aw.  But I can't use a computer,  'cause I don't have any fingers! Whoa!  (laughs)  I'm gonna hide that thing.  All right,  are you ready to see Daddy, Mr. Sweetface?  Yes, you want to see Daddy.  Where is Daddy, Mr. Sweetface?  (phone chimes)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: In his defense,  he's had a lot on his mind.    What do you think, Mateo?  Should we pop by and see how Auntie Catalina's doing?  - Hmm? - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  Catalina.  Oh.  Jane.    -  - (sighs) We had some time to kill,  so we wanted to say hi.  And,  apologize, again.  For snooping through your bag  and thinking that you were hiding something.  Bonjour!  Who are you?  I am Catalina's husband, Arnaud.      (trumpet plays)  You're married?  He's being a little dramatic.  Dramatic?  I am not being dramatic!  We're getting divorced.  We are not.  CATALINA: Yes, we are!  Now for the last time, go pack.  I'm taking you to the airport.  - So I should explain. - Uh, yeah, that'd be a good idea.  I married Arnaud on a passionate whim  a few months ago.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That old guy? Come on,  it had to be about money.  It was wild and romantic,  and not about money.  He actually has a title, but not a penny to his name.  Okay, get to the point.  Right. Everyone told me  not to marry him, but I did it anyway  and, well, it turns out everyone was right.  Why wouldn't you just tell me?  Because it was embarrassing.  ARNAUD: I can hear you!  Well then stop listening!  Anyway, we had just met  and I didn't want you to think poorly of me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, that yacht has sailed.  What about all the cash and jewelry?  Is that really for our poor relatives in Venezuela?  Mostly, yeah.  I mean, a few are gifts from Arnaud,  which I wanted to sell, but he wants back,  so fine, I'll give them back.  Did you hear that?  I'll give them back!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted  that Jane's next thought  was that she needed to tell Rafael!  - Right away. - (buzzing)  Remember, Jane, don't meddle!  You need to tell Rafael. Right away.  Just tell me.  (sighs)  The DNA results came in and it's confirmed.  You are not Emilio and Elena's biological son.  Wow.  (scoffs)  Somehow it didn't seem real until now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What does this mean?  Is he still Emilio's heir?  Does he still own the Marbella?  God, I wonder if my dad knew.  And that's why he always treated me differently.  Right. That, too.  I'm sorry.  And just so you know,  you're under no legal obligation  to disclose that information to anybody.  Sorry to interrupt, but Rafael,  we're actually waiting on you in the interrogation room.  Oh, that's where everyone is. Okay, let's head over.  Uh, sorry, man.  Because of the desk duty, you know.  Chief says you can't be in on this anymore.  I get it.  - I'm really - It's okay.  -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Tough day.  PETRA: What are you up to?!  And it just got worse.  You and Scott.  Are you are you working together?  Manipulating me?  I'll remind you, they were.  I told you it would work. And you will be  getting that bonus as discussed.  Of course not.  He bought a new car. Where'd he get that money?  I saw you two talking!  And friends,  can you really blame Rafael  for what he said next?  Petra.  I think you're being a little paranoid.  Which makes sense,  considering what you just went through.  (laughs)  Well, I can.  That was a low blow.  JANE: You're never gonna believe this!  I was dropping Mateo off and so we stopped by  to visit Catalina and turns out, she's married.  What's wrong?  Did things go badly with Rafael, because  No, no, no. It's, uh  it's not Rafael. I, um  I sort of I quit my job today.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, she wanted him to take an action.  I'm sorry for not talking to you about it first.  It just  I'm not even allowed to be involved on cases  I've staked my entire career on.  And then some rookie  gave me a 20-minute lecture  on the proper way to fill out evidence log forms  and I don't know, I-I quit.  And then I panicked, 'cause I knew  I should have talked to you first.  No. I get it.  You do?  Yes, of course.  Oh, I don't want you to be miserable.  (sighs)  Armstrong gave me a six-month severance package,  so, it gives me some time to figure out my next move.  Okay, six months is good.  I think it was the right move.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw.  She doesn't even look nervous.  Oh. Now she does.  ""Those must be"" I'm sorry I was judgy about Bruce,  but Michael quit his job"" coffees.  Eh, you should see how they butcher my name.  Uh-oh.  Maybe Jean and Zoe  have something else to discuss.  (sighs)  What happened?  Nothing. I'm fine.  - Ma - I don't want to discuss it with you.  You can't be objective when it comes to Bruce.  Okay. I get it.  (footsteps departing)  Is she okay?  (buzzing)  Remember, Jane. You don't get a medal for meddling.  Yeah. She's great. Thanks, Bruce.  - Jane, please. - Why won't you just leave her alone?  (gasps)  Because I care about her.  Oh, yeah? Is that why she's in there, crying?  Again? Just like she did for three years straight.  And do you know who had to stand by her and pick up  the pieces every time?  Me.  So I'm sorry.  I-I just I can't be on board.  ROGELIO: I told you, it wouldn't be contentious.  Yes, great, you were right, and I was wrong.    Let's finish up. Schooling.  Private or public?  - Private. - Private.  And nannies?  The more the merrier.  - Vacations? - Summers in Tulum.  Winters in Aspen.  How about media appearances?  Vanity Fair at three months,  People en EspaÃ±ol at six months,  and Us Weekly cover shoot at a year.  Have you settled on a last name?  Hmm. (gasps)  De La Vega Factor?  DARCI: The De La Vega Factor.  I like it.  Very good. Just, uh, one final matter.  Procedure. Will you be having sex or using insemination?  Insemination.  I'm worried Darci will fall  for me if we make love.  And it's important for us both  not to have feelings for each other,  to make this work.  I totally agree.  Plus, I froze my eggs years ago.  I want to use the youngest ones.  Isn't she the best?  Relentlessly practical.  (chuckles) Okay, great.  I will have copies of the agreement  for you both to sign in the next couple of days.  ROGELIO: It's happening, people.  The negotiations are done.  All we have to do is sign the contracts,  and in nine months, out comes Rogelio Jr.,  or Rogeliana.    Well, no, that's the only thing she hasn't agreed to.  Yet. (laughs)  What is it?  I-I just can't believe you're actually  going through with this.  What do you mean? I've been talking  about it for weeks.  Yeah, well, you always have crazy ideas  but you never actually follow through.  What are you talking about?  We need to bond as a family.  -  - One year. A trip around the world!  -  - I am all about Kaballah.  Here, I got you all red strings.  From now on,  you can call me Yahweh.  -  - I'm thinking of growing a man bun.  It's a terrible idea.  The man bun? Because I'm still debating.  No! The baby. You hardly know her.  We agreed on absolutely everything about child rearing.  Plus, you know how much I want another child.    Mm.    I would very much like to introduce you.  Trust me, to know her  is to love her in a totally non-emotional,  nonsexual way.  RAFAEL: I don't understand.  Why wouldn't you just tell me? I'm divorced.  I mean, we've talked about my divorce.  I know. And I can't really explain it,  except that I'd made such a huge mistake,  and it felt so good not to think about it  or talk about it. Finally.  Plus, I have a habit of running from problems  rather than dealing with them.  Well. I can relate to that.  Darling,  I wasn't looking for anything when I met you.  This this just happened.  And is it over?  With the old guy?  - Oh, don't call him that. - I googled him. He's old.  - I said it was a mistake. - Is it over?  Absolutely. Ask Jane. She heard me tell him to pack up and go.  Jane met him?  JANE: I'm sorry. I wasn't sure what to do.  I told her to tell you.  You should have told me.  (sighs) Yeah. You're right.  How'd you leave things?  Well, she swears it's over with the old guy.  What do you think? You trust her?  I'm not sure.  Yeah. Me neither.  Look, if anything else happens  Absolutely. Anything I know, you know.  ANEZKA: What would you like to know?  Anything at all?  Answers from the beyond,  available here, today.  Beautiful sister,  what are you doing here?  Trust me, it was a last resort.  It's so good to see you.  Oh, one of the pimps at my motel  was going to let me use his cell phone  to call you but then he got knifed in the stairwell  and had to go to hospital so it didn't work out.  Look, I'm only here because I need to know.  Has Scott reached out to you at all?  No. Why? Has he asked about me?  No! I just don't know if he's up to something.  He has money, suddenly. That's what I need to know.  I need to know where is it coming from.  Beautiful sister,  are you okay?  No. No, I-I am not okay.  You paralyzed me. And now I'm paranoid,  and I can't trust anyone, not even myself.  I need you to leave.  Yeah. That's That's part of the problem.  No! This is my booth.  I had to fight man who sells dreamcatchers for it.  No. I meant the United States.  I'll get you a ticket.  - You're going back to the Czech Republic. - No. But  It's either that or you're going to jail.  MICHAEL: I mean, it's highway robbery.  So I went to the car dealership  to see about leasing a new car,  (snaps fingers) and suddenly, it hit me.  JANE: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.  You want to be a car salesman?  Come on down to Seven Star Auto Dealer,  where our prices are insane!  Um Do you really think you'd like it?  Well, I mean, uh, enough.  It's a job. Steady pay.  Yeah. Y-You're just not really a car guy.  I'm a car guy.  What's your favorite car?  Uh the the DeLorean.  Okay, I'm not a car guy.  - But I might become a car guy. - Just don't rush into anything.  I want you to do something you're passionate about.  Yeah, well, having sex with you doesn't pay that well.  (laughs) Just promise me  you'll wait a beat before interviewing  at the car dealership. Maybe try  the aptitude test I gave you.  - (knocking on door) - There's someone at the door.  Okay, I'll be home soon.  Love you. Bye.  (knocking continues)  I can't believe that you yelled at Bruce.  What were you thinking?  Mom. You're already fighting, he's already making you cry.  We weren't fighting. We were talking  about his teenage daughter, Tess, who hates me.  He said we'd just keep working on it,  - and I just felt sad. - Oh.  Yeah. And he thought that she'd get past it eventually  She's only 16, right?  But now, after talking to you, he's not so sure she will.  Mom. I'm so sorry.  (buzzing) Mm-mm-mm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: If he won't say it, I will.  Nobody likes a meddler.  Hey, did you pick up the rum cake my mom likes  - for dinner tonight? - Yes.  I even had the baker write, ""Sorry I messed things up  ""with Bruce"" in vanilla frosting. (laughs)  Just kidding.  It's in the fridge.  Thank you.  And career aptitude test complete and the results are in.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Drumroll, please.  Okay.  So it says here I should be  A detective. Okay.  So that was a big ol' waste of time.  Hey, at least we know that it works.  (sighs) Stop, look.  They give more than one career option.  Plus, it says that you're analytic,  fair-minded, result-oriented, and incredibly sexy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I didn't see ""incredibly sexy"" on that list.  Let's see. A P.I., security consult Ooh!  - An FBI analyst. - Oh, forget it.  All these jobs are just me sitting at a desk, wishing  I was in the field, doing the real investigative work.  I I might as well be a car salesman.  As long as it's something that you're excited about.  I want you to be happy.  - You know what would make me happy? - Hmm?  Not going to this dinner with your mom and Bruce.  Can I just make a case as to why I shouldn't go?  I'm listening.  I don't know Bruce. Okay?  I've never met Bruce.  And I'd just be in the way, taking up  precious Bruce-Jane bonding time. Okay?  Plus, I really need to go to the station,  pack up my stuff in the office, say good-bye to the guys.  And I'm making the super cute, ""Don't make me go  ""to the dinner with your mom's boyfriend  ""who you yelled at"" face.  Ugh, fine. Of course.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now  Uh, some wine?  Is this safe to drink?  Oh, yeah, I didn't  He was just making a joke.  Right. (laughs weakly)  Look, I know the idea of me dating  your mom again is a tough pill to swallow.  Yeah, well, there's history there.  Right. Yeah. For my daughter, too.  Did she know,  while you guys were having the affair?  Yeah.  I went over there, once.  Bruce!  - (kicks door) - Bruce!  Come out here!  We both made bad choices.  When your mom finally walked away,  it was my wakeup call.  I was so unhappy, I was making everybody else unhappy.  So I made adchange.  And it was hard.  Every step of the way.  How about your ex-wife?  We're good now.  Finally.  But my daughter's having a hard time,  now that I'm with Xo.  And I would never put her through this  if I didn't think that your mom and what we have  Is worth it.  Just give your daughter some time.  I bet she'll come around.  (exhales)  So, thank you for giving Bruce another chance.  Well, he seems to really care about you.  Right?  So, can we put another dinner on the books?  Maybe a double date?  Yeah, sure.  When?  I don't know, just give me a minute.  What's wrong?  Nothing, I'm tired, I got to get Mateo.  Jane.  Look, I always saw Bruce as the guy who wreaked havoc  on our family, but now you're that person to them.  And I don't know,  I-I don't like thinking about you like that.  I'm sorry, you asked me what was wrong.  No, it's okay, I get it.  Hey, Michael, I'm done with dinner.  I'm picking up Mateo and I'll be home soon.  (laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sacre bleu!  Sorry, I mean, oh, my gosh.  (sighs)  So, of course I told Rafael.  He said he was gonna end it, but I mean, can you believe her?  What? Why are you smiling? None of this is funny.  I'm sorry, I just actually had a breakthrough,  something I'd love to try.  Okay? I don't know if it's a career,  but I'm excited.  Oh, my God, what is it? Tell me.  Okay, well, I went down to the station, um,  and Dennis and the guys, they threw me  a little surprise going-away party,  and I made a speech, and I was cracking everybody up.  I mean, seriously cracking them up.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And  And it made me realize something.  Maybe I should try  my hand at stand-up comedy.  (laughs)  He's not joking, Jane.  Well, that sounds great.  XIOMARA: A comedian?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No, Alba.  Not like Jerry Seinfeld.  I mean, kind of, but kind of not?  - Has he been telling you his jokes? - Oh, yeah. Nonstop.  Okay, check this out. This is something I've been working on.  Inspired by (imitates actor): Jim Carrey.  And then for the next 11 minutes  he talked out of his butt.  Oh.    Yeah, not the Jim Carrey bit.  I agree, Michael is hilarious,  but do you know what the odds are  of becoming a successful comedian?  Well, you're an aspiring novelist.  That's not exactly a straightforward career path.  I know, I agree, and I'm trying to support him.  And you guys will have a chance, too.  He signed up to perform at a comedy club tonight.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Should I get him to postpone? Practice more?  I just don't want him to fall on his face  after all he's been through lately.  If he fails, he fails.  He's a big boy, he can handle it.  (buzzing)  I'm with her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I was, too  along with the rest of the popular vote.  Bee supportive.  No meddling, Missy. (laughs)  Which brings us here. Now.  Oh, my God. Every time I hear it, it just gets funnier.  - Really? - Definitely.  Okay, let's go over my Godfather as Batman bit again.  Go for it.  (imitating Vito Corleone): Hey  I'm Batman, and we're family, okay?  So, what do you think you're doing?  You robbing that bank?  You can't rob from family.  - (laughs) - (chuckles)  Wow. Methinks thou dost crack up too much.  - You are killing me. - (cell phone ringing)  Yes! Oh, hold on, it's Catalina.  Hello?  Rafael just ended our relationship  because you told him you saw me kissing Arnaud.  You got in the car. You kissed him.  A friendly kiss.  I don't kiss my friends like that.  Well, I do, and you should have called me,  and not run to Rafael.  I don't want him to get hurt.  And what about me?  I've known you for a month  and you've lied the whole time.  He's my child's father.  Well, I guess I know  where your loyalties lie.  Yes, you do.  - (cell phone beeps) - Oh.  Okay, who's in the mood for a comedy show?        Totally calm and I totally feel like I'm gonna throw up.  (chuckles)  So, is Bruce coming?  No. He has his daughter,  but thanks for inviting him.  You know, I was thinking about what you said,  about not wanting to see me that way and I get it.  But I've changed  and maybe that's why I think he can, too.  Okay, so Darci will be here any minute.  - You said you'd try. - I am trying.  We are scientifically and mathematically  compatible to breed.  I will show you the algorithm.  Oh, please, you don't even know what an algorithm is.  (mocking): I do, too.  - No, you don't. - Yes, I shh! Darci.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, this calls for another drumroll.  (drumroll plays)  Can I get you a drink?  - Vodka soda. - Iced tea for me.  Oh, that's right. You're about to get pregnant.  Got to keep that body nice and pure.  You've certainly thought of everything.  It's because I'm driving.  Oh.  Look, I'm a straight shooter,  so I'm just gonna say this.  I'm sensing a little tension here.  You think?  I tried to tell her about the algorithm.  I take it you're not on board  with our plan to coparent.  You've only known each other for two weeks.  We've thought everything through,  negotiated the terms of our agreement,  and we took my very comprehensive  compatibility Love Forecast.    It takes a lot more than a compatibility test  to make this kind of commitment,  otherwise, everyone matched on eHarmony would be married.  My Love Forecast is better than eHarmony's  if you're honest.  Question 42 of our compatibility test is,  ""Do you have a supportive family?""  You checked yes,  and clearly, you don't.  I'm gonna go freshen up.  (sighs) What?  Ma, come on. You know this is crazy.              SCOTT: Let me fix this.  There must be something I can do.  No, beautiful sister is certain.  I must go back to Czech Republic.  I just wanted to say good-bye.  I missed you.  Oh, I'm sorry,  it's not the golden locks you fell for.  Oh, no. I It was you who I fell in love with, Anezka.  Please, stay. We can be together.  Without Petra's money, I have no place to live.  No, I have money.  Rafael and I made an arrangement.  I can take care of you, hide you.  No, she'll find me.  She'll put me in jail.  And  she's already suspecting you of something.  Just be careful around her. Please.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow. What is this, The Americans?  He's gonna kill it.  I hope so, my stomach hurts.  Okay, hello, everyone.  Get ready to laugh  or not. I can't really say  because we have a first-time performer  here at The Laugh Outlet.  So, please give  a ""we'll-reserve-judgment"" welcome  to Michael Cordero.  (audience cheering)  (whooping) Bravo, Michael!  Yeah, baby!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Go, Michael!  Come on.  Go, Michael.  Michael, go.  This is either a classic case of stage fright  or an ill-timed series of tiny, consecutive strokes.  You suck.  (microphone feedback)  Can somebody get me a gong already?  (woman laughs)  (man imitates gong ringing)  (audience members laugh)  MAN: Get off the stage.  Psst. You spend a lot of time with a toddler.  - (whispering): I should go. - Hey. You got this.  You spend a lot of time with a toddler.  (audience whispering)  You spend a lot of time with a toddler.  I, uh, I spend a lot of time  with a toddler.  And so And so, um, I-I've been watching  (mouthing) a lot of Sesame Street.  And you know who goes down there one day? Uh  Bobcat Goldthwait.  Yeah, you remember him, right?  From the Police Academy movies.  Well, those movies are actually one of the reasons  why I became a cop, except six,  Under Siege, 'cause that was just goofy.  (Jane and Rogelio laugh)  Anyway, Bobcat talks to Cookie Monster, he's like,  (imitating Bobcat Goldthwait): Hey, um, uh, Cookie Monster,  um, you want to get the biggest cookie you've ever seen?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, this bit goes on longer than it should,  but it should be noted  that Michael wasn't the worst comedian in the world.  This is Jerry Seinfeld as E.T.  (imitating Jerry Seinfeld): Did you ever have a time  where your finger just glows for no reason?  The pirate from Captain Phillips as played by SpongeBob,  uh, Mateo's favorite.  (imitating SpongeBob): Look at me! Look at me!  I'm the captain now.  (imitates SpongeBob's laughter)  Dame Judi Dench as Scarface.  (imitating Judi Dench): First you get the money,  then you get the power,  then you get the woman.  That one went right over Mateo's head.  At least, not to the people who loved him the most.  But on a less comedic note  EMILIO: You are such a disappointment.  We're at 50% capacity.  Dad, I'm working on that.  Just give me a chance.  You're lazy. You're unmotivated.  You've accomplished nothing.  Look at your sister. Even she is on the right path.  Dad, I don't understand why you coddle her.  Luisa's family and  family's everything.  MICHAEL: You are not  Emilio and Elena's biological son.  I wonder if my dad knew.  That's why he always  treated me so differently.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, why does he look so upset?  I can't see anything from here.  That's better.  An addendum to Emilio's will?      I knew I was right to be worried about the money.  And you guys thought I was shallow.  (knocking on door)  Petra, this is not a good time.  Frankly, I don't care.  It's awfully dark in here.  Hiding something?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The will.  What's going on, Petra?  You know, maybe I could have forgiven you  for not knowing I was in a coma.  Maybe I could have forgiven you for,  (pouring drink) I don't know,  sleeping with my sister.  Maybe I could have even forgiven you for  using Scott to screw me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.  Uh, what are you talking about?  He told me.  I went to him,  as Anezka, and he told me.  You made me feel like I  (chuckles) like I was  crazy and paranoid.  - I'm sorry. - Well, I'm not.  'Cause now I know who you really are,  and the lengths you'll go to to get what you want.  But let me tell you something.  You have absolutely no idea  the lengths I'll go to.  XIOMARA: So I wanted to apologize.  I was rude before, and I want to assure you  that Rogelio does have a supportive family.  Doesn't seem like it.  Look, I'm just protective of him.  You guys are moving fast.  In some ways.  But we've both been wanting children  for a really long time,  and we've both been unlucky in love.  - It's a gamble. - Love is a gamble.  This is methodical.  I'm only looking for one quality,  and that's a good father for my child.  And I know Rogelio will be one  because of the way he talks about your daughter.  There you are. Should we go?  I'm shooting my film tomorrow morning,  and, unlike BeyoncÃ©, I don't wake up like this.  Break a leg.  Oh, and I was just telling Darci,  question number 42?    It's a yes.  - So, question. - Hmm?  Did you really think I was funny  when I was practicing and stuff?  I mean, yeah.  Not totally.  Oh, my God. Why didn't you tell me?  You let me make a fool of myself.  I wanted to stay out of it and be supportive,  like Mr. Let It Bee said.  - Oh, I almost forgot about Mr. Let It Bee. - Oh, my God.  - I shouldn't have brought it up. - ""I kinda rely on your meddling, Jane.""  Or your judgments, let's call it.  I would have much rather you told me to save my set  for Christmas with the Villanuevas.  Not even Christmas with the Villa  - I'm just being honest. - Ow. Ouch. Ouch.  (goofy voice): Honestly? Hmm?  Mr. Let It Bee's kinda in the mood.  - Michael, stop it. - Bzzz.  I'm serious.  Let's get bizzzy. Bizzzy!  (laughing)    (phone ringing)  Abuela?    Oh, no. What happened?  I thought she was having brunch with Bruce and Tess.            Oh, no.  (buzzing)  Don't do it, Jane.  No meddling. Remember,  meddling merely makes a mess.  But sometimes meddling's for the best.  Like Michael told you.  - Who are you? - Who am I?  I'm Bette Meddler.  And I say Jane  should put the pedal to the meddle.  - Buzz off. - Do it, Jane.  You're the wind beneath her wings.  You know what? I will.    Uh, let me call you back, Abuela.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know those moments  when a solution is crystal clear  and then you get there and realize it might not be  - such a great idea? - Can I help you with something?  Oh, no, uh  Never mind, I was just leaving.  Wait.  You're Jane Villanueva, right?  What are you doing here?  Did your slutty mom send you here to spy on me?  Uh, no, she didn't.  It's Jane. I recognize her from Instagram.  Her mom's the ho-bag.  You just walked in to the wrong store, girl.  Tell your mom to leave Tess alone.  Yeah, and tell her skanky ass  - to step off. - Girls, please.  Watch your language.  Hey, I got this.  Go fold those graphic sleep tees.  - But We can - Sleep tees!  What do you want?  Just to talk.  Look, I get why you hate my mom,  but she's not who you think she is.  She's changed.  I think you need to change because your outfit is basic.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Dang, she dropped the ""B"" word.  Understand. Got that note.  Anyway, I just mean  my mom wouldn't do the things she did then now.  And I know she is so sorry for how she acted,  and I get how you feel, I honestly do.  But they have something.  They make each other happy.  And trust me, I hate to admit that.  Are you buying anything?  Because I work on commission.  Y-y-yeah.  These, uh these socks.  That's it?  Uh, also, um, this top.  And I can't wait to check out those graphic sleep tees.  And who doesn't need an extra pair of khakis?  I can't believe they costumed me in khakis.    - They're so not flattering. - Relax, Rogelio.  You're only going to be wearing them for a few seconds.  All right. Contract signed.  - Good luck out there. - Wait.  Sorry, I'm just a little nervous.  Is it the nudity?  God, no, not that. That's nothing.  It's just that I'm used to telenovelas,  and this is indie film acting.  It's more subtle.  I just want it to be great.  Now, listen, Rogelio.  Don't you let that doubt creep in.  I know your matchmaking profile inside and out,  and your confidence quadrant was off the charts.  And one day our kid is gonna be so proud of you  for giving this great performance,  so you get out there.  Do it for our future spawn.  Come with me?  I'd love to.  I can't do this anymore.  I don't want to feel anymore.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it was at this rather  inopportune moment  that Rogelio realized something.  Um, Rogelio  Oh, my!  Yeah, can you do something about that?  I don't think I can just now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep, his feelings for Darci  had definitely come up.    Thanks for leaving the stage.  And I have something to confess.  I've grown feelings for you.  Yeah, I kind of picked up on that.  But you gotta get over it  if you want to have a baby with me, understand?  (sighs) How bad is it?  Did I make everything worse?  Actually, Bruce and Tess had  their first bonding moment in a while,  over how unhinged you seem to be.  And we rescheduled brunch.  - She's giving me a chance. - That's great.  - I'm so happy I helped. - Yeah, well,  no helping anymore.  Why? Michael appreciates it.  He's your husband.  There are many, many things  you should do with your husband  that you shouldn't do with your mom.  Good point.  I'll stay out of your relationship with Bruce.  Gotta go. Love you.  (phone beeps)  Oh, um, hi.  Jane. Hi.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, I thought  he was done with her.  Sorry, I lost track of time.  Hey, so listen  You don't need to tell me. It's your business.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good choice.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think.  It just seems like a disaster waiting to happen, that's all.  But you're staying out of it, right?  Mm-hmm.  Random question.  How 'bout a lawyer? For what?  For me, like, as a job?  I mean, it's related to police work  and investigating, you know?  Whenever I testify in cases,  I always thought the legal positioning  was interesting.  - Yeah, that's true. - Yeah.  But it's not practical. I'd have to go back to school.  So you go back to school.  Does it feel exciting? That's the important thing.  Is it something you could see yourself doing long-term?  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, the law offices of Michael Cordero Jr.  I like the sound of that.  Oh, wow, you opened your own firm already.  Well, I gotta dream big.  That's what I'm talking about.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, to see that dream  come true.  But alas  I'm not gonna sugarcoat things, okay?  Because I'm your lawyer, so there's confidentiality here.  I'm thinking your father suspected you weren't his son.  That's why he wrote this addendum.  So am I really entitled to nothing?  That's only if the addendum is probated.  From what you're telling me,  you're the only one who knows it exists.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or was he?  It's awfully dark in here.    RAFAEL (over speaker): No, I haven't told anybody.  ALLISON: Let's just keep it that way.  All right? Nobody at all.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep,  looks like someone else  knows it exists, too."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, let's do this thing.  As you know, Jane married Michael,  but then he was shot.  And even though he recovered,  he didn't pass the physical for work,  so he couldn't be a detective anymore.  Bright side, he'd settled on a new career.  - How about a lawyer? - Exciting, huh?  Also exciting, Jane's father, Rogelio, met a matchmaker,  only he made a match with her  or rather, a business arrangement.  Not to date, just to have a baby with.  But then he developed real feelings for Darci,  - which was a big old no-no. - But you got to get over it  if you want to have a baby with me.  And speaking of complicated relationships,  Xo is back together with her old flame, Bruce.  Oh, and Jane's baby daddy, Rafael,  he was dating Jane's cousin, Catalina,  who Jane thought was pretty damn shady.  But she wasn't as shady as Petra's twin sister, Anezka.  You recall Anezka paralyzed Petra and then took her place,  and to make matters worse, she started dating Scott as Petra.  I know! Traumatic, right?  So, when Petra finally woke up, well she was pissed.  I was freaking paralyzed and nobody even noticed.  Oh, and one last thing  Rafael recently found out  he wasn't really a Solano,  and then he discovered an addendum to his father's will,  leaving everything to his biological children,  which means if that will comes to light  well, Rafael stands to lose a lot  of money, that is.  Which, my friends, is where we left off.  It should be noted that Jane Gloriana Villanueva  knew her husband, well,  like she knew herself.  The Law Offices of Michael Cordero Jr.  I like the sound of that.    So, she knew when he decided to be a lawyer,  well, there was no stopping him  MICHAEL: Though the evidence against the defendant  is circumstantial,  it does fit a pattern of behavior, Your Honor.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: from pretending he already was one.  Objection! Your Honor,  the defendant is way too cute,  and the prosecution is way too sexy.  Objection sustained.  High fives.    So  Good news and bad news. Good news,  you can take the LSAT at the end of this month.  -  - Bad news, I got to take the  -  - LSAT at the end of the month  -  - and I suck at tests.  Standardized testing is about learning the rules, the tricks.  You're trying to work in your SAT scores again, aren't you?  No  but, Mateo,  Mommy did really well.  Let me help you.  No, no way. Recipe for disaster.  I just think it'd be smarter for us  to separate church and state, you know?  Yeah.  You're probably right.  But maybe you can make me one of your patented calendars.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  it was the most romantic thing  he could have said.  It just so happens that I'm making myself one  to finish my thesis.  Add me in.  (gasps) I'd love to.  Good and schedule in lots of sex.  Which she did, for the record  Mmm.  As reward incentive for lots and lots of studying.  And I have to say, so far, separating church and state  has proved highly productive    (laughs) I can't believe it.  I actually finished a draft of my novel.  For church, anyway.  Congrats, babe.  State has taken a more laid-back approach,  which is totally stressing church out.  So, what's on the agenda today?  Uh, same. Just hitting the books.  Oh, did I tell you  I got an e-mail confirming my interview  with Putnam Law School on Wednesday?  What? No.  - You never mentioned. - No! Run.  Run. Come on.  Michael, Putnam's the ideal law school.  It's one of the good ones.  It's cheaper and close to where we live.  I know, that's why I'm busting my butt studying.  The-the game helps me relax and focus.  Weren't you gonna drop your novel off with your mom?  Which, for the record, is exactly what she planned to do.  Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?  I want to give her my  Bracelet. Mom  - wanted to borrow it. - She was running late  coming back from Bruce's.  Shoot, I can't wait.    I can't wait, either.  ALBA: Mm-hmm.      Bye-bye, bracelet.  I came here to invite everyone  to the last day of shooting for Tiago.    Okay, to be honest, I'm also here to soak in  all of these lovely family vibes  before I see Darci again.  Is it time?    To explain: Rogelio had not seen Darci  since his feelings mm, came up.  Oh, my!  These three weeks apart were just what I needed.  Whenever my feelings for her would arise,  I tamped them down  and reminded myself  what I'm fighting for:  our potential child.  Dad, what is that?  A composite baby half me,  - half Darci. - Uy.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And 100% creepy. - Yeah.  I can't even look at it.  And luckily I don't have to.  Aw, there's the cutest face on the planet.  Okay, he's cute, too.    WOMAN: Wow!  He's really putting words together.  -  - (chuckles): Yeah, geez.  Chauncy, what do you say?  Mom   That was a full sentence.  I mean, I can hardly  understand him, but  sure, that's a full sentence.  - Is Jules talking? - Not like that.  I mean, âmama, Dada.â  - Exactly. - âBall.â âUp.â  âBabaâ for âbottle.â âDoggie.â  - Maybe, like, 20 words. - Whoa.    (gasps) 21.  (laughs)  Don't stress. All kids learn at different rates.  Yeah. I'm not stressed.  Mateo! Don't put that rock in your mouth!      RAFAEL: A sentence?  I mean, the grammar was all over the place, but yes.  Huh. Should we check in with Dr. Garcia?  If you think so.  You've already made an appointment.  - 11:30 tomorrow. - Mm-hmm.  Come on, Mateo, let's go play with your sisters.  Have fun,  - Mr. Sweetface. - Bye!  Oh-ho.  So, where's Cat?  The days when I have three kids aren't really her speed.  Gotcha.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll remind you,  Catalina isn't really Jane's speed these days.  But since you asked I'm gonna end things with her.  Oh, really?  Stop pretending You're obviously happy.  I'm not.  Okay, fine, I'm a little happy.  Unless you're sad.  I'm fine.  I just don't need the distraction right now.  Actually, there's, um, something else  I wanted to tell you.  A few weeks ago, I found an addendum  to my father's will,  and I've decided to probate it.    I'm meeting with my lawyer on Friday, and  you know, after that, things could change for me.  Financially.  Substantially.  Whatever happens, you'll be fine.  We'll all be fine.  RAFAEL: Thanks. That means a lot to me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.  Someone doesn't look fine.  But she sure does.  Ah! Petra, darling!  To catch you up,  these two first met about three weeks ago.  Hello there. I'm Catalina, and I just thought  I should introduce myself, because I'm dating Rafael and  redesigning the hotel menu!  (laughs) Anything else?  I'm also Jane's cousin.  Oh. You went shopping on Ocean Drive.  (laughs): Oh, no, I'm not a hundred!  I love your watch.  TrÃ©s chic.  Mm. So, I have a proposition for you.  Sexual?  Financial.  (laughs): Oh, what makes you think I need money?  I googled your ex-husband.  Oh, please, there's no other reason you'd marry that guy.  Trust me, I'd know.  (cash register rings)  So, Rafael's ending things with you.  And Jane couldn't be happier about it.  And clearly, you're trying  to manipulate me.  Oh, I absolutely am.  You see, we're alike, you and I,  so I know an opportunist when I see one.  And if a situation's not working, you might as well see  what you can get out of it, hmm?  Well, here's what you can get.  $10,000. And all you have to do is take Rafael away  for one night.  (bell dings, doors open)  I'll think about it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, she's a hard one to read.  JANE: Promise you'll read it soon.  I just need to know if I can give it to Abuela.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall Jane's novel is  loosely based on her grandmother's feud  - with her family in Venezuela. - Mm. I'm sure she'll love it.  Hmm. She seems weirdly into it.  Ah, yes, I almost forgot.  These two are still in the honeymoon phase.  Lots of PDA.    -  - My bracelet?  So, I guess I should head home.  Is Michael still irritable?  So irritable.  Which I get. LSATs are grueling.  Oh, yeah. I was so stressed, my ulcer had an ulcer.  Then I got to the first year of law school and I realized,  ha, that was nothin'.  I basically lived in the law library.  And then it was 90 hours a week in the office racking up  billable hours, massive student debt.  God, it was hard. That's when my marriage really fell apart.  But you guys are gonna be fine.  Is that what it's gonna be like for the next three years?  Assuming he gets in. And if he doesn't,  he's gonna have to wait a whole year to reapply.  And his severance runs out in six months.  - You're spiraling. - I'm totally spiraling.  (whispers): I just feel really unsettled.  Talk to Michael. Share your anxiety.  Remember, he wants you to share your burdens with him.  You're my wife.  Let me help you.  Yeah, you're right.  MICHAEL: Why the hell  would you tell me this now?  - You said to share things. - Yeah,  but it's all about timing, Jane, and now is not a good time!  Telling me all your fears two weeks before  I have to take the biggest test of my life  is not helping me relax.  And I need to be relaxed to study, and I need  to study if I'm gonna get into law school.  Although, apparently, that's suddenly stressful for you, too.  So what's the point of any of this?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well argued, Counselor.  I'm so sorry. I didn't even know  - how stressed I was. - No. No, I get it.  Yeah, of course you can tell me when you're stressed.  You know that, right?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To refresh  Why the hell  Your fears  is not helping  Yeah. Totally.  And I'm also gonna sign up for an LSAT prep class.  I think it'll help me feel better prepared.  I think  that's a great idea.  Maybe I'll try something, too.  Let me guess. Research? Making a list?  Yoga? Really?  Oh. Okay.  I'm trying to figure out how to relax.  And I researched.  I knew it.  And the classes at the Marbella  are very well-rated on Yelp.  - Of course. You should go. - Thank you.  Get ready. Next time you see me,  - I'm gonna be all kinds of Zen. - (chuckles)  Hey, guys. What's going on?  - Hey. - Hey there. You know,  it's probably nothing. But I noticed at Mateo's playgroup,  that the other kids have a lot of words.  Sentences, even. And he doesn't have any, just mama and Dada.  And we know we're probably stressing for no reason.  Well, he should have a few more words than mama and Dada.  Is he bilingual?  I talk to him in Spanish sometimes. My grandma does.  Sometimes kids who grow up in bilingual households  speak later, but then their language suddenly explodes.  It's great for their brain development.  That might be what's happening here.  (sighs) Either that,  or  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on. Use your words.  Let's keep an eye on it for the next three months.  If the words still aren't coming,  we'll consider a speech pathologist.  Try not to stress, though.  It's not good for you. Or him.  XIOMARA: Geez.  How much yoga are you gonna do?  I don't know. A lot.  It's gonna make everything better.  Okay  And I hate to stress you out more,  - Oh, no. Ma. - Hon.  There's no way you can show Abuela your novel as is.  - Really? - I love it  so much, but the way you describe her  and the whole feud with her sister  It's fiction. You know how sensitive she is.    The difference between fiction and reality.  For instance, if I was a cobbler,  with a time portal, I would bring back modern tools  from the future to make cobbling easier, but since it's fiction,  it doesn't need to be perfectly accurate.  Because people take liberties.  You know?  Hmm.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of  Ladies, gentlemen.  Thank you for coming to the last taping  of Tiago.  (applause) WOMAN: Yeah!  Okay.  I've had trouble figuring out what to say  now that Tiago is ending.  What started as a cheap rip-off of Quantum Leap  has become much, much more.  And now, as I stand here,  back where it all began,  in this cobbler's shed,  I realize  we cannot end it here,  absolutely not!  - What? - Sorry.  It just hit me. We can't end Tiago  in the exact same place it began.  Rogelio, we had five meetings about this.  You chose this.  Well, I unchoose it.  We can do better.  We have to do better.  You might want to take your dad with you to yoga.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also in need of relaxing  (gasps)  What the hell are you doing here?  I want to talk to you about Anezka.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Deep breath, Petra.  Find your inner lotus.  Don't send her away.  I love her.  I just saw her the other day, and we still  have a real connection.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. You remember this  I just wanted to say good-bye.  I missed you.  She's already gone.  And that wasn't Anezka,  you idiot, that was me.  That's right.  I know you and Rafael were working together  to screw me.  Get out of here, you vested vermin.  Ah, don't worry, baby.  Petra thinks you're gone.  Now what, my king?  Well, now we get some leverage on her,  so we can be together, out in the open forever.  DARCI: All right, Rogelio.  It's been three weeks, where are we?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Alas, the moment of truth.  Is there still a love connection here?  It's fine; I feel nothing.  Really?  Mm-hmm. (chuckles)  Uh-uh.  (whimpers quietly)  Okay. I have a boner.  Rogelio.  Not a physical boner, an emotional one.  An emo-ner, if you will.  I'm sorry. I have to be honest.  Yeah. I know.  Okay.  So it's a no-go on the kid.  For now.  Unless, perhaps  it were to happen eventually  the old-fashioned way.  Can't we go on a date? See where this leads.  Fine. One date.  At this moment, I would love to grab you in my embrace  and kiss you, but I must ask first,  since Donald Trump has ruined romance for all of us.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Along with a lot of other things.  Yes.  You can kiss me.  (groans)  INSTRUCTOR: Now remember, thoughts are just things to let go of,  so as a thought arises,  let it drift away as if on a cloud.  - Inhale your worries - (inhales)  and exhale, let them go.  (exhales)  Inhale  and exhale.  Inhale  and exhale.  Can you scooch over?  Jane!  Scooch a little.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Inhale and exhale, Jane.  INSTRUCTOR: And slowly transition into downward dog.  And exhale into the pose  So I actually wanted to talk to you.  Now's not a great time.  I can't relax until it's sorted.  INSTRUCTOR: Good. Breathing in and out.  (inhales)  Inhale  Calm exhale your fear.  Did you actually say  you'd be happy if Rafael broke up with me?  Did he say that?  You haven't answered my question.  INSTRUCTOR: Now let's move into Kasyapasana.  Beginners just try a side plank.  I am not one to hold on to things.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: How are you doing that?  So if you said it, I'd rather you just tell me.  Fine. I did.  I can't believe it.  Since you've been here you've constantly lied.  - That is not - It is. And you know it.  You are a liar.  Why don't you step away  - until you can - (inhales and exhales)  calm yourself down.  (inhales)  (knocking on door)  I'm in.  $10,000 and  throw in your watch.  - Afternoon. - Buenos dÃ­as.  Hey.        I haven't turned it in. I-I can make changes.    You did?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. I didn't see that coming.        Abuela.              (crying and laughing)  I'm so happy right now.  (both laughing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (crying): Me, too.  Hey, Darci.  Oh, hi.  Hear you have a big date.  I'm actually really excited.  (Rogelio clears throat)  Thank you all for coming.  I'm sorry to announce we will not be filming  the Tiago finale today.  Thank you and drive safe.  DINA: Rogelio.  What are you doing?  Ending Tiago in outer space  on the International Space Station  in an homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey  is a dumb idea from a dumb film  I admit I do not understand  and should have never agreed to.  Well, you did.  Well, I un-agree.  I  Xo, will you talk to him?  You're the only one who can get through to him  when he's like this.  Of course.  (printer grinding)  I thought you were done.  The deadline, your Abuela liked it.  - I found a few typos. - Oh.  Got it.  So much extra did you have to pay  for the world's loudest printer? (chuckles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here's a fun LSAT logic game:          Is the answer (printer beeping)    Shoot. Another one.    Or C  Seriously?    -  - Sorry. Last time.  Okay. You know what? I'm gonna go to the coffee shop, okay?  Hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like someone's having trouble letting go.  And speaking of letting go  All right, Rafael, drop her like she's hot.  Listen, Rafael, we've been having loads of fun,  but we've come to the end of our road.  - It's time for me to go. - You're leaving?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, that was easy.  Well, uh, if you  really feel you have to go  But I thought maybe we could have  one last adventure together.  No strings attached.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Don't do it, Rafael.  (laughing): I, uh  happened to grab a few pamphlets  from the front desk (exhales)  Things to do around Miami.  Pick one.  Oh, come on.  What do you have to lose?  We'll have great sex, great fun  and a great story to tell someday.  Our last hurrah.  Besides, you could use a proper adventure.  Couldn't you?  Close your eyes.  (both laughing)  (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Man, I can't even watch this.  Hopefully, this is a happier date.  If we find ourselves overcome with desire  and are unable to make it through the entrees,  we can always finish our meal at home.  I, for one, am always ravenous after lovemaking.  Darci Rule Number 12 Never lay it on too thick.  It makes you look desperate.  Rogelio de la Vega is not now,  nor has he ever been, desperate.  Classic narcissism paired with  a third-person reference. I see it all the time  from my A-listers. I didn't think I'd get it from you, though.  Are you trying to say I'm not an A-Lister?  Are you trying to say that you are?  Salad nicoise for the lady.  And seafood quartet for the gentleman.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Man, that's a lot of fish.  Darci Rule Number 23  Never order something you don't look  attractive eating.  Clearly you skipped that lesson.  What's going on?  Why are you being so critical?  Hey, this is me. You want to date me,  you need to know exactly who I am.  Not all at once!  You hide this stuff on your first date.  Then, as someone starts to fall for you,  you slowly reveal all your quirks.  I just want to cut to the chase.  See if it's worth investing in this relationship or not.  Well, you're gonna be this critical, then the answer is no.  We should go our separate ways.  Or, you know, put me back in your dating pool,  since I paid for the three-month platinum plan.  Fine. And we'll just go back to the kid plan.  No.  Kids deserve to be treated  like A-listers, too.  And if you're gonna be this critical with me, well  MICHAEL: No way.  I thought you were just gonna make a few little changes.  I was, but that led to a few bigger changes, and then  the whole thing started unraveling, and now I'm lost.  - What's that? - Essential oils from my new yoga  teacher who thought I needed to chill out.  - She applies it to her temples. - I'll try some of that.  Really need a good night's sleep for my interview tomorrow.  Mmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so just breathe that in and  Wow. The oils really seem to be relaxing Michael.  Jane? Not so much.  She needs to go medical grade, in my opinion.  You know, I don't think you understand  how truly stressed Jane is, so I'm going to let you in.  JANE: Oh, good. Michael's sleeping.  Good for him. I'm glad he can sleep.  I'm so happy about that.  And I'll get used to dealing with my own anxiety myself.    - You seem stressed, babe. - (sighs)  I am. Actually, I was hoping  - that I could talk. - Do you mind  heading out to your stress shed then, because I'm stressed, too,  and your stress really isn't working for me, okay?  JANE: That's ridiculous.  Come on, Jane. Keep it real. Relax.  Relax.  Mateo. Oh, think of Mateo.  Yes, Mr. Sweetface.  Hi, Mr. Sweetface. How was kindergarten?  (in a deep voice): It ruled! I totes dominated at kickball today.  And I'm pretty sure I'll have my ABCs down any day now.  JANE: Mateo's fine. Do not stress about Mateo,  not for three months.  Focus on your novel.  You have to finish your freakin' novel.  -  - I'm just rethinking the opening  -  - of chapter four.  I need those pages before I drop dead, Ms. Villanueva.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like I said, I think she's going  to need something stronger than essential oils.    - Oh, good. - (sighs)  Looks like Jane finally got some sleep.  Ah. (gasps) Oh!  And Michael turned into a puffer fish!  - What's wrong? - Whoa!  He had some allergic reaction, and now he has a law school  - interview this afternoon. - Looks like I just  pulled my head out of a beehive.  All right, let's give him  -  - the full Mickey Rourke.  He's gonna look a little tan and weird and greasy,  but at least he won't look contagious. Go!  Thanks for doing this, Dad. I hope I didn't put anyone out.  No, no. The whole crew has  been here for 24 hours straight.  Nothing's right for the ending of Tiago.  I get it.  I thought I was done with my novel,  and then I just took the entire thing apart.  Ooh, I know.  You can end Tiago in Venezuela circa 1975.  (laughs)  Oh, God, no, that sounds incredibly boring.  (chuckles) I meant  to dramatize,  you know, visually, on-screen.  - Nice save. - Hmm.  Hey, how was your date with Darci?  Terrible. She was super critical.  It was clear that she didn't even want to be there.  What? She was so excited when I saw her  right before.  MICHAEL: So, how do I look?  So much better.  Eat your heart out, Mickey Rourke.  Right, Matelio?  And Rafael's not answering his phone,  so looks like Mateo's coming with us to the interview.  I'll drive, you rest.  It'll be our first family road trip.  Where's-where's Rafael?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's find out.  Just try and relax.  Be in the moment.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What moment? Where are we?  Now, close your eyes.  Open your spirit,  and listen to the ancestors.  (whispering): This really isn't my thing.  - Feel the vibrations around you. - Come on.  - What's the worst that could happen? - Feel the earth  With my luck, one of my ancestors will manifest  - and turn out to be an ax murderer. - (laughing)  Shh. (grunts)  This is a ceremony about rebirth. The warm,  dark hut represents the womb.  And when this ritual is over,  you will be reborn into the world.  (steam hissing) Allow the steam  to cleanse the impurities of your past.  Let the heat melt your burdens  and fears  I feel really hot.  Like  so hot.  (whispering) Well, that's the point.  - It's a sweat - (thuds)  - (sighs) - Are you okay?  I'll be fine.  I don't know what happened.  (laughing)  Look, this whole thing just isn't my scene.  A little too hippy-dippy for me.  Huh.  See, I actually really liked  what the guru was saying about rebirth.  I like to think that's possible, because there's something so  optimistic about it, you know?  If you screw things up, you can make it right.  Yeah, I can see that.  On the other hand  Rafael, are you all right?  Well (laughs)  Sorry. (sniffles)  I must still be overheated or something.  Well, what's going on?  Just the whole, um  all the rebirth thing.  I just found out  my parents aren't really my parents, so, you know?  What?  Which I shouldn't be dumping on you on our last trip away.  No, no, no, of course you should.  You can trust me.  -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Only he couldn't, friends!  Remember.    I know. This is bad.  (door closes)  Really bad.  RADIO ANNOUNCER: Really, really bad  traffic. If you're on I-95 right now, you're not going anywhere.  - (horn honks) - That oil spill  has just shut down traffic in both directions.  (horn honking)  What?!  Nothing.  It's not my fault that they shut down the highway.  I never said it was.  Then would you stop giving me dirty looks?  It's not dirty looks.  This is just my swollen, puffy,  melting Mickey Rourke face, okay?  It actually looks like it's getting better,  like the antihistamines are kicking in.  This is ridiculous. There's no way  we're gonna make the interview, so I'm calling  to cancel.  (touch tones sounding)  (scoffs)  (touch tones sounding) Do you want me  - to dial for you? - No!  JANE: Okay.  - (crying continues) - Oh, great! The voice mail.  - (Mateo screaming) - Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Essential oils, anyone?  (Mateo crying)  It's gonna take at least three hours to clear.  - Are you serious? - According to the Internet.  (sighing): Oh!  MICHAEL: Look, there's a campsite off that exit.  - We should pull off. - Seriously?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me remind you that Jane hates camping  - which Michael knows. - I have my gear in the trunk.  You want to stay the night?  It'll be dark in an hour,  and we're three hours from moving, okay?  (Mateo shrieks)  Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think we know where Mateo stands.  Great. Fine, let's camp.  - Feet to the fire. - I did.  More personal than Brexit.  Oh, it was so embarrassing. I thought  it would never pass, so I didn't vote.  Nope.  Not counting it.  I had so many friends in Parliament.  More personal!  (laughing) Fine. Fine. More personal.  I can't have kids.  How's that?  It's fine. No pity.  Well I can't have any more, either,  so, you know  You do have three.  - True. - So not the same.  - Uh-uh. - Mm.  I didn't even think you liked kids.  Oh, I do. So much.  That's why I've been pulling away from yours.  Don't want to get attached.  I had no idea.  Well, we've been getting drunk on tequila  and having great sex,  so, hasn't been the most serious relationship.  Yeah. You're right.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Don't get sucked in, Raf!  She's playing you! She took Petra's watch for God's sake!  Wait.  I need to tell you something.  (groans)  - I wish we were home! - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To be clear,  Michael definitely got that memo.  I told you, you need to use a rock.  Not that hard. You'll bend the stake.  You are the world's worst back-seat tent-putter-upper.  It takes ten minutes.  Good. Great. You get the medal.  I don't want a medal. I just  I don't even understand what's happening.  What's happening is you are stressing me out.  And I'm not allowed to tell you, but you are.  And if we can't even deal with stress while you're  just trying to get into law school, how the hell  are we gonna actually deal with it when you're in law school?  Well, you don't have to worry about that,  'cause I'm not getting into any law schools,  since I failed every one of my practice tests.  So what happened? Because you liked me.  - What? - Even Jane saw it.  So why did you push me away?  I didn't.  You feel something.  I don't.  And I don't believe you.  Okay, fine. I have an emotional boner or whatever.  But I don't want to get involved.  Why?  Because you're too attached to your ex.  I know how this works.  I'm a matchmaker for cripes' sake.  That kind of baggage does not fit in the overhead.  Oh, come on. Everyone's got baggage.  The way you are reacting to the way I reacted to Xo,  that's coming from your baggage.  Yeah. Obviously someone you were dating  went back to an ex.  Look. Sure, in an ideal world we'd be like Adam and Eve,  the first man and woman on Earth  with totally clean slates, but  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when it hit him.  The genesis of a great idea.  What the hell are you looking at?  I-I-I'm sorry, Darci, I know we're supposed  to be discussing our relationship,  but I need to get down to the stage  and have the writers do another all-night revision.  But I'd really like it if you came to the finale of Tiago,  for the last time.  You'll see that you have inspired it.  Why didn't you tell me about the tests?  Because I know the stuff.  And I do fine when it's not timed,  but then it's timed and I sit there,  and it all just overwhelms me.  I start thinking what if I don't have enough time  to finish the logic questions?  And then I start worrying about the fact  that I wasted all that time time worrying.  And if I don't finish, I'll do badly,  and I won't get in anywhere,  or I'll get in somewhere really crappy.  Won't be able to get another job,  we'll be in all this debt  and we'll end up homeless.  Michael, that's not gonna happen.  At least worry about real things.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like a stress shed?  But I get it.  I go worst-case scenario, too.  Maybe we should think about what could actually happen.  Worst case.  Uh (sighs)  I fail the test.  I run out of severance, can't find another job.  And I turn my book in and completely fail as a writer.  Is that why you haven't turned it in?  I mean, probably, right?  So I fail, we're broke.  I guess we move in with your mom and grandma.  - Oh, man, that would suck. - So much.  We got to get my mom  - to move in with Bruce. - That's good.  Good thinking. We'll get your Abuela  to start dating that guy from the gift shop  she's been crushing on.  - You noticed that, too? - Yes, I have.  So, she'll move in with him.  Wow, just like that, we're unemployed with a house.  And our home brewery is really taking off.  (laughs)  I was wrong to push you away.  And I know we have to figure out how to deal  with stress better as a couple.  We just  have to find a way to relax  that reminds us that even in the worst-case scenario  we still have each other, right?  Tent.  - Did he just say? - Was that?  Tent. Tent.  Oh, my God. Yes, Mateo.  Yes. This is a tent.  Whoa!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Take that, Chauncy.  BOTH: Tent, tent, tent, tent, tent, tent.  (giggles)  (coughing) Sorry to cut our trip short, Raf.  I just don't feel too well.  It came out of nowhere.  (knocking on door)  Anyway, take your shower.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait. I thought he was in the shower.  - What are you doing here? - Where are the cameras?  What? What are you talking about?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, that was a set-up.  - Cat told me what you said. - Rafael, come on.  The only way  - you could have known - Don't get carried away.  - Is if there were cameras. - Rafael  Rafael.  What the hell is this?  - Well you had cameras first. - Petra.  You did, in the teddy bear.  Because I thought it wasn't you.  Exactly! Because I was paralyzed!  Do you understand?  I was paralyzed and I was forced to lie there  and listen to what everybody really thought and-and said.  And things are different now.  I-I can't even tell what's real and what's not.  But with the cameras I can. I can go back. I can  - I can rewind, I can make sure. - Petra.  If you're looking for the will, it's over. I destroyed it.  Why would you destroy the will?  I had to.  For the babies.  It's the only thing I can do.  We just started to bond.  Do you remember when she paralyzed me?  (squealing and laughing)  (gasps)  (crying): They don't know me now.  They cry when I hold them.  But the money, I can help with the money,  with you not losing your money.  Hey, hey.  (sighs) You're gonna be okay, Petra.  You're gonna be okay.  Right now everything  just feels  MICHAEL: Like it's gonna work out.  There's something about the big open sky.  Our problems just seem so insignificant.  Exactly.  That's why I love camping.  So maybe this is what we'll do.  To de-stress.  I don't know if I'd go that far.  (laughs)  - You're relaxed. - (laughs)  Yeah. I really am.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Meet Zen Jane.  I love you.  And if actually, no,  let's let them have this moment.  And we'll stop here, now.  At the dawn of time.              (groaning)  DIRECTOR: And hold.  And action.  (groaning)  (gasps)          (grunts)  DIRECTOR: And cut.  And that's a series wrap on Tiago  a TravÃ©s Del Tiempo.  (applause)  You came.  Let's give it a try.  And I would love to grab and kiss you if that's all right.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw. It looks like the stars  might finally be aligning for these two.    And now let's check in on  - Is she asleep? - RAFAEL: She is.  - Thanks for your help. - Of course.  And I'm sorry again.  I agreed to help her before things changed between us.  I know.  But  I want you to leave.  I just  I have so much on my plate right now.  And someone like you,  who I, I really like  but who isn't 100% trustworthy  it's just not what I need right now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Talk about rebirth.  Okay, then.  And give Petra her watch back, weirdo.  All right. I am off.  And I'm sorry again that things got weird.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And she doesn't even know about the watch.  Well, you know. Good luck  back in New York.  I really did love getting to know you, Jane.  Oh, anyways,  my Uber is here. We'll stay in touch.  Mwah, mwah.  - Au revoir. - Bye.    XIOMARA: Bon voyage.  (door closes)  (sighs)      - Me, too. - Me, too.  -  - Yes. Michael did well  on his practice LSATs.  I'm so glad.  And you sent in your novel.  I know. Change is on the horizon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It sure is.  So I found you a psychologist.  It won't help.  Just promise me you'll go.    As long as you don't bring up the addendum again.  Please.  - I destroyed it. - (sighs)  Oh. One last wedding gift,  Mrs. Archuletta.  Why, thank you, Mr. Archuletta.  What is it?    It's our ticket to freedom, baby.  This piece of paper is all we need.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, poor Scott.  If only he knew the events  he was about to trigger."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, big stuff, friends, so buckle in.  As you know, Jane and Michael had a fairy tale wedding,  but it turned into a nightmare,  but thankfully, Michael survived and thrived.  So, it was a huge shock when  I didn't pass my physical.  I can't go back to the force.  Which meant he needed a new career.  - How about a lawyer? - Exciting, right?  Now all he had to do was pass the LSAT.  And speaking of big career moves,  Rogelio wanted to cross over from telenovelas,  so he shot a revealing part in an indie film.  Yup. Really revealing.  And as for Jane's mom, Xo  well, she was back with her old flame, Bruce.  The only problem? His daughter, Tess.  Barf. Sorry, I shouldn't say that,  but trust me, she's tough.  Also tough, Petra.  Or she was before her sister, Anezka,  paralyzed her and took her place.  And ever since Petra woke up, well  she's been having a hard time connecting with her kids.  Also having a hard time, poor Rafael.  See, he had covered up his late father's crimes,  but then he found out his parents  weren't really his parents,  and he found an addendum to his father's will,  which would make him, well, broke. Then again  If you're looking for the will, it's over. I destroyed it.  Or at least she thought she did.  I know. Straight out of a Telenovela, right?  Which, of course, it is, after all.  Looking back, you could say it felt different right away,  which might be true, or might just be memory.  -  - In any case, when Michael Cordero Jr.  Was seven years old,  he had the worst day of his life.  Honey, I'm sorry, you're sick, so no trick-or-treating.  But I feel totally fine.  Of course, young Michael was an unreliable narrator  You have a fever.  - which I'm not. - Come on.  Smile for me in your costume,  and then we'll get you into your pj's.  MICHAEL: Oh, man.  I remember this moment exactly.  - Well, not exactly. - Oh.  You were seven.  Plus, the act of remembering changes things.  I read this article in The New Yorker.  Show off.  It was about flashbulb memories.  Oh, yeah, I read that one.  (flash pops)  Apparently, memories around big events seem clearer,  but the periphery disappears.  You remember the feeling, not the details.  - No. I remember it exactly. - He doesn't.  'Cause it was so traumatizing.  You can trust me.  Okay, okay, I believe you.  (laughs)  (knock on door)  (cell phone rings)  Hello? Hey, Alice.  I have huge news!  Wait, wait, what?  Uh, yes, of course.  Tell me about the job.  ALICE: Chloe Leland  is in the market for a new assistant.  You know who she is, right? Total wunderkind. And it's  $40,000 a year, plus benefits?  And you know why her current assistant is leaving?  Because he's getting his book published.  By Chloe?  Oh, my God, yes.  Please, give her my rÃ©sumÃ©. Yes.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  This job sounds amazing.  $40,000 a year.  Plus benefits. That would be huge.  Right? Hey, what's wrong, sweet boy?  Well, if you must know, I had some  big news myself, that I was excited to share.  Oh. Sorry about that. What is it?  Never mind, you stole my thunder.  - Dad. - Okay, here it is.  - JANE: Oh, no, Mateo. - (Mateo vomits)  Ugh. Uh.      I hope he's not coming down with a stomach bug.  MICHAEL: Maybe it was the chicken last night.  I woke up feeling a little off. Thought it was pretest jitters.  Well, how do you feel now?  Totally fine.  Rogelio, you were  about to tell us something.  Oh, since you asked, they are screening a-a rough cut  of my film, uh, tomorrow night for friends and family.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. His full-frontal Fassbender moment.  MICHAEL: Oh, I'm sorry.  I have my last LSAT prep class.  I'll have to see it at Sundance.  From your lips to Robert Redford's ears.  But, Jane, you're coming, right?  I, uh  I mean, it's  it's just so soon.  I thought I'd have more time to prepare.  Oh, come on. I told you I'll give you a heads up  before the naked shot  so you can look away.  - Promise? - Yes.  And look, stills for my fan club.  Oh! Dad, put that back.  -  - But I signed my name over my goodies.  Fine.  But you are coming, right?  I thought you were in just the one scene.  Yeah, but I made up the invitations.    - You're not going to that, are you? - RAFAEL: No.  He just invited me because I helped him get the part.  Good because it was your idea to dismiss the nannies  for this whole family bonding thing,  so you can't leave me alone with them.    (baby jabbering)  You know I have to meet my lawyers, about the plea deal.  Ah, yes. You'll recall Rafael cooked some books  to cover his father's art theft.  O-Only an hour, you said.  Only it turns out his dad wasn't really his dad.  And also, my sister's coming,  so I'll need some time with her.  To drop the bomb that she's not really his sister.  You done?  Yes, I-I think so.  Yes.  The rest of the time, I will be here.  MICHAEL: Are you nervous?  No, because I'm not gonna make the same mistake  - that I made last time. - You mean when Cat told you  not to prepare for the interview and just,  (falsetto): ""Fake it till you make it.""  Yeah, and this time I'm gonna prep it till I crush it.  My girl.  (laughs) So, I've been doing  a deep-dive Internet search on Chloe Leland.  Mm-hmm?  She's incredible.  She published her first book when she was 19  by tweeting one sentence at a time.  Yeah, she's basically  pioneered a whole new form.  You're like the Mark Zuckerberg of publishing.  -  - (laughing): Oh, no, stop.  But feel free to tweet that about me.  I like it.  And she published, Around The World  In Eighty Leis: A Hawaiian Girl Abroad,  which was my favorite book last summer.  When I read that proposal, I died.  I had to snap the minute after.  And she commissioned a series of books called  Written To the Nines,  which are all written by kids under ten.  Age ain't nothing but a number.  Says the woman who's accomplished more before 20  than most people do in their lifetime.  Ugh, and yet, still single  as my mother reminds me.  - Oh, no. - Oh, yes.  How'd she become a VP so young?  Well, the woman she replaced found herself  on the wrong side of a James Frey situation.          Someone had to take the fall.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The cost of being  an unreliable narrator,  which as I've said, I'm not.  Then again, I'd say that if I were.  I hated getting my big break  at the expense of another woman's failure,  but this isn't summer camp.  No participation trophies. Anyway  I like you enough for phase two, Jane V.  Sample coverage.    It's a new memoir.  One-page synopsis, two-page analysis.  I'll give you extra points if you can do it  without using the letter ""E"".  Kidding.  (laughs nervously)  XIOMARA: Jane V?  I think it's cute.  Thanks for watching little man.  Hey, I'm your mom.  If you can't leave your sick kid here,  and I can't ask for a really big favor in return,  what do we have?  What's the really big favor?  Lunch with me, Bruce and scary Tess.  Mom, you're an adult.  Teenagers are mean,  and I think that if you were there,  she would be a little more self-conscious  about being a bitch. Please?  Mateo puked on me twice.  Yeah, okay fine. He did?  Yeah, but then he seemed okay.  Oh, shoot, can I have a tampon?  I forgot to go to the store.  - Sorry, I don't have my period. - You don't?  - Mm-mm. - Aw.  We used to always have the same cycle.  You aren't gonna cry because we are not  on our periods at the same time, are you?  No.  Oh, I think I'm due soon.  Hmm.  -  - Oh, my God.  What?    You're right. I'm late.  How late?  Like five days late.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, baby!  Jane V could be due soon, all right.  (stammers) Aren't you on the pill?  Ugh, I skipped when we were camping,  - but that was one day. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn.  These Villanueva women are fertile.  Mom, I can't have another baby right now.  Michael's trying to go back to school; I have to work;  Mateo's so little; we have a timeline.  Slow down, you haven't even taken a test.  I've been late once before. His name is Mateo.  (Mateo crying)  I'll get him.  Do you have a pregnancy test laying around by chance?  I think so.  Also having severe baby anxiety  What the hell are you doing here?!  You're supposed to be in the Czech Republic.  And you, I am done with you. You are fired.  You can't fire me.  Oh, really?  Well, watch me, you little piece of  Oh, beautiful sister with the ugly heart,  you don't have the upper hand anymore.  What the hell is that?  That's the amendment to Emilio Solano's will.  It's my wedding gift for my wife,  Mrs. Anezka Archuletta.  (bells ringing)  You two are m-married?  Yeah, we sure are.  Which means I can stay in this country.  Oh. Knock yourself out.  The real one's in a safe,  and scanned,  and hovering above you  all the time in a cloud.  Checkmate, Petra.    You burn me, I burn you.  The cycle of life.  I can play this game forever.  ANEZKA: But we don't want to  do we, my rooster?  (imitates rooster crowing)  (giggles)  What do you want?  DARCI: Commitment.  I want commitment.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, Rogelio's new girlfriend.  I'm a matchmaker. I know what it is, what it looks like.  Wait, where's Rogelio?  Aren't you gonna say something?  Should I be, like,  real mad right now or not yet?  Cut!  Ah, there he is.  (laughs)  Ryan, we've been over this.  She's trying to sell a reality show, no?  The more drama, the better.  DARCI: It would be so much easier  if you would play the part of my boyfriend.  You know I can't do that.  Not even for the sizzle?    Come on, can't you see it?  You and me, shrink-wrapped on the side of a bus.  The De La Vega-Factor Factor.  ""This matchmaker has finally met her match!""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'd watch it.  Look, I have to limit my exposure  to serious acting roles.  Perhaps I'll embrace reality  on the other side of my career comet,  with a comeback on Dancing with the Stars.    (applause, cheering)  But would you come to my screening with me, Darci?  I would love to walk the red carpet with you on my arm.  There's a red carpet for a friends and family screening?  The metaphorical red carpet.  I wouldn't miss it.  JANE: That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.  Look, it's little Michael!  Almost as cute as you.  But not quite.  Someone's feeling better, aren't you?  We are gonna put all these photos on the wall,  so we can look around and see our family.  Would you like that?  Yeah? Yeah?  Oh, oh!  Oh, yes. That's a good one.  We went to the carnival,  and Michael was so nervous that night  he gave himself a tummy ache.  Like you, Mr. Sweetface.  (gasps)  Someone's in the copying phase.  You want to do everything Mommy does now?  What do you think?  Are you ready for a sibling?  Hmm?  (inhales, exhales)  (door closes)  Guess who just destroyed  two multiple choice practice sections in a row.  Oh, yeah?  - Are you cooking? - (chuckles)  What'd you do with my wife?  It's just pasta.  (laughs) I wanted to do something nice for you.  But instead you cooked?  Are you trying to take advantage of me?  Please let the answer be yes.  Oh, is this the manuscript you have to read? How is it?  Oh, it's good. Yeah, it's all about  this girl's crazy childhood  - in Fort Pierce. - Oh, yeah?  As crazy as the drug bust I worked there last year  with the Coast Guard?  Maybe I should write a memoir.  Okay, I have a practice question for you.  If an 18-month-old child's mother  is five days late for her period  - Uh-huh. - And she and her husband  have a timeline that include  (sighs)  I don't know what comes next in this question.  I'm trying to tell you that we might be pregnant.  What?  I'm late. My mom gave me a test, I-I haven't taken it yet,  I wanted to wait for you.  Really?  You're excited?  You're not?  I-I went straight to stress.  With school, and money.  Okay.  Okay, first, l-let's take the test.  Is this a  -  - a plus, or a lightning bolt?  It's nothing.  My mom's test was expired.  I'll have to buy one tomorrow.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh. Kind of a letdown.  So, you'd be excited?  I mean, it's sooner than we thought,  but our family already started earlier than we planned.  That's true.  What?  I'm just thinking about a little baby Michael.  - Or a little baby Jane. - (laughs)  And only two and a half years younger than Mateo,  which is kind of ideal distance for siblings.  Mm-hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of siblings  So I'm not actually your brother, biologically.  Ah yes, look who's back.    And I understand if this changes things for you.  Raf, stop.  You're my brother.  A blood test doesn't change that.  I love you.  And I will always have your back.  Just like you've always had mine.  Aw, see?  This is the kind of sibling love Jane was talking about.  Thank you.  I think this is the perfect time for you to come.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no.  Who is she talking to?  No one.  -  - I'm telling you, no one is here.  Not even the paps know who I am.  It's humiliating.  And I'm the one who called them with the hot tip  that celebs would be here.  You are a brilliant actor, Rogelio.  Trust me, everyone in America will know your name very soon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And actually, friends,  this would turn out to be true.  WOMAN (on screen): Then I upped his meds, doubled the dose.  (harsh whisper): Now! Now!  ROGELIO'S CHARACTER: I can't do this anymore.  I don't want to feel anymore.  WOMAN: Several patients have had side effects.  We could have class action suit  - on our hands - Wait, what?  Shh.  Where's the rest of the scene?  I mean, they cut my penis.  Oh, my God,  they cut my penis!  Why would you do that?  You can't just cut away  right in the middle of my  Calm down, please. I will not calm down!  They never would have done that to Brad Pitt.  And I never would have taken a role in this indie hack movie  if I'd known they were going to humiliate me  by not showing my penis.  DARCI: Would you stop saying that?  Why should I?  The movie's boring, and slow  and it had one thing going for it:  my provocative penis.  Penis! Penis, penis, penis!  I might as well say it, because no one's ever gonna see it!  I get you're upset.  But you're still in the movie.  In a forgettable part.  - It'll be okay. - No, it won't!  And you wouldn't understand because you just want  to be Bethenny Frankel.  But I want to be taken seriously.  Well.  I didn't get a glimpse of your penis tonight,  but I did see a big dick.  MICHAEL: At least you didn't have to see it.  Yeah, I know.  What's wrong?  I got my period.  Oh.  So. No baby.  Gotcha.  Okay.  Well, maybe it was for the best,  with me in school  Yeah. And my work stuff in the air.  I guess I just started to get excited about the idea.  It's okay.  We have plenty of time.  Okay?  ANEZKA: Give us a smile.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, look.  Petra's babies are warming up  - (crying) - to Anezka.  Oh, dear.  Oh, I just missed them so much.  And they missed their Auntie Anezka. Hmm?  (chuckles)  Thank you for letting me see them.  I didn't have much of a choice, once you blackmailed me.  That is something I'd be wanting to be moving on  - from talking about. - (crying continues)  (whispers): Here.  Come. Let me try.  Please. She's hungry.  (crying stops)  (crying)  Don't worry.  I'm sure they will be warming up to you eventually.  (gasps) No?  Mm  RAFAEL: I just passed Anezka  in the hallway. What the hell is she doing here?  (sighs) She just wants to spend some time with the twins.  Look, she's blackmailing us, what was I supposed to do?  If I probate the will, they won't be able to blackmail us.    No. No, you promised you wouldn't do that.  Raf, please.  Let me give my kids what I never had  Financial stability.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the things we do for our kids.  -  - And our moms.    So, Tess.  What do you like to do for fun?  (phone chimes)  Hey. No, um, phones at the table.  Of course. Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.  Ah, yes. Teenspeak.  Sorry, allow me to translate.  Of course, sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.    Let's just zip through the highlights, shall we?  Pass the salt, please?    And the pepper.    Cute wallpaper.    It's nice you're so loyal to your family.    Yeah, we're really close,  but I don't live at home anymore.  Huh. I guess Jane still has a rudimentary fluency.  Oh, my dad said you lived at home.  I used to, but my husband and I live in Wynwood now.  - I told you, she moved - I don't listen that much to you.  That's actually a really cool area.  Yeah. We love it.  Uh, the apartment's small, but we live, like, three blocks  from the Panther coffee shop on the corner of Sycamore.  Seriously? I go there with my friends all the time.  Their mocha lattes are legit.  Totally legit.  Aw, looks like Tess and Jane are actually bonding a little.    Also bonding?  So sorry I'm late, I had to put the twins down.  Oh, no problem.  No, no, no. I am under strict instructions  not to let you touch anything that might be contagious.  Uh, I have the big test tomorrow, so  Yeah.  So cool, man.  What you're doing.  It's really impressive.  Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.  JANE: Hey.  Found Mr. Monkey. (gasps)  Good-bye, Mr. Sweetface.  I love you. (kissing noises, laughing)  (phone beeps)  You're copying Daddy, aren't you?  He's copying everything these days. Everything.  You want to be just like Daddy, don't you?  (laughing): Yeah!  Okay. Back to the books for me.  Uh, speaking of books, do you think it's weird  that Chloe never responded about my coverage?  Probably just hasn't read it yet.  - Yeah. - (knocking on door)  Oh. They must have forgotten something.  (sighs)  Jane!  I found your house! (laughs)  What are you doing here?  It took me a couple of tries, but whoo-hoo!  P.S., your neighbors are mean.  Are you drunk?  I'm just a little bit completely trashed.  Don't tell my dad. Shh.  I can crash here, right?  Um  She won't let me take her to Bruce's.  - You can't tell my dad. Please! - Okay.  - I'll be nice to you, I swear. - Just sit down.  You can have sex with him all the time.  We'll get you some water.  And maybe some pizza?  I have to call Bruce, right?    Definitely. Just give her a little time to sober up.  Okay, I don't want to mess this up.  -  - This feels like some kind of test.    Ma, she's gone.  What?  She can't get far on foot she's wasted.  My bike is missing.        - How do you know? - (bike bell rings)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A bike bell.    JANE: I've got eyes on her!  Riding northwest on Parker.  Oh, oh I can't keep up!  She's making a right on 26th.  - Copy. - (bike bell rings)  I've got eyes on her. I've got eyes on her!  I lost eyes.  XIOMARA (over phone speaker): She turning down Evans.  Evans!      (horn honks)      Enough, I get it, Barry.  I screwed up. It's everywhere.  TMZ, Perez, Lenny Letter.  It's gone viral.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I did say America would know his name.  Well, you're my agent, can you fix it?  ROGELIO (on iPad): You will never understand me  because you just want to be Bethenny Frankel  and I want to be taken seriously.  BRUCE: This behavior  I'm just so angry.  I'm taking away her cell, she is not leaving the house.  Or maybe go the talk route?  - I'm sorry, it's not my place. - No,  I want to know what you think.  I think she's a good kid who went somewhere safe.  Which is kind of responsible.  I mean, much more responsible than I was.  And this stuff is gonna happen.  So you want to be someone she can talk to,  not run away from.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that Tess was awake,  which Xo knew.    I left my pictures here.  Oh, okay.  Dad, are you all right?  Did you see the Internet?  -  - ROGELIO (on computer): Penis!  Penis! Penis! Penis!  No, we haven't. What's going on?  It was awful, the way I yelled  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: ""Penis"" a hundred times?  At Darci.  I just blew up at her  and said hurtful things.  And-and I'm calling to apologize,  but she won't answer, and I don't blame her.  What you need, my friend,  is a big gesture to win her back.  When I was winning over Jane,  I karaoked, I whittled her a giraffe.  Oh, remember when you helped me build that awesome  honeymoon suite in the hospital bed?  Yeah, that all feels small and low-impact.  Okay.  Well, I'm sure you'll think of something  that's just the right size.  Now what I'm going to do  with these 250  8x10 glossies?  Where are my pictures?  Oh, my God!  This is my manuscript and my coverage to Chloe.  I thought you already dropped that off.  I did.  (gasps) Oh, no.  Alice! Hi, I-it's Jane Villanueva.  Jane, what happened?  Why'd you flake on the coverage?  That's why I'm calling I didn't.  I actually dropped off the wrong envelope,  which may have contained some other pictures.  Oh, my God, the weird naked guy?  I can bring the coverage over in, like, 20 minutes.  Sorry, Chloe's not big into second chances.  She's interviewing other candidates.  PETRA: What's wrong?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like isn't the only one  getting bad news.  Rafael, what happened?  That was my lawyer.  The plea deal is off the table.  Apparently there's a lot of scrutiny  Rich guys being treated differently.  And my family is high-profile,  so the mayor wants to show he's tough on white-collar crime.  Okay, so you fight back.  If I do that, everyone in my life will be subpoenaed,  interrogated and dragged through the mud.  - What's the alternative? - I don't know.  I could plead guilty.  And what? You pay a fine?  No.  I'd go to jail.  With good behavior, I could be out in  I don't know, nine months?  Wait, stop, no.  Rafael, you're not going to jail.  Okay? You're gonna get a great lawyer.  I mean, I-I was framed for murder, and we figured it out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: There's a sentence you don't hear every day.  But I did it.  - I lied. - No.  I reject your defeat.  Look, no, what you need to do now is you need  to go upstairs, collect all your files,  calendars, uh, relevant e-mails.  Anything that can help and-and we'll come up with something.  Petra, Petra  No, I need you!  Rafael, there are two little girls who need you.  They need role models!  Mateo is copying everything that I'm doing.  Everything.  And I have to look at that.  What am I teaching my kids?  - They don't know. - They will.  At some point, they will.  Just like I knew everything that my dad  or Emilio  was doing, and I just,  I want to be someone that they are proud of.  I can't do it alone.  You'll have help.  I can't!  (baby crying)  PETRA: Great, now I've upset her.  RAFAEL: Turn on the mobile.  She likes it.  (melody playing)  (baby quiets)  (carnival music playing)  JANE: You feeling okay?  MICHAEL: Yeah, yeah, it just  it feels weird to be out, not studying.  The night before a big test,  you know everything you're gonna know.  And you need to relax, hmm?  And this place is good for your nerves, right?  It definitely was.  You know, that night is the last time  I had seen you this nervous.    So, um, do you like roller coasters?  Yep, still do.  You asked me that in the car.  Wristbands or tickets?  Uh I wonder  - Let's go over there first. - Okay.  I dragged you here first.  Oh, I remember.  Here, grab the handle.  We can see how compatible we are.  (machine chiming)  Ah! We made the heart glow.  Wow. Cool.  We should do the wristbands then,  so we can ride as many times as we want.  Okay.  Go.  And it's not working.  Who cares? We don't need some creepy old machine  to tell us that we're in love.  Hey, do you have any more singles?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the photo booth.  A time-honored make-out zone.  Smile.  Wait, I think it's over now.  I know, but I'm not done.  (laughing)  They're  cute.  They're porn!  Who needs a busted love tester  when you have visual proof?  I give you exhibit A.  Yes, preach, lawyer.  Feeling better about your test?  I was until you reminded me about it.  So let's go.  You remember.  Everything, exactly.  Okay, what's going on with you?  I'm nervous.  You've got nothing to be nervous about.  You crushed those practice tests.  You've got this.  I do feel prepared.  I just want to do well.  For us.  I I want  What?  Well, these last last, these last few weeks  - have been great. - I agree.  And I just want you to know that I'm not  dating anyone else.  And I know you're still seeing Sam  - Michael. - No, it-it's fine, it's totally fine.  I just want you to know that, for me,  that's not, uh that's not where I'm at.  And I just want to be with you,  and I just want you to be aware.  Are you done?  I haven't seen Sam since you kissed me two weeks ago.  Ah, thank God!  I only want to be with you, too.  It'd be fun to take Mateo here.  Yeah.  And it was fun thinking about baby number two.  Yeah, it was.  I was actually thinking  maybe we should move up our time line.  To what?  I don't know.  I just want to be open to things changing.  I just want to stay up here with you.  I don't want to go back down.  Me, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Me three.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right. What comes up must come down.  Oh! Over there is where part of that amazing memoir took place.  When the author was 14 years old,  she would swim from island to island  to escape her crazy home life.  Well, not island to island, but-but, hmm.  No, she did.  No, that's impossible. There are jetties  just under the water that you can't see.  I remember, during our drug bust,  our boats had to go around.  What?  I guess the author just embellished a little,  for artistic effect.  No, you can't embellish a non-fiction memoir.  It has to be true.  Well, it's not.  (chuckles softly)  Then the girl's  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: An unreliable narrator.  A fraud!  And you're a genius.  Ha!  (baby crying over monitor)  Rafael.  Hmm?  (crying intensifies)  Elsa, come on, I'm your mommy!  Come on  (crying)  MICHAEL: It's nerves.  Fine, but if you're not  -  - feeling better after the test,  I'm taking you to the doctor, end of story.  Got it. (exhales)  No way.  Where did you find this?  EBay.  Inside is crackers, an apple, antacid.  - Thank you. - Mm-hmm.  And good luck with Chloe.  Thank you for helping me do the research last night.  And thank you for what happened after.  (laughs)  I love you.  I love you, too. Mwah.  You got this.  Okay.  Michael!  I am so proud of you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, it should be noted  that Jane would play this moment over and over,  until it became a memory.  - Yeah. - Okay.  And therefore, unreliable.  It's filled with gross exaggerations and flat-out lies,  and I know you don't want to hire me, and that's fine,  but you can't publish this book.  Bravo. You passed the test.  I'm here to take the test.  Sign in here, put your cell phone in the bin.  CHLOE: People cheat. Lie.  So I have to be vigilant.  Make sure the people I hire are vigilant.  I'd written you off, but you're the only applicant  that figured it out.  So the job's yours if you want it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Do you really want to work for someone  who tests you like that?  Of course I want the job!  Then again, Jane does love tests.  Michael, on the other hand    (chuckles softly)  Oh, sorry! Sorry.  I just got a new job and it feels like a dream!  Mm!  Want to try?  You want to try?  (Rafael exhales)  I let you sleep. (chuckles)  You had so much on your mind.  Oh, Mateo's still sleeping, too.  Thank you.  Are the nannies here?  No. I did it.  I-I got them back to sleep last night,  and then up this morning, and I changed  their disgusting diapers,  and I dressed them and you're right.  I can do it.  So  whatever you want to do,  you do.  I want a clean slate.  I don't want this hanging over my head anymore.  So, jail?  It's only nine months.  And then I get to start over.  Well, I can handle things here.  (doorbell rings)  Which would prove to be true,  for the record.  But we're not there yet.  Raf.  Good morning.  I I just wanted you to meet Eileen.  We've been dating for the last three months, so I thought  you two should meet each other.  Uh-oh. Eileen. Who's Eileen?  I have heard so many wonderful things about you, Rafael.  What's going on, can't can't we come in?  Right. Uh, no.  EILEEN: Oh, I'm sensing  some negative energy.  - I'm an empath. - Oh.  - A guru. - Oh, honey.  You know I don't like that word.  I'm more of a guide.  Eileen, it is really nice to meet you,  but here's the thing.  If you want to be in my sister's life, or mine,  we need to do some medical tests.  Are you freaking kidding me? Your last girlfriend  - was a criminal with a fake face. - Oh, my God.  Oh, my God, oh, my  Hon, hon, it's okay. We have nothing to hide.  What kind of tests?  Blood test,  uh, X-Ray, DNA, MRI  and whatever else the doctor recommends to rule out  any plastic surgery.  You got it, friend.  Thanks.  Look, it-it's just that, um  her ex killed my dad.  I know. But that's only if you believe that death is finite.  Yeah.  I do, so  Well, that went well.  Yeah.  (raspberry)  You do realize,  when you pass this medical exam,  you leave the country. For good.  Yep. For ten million bucks, I can do that.  You'd better.    Or I will have you killed,  make no mistake.  (laughs) Excuse me.  Let me talk to you for a second.  - What? - What are you doing?  I can't even make threats anymore?  We talked about this.  It's just words.  She has to be scared. Relax.  Okay, ladies. I'm gonna go hit the shower.  I got some medical exams to pass.  Oh, baby. We are so close.  We're gonna get back to normal. Go to family functions.  We can take walks along the beach, it's gonna be  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But again,  we're not there yet.  Where the hell are we?  Here. You can open your eyes now.  (sighs)  DARCI: You're doing it?  Brad Pitt started out dressed as a chicken  handing out coupons on Hollywood Boulevard.  Who says I can't make a pit stop in reality TV  on my way to super stardom?  So we're gonna have to do this for the cameras again.  Okay?  I can't wait  To actually stop waitressing.  Move on to the next phase, you know?  Publishing.  And then hopefully, published.  (chuckles)    Speaking of the next phases,  Tess and I had, kind of, like a breakthrough this morning.  - Oh! - Ah.  And Bruce and I were talking and  well, we might move in at some point.  Really?  I mean, not, like, right away,  but in, like, in six months?  That's what we'd be looking to do.  And then there was one.  I know, it's a lot to think about, Ma.  T-That's why I'm mentioning it now,  while it's still far away.    JANE: They lived happily ever after.  The end.  What do you think?  Is Michael almost done with his test, Mateo? Hmm?  (growling, laughs)  (gasping)  (students murmuring)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends,  I did say Michael would love Jane  until his dying breath.  FEMALE STUDENT: He's not breathing!  MALE STUDENT: Call 911.  MAN: Your husband's death was ultimately the result  of his gunshot wound.  His blood pressure spiked  aortic dissection  We're so sorry.  (crying, screaming)  Jane, Jane, Jane. Hey.  Hey, hey, hey. Hey.  What happened? Shh  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which unfortunately,  brings us to the end of Part Two.    (exhales)  Mateo, hurry up!  I'm ready, Mom.    Shoes.  Come on, sweetie. We don't want to be late for the wedding.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So yeah.  We've got a lot to catch up on."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As Rogelio once said,  and also Charles Dickens,  ""It was the best of times,  it was the worst of times.""  So, let's start with the good, shall we?  Jane got a dream job,  working for a high-powered publisher  and her mom had recently reunited  with her old flame, Bruce,  and she was feeling it.  Oh, and Jane's father?  Well, he had fallen for his matchmaker, Darci,  and agreed to star in her reality show  during his break from telenovelas.  Oh, and speaking of telenovelas,  remember Petra and her twin sister, Anezka?  Well, Petra wanted Anezka out of the country.  Only Anezka married Scott.  And on the topic of family drama,  Rafael recently found out his parents  - weren't really his parents. - Wow.  But before he knew that, he'd covered up  his late father's art theft.  So, he came clean to the police.  And they cut him a deal, which included jail time.  And at first, Petra was all  No! I reject your defeat.  But, ultimately, she changed her mind.  Whatever you want to do, you do.  I want a clean slate.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And now, for the worst of times.  You'll recall, Jane married Michael.  But then, this happened.  And he seemed to recover.  Until  (gasps)                      (crying): How did you do it, Abuela?      (Mateo laughs)  (exhales deeply)        - No - Mm-hmm.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, little by little,  they did.      (sighs)  Mateo, hurry up.  I'm ready, Mom.  Shoes. Come on, sweetie,  we don't want to be late for the wedding.    (magical chimes) You got this.  Hmm.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But don't feel bad for her.  She's got this.  Her words, not mine.    MATEO: No clothes!  - (Mateo laughing) -   MATEO: No!  (Alba groans) (Mateo laughs)    Abuela, no more yelling, remember?  We have a new system.          (Mateo laughing)  Mateo, put your clothes back on right now.  No, I want to build a fort.  - (claps) - That's one clap of thunder, Mateo.  Now put your clothes back on right now.  Fort, fort, fort.  That's two claps of thunder, Mateo.  MATEO: No!  No more thunder!  Then put your clothes back on so that we can go.  No. No. No! Fort jump!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no. Don't tell me  Mr. Sweetface's face  is now the only sweet thing about him.  That's three claps of thunder, Mateo.  No, you're a bad head!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Bad head? That's the best you can do?  Okay, that's it. It's a rainy day.  No, I don't want it!  (thunder claps)  (yelling)  (yelling continues)  (sighs)    MATEO: Fort, fort, fort!    Mm-hmm.  Mateo, get off the couch right now.  No, I hate you!  You're the worstest mommy in the whole world!  (Mateo yelling)  Well, that's too bad. You're stuck with me.  We can't wait much longer to start the ceremony.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep, that's right.  Rogelio's the one getting married.      Just one more minute, Jane will be here.  I'll stall as long as I can, but she's going full bridezilla.  I know what you're thinking.  Who's the lucky bridezilla?    Huh?  Ugh!  Mateo, give me my phone.  We need to leave.  - Come - (grunts)  (grunting)  (""Here Comes the Bride"" begins playing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep. That's right.  He's marrying Darci.  Ugh! This is a very rainy day, do you hear me, Mateo?  A very rainy day.  And when I look at you, it's like I won the lottery,  and the payouts will last a lifetime.  Oh, no! Jane is missing Rogelio's freaking wedding!  But I also got it in one lump sum.  The lump sum of your love.  (whispering): Oh, God.  No, no, no.  Ooh, cut!  (sighs)  Jane's here!  (bell ringing)  JANE: I'm so sorry, Dad, Darci.  That's fine. That was just for the master.  We still have a bunch of other angles to shoot.  Okay. (sighs)  Is that kid gonna keep it together?  No! You do not talk about Matelio,  you diabolical shrew.  -  - I thank God every day that  I never had a baby with you.  And I thank God  I never tarnished my DNA  by co-mingling it with yours.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So yeah.  That true love shtick?  Strictly for the cameras.  Sorry, we're just tweaking  the lighting, folks.  Enjoy a little promo reel.  (music playing)  CHEESY REALITY SHOW NARRATOR: He came in looking for a match.  But it turned out, the match was her.  TV NARRATOR: Nothing could tear them apart.  Aah!  (chuckles)  Not even fertility problems.  You're my baby.  Or even scarier, his evil ex.  (shrieks) This is (bleep) ridiculous!  You've got to be (bleep) kidding me with this (bleep)!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us to    Yep. The evil ex.  (grunts)  Why do they keep showing that stupid clip?  It's completely out of context.  I had just spilled hot coffee on myself.    I know, hon. Just be glad the show is finally ending.  (moans) Thank God.  It'll be nice to go outside again without getting harassed.  How dare you mess with Dargelio!  - (grunts) - (screams)  On the plus side, you have gotten a lot  of free publicity for the new dance studio.  (scoffs) Free publicity is not worth being named  one of BuzzFeed's Ten Most Notorious Reality Show Villains.    Oh, and Rogelio RSVP'd yes,  so we're skipping the Marbella's grand re-opening.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep. You heard that right.  Wait'll you see the brand new Marbella!  That'll put a smile on your face.  Why is no one smiling?  This is supposed to be the second happiest place on Earth.  Families are coming here for luxurious fun.  I don't care if a customer is stabbing you with a fork.  You keep smiling.  Perfect.  Now get back to work.  (sighs) Come on, girls.  You're gonna demo the new pirate treasure hunt.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.  Those are some well-behaved little girls.  I didn't even realize they were there.  Oh, no.  The little man is gonna behave.  We have a new system. Don't worry.  Please, Mommy, let him come.  Ahoy, mateys! To the beach we go.  Ow!  Mateo!  It's all right. I know Mateo's just playing.  Take Pammy the Parrot with you.  Aye, Captain. Now, the most important part  of our treasure hunt is to avoid our dastardly villain.  Chuck.  Ah, yes,  Chuck Chesser.        What are you doing here?  Just wanted a word  about your Critter Cage.  I already told you, we're not moving the Kids' Club.  Not sure you got a choice, darlin'.  Petra.  Look, I'm just here to give you  a friendly neighborhood heads-up.  Heard you got a problem with your final inspection.  (scoffs) What?  (chuckles)  No, that can't be right.  INSPECTOR: He's right.  You have a problem.  The structure  is five feet over the property line,  which means you can't get your certificate of occupancy  for your Kids' Clubhouse.  Uh, the grand opening is in five days,  so that's not an option.  Either tear it down  or get an easement from your neighbor.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll remind you, friends,  that neighbor is the scallywag Chuck.  - (chuckles) - Just breathe.  Freaking out isn't gonna help.  Look who's staying all calm in the face of a crisis.  What's that about?  I don't need Zen Rafael right now, okay?  (scoffs) Who the hell goes to prison and comes out softer?  It was prison. He got mellow in prison!  And I knew that. I was just messing with you.  I'm not trying to be Zen, just reasonable.  I don't need reasonable!  I need to come up with a plan!  ""I,"" not ""we""?  I'm letting her take the lead.  The hotel's succeeding because of her rebranding idea.  How do you know it's succeeding? It hasn't even opened yet.  We started taking reservations last week,  and we are booked solid, six months out.  Oh, wow.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, that is impressive.  Anyways, Petra's gonna deal  with the whole easement thing, so  I'm not gonna stress about it.  Okay, Zen Rafael.  I buy one pair of linen pants  And grow the world's worst beard.  Why does everyone hate the beard?  Except Mateo.  (sighs)  Hey, if I'm nervous  about his parent-teacher conference tomorrow,  then you must be at a nine.  Closer to a ten thousand.  Just try to breathe.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Don't wear linen pants  a-and say good night to Abbey.  Will do.  Jane says good night.  Hmm.        Is Jane okay?  Yeah. Just nervous.  Hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. The big preschool evaluation.  I am so pleased to tell you how much sharing,  cooperation, and, well, all around good behavior  we've been seeing lately.  Not to mention kindness.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Looks like they had nothing to worry about.  You have every reason to be so proud  of Ellie and Anna.  Oh, thank you again. So much, Mrs. Taub.  Oh, no.  Thank you, truly.  They are such a joy.  Oh.  (sighs)  Good luck.  Mateo definitely has a very sweet side.  But he also has some impulse control issues,  which, I know, we discussed  when we admitted him a few months ago.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Right. Jane and Rafael decided  he needed more structure after the terrible twos  stretched to the friggin' fours.  We know that adjusting to a new school can be difficult.  And we empathize.  Thank you so much.  But his behavior's disrupting class,  so we would like you to get him an aide.  Excuse me?  A shadow. To follow him around  and help him, and us, when he acts up.  I know, it's hard to hear,  but we have enlisted the help of aides for other children  with behavioral issues, and we've had great results.  It just feels so drastic.  Do you really think that's necessary?  If he wants to stay at the school, then yes.  (thunder rumbles)  Good. This is good.  She gave us two weeks to whip him into shape.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Translation: Jane begged.  - We can do it. - Hmm.  An aide is just too extreme.  And, of course, it goes without saying  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But here she is saying it.  - Please, don't tell - Hello, hello.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep. That's right.  Petra is the queen of The Marbella  and queen of the preschool.    How was the conference?  - Great. - It went well.  Oh. Whew. Good.  I have to say I feel a little bit responsible,  since I pulled all those strings to get Mateo in.  Which, again, we really appreciate.  - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy. - (laughing): Hey.  Mateo, the girls were just about to have a snack.  Would you like some mini carrots, too?  Mateo, say thank you.  - Carrots yuk. - (gasps)  Mateo. We don't throw.  Hey. You stop that right now. That is unacceptable behavior.  Petra. We talked about this. Please don't discipline my son.  Well, someone has to.  (clears throat)  Okay. I should go.  - Okay. Uh, we'll see you later. - Hmm?  We're taking the twins to ice cream  'cause they tied for ""Best Helper"" in class.  Two weeks in a row.  Great. So happy for them.  Good job, girls.  Thank you, Auntie Jane.  We'll share with Mateo.  Awesome.  Okay. I have to go to work.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Work.    Remember Jane's dream job' with the dream boss?  Well, over the past few years, that dream boss became  The Alvarado manuscript?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: a nightmare.  Yep. Here you go.  With the edits.  The first round of edits, not the second.  Fine. So one of the writers dropped out  of Miami's Ones to Read.  Really?  Uh, so-so there's an open slot?  Yes. Let me know which ones I should bother to read  and which would make me gouge my eyes out.  So I'm gonna submit my novel.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall we left Jane  working on a novel about her Abuela.    Miami One to Read.  Don't get too excited.  Who knows if she'll pick it.      - Agreed. - (door opens)  Hi, all.  Hey, what are you doing here?  They invited me.  What are you doing here?      Beyond the fact that we love you both,  do you know what a giant pain  in the ass it is to have you two not speaking?  Scheduling separate dinners every week.      Well, re-shoots.      Nope. No way. Not happening.  (scoffs)  - That's one. - What was that?  Oh, come on.  If you two are gonna act like children,  then we're gonna treat you like children.  Go. Make up.  That's two.  As I have told you 1,000 times before,  I am very, very sorry about the way you were portrayed  on the De Le Vega-Factor Factor,  but I didn't know.  And I had no say in it.  You're a producer.  Everybody that works in television  is a producer.  (bowling pins falling)  You knew they were gonna portray me like that.  - I didn't. - You did.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is nose-diving fast.  So I don't know what else to say to convince you.  But the bottom line is that the show is over.    So please, can we just put it behind us?  I've missed you.  Yes.  Okay, let's try.  ""And Olivia gives her a kiss back and says,  'I love you anyway, too.'""  Mommy?  Yes, Mr. Sweetface.  I'm sorry I'm a bad boy.  Mateo, you are not a bad boy.  Don't ever say that.  You are a good boy  who does things he shouldn't do sometimes.  But everyone does things they shouldn't do sometimes.  Like Olivia in the story  when she painted on the walls?  Yeah.  She should have asked her mommy  and used her words.  I try to remember to use my words,  but sometimes I just forget.  I know.  I love you, Mommy.  I love you, too, Mateo.  - Oh. - You're the best  mommy in the world.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah. If only everyone  could see this side of him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, Jane is researching.  Some things never change.  Okay. Time's up.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But some things do.  Okay.  My plan is to track Mateo's meltdowns  for a week to see if there any triggers  to get to the root of the problem.  Okay. My plan is martial arts.  Did you get that plan from Petra?  No. It's from me.  I like what Ellie and Anna get from it.  And research says that it teaches discipline  and that it's really great for overactive kids like Mateo.  Okay. So we have a two-pronged plan.  Track his meltdowns and martial arts.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Admire his commitment  to late modern Florida bro-chic with classic douche accents.  I need your signature on this easement.  Ooh. No can do.  You know how I feel about that kids club.  Screeching rodents are gonna kill the sensual vibe  of my adults-only pool.  Move that little brat bin to the other side of your property.  That's ridiculous; you know the tides there  are way too dangerous for kids.  On the other hand, overpopulation  is a major concern.    Look. I'm a reasonable person, so how about this?  We split the cost of moving your pool.  (laughs) Shut down my pool during peak season?  You couldn't pay me enough.  Well, I'm not moving my clubhouse.  Great. Then I'm gonna tear it down.  Oh, we'll see about that.  That conclude our business here?  'Cause I got ten minutes to kill before my next meeting.  Fine, but this is the last time.  And wipe those greasy hands first.  (clothes rustling, zipper unzips)  - (Chuck grunts) - (Petra moans)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah. So let's give them some privacy.  (bell dings)  SENSEI: Okay, class, stand up.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Martial arts.  Fingers crossed it helps.  (Sensei instructing in Japanese)  SENSEI: All right.  Now close your eyes.  Mateo.  Pay attention, Mateo.  Stand still.  I can't. I have the wiggles.  Of course you can.  You're only as weak as you think you are.  You're only as strong as you choose to be.  Now,  stand perfectly still.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You can do this, Mateo.  As still as a tree in the forest.  - Sir, yes, sir. - Sir, yes, sir.  SENSEI: All right, everyone.  Let's begin.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Look at that.  (Sensei instructs in Japanese)  Punch, kick.  PETRA: I'm ready for a fight.  And I am more than willing to play dirty.  Tell me more.  I did a little research.  Turns out those lobsters you love so much?  The ones that have been on your hotel's secret menu  for the past month?  Mmm. Granny-slapping good.  Whatever that means.  They're also illegal.  It's off-season for the spiny lobster in Florida.  And each poaching violation can get you up to six months  in jail, plus your fishing boat can get impounded.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh. Petra's lobster claws are coming out.  - Really? - And if you don't sign this easement,  I will turn you in.  So, as our wildlife commissioner says    (laughs): Wow. Now you're gonna quote Uncle Bobby?  What?  Florida wildlife commissioner's my Uncle Bobby.  And I'll clear up any violations when I see him at poker night.  Thanks, though.  Okay. Good.  Okay, this is good. She just tweeted  that her green tea latte is #LiquidZen.  And Lena Dunham  just faved it. Go. Go.  Okay. I'm going.  Don't be scared, but don't be too confident.  Remember, Jane, you're as strong  as you choose to be.  (knocks lightly)  What?  Well  I've never asked you for anything,  uh, but, well  sometimes in life,  certain opportunities come up and you have  to go after those things, and I think this might be  - one of those times. - Just give me the logline.  Will you read my work and consider me  for the seventh showcase slot?  Sure.  Anything else?  No.  Thank you.  Strong move, Jane!  Hi-yah!  The strength of your love nourishes my body  and my soul, Rogelio.  DIRECTOR: And cut!  Why won't you even consider it?  Because I want the show over.  And we get how you feel, Rogelio, we really do,  but, uh, the ratings keep rising.  Then get another gorgeous fool to play her husband.  Because there's no way in a million, gazillion,  trillion years  Trillion is less than a gazillion.  - What? - If you're building,  - it's million, trillion - You see, this is why  - gazillion! - This is why I don't want to do it!  Everybody just calm down, okay?  Rogelio, just answer me one question, okay?  Hmm?  Would this change your mind?  Ah, yes The American version  of The Passions of Santos.  You'll recall this was a passion project of Rogelio's.  You have six months to get famous enough  to star in the American version,  or you have to go beg Rob Lowe to come back.    The network is prepared to green-light  The Passion of Steve if  you just give us one more year  of The De La Vega-Factor Factor.  Let's do it.  This country needs a Latino president,  and you're just the man to play one on TV.  And if she likes my book, I mean  I don't even want to think about it.  She's gonna love it.  Trust me. I've read it.  You okay?  Yeah. Yeah, it's just  I don't get how everyone made such a big mistake  with the construction plans.  I mean, no one noticed they were going five feet over?  It doesn't make sense.  What?  You're engaging a little.  Oh, don't make it a thing.  - Oh, it's definitely a thing. - MATEO: Mommy!  - Daddy! - BOTH: Aw  What's wrong, sweetie?  Jackson's having  his birthday party,  and everyone's invited but me.  Aw. Honey, I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.  Hey. So, this is awkward, uh,  but Mateo didn't get an invite to Jackson's party.  And I'm sure it's just 'cause he's new, so  No, it's because he hit Jackson last week.  And we wrote an apology card.  And he's in martial arts, so that's helping.  I'm sorry, we can't have that sort of behavior  at Jackson's party.  Look, I'm sure this school  has a policy about inviting all the kids.  - We actually don't. - Well, that's crazy.  Take it up with the PTA.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, of course,  the president of said PTA is  Petra.  Yeah, Astrid told me about the birthday.  And look, Jane does not want my pity.  Or help.  She's made that very clear over the years.  You're wrong, and you're getting Mateo invited.  But that is not why I'm here.  I went back to the original plans  and look right there.  That 8 used to be a 3.  Someone tampered with it so we'd build the kids' club  over the property line and have to take it down.  Who would do that?  And how would they gain access to the blueprints?  Uh, there are some greasy fingerprints  along the edges.  PETRA (moaning): Oh, Chuck  (moaning, gasping)  RAFAEL: Wait.  You and Chuck?  Stop. It's embarrassing enough, okay?  It's just with all the stress  of remodeling and opening the Marbella  hate sex with him was my only escape.  Well, that's not as bad  as when I thought you were sleeping with Scott.  (groans) Don't remind me.  Hey, whatever happened to that guy anyway?  Good point.  I haven't seen him since  I am done with you! You are fired!  You can't fire me.  What the hell is that?  That's the amendment  to Emilio Solano's will.  You burn me,  I burn you.  Who knows?  After he and Anezka split, he moved away.  Look, this is my mistake.  I'll fix it.  And speaking of fixing things  Well, it's a good thing that Jackson's mom  found your invitation. And her manners.  But listen to me, it is very important  that you are on your tippy-top best behavior.  - Sir, yes, sir! - Oh!  - (phone chimes) - Mwah! Mwah!  Ugh. Work.    Oh, my God.  Was your boss mean again?  No. Mateo, she was really nice.  She she just picked Mommy's book for a special reading!  - Yay, Mommy! - Yay, Mommy!  Yay, Mateo!  (gasps) It's party time.  BOTH (chanting): It's party time! It's party time!  It's party time!  Which brings us here. Now.  Uh, gentle, okay?  Good boy.  (phone chimes)        Ha-ha-ha!  - Hey, I got him, I got him. - Uh, keep him away  from the sugar He can't handle it.  You know, I really wish you'd keep your opinions to yourself.  N-Nothing ever stops you from giving yours.  Well, I don't make critical remarks about your kids.  JACKSON'S MOM: All right, everyone gather around for cake!  Yes, that's because my kids behave.  My son's behavior is none of your business.  Of course it's my business I'm the reason you're here.  What?  - Cake! - Rafael.  Did you ask Petra for help?  Yes, I did.  Because he's my son, and I wanted him here.  - You should have told me. - You would have said no.  Exactly! Because we don't need pity.  Hi-yah!  - (gasps) - (kids laughing)  Yeah.  See, I beg to differ.  Hon, put it out of your head.  You apologized.  Now, come on. This is your night.    Ah, yes. Welcome to the glittering  Miami literary scene.  Be right back.  Professor Donaldson.  Hi. Thanks for coming.  Well, I was in the area.  Yeah, right. You're my mentor, okay?  So stop acting like you're not.  Well you know I love this book.  So  (sighs) Thanks for pushing me to write it.  Big night.  (exhales)  Xo? What is it?  Your fake wife tweeted about the third season.  (sighs)  Well, it's not true. She's trying to pressure me.  What?  The network offered  to green-light The Passions of Steve  in exchange for another season.  But I turned them down.  It's not worth it.  I won't put you through another year of that.  Can everyone please find a seat?  All right, I'm here. How can I help you, darlin'?  By telling the truth.  - (chuckles): What? - I know you did this.  Did what?  Altered the blueprints.  And I won't hesitate to call the cops  unless you sign this easement.  Petra, I did not do that.  I know you did. And I staked everything  on this renovation. Everything.  Not just my reputation. It's my vision.  It's my gift to my daughters. It's mine.  It's the first thing, actually,  that's truly mine I didn't marry it,  I didn't steal it, I made it  And now you're trying to take it all away.  (quietly): I knew it.  Now, get out of here.  Almost done. You're up in five, Jane.  So this might be the moment to tell you that  though we left Jane working on a novel about her Abuela,  that is not the novel Jane finished.  That's right.  The book she finished was about her love story with Michael.  With an important change.  In the book, they got their ""happily ever after.""  It was a romance novel, after all.    (phone chimes)          RAFAEL: Yes, you can.  No, I can't.  I don't know  what I was thinking.  I-I can't stand there and read a book about Michael  in front of a bunch  of strangers. (crying laugh)  I thought I could.  Or maybe that I should.  But I can't.  Rafael, I can't do it. (sniffles)  It just feels like  like  You're giving a piece of him away?  - Yeah. I totally get that. - (faint applause)  And we can talk about it later.  Now, stop crying, and get out there.  What?  I'm serious. This is too important.  So wipe up those tears.  Wipe them up right now!  Later you can cry all you want,  but right now you need to pull yourself together.  Get out there and read your damn book.  What happened to Zen Rafael?  And if you don't,  I'm taking back two Sundays.  (exhales)  (whispers): You wouldn't.  Try me.  WOMAN: You ready?  (exhales)  (shuddering inhale)  (exhales)  âChapter One.  âKnowing what would happen,  âthe heartbreak, the tears,  âthe love, the hope, the betrayal,  âthe heartbreak  âyes,  âit was always the heartbreak.  âWould she do it over?  âAnd she knew,  âthe answer was yes  because of how it all ended.â  (sniffles)  (shuddering breaths)  (exhales)  âBut I'm getting ahead of myself â  (applause)  - (howls) - Bravo!  (Rafael howls)    We, Mom.  We.  We're family, Rogelio.  And no matter what's happened between us,  we've been through too much to get hung up on this stupid fight  any longer than we already have.  I couldn't agree more.  And what you did  turning it down, well, I appreciate it.  But you helped me achieve my dream of opening a dance studio.  I can put up with people trolling me on Twitter  another few months  if it means you get Passions of Steve on the air.  Are you sure?  Because they're also really mean to you on Instagram.  (chuckles softly) I'm strong enough.  Well  okay then.  It's going to be a kinder, gentler version.  No more Evil Ex.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which, for the record,  he fully intended.  I just have to accept now  that I'll still see Darci.  Yeah, I'm sorry stuff got so bad with you guys,  with all the fertility problems.  We didn't have fertility problems.  I couldn't go through with it.  I just kept thinking, I'm not ready to be tied to her.  Permanently.  Which Darci didn't take  too well.  Should we go, hon?  I just thought I was further along, you know?  It's been three years.  I thought by now I'd be able to listen to the message  without crying.  Why?  You are where you are, right?  You know, I think I'm starting to see the upside  of Zen Rafael.  Yeah.  You're kind of my best friend, you know that?  Yeah, I know.  And speaking of where we are  Mateo needs a shadow.  He acts out,  he has impulse control issues,  and we need to accept that and get him help and support,  which, luckily, we can afford.  You're right.    (both chuckle)  Mi amor.    How long are you gonna keep tucking me in, hmm?    (chuckles softly)  (door shuts)  (beep)  MICHAEL: Hey, it's me. I'm sorry I'm late.  - I'll be home in ten minutes. - (crying)  I stopped to buy an orange.  O-Okay, a dozen oranges.  I know what we said about buying street fruit,  so I'm just preparing you for a lot of oranges.  Okay, bye.  PETRA: And it's a brand-new day.  And a brand-new hotel!  (cheering and applause)          (indistinct chatter)  Thank you.  You're the reason this wasn't a disaster.  Just supporting. This is all you.  Still not ready to step back in full-time?  No. No, not yet.  I tell him all the time he should.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow. I almost forgot  about Rafael's girlfriend, Abbey.  Which maybe is significant.  But that's for another day.  What the hell?      We broke ground on the on the clubhouse  eight months ago, right?  Yeah. Why?  Well, the timeline doesn't add up.  I started sleeping with Chuck six months ago.  He couldn't have changed the blueprints.  You didn't do it.  Like I told you.  Why did you sign the easement?  I think you know why, Petra.  Well, thank you.  And I'm sorry  about all the mean things I said.  And thought.  Mm-hmm.  I assume the fact  that your hand is now on my ass  is your way of saying you accept my apology?  Let's make it quick. I got plans early tomorrow.  (moans)  Who's ready for a pirate treasure hunt?  (cheering)  I, Swashbuckling Shawn, must confess,  I've buried some treasure at this address.  I need your helping hand finding my loot on this here land.  Look until the sky is starry.  Yo ho ho, you won't be sorry.  - (cheering) - JANE: I'm sorry.  I didn't ask for your help with Mateo because  Well, it made me feel like I failed him as a parent.  Like I let my sadness get in the way,  and that's why he's acting out.  Yeah, no kidding. And I've been waiting to tell you  that's just completely ridiculous.  Look, I don't know how you did it,  but you have been an incredible mother.  And I know.  I've seen you once a week for the past two years.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which was true, for the record.  (children giggling)  You won't ruin them.  I promise.    Trust me, I worry about that, too.  (scoffs)  (sighs)  I do.  So let's check in on each other, okay?  Once a week. We'll get the kids together,  because they're siblings, and we'll just make sure  that everything's okay.  You don't have to do this.  I don't like to be pitied, okay?  Are you serious?  Don't make me pull the widow card.  I need this, too, okay?  And then, the rest of the week, we'll never speak of it.  Fine. (clears throat)  Brunch.  On Saturdays.  Which, for the record, they did.  Every single Saturday.  Come rain or come shine.  I'm remembering Alba's words right now,  how Jane's life will be beautiful again,  in different ways.  - This way! - (children shouting, whooping)  Aye, he's found something!  (cheering)  Hmm. I can't see far, I can't see yonder.  What might be blockin' this, I wonder.  (gasps)  It is my pleasure to tell you the treasure  is hidden in a place where the sea meets the land.  That's right, children. I'm talking the sand!  (cheering)  Shh!  - (clinking) - Hey!  - Yes. - (children giggling)  Yes, I can hear you.  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you.  Okay, so, yeah, so, um, we'll be in touch.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  A publisher wants to buy my novel about Michael.  - Oh, my God. - Wait, what?  (chuckles)  - Oh, m - That's incredible.  Mommy's got a book deal!  - Yay! - Yay!  High five! High five!  I told you you got this.  GIRL: I got it!  I got it!  It is our duty  to unlock that booty!  (grunts) And now we must set that there treasure free  by finding that pesky old skeleton key.  But how? By where?  What's that? Over there!  To Michael.  ALL: To Michael!  Cheers! To avoiding the curse of Davy Jones' Locker.  Oh, my God.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: What is it?  What? What?  What?  We need to get to the beach, right now.  (gulls calling)  Uh-oh, mateys,  it looks as if the black spot  was placed on dear old Scott.  (lightning crashing)"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, people, lots coming up.  As you know, Michael died.  And three years later, well,  it was still really hard.  Also hard, Jane's nightmare boss, Chloe.  But guess what? She just got some amazing news.  A publisher wants to buy my novel about Michael.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Go, Jane!  - (cheering) - And as for her parents,  well, things were looking up for them, too.  See, they'd been estranged for the past two years,  because of how Xo was portrayed on Rogelio's reality show,  The De La Vega-Factor Factor.  That's right. She was known as the evil ex.  But Rogelio convinced her he knew nothing about that.  So they were trying to move past it.  Also moving forward, Jane's baby daddy, Rafael.  See, he went to prison and came back all Zen.  Just breathe.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And he had a new girlfriend, Abbey,  a super sweet greeting card designer.  And as for his other baby mama, Petra,  well, she had rebranded the Marbella  and turned it into a kids' hotel.  And she had a new beau, too: Chuck Chesser,  the owner of the Fairwick Hotel next door.  And she wanted to keep the relationship under wraps,  but alas,  nothing stays buried around here.  Which is where we left off.  Afterwards, after Michael,  there were times when reality felt overwhelming and   -  - well, let's have Jane tell us.  And my heart is racing,  I'm sweating,  everything looks and sounds far away.  (sniffles) It's like I'm dying.  Yeah, that's definitely a panic attack.  And I can give you some tools.  Yes. Please, yes.  First, take a deep breath,  put your hand on your heart and give yourself  a reality check.  Remind yourself that  you are not dying  and that this is just a physical sensation that will pass.  Then go through a checklist to figure out the trigger.  HALT.  Are you hungry, angry, lonely or tired?  Usually all four.  Try to figure out which is strongest,  and then keep breathing.  And when the panic attack passes,  address the underlying trigger.  Okay, I'll give it a try.    I feel really bad, so terrible.  Go on.  I think I'm ready to stop therapy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the awkward therapy breakup.  Who hasn't been there?  That's great, Jane.  - (sighs) - It means we've made real progress.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm, mine was much more awkward.  You have been so helpful.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Then again, I led with expensive.  And I will take everything I learned with me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which she did, for the record.    Especially that deep breathing technique.  CHLOE: Why did you cancel my therapist?  Are you an idiot?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not for panic attacks,  but for panic-inducing bosses.  I canceled your appointment because  you texted me late last night asking me to cancel it.  Well, you should have known  that if I'm texting you  late at night about my therapist,  I really need my therapist.      You're right. I'm sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know what you're thinking:  Jane just got a book deal.  Why is she still working for this demon?  And my latte is cold!  (gasps)  NARRATOR: Well, at least it's cold.    Screw it, I'm going to be optimistic!      I don't know how you don't quit that job 15 times a day.  I haven't gotten the official offer for my book deal yet.  I need to know what number I'm working with  before I give them my notice.  ABBEY: I think you're being  completely reasonable.  -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my bad.  -  - I actually forgot she was there.  Thanks, lady. See?  No, do not gang up on me.  (chuckles) We're not. She's just right.  Anyway, I got to run. My Something Borrowed,  Something Blue line just came in Something Turquoise.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, what's wrong with turquoise?  I love turquoise.  - Love you. - I love you.  - Mwah. - Mwah.  I know, right? They're already at âI love you.â  That's major.  MAN: We had a reservation.  ELVIS: I know and I'm sorry, but we're backed up,  and it's currently an hour wait.  This is unacceptable.          (quietly): If you move the planters by the railing,  you can push two tables together.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Enjoy.  You are a lifesaver.  He'll learn.  I hope so.  Scott was a creepy, scheming weirdo,  but he was a damn good lounge manager.  May he rest in peace.  Speaking of which, don't you have to ?  Yeah. I do.  Good luck.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know what you're thinking.  Good luck with what?  DENNIS: Okay, the results are in.  We've concluded that Scott Archuletta's body  was officially found on the grounds of  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Actually, I should jump in real quick.  That's Dennis. You remember Dennis, right?  Michael's old BFF at the police department.  He's been promoted to, like,  major or admiral or colonel or something.  Anyway, he's now running the dead Scott investigation.  Okay, let's continue.  Scott's body was on the grounds of   the Fairwick Hotel  and not the Marbella.    So, I got a stiff on my property. So what?  Accidents happen.  Problem is, we don't know if it's an accident yet.  Could be a homicide.  So that's what we have to try to figure out.  PETRA: Chuck, wait!  Hi.  Couldn't resist a private good-bye, huh?  Uh, no, I just, I wanted to see if you needed some advice.  Since, you know, the Marbella's been here before.  A few times.          -  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hold on,  that elderly guest  died peacefully in his sleep.  What's your angle?  What?  Darlin', I've been in bed with you.  You only think about yourself.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. TMI, Chuck.  What are you trying to get me to do?  Nothing. I'm trying to help you.  Let's just stick to the language of love, sweetheart.  And I'll take care of my own hotel.  (elevator bell dings)  Okay, so regardless of where Scott was found,  we have to get out in front of the story.  I'm implementing a complete lockdown.  All media calls will be forwarded directly to me,  the staff will inform guests that the blocked-off area  on the beach is due to renovations,  and security have been given strict orders  to keep all press off the premises.  But don't you think  This is a kids hotel.  A whisper of murder and we're ruined.  You are ruining me.    Only the finest masseuses for my new bride.  (moaning)  Your hands  feel so good on my body. (moans)  That oil is so slippery and delicious.  Can you rub it even lower?  Tanning oil does feel so good on the skin.  - TRIPP: Cut! -   Rogelio, this cabana boy is moving in on your woman  on your romantic Hawaiian honeymoon!      You're supposed to fly into a jealous rage  and then hit her up with your catchphrase.  ""âI just want to be factored inâ""  Yes, I know that's what I would have said,  but, remember, this is a kinder, gentler  The De La Vega-Factor Factor.  No jealous rages.  I just want to do a show about  a happy, well-adjusted fake married couple.  (phone vibrates)        Okay. Dad'll be here soon.    Great.  I'm really glad we're doing this.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, you'll recall, Xo and Ro  put their fight behind them.  Me, too. It's about time.  -  - Come on, Mr. Sweetface.  Your daddy's on his way to pick you up.  Before we get started, I just wanted to say something.  I'm so happy  that we're all here together to share in this moment,  when I show you what a liar  Rogelio really is.  I'll go talk to her. We'll go again.  Why? That was perfect.  We'll make it seem like she lost it because of you and Darci.  Come on, she just spilled coffee on herself.  America doesn't know that.  Ro, buddy, this is the drama that we have been looking for.  It's gonna send the ratings through the roof.  Fine. Just this once.  You said you didn't know anything about it.  I knew you were lying!    ROGELIO: I know.  I'm so, so sorry.  I didn't think it would become  such a big deal.  - I would - Go!  Xiomara  Just go now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, this Rogelio thing  is really affecting her, huh?  Oh, no, this is bad. I know what you're thinking:  âWait, doesn't Jane like Dennis just fine? â  Well, the answer is no, but I don't have time  to explain now. Just trust me.  Jane?  She hasn't had a panic attack in forever.  Jane?  Remember your coping mechanisms, Jane.  (panting)  Jane?  Jane?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Even I didn't see that coming.  - Oh, my God. I'm so - No, um (stammers)  I can't believe that I did that.  I-It's okay.  But you deserved it. And But I am so sorry.  - Look, can we talk? - No.  - Jane, we - I don't want  to talk to you ever.  (panting)    I still can't believe it.  (sniffles) I know.  (crying)  I'm gonna check up on you, okay?  (sniffles)    I know.  It's just  (sighs) I started having a panic attack.      I was thrown. I wasn't expecting to see him.    Apparently, he's running the Scott investigation  at the hotel, so he has to interview all the employees,  including you and me.    I'll be fine.  I just wasn't prepared.  - Now I'm prepared. - PETRA: No.  A salad lead time of 11 minutes is unacceptable.  All salads and cold apps need to be delivered to the table  within six minutes of the order being placed.  I understand. I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  Hey, yesterday it was 15 minutes.  So he's improving.  I am getting so tired of Zen Rafael.  You hired him; you fire him.  (phone chimes)    Oh, no.  Someone leaked the story.  I hate to say I told you so.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And yet   We should've gotten ahead of it.  All it takes is one disgruntled employee.  (whispers): And trust me, we have more than one.  SONIA: So, so sorry  for the wait.  Great. You told me so. That's not important.  What do we do now?  I know this doesn't undo what I did,  but please accept my apologies.    I had my assistant go nuts at the bookstore.  There are books about writing books,  books about reading books  Dad, I appreciate all the books, but  Even books about forgiving.  âForgiveness is a gift  you give yourself.â  Deepak Chopra.  Via Suzanne Somers.  Look, I know that you're sorry, but  I never meant to hurt anyone.  But you did.  And it's gonna take a while for people to forgive you  no matter how many books you buy.  I understand.  I'm just trying to get the process started.  Because I love you, Jane. You know that.  And I love you, too.  But I-I don't think Mom's gonna get past this.  Her Ropology basket is a work of art.  (phone chimes)  Oh, my God. It's my offer from the publisher.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm so excited!  Let's see how much money Jane's going to get.  (shrieks)  I am getting $50,000!  What? That's it?  (chuckles): That's barely my episodic rate.    No, that's amazing. $50,000 is a lot of money.  It's a huge amount of money. What was I thinking?  Let me get that scene from the top.  $50,000, Jane! Holy moly!  Congratulations!  Oh (laughs)  It's a year's salary.  So I can finally give my two-week notice to Chloe.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, yeah.  Someone's got her quittin' heels on.    I have had it with Chloe and her ridiculous notes.  I am not a hack, Jane!  No one said you are, Gary. You know Chloe.  You just got to breathe through it. (inhales)  (exhales): Ah  We'll talk later, okay?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or hashtag âsomeone else's problem. â  So, I have some exciting news.  After the writers' showcase,  I was actually offered a book deal.  And?  And  yay!  So I'm giving my two-week notice.  And I wanted to say thank you for the wonderful opportunity.  It was amazing.  So thank you.  Very, very, very much.  No.  Two weeks' notice is unacceptable.  I need at least six months, preferably a year,  to find and train a new assistant.  (stammers)  T-Two weeks' notice is pretty much industry standard.  Now you're lecturing me on industry standard?  No. God, never. No.  Uh I could stay a little longer.  (groans): Oh, please.  Go. You were terrible at your job.  What?  And you're deluding yourself  if you think this book deal's going anywhere,  especially with that ridiculous D-list publisher.  But congrats, you're a half a step above  self-publishing online.  Wow.  Chloe  you're a horrible person.  And I tried  to make excuses for you over the years,  like maybe your parents didn't hug you,  or maybe you grew up in a prison like Bane  from that Batman movie, but I just think  it comes down to who you are: a petty, mean-spirited bitch!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Atta girl, Jane.  I'm proud of you.  She deserved that.  God knows Scott did not deserve this.  And I am so sad about this.  (sobs softly)  Which is why  we're dedicating this fountain to him,  and creating a scholarship fund in his name  for disadvantaged youth.  (sighs) And even though  he died next-door, and not here at  his beloved Marbella,  his tragic loss will reverberate through these halls  for years to come.  Farewell, my friend.  Farewell.  (applause)  Just know I feel terrible.  VAN: You should.  It's like North Korea here.  Everyone's scared to say anything to Kim Jong-Chloe.  She told me to figure out everything you knew  but not to call you.  If I get caught  Don't worry, it sounds like she  wants you to call me but doesn't want you  to know she wants you to call me.  You're fine. And you've got  15 more minutes before she gets back from therapy,  so hit me up.  Sweat and Spin password?  Zero-three-ten.  Blowout Heaven stylist?  Lana for Beachy Waves,  Quentin if she wants a Straight-Up,  and always with a scalp massage.  - Always with a scalp massage. - VAN: Got it.  - Coffee order? - JANE: For a cold brew,  Davey's 20-ounce Baridi Blend.  For tea, InstaJava Venti  Iced Green Latte. And don't leave there  without an Edamame Hummus Wrap. She'll say that  she doesn't want one, but she'll always ask for it later.  (knocking) Hang on.  - Hurry. - JANE: You're good on time.  Legal docs for Jane Villanueva.  Van, it's a messenger with documents  from the publishing house for me to sign.  Shut up. Oh, my God!  Chloe's favorite massage therapist?  She wants something called the pounder?  - Oh, no. - VAN: Yep.  Did I mention Gary finally dropped us?  He's taking his next book to HarperCollins.  Uh, 90 minutes with Mary.  Van, let me call you back.  Â¿QuÃ© pasa?  I-It's about when I get paid for my novel.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when Jane  finally got her check.  I don't get $50,000  all at once.  I get $5,000 now,  another five when I turn in my first draft,  and the rest after the book is published.  Holy crap! I just quit my job.  I need to get my job back!  (groans) Of course I need to get it back.  RAFAEL: Why?  You hate that job.  ABBEY: You have been complaining about it forever.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oops. Sorry. My bad again.  Maybe this could be a good thing.  It's just that publishing jobs  are so hard to find, especially in Miami.  And I know Chloe hasn't filled my position yet.  Here's a thought.  Our new lounge manager isn't working out.  You could replace him.  Oh God, no.  - Why not? - I left waitressing behind.  This isn't waitressing; this is management.  This is a step up in responsibility and pay.  A wrong step. A step backwards, or sideways.  Mateo, use your words.  Help me!  Please.  Please!  I just need  to do some intense groveling, and hope it works.  Okay, the basket's all done.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw. Jane's first apology basket.  Let's see what she's giving Chloe.    What do you think?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not bad for a first-timer.    Chloe loves vintage jewelry.    (phone vibrates)  (breathes deeply)    Yeah.  My interview with Dennis is scheduled for tomorrow.  (sighs)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: As it happens, friends,  Dennis did stop by to check on Jane.  - So, did you go to the pickup game? - Yeah.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it turned into a regular thing.  Stayed five minutes, then I left.  Why?  Some guy asked where The Gunner was.  - The Gunner? - Mm-hmm.  That was Michael's nickname on the court.  Because he was always gunning.  The dude would never pass.  - (chuckles) - Seriously?  I didn't know Michael was such a ball hog.  Oh, yeah. He made a lot, and he missed a lot.  But he just kept shooting.  (chuckles)  So  you ready to go through his things?  (exhales)  (softly): Yeah.  And thank you for being here for this.  Of course.  -  - (panting, sighing)    (exhales)  I just have to get through this stupid interview.  RAFAEL: Just breathe.  Don't tell me to breathe, Rafael.  My breathing is not the problem. The problem is Elvis.  The demotion didn't work. He's also a horrible waiter.  If you won't fire him, I will.  No, don't. You can't.  I'll find some other place for him.  Why do you care so much?  I just do.  That's all.  Okay. Fine.  Look, I met Elvis in prison.  - Oh, my God. Prison? - Don't freak out.  - It was a nonviolent crime. - Oh, you-you hired  He's a good guy. He just needs a chance.  An ex-con to work in a kids' hotel?  Why? Why do we have to give him a chance?  Because it's really tough for ex-cons to get work.  And he has restaurant experience.  I was just trying to do a good thing.  If it makes you feel better, I'll just put him  in maintenance, okay, away from the kids and the cash.  Fine. Maintenance.  And I'm running a background check.  (phones vibrate, chime)  Oh, my God, it worked.  Your plan actually worked.  âHigh praise to the owners of the Marbella  âfor raising $12,000  âin honor of their deceased employee,  Scott Archuletta.â  âChuck Chesser, owner of the Fairwick Hotel,  âwhere the body was found, has refused to comment.  âHis conspicuous absence from the Marbella memorial  raises the question:  Could the Fairwick be covering something?â  I lied, and I covered it up, and I'm just so sorry,  but, Xo, please, just call me back.  (sighs)  You! I know what you did!  What are you talking about?  You sent that video to Xo, and now our relationship  is ruined!  I don't know anything about a video.  You're a liar! I should have never trusted you!  I didn't do it, Rogelio, I swear!  It was probably Tripp.  Come on. You said the only way you'd keep doing the show is  if we made it kinder and gentler.  And I agreed, because I need you.  It wasn't me, I promise.  Okay.  Okay?  Now can we deal with this after  and get this scene shot?  All right, let's do this!  And action!  Close your eyes, my love.  I made it myself.  (gasps)  It's my apology for being jealous of the cabana boy.  I'm sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of apologies  looks like Jane's got  her âplease give me my job backâ heels on.  Oh, what are you doing here?  Please. I just want to talk to you.  And Van told me that you threw out my basket.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good thing Alba kept her earrings.  And since you won't let me past reception,  and I know your schedule, I  Geez, you have to have, like, an engineering degree  to get this up.  I got it. (chuckles)  Look, Chloe  I just want to say that I am so sorry  that I quit, and I (loud dance music begins)  Okay.  Are you ready to be your best self today?  Let's make every minute count.  Out of the saddle!  (dance music continues)  We're almost at the crest of Mount Fuji, people!    You're almost there! You own this mountain!  - Today is your day! - (talking under loud music)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! I can't hear her, either.  I assume she's apologizing.  Or hyperventilating.  INSTRUCTOR: Whoo!  You made it to the top.  Now break away from the pack.  (groans)  - (music stops) - Wow.  That was intense.  Do they provide a wheelchair, or do you just crawl out?  Chloe please, can we talk?  Just wait.  No, just give me a second!  (groans) Okay.  (grunts)  Are you kidding me right now?  (grunts)  Wait!  (panting) Chloe!  Wait. I know I was rash.  I got caught up in the excitement  of getting a book deal, and I shouldn't have quit.  But I know you haven't found a replacement, and let's face it,  no one knows you better than I do. Please.  No.  I can get Gary back.  I'm listening.  I know him. He trusts me.  Remember, I got him to add commas into The Golden Hour,  even though he's morally opposed to commas?  And you yourself said that it made the book readable.  Just give me a chance.  Hey, what do you have to lose?  Fine. If you can get Gary back, you can have your job back.  (car door closes)  Hey, Gary, I was hoping that we could meet for a drink.  And, look, I know that you already made your decision,  but I just wanted to talk to you about it, okay?  Uh, call me back.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Deep breaths, Jane.  I've been doing it, too, and I am definitely  finding narrating a lot less stressful this episode.  Usually I'm like, âThere's so much exposition.  How can I fit it all in?â  - How's Lindsay? - That's his fiancÃ©e.  She's a third-year resident at Miami General.  They met in college.  See? Stress-free exposition.  She's fine. Busy with work.  Thanks for asking.  About what happened the other day  I just want to get this over with.  So, what kind of guy was Scott? Did you like him?  - Was he trustworthy? - (pen clicks)  I really think you'll feel better  after going through this stuff.  -  - JANE: I hope so.    I could have sworn  - I had another box buried - (camera clicking)  in the back of the closet somewhere.  No rush. I've got all day.  (camera clicking)  What the hell do you think you're doing?  Are you spying on me?!  Jane, there's been an ongoing investigation  into whether Michael wasconnected to Sin Rostro.  He didn't do anything!  - I'm just trying to clear his name! - No! Just get out!  DENNIS (echoing): Jane? Was he trustworthy?  Oh.                (sighs)              Mm.          Hmm.                                RAFAEL: Who are you?  I'm a momtrepreneur!  Hold one second for Anna!    Are you worried about your boyfriend?  He's not my boyfriend.  And, no, I'm worried about us.  If this is ruled a  M-U-R-D-E-R,  this is going to be very bad for everyone.  We don't need cops hanging around our hotel for months.  My God, do you have to film everything they do?  In a few years, you'll be glad  I have all these recordings.  Krishna!  Find out every event that happened here  in the days around Scott's death uh, weddings, parties,  bar mitzvahs, everything. I want a list.  And we need to contact everyone on that list  to get their recordings.    (women laughing, squealing)      Ladies, this is for my sizzle reel,  so would you mind screaming when you see me across the room?  One of you can even burst into tears  - if that feels right. - (women laughing)  ROGELIO: Of course I have the footage,  and I'll be happy to help. I know all about detective work  from my time as Detective Christian Contreras  in the smash hit telenovela Investigando El Peligro!  I'm sorry. I don't speak Spanish.  Oh. Investigating Danger.  Right. Yeah, well, hopefully.  Well, since you were shooting all over  the hotel that night, I'm just hoping  we'll find some footage of Scott.  I'm sorry. Can you please slow down?  Hmm?  Your accent is very strong.  - Ooh, I love this part! - You laugh at a port?  Why would I laugh at a parrot?  No. I'm just saying this is such a gem.  Can't you go to the gym later?  There's hours and hours of footage here.  Or what?  - What? - Please just slow down.  Wait! This is it!  I know. This is the money shot.  I love it. I look amazing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But that's not  what Petra was looking at.  Rogelio's footage shows Scott so drunk, the bachelorettes  were telling him to slow down. But he didn't.  He just said  Maybe I'll go for a swim.  The cops said it's most likely an accidental drowning.  You starting to like me, Solano?  What?  'Cause you're working awful hard  to help me if you're not.  Bad publicity for you is bad publicity for the Marbella.  That's all this is.  DARCI (moans): Oh!  That oil is so slippery and delicious.  Can you rub it even lower?  ROGELIO: I should have never trusted you!  DARCI: I didn't do anything!  Wow. It looks like we actually got in a fight.  Yeah.  Tripp pieced it together.  It works, I guess.  Oh, good. The show needs some more drama.  You guys were right.  I am factored back in!  You serious?  What changed?  Xo.  I realized she's never gonna forgive me.  So you know what? I'm done apologizing.  So I'm glad you sent that tape, to end things once and for all.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Aha! I knew it!  I knew you did it!  Okay, you got me. I lied.  And here's the thing  I don't care.  (sighs) Darci, come on.  How did things get so bad between us?  I unfroze an egg, you had a panic attack and bailed.  Well, technically, that was not a panic attack.  Now, Jane has  It defrosted!  I just didn't want to have a baby with you.  So you said.  Do you think it's easy for me to do this show?  I'm miserable.  But here's the silver lining.  Now I'm famous.  And fame  It really does a great job of masking that empty feeling.  Well, I'm done, Darci.  You can't quit.  You signed a contract!  What's Papa apologizing to me for?  JANE: Don't worry about it.  Just take the gift and say thank you.  Can we color a little?  One page, then bedtime.  (panting softly)  A giraffe.  (echoing): Mommy, are you okay?  (gasping)  Mommy? Mommy?  Oh.  Mommy?  Sorry, hon.  You had that face. Were you thinking about Michael?  A little, yeah.  How come now?  Well, I saw someone that was mean to him,  and it made me mad.  Did you use your words?  You know, I really didn't.  You should.  You're right.  I will.  Oh, you.  (sniffles)    Okay. Mommy asked him to talk.  (phone chimes)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us  -  - here now.  I know. I was expecting, like, a cafe or something.  Why are we here?  I figure if you're gonna keep hitting me,  at least you can wear gloves.  Look, I just want to talk. I'm not gonna hit you again.  Fine. I just want to explain my side of the story.  When Michael passed away,  I joined the department's investigation to  No, you're right. I do want to hit you.  Give me those gloves.  Don't forget to practice.  - I don't want to talk to you. - I know. I know.  I just wanted to tell you,  I've been doing some soul searching,  and I realize I've lost my way.  Yeah. No kidding.  I just want to go back to how things were before I became  this crazy famous reality TV star,  when I was just a simple internationally famous  telenovela star.  And I'm gonna try to get back to that guy.  And he was honest.  And if I'm honest,  I think I agreed to the cut because I was jealous.  You had just moved in with Bruce,  and I think I wanted to hurt you.  And I'm so sorry.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And from one troubled friendship  to another.  Oh, wow! Look at Jane!  She's pummeling him!  - In her mind. - (bell dings)  In reality   You are such a jerk!  I'm so mad at you.  Whoa.  - No kicking. - Sorry.  I know you're mad.  Punch me back.  - No. - You can use me  and betray me  That's punching me!  I didn't use you.  You did!  I trusted you,  and you went through Michael's stuff!  I had to.  What you had to spy on him?  I was trying to clear his name.  The whole time, I was trying to clear his name.  - I don't believe that. - It's true.  - There was an investigation. - You didn't have to work it.  Would you want someone else to?  - You could have told me! - I was trying to protect you.  I don't need protecting!  Not now, but then.  You were having panic attacks every day!  (bell dings)  I'm sorry, again.  Not your fault.  (sighs)  You're right.  I was in a different place then.  (sighs)  It just sucked, because you were the one person  that I could talk to or could  I don't know  Tell me new things  about Michael, things I didn't know.  Hearing that he was a ball hog, or  what he said after our first date or whatever.  It just kept him alive a little.  I know.  Well, I'm here every Tuesday,  if you ever get the urge to talk,  or, you know, hit me again.  Maybe I will.  So should we talk about Scott?  Nah. We actually ruled it an accident this morning.  Really? 'Cause I had a list of, like, 50 suspects in mind.  Yep. The Marbella is totally off the hook.  The Fairwick, too.  JANE: That's great.  I'm so happy for you.  Oh. How is Mateo? Did he go down without a fight?  We went a few rounds,  but Fuzzy Bunny finally talked him into it.  Oh, Fuzzy Bunny is such a creep.  (Funny Bunny voice): It hurts my feelings  when you say that about me, Jane.  (laughs): Creepy.  (laughs) JANE: Oh, that reminds me,  I'm going to be a little late tomorrow picking him up.  I'm meeting Gary for breakfast.  I'm going to ply him with mimosas,  and get him to come back to Chloe. Hmm?  Jane, stop.  Just come manage the lounge.  I can't.  Why? You'd be good at it.  Plus, you love everybody there.  I have to think long-term, career-wise.  This isn't about your career, this is just to buy time.  You don't know that.  What are you talking about?  You just got a book deal.  W-Which might not go anywhere.  What?  Hit books are few and far between.  And if it doesn't happen for me,  then I'd be a lounge manager,  as opposed to someone working in the publishing industry.  You're talking about if you fail.  I'm being practical.  What happened to following your dreams?  Well, y-you know, I  I had a dream.    RAFAEL: I know.  But you do have other ones.  And I won't let you get stuck in the lounge.  Okay?  Two years and you're out.  Promise?  Promise.  Because you'd want me to tell you if you were stuck.  Exactly.  You're stuck.  At work, you're basically Petra's bitch.  And I say that with full respect  for Petra.  You're not gonna turn back into greedy,  shady, amoral Rafael  just because you care about the Marbella.  Greedy, shady, amoral Rafael?  Paraphrasing. Just think about it.  LATIN LOVE NARRATOR: Which he did, for the record.  So just like that?  After a year of âyou decide, â you want to start weighing in.  Yes. I'm ready.  Well, it's about time.  ABBEY: See? I knew she'd be happy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, God. Sorry, again.  So embarrassing. I should look into this.  Well, he actually has good ideas sometimes.  Wow. High praise.  But he has to lose the beard, right?  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  It's a prerequisite.  I'm going back to telenovelas, Mateo.  You are too young to remember, but Papa played some epic roles.  So my next role needs to be even bigger.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or much, much, much smaller.    But we're not there yet.  Ooh, it's my agent.  Hi, Barry.  Hi, Barry.  Oh.  I see.  Okay.  Thank you.  What's wrong?  It's nothing.  Tell me. I want to be factored in.  Hmm.  I'm being sued for $10 million for breach of contract.  That sounds bad. Can you send them a basket?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: If the basket is full of $10 million.  Sonia, can you cover six and seven  for Joey until he gets back from break?  - Yeah, no problem. - Thank you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep. Rocking that manager job.  And in that instant, friends, Jane was reminded of Michael.  And dare I say, it felt a little like a sign.  The first in a long time.  (sighs)  Found it.  (chuckles)  RAFAEL: Okay.  Now that you've made it through your first day,  I am officially giving you  your one-year, 51-week, six-day notice.  That won't be necessary, because I will have quit  in a blaze of glory by then,  because I am a writer.  I have a book deal.  A messenger sent over the paperwork and everything.  Huh? (mimics explosion)  (squeals)  PETRA: What's all this?  They're flowers.  It's what someone brings when he's taking  someone else on a date,  which is what I'm gonna do.  Just take your pants off.  You don't need to take me to dinner first.  (chuckles): No.  I want to go out.  A proper date.  Come on.  You wouldn't have tried to help my hotel  if you didn't âlike meâ like me.  Fine.  Maybe I âlike youâ like you.  You happy?  I'll pick you up at 7:00.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.  Looks like something's troubling Petra.  I wonder what it could be.  Sorry. I'm just being coy.  I know what it is.  I'll show you.  (thunder crashes)  Yep. Petra's been hiding something.  And she's not the only one.  That was close.  It would've been bad for us if they'd ruled it a murder.  I know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  What the hell are you up to, Rafael?"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hola, friends. As you know, Jane's husband died.  But three years later  A publisher wants to buy my novel about Michael.  So sweet, right? But you know who hasn't been that sweet  lately? Mr. Sweetface.  So Jane and Rafael decided to take  some action and get him an aide.  And as for Jane's parents, well, they weren't  on such great terms, because Xo learned that Ro agreed  to frame her as the evil ex on hon reality show.  Good thing Xo has her super cute lawyer boyfriend  to lean on.  And as for Rogelio, well,  he decided to quit The De La Vega-Factor Factor,  - which felt great until - ROGELIO: I'm being sued  for $10 million for breach of contract.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! Holy cow!  Oh, that reminds me. Remember Chuck Chesser,  owner of the hotel next door?  Well, Petra's been sleeping with him.  But now Chuck actually likes her. But Petra has a secret.  See, there was a body found on the beach,  right between the Marbella and the Fairwick. And Petra  Well, I'll show you  - (lightning crashing) - Yeah.  So that, friends, is where we  Oh, wait. Shoot. I forgot about Abbey.  Abbey is Raf's girlfriend, and she's really nice.  Which is why I hope Raf isn't up to something shady.  Though it sure seems like it.  And that's really where we left off.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was 27 years  and 14 days old,  she lost her voice  -  - (hoarsely): I'm sorry, Mr. Sweetface.  I can't sing to you. I can barely talk.  Daddy!  - Daddy! - Daddy already sang two songs.  Enough. Time for bedtime. I love you.  More stalling?  Thanks. I don't know how I lost my voice.  I feel fine.  What?  I have a few things on my mind,  so I'm gonna go ahead and take advantage  of this whole you-can't-talk situation.  - Well, that's a lit - Shh. So, per our deal  to keep each other informed  I'm dating someone.  It's getting a little serious.  Her name is Abbey.  What? When did y  Shh.  Don't use your voice.  That's all I want to say about it. Next,  it's time for you to start writing again.  Yes, I know You haven't made progress  on the Venezuela novel.  So write something new.  It's been    Long enough.  You have to start.  - It's not that easy. - It doesn't even have to be good.  - (scoffs) - Just write.  About anything.  Uh, Kim and Kanye.  The-the history of throat lozenges.  The history of  Florida.  It-it doesn't matter, okay?  Just flex the muscle.  Okay. That's all my wisdom for the night.  I have a date.  I need details.  Depends on how many pages I get.  (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on,  you know he's right.  (groans softly)  (sighing)  Aw, I was hoping she'd go with lozenges.  A medicine and a candy!  But anyway, the point is Jane began to read            (sighs)  You got this.  And that, my friends, is how Jane got her voice back.  -  - And since then, well,  she used it nonstop.  - You are being ridiculous. - See what I mean?  Of course I'm excited to meet my editor.  I was just expecting a woman, because  You trust women more than men.  So not true!  You do. Admit it. You have a bias.  You didn't even consider hiring Alex.    I considered him. He's just    Not as good as Carly.  Nope.  You only trust female authority figures.  It's a pattern.  Wow. I've never noticed that before,  but it's so true!  Okay, if it's slightly true,  it's not my fault I've just always been surrounded by women.  (chuckles)  But, fine,  I'll check my bias from now on. Happy?  (phone chimes)  - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's Abbey.  She just wants to have a talk later.  Huh, she seemed fine this morning.  - Uh-oh. - Mateo,  are you excited to meet your new special friend Carly today?  - (shouting) - Oh, man. Come here. Come here.  (grunts)    Yes, I'm excited!  Good. You're gonna love her!  (gibberish sound) Mwah!  Do you think he loves her?  - I can't tell. He won't turn around. - (gasps)  I think she just said ""Good job, Mateo.""  Or was it ""Stop that, Mateo""?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looked to me like ""Screw you, Mateo,""  but I think I'm just really bad at this.  Okay, this is crazy.  We have to go before we get caught.  I know. You're right. Going.  Wait, what?    (whirring)    Oh, Jane, Raf. Hey, Stacy.  So, how are things going with Mateo's new aide?  I completely get why you need the extra help.  (chuckles)  What a relief,  - huh? - RAFAEL: Yeah.  It really is.  JANE: What a bitch!  Can you believe her?  What? She was nice.  Nice? Didn't you hear her tone?  I think you're being a little sensitive.  No. Trust me, this is a mean girl thing.  You just don't get it because you're a man.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yep. There's that gender bias.  Who's never experienced mean girls.  Or maybe you're just a little extra sensitive  because you're feeling insecure about Mateo.  Maybe. We'll see.  I have to go meet with my editor.  With my open mind.  - Good luck with Abbey. - Yeah. Thanks.  I'm thinking she just wants to come to the fundraiser,  you know, get involved with school stuff.  - I want to move in. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh.  Wow.      You look shocked.  Surprised.  It's been over a year.  Where did you think we were headed?  Right here. Of course.  I just, you know, didn't expect today.  I know. It's a little out of the blue.  Exactly. You know?  Um, I just thought you wanted to come with me  to the fundraiser. (chuckles)  I assumed I'd be going to that.  (overlapping arguing)  - No - I mean, I'm here all the time.  - You have the dr - Don't say I have that drawer.  A dramatic way of bringing it up.  Look, this is a big deal, because  it affects Mateo and Anna and Ellie, too.  Good save, Raf.  So will you just give me a beat to think it through?  (knocking, door opens) - KRISHNA: Mr. Solano, I  Oh, excuse me.  - Oh, no, that's okay. I was just leaving. - No, it's  It's okay. I'm fine.  CHUCK: You don't seem fine.  Well, I am.  Yeah. I'm not buyin' that, darlin'.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To remind you  (lightning crashing)  You're embarrassed to be seen with me.  Oh please. No.  That's not true.  We're having lunch in Cooper City.  At 11:00 a.m.  Yeah. Well, I happen to love the food here.  Early.  - I know you moved the bones, ma'am. - What?  - I said watch out for the bones, ma'am. -   What is going on with you?  Okay, fine. You know what?  You're right.  I am a little embarrassed.  And, uh and I know I shouldn't be.  So, tomorrow  come to the Marbella for dinner.  All right.  And, wow, you're way more sensitive than I thought.  Can't judge a book by its cover.  (chuckles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But can you judge an editor  by his office dÃ©cor?    There she is!  Jane Villanue-bomb!        Man, I really dug your book.  You crushed it.  Thank you. So much.  It was epic. I swear, I freaking inhaled it.  I'll remind you she'd written  about her love story with Michael.    The railroad tycoons,  all the letter writing.  And those robber barons?  Dapper as hell.  To clarify, her love story with Michael  as imagined in the early 1900s  at the dawn of Miami's great hotel boom.  I mean, bam! Getting Josephine knocked up  by the robber baron after that one-night stand was fire.  Great. I really wanted it to be fire.  And Detective Martin almost getting shot  on his wedding night but not!  And then catching the villain,  who ended up being the woman without the face!  Hella happy ending!  Ba-boom!  But I need more obstacles.  - More than that? - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: More than that?  Especially in the middle section where it gets mad slow.  Look at Rake, the robber baron character.  I feel like he could be more  bam, boom, bang!  You got that?  Makes sense?  Definitely not.  Yeah. Totally.  Good. So go knock that rewrite out of the park!  Bam!  Bam!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's see. Where were we?    I'm with child, Rake.  From our drunken night in the railway car?  But though you are the father,  I love Detective Martin, and I want to be with him.  I understand.  Ah, yes  Go, Josephine.  Win him back.  Jane's novel.    Remember, more obstacles, Jane.  I'm awfully sorry if I offended you.  Only, I love Detective Martin, and I want to be with him.  (sinisterly): I understand.  Go, Josephine.  Win him back.  (chuckles)    I don't care what you have to do, Kristoff,  but find an excuse to lock up that Pinkerton, Martin.  She will be mine.  (laughing)  She will be mine.  -  - (laughing)  (sighs)  MAN: Stop worrying!  They call me The Jaguar for a reason.  I'd kill for my clients.  - And I devour my prey. - (jaguar roaring)  It's just that ten million dollars is a lot of money.  For some people, so I've heard, you know?  And I did quit the show.  And I did have a contract, so  Yeah. So what?  I deal with this kind of thing all the time  for my celebrity clients.      When Jennifer quit two movies in a row  after filming had already started,  I got the studios to pay her a million dollars.  Lopez? Garner?  Aniston?  (gasps) Lawrence?!  We'll get it down to a couple hundred thou,  which you'll pay out over ten years.  Chump change.  - Now, I need your list. - Huh?  All the people involved  so we can start gathering intel for our attack.  (jaguar roaring)  Oh, I'm being deposed.  Well, The De La Vega-Factor Factor did impact you.  I know, but I don't want to have to see Rogelio.  I'll go with you for support.  It's good to have your own legal counsel anyway.  - XIOMARA: Thanks, baby. - BRUCE: Of course.  - (laughs) - Love you.  He is so sweet.  How can someone be so sweet?  I don't know.        - (laughter) - BRUCE: And he's got  - ass for days, right? - (laughter)  I mean, when you factor in the difficult children, I mean  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, Jane, Stacy probably wasn't being snarky  about Mateo before.  I mean, I just hope Mateo's aide is going to be there  because I can't handle that situation on my own.  - Ugh, trust me, I know. - Excuse me.  So you know, my son is not a situation to be handled.  And I'd appreciate it if you grew up and stopped gossiping.  Just stay out of this. I don't even know you.  STACY: Uh, Jane,  this is Gwen Conway.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh.  Why does that name sound familiar?      STACY: Yeah, we were just discussing the upcoming  field trip. I'm the only parent going,  and it's a lot of kids  to handle on my own.  That's all I meant.  Gotcha.  Oh! So sorry about that.  And it's really nice to meet you, Gwen.  Um, can I say,  we are so happy to be here at your school?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know. I can't watch, either.  RAFAEL: It's a great card.  Really beautiful, hon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Kiss ass.  But what about what I wrote in the card? Is that great?  I mean, it's an apology for being rude,  so I think ""great"" is probably hard to achieve.  So no?  Jane, Gwen is not gonna kick Mateo out of school.  No, but he'll definitely get the bad teacher for kindergarten.  Okay, girls,  why don't you go play with your brother in the playroom?  Poor Mateo.  I know. Let's hug him.  You must make this right.  Look, if Gwen doesn't like you, you're screwed.  Or rather, Mateo's screwed.  He'll get no special attention,  he'll get all the bad teachers.  I'm fixing it. I wrote a long apology note.  Words don't mean anything. Only actions do. Oh!  Okay, there's a final  planning committee for the annual fundraiser tomorrow.  Gwen will be there, and so will you.  This is important, Jane! Plus, everything  you do reflects on me because I'm the one who got you in.  XIOMARA: My reputation was ruined.  Strangers confronted me at the grocery store.  Someone gave me the finger at a red light  and called me a slut. It was awful.  For the record, I want to reiterate how sorry I am  for the part I played in causing this.  Okay. Got it. I think that's all we need.  Sounds like they assassinated your character.  Great, great stuff.  For our case.  Hopefully, we won't need to use any of it, though.  Much better to mediate.  That's right, in the media.  What? I am gonna drag  this company's name through the mud so hard,  - they beg us to settle! - (jaguar roaring)  I love this guy.  I don't like this guy.  Trying to shame the production it's risky.  Well, there's nothing we can do.  - You could talk to Rogelio about it. - (laughs)  Oh, come on! The sooner this case is over,  the better it will be for you.  Fine. As long as you do it with me.  Of course.  We're a team.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of teamwork  Thank you again to Petra for donating  the use of the Marbella.  And thank you to the planning committee.  Your hard work has been inspiring.  (laughing)  Monte Carlo night is going to be our best fundraiser yet.  - STACY: Agreed. Absolutely. - Mm.  All right, so, any more auction items to add, ladies?  Yes, um, my sister can donate courtside seats  - to the Heat game. - Oh.  And I secured those BeyoncÃ© tickets.  (people gasp)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Use your words, Jane!  Say something!  Um, well, I was thinking,  uh, maybe if we lose the second fountain,  we could make room for another table to make extra money.  I mean, looking at the budget, those fountains  are a fortune, and the point is  to raise money for the school, not spend it.  GWEN: We need  the second fountain.  No one is going to pull out their wallets  to donate if the event isn't great.  Huge mistake. She loves fountains.  STACY: You know, I love  the layout that we decided on  last month.  Okay, so we need three more people to work tomorrow night.  Any volunteers?  I would love to.  PETRA: And she just  keeps messing up.  Honestly, it's kind of funny.  (laughs) Okay, never mind then.  Not funny. Sorry. Just distracted.  - Abbey? - Do you think I should do it?  Yeah. Probably.  Abbey's great.  I mean, Jane and I both like her,  and that's saying something.  Yeah. I know.  Oh, and by the way,  not a big deal, but, um, Chuck and I will be dining  at the restaurant tonight.  Got it. Does he know we don't serve gator?  RAFAEL: Hey, change of plans.  Petra will be out of her room tonight.  Got it.  - I'll get it done. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Get what done?  Gosh, what are these two up to?        Hey, hon, want Chinese?  (sighs)  I'm confused.  Okay, you can decide later.  No, the book.  I don't know if I'm going in the right direction.  I mean, I-I don't think I am.  But maybe I'm just used to what I had?  Then again, this editor is  Hey, hon, don't just discount him  because he seems like a frat guy.  I know, you're right.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, sure!  Now that a woman said it, you hear it.  I swear, now I'm seeing her gender bias everywhere.  I'm trying not to, and yes to the Chinese.  And button up before the delivery guy gets here.  You know he's got a crush on you.  Kind, sir, I'm here to seek your help finding Martin.    Oh.  Dear me.  (gasps softly) I seem  to have a rip in my stocking.  Zara  you are a sight for sore eyes.  That's not all I am.  What else are you?  You can't put that in the book!  I'm serious. That's gross. Take it out!  Okay, please leave.  You are not supposed to be the literal obstacle to my writing.  Fine.  But I'm serious. Take it out.  CHUCK: And we're out.  Calm down.  You're making a bigger deal of this than it is.  Oh, our public debut is a big deal.  Everyone's watchin'.    Oh, no.  I think I left my phone upstairs. I'll be right back.  ""You're not baili"" on me, right?  Oh, of course not.  Sit, get us some drinks.  What the hell are you doing here?  Just some standard maintenance on the penthouse suites, ma'am.  Why didn't you call in advance?  I mean, you can't just enter people's homes with no notice!  I'm very sorry. I'll come back another time.  (phone chimes)      (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear. Whose book is that?  As Jane's editor would say, that's hella shady. Bam!  ABBEY: Hi, there. Sorry to just come by,  but I wanted to bring you Anna's blankie.  She left it at Raf's.  Oh. Thanks.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And?  And I also wanted to talk to you.  About Rafael, which I realize is completely  inappropriate, but I'm sure you heard  about the whole moving-in conversation?  It might have come up.  - It seemed so out of the blue to him. - Yeah, well,  - part of that's just a guy thing. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey!  I mean, they're like cows. They have to be led to the water  - and told to drink. - Right, totally.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Maybe get a girl to narrate for you then.  But do you think he'll get there eventually?  Honest opinion. You know, I don't  I don't want to set myself up.  I hope he does.  I think he should.  Ugh, men. (laughter)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, come on!  That doesn't count! He's four!  (laughing)  - How was he today? - Great.  -  - We worked on  -  - paying attention to our neighbors.  And I probably shouldn't say this, but  you know that kid Nick?  - Yeah? - He's a little terror.  Yelling, interrupting.  Mateo is a dream in comparison.  Just so you know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I see that smile, Jane.  Anyway, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye, Mateo!  (sighs) Another good day with Carly.  She's great, right?  - Yeah, she is! - All right, let's go.  Yeah. (chuckling)  - (phone rings) - Oh.  Hello?  JEREMY: Villanue-bomb!  Uh, you think you can get me those new pages  by the end of the week?  Oh. Uh, wow, that soon?  Yeah, man. Deadlines are what's up!  That way I can check in, make sure you're moving  in an awesome direction.  Right. O-Of course. (chuckles)  No problem.  (sighs, mutters)  (sighs)  Hi, Bisa. I have to go pee-pee.    So, now I havehaa deadline and..  Oh, hey, Bruce. Where's Mom?  Well, I came over to talk to you two, actually.      ABBEY: One more minute!  (clears throat) Okay. I'm ready.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I swear, this one is always sneaking up on me.  Wow. You look beautiful.  Oh, thank you. You look beautiful, too.  Are you ready for a night out  with my two baby mamas at a cheesy approximation  - of Monte Carlo? - Hey, don't ruin it for me.  I've never been to the real Monte Carlo, so for all I know,  this could be exactly like Monte Carlo.  I can assure you, it is nothing like the real Monte Carlo.    But, hey, it's still pretty nice  for a freakin' preschool fundraiser!  Hi! Welcome!  So, I've already sold 12 raffle tickets.  Oh, no.  We were at 50 by this time last year.  Oh. (chuckles) I'm just warming up.  Oh.  (gasps) Hey.  Need a raffle ticket?  -  - Sorry. Right. You already bought one.  (exhales noisily)  (indistinct chatter)  (whispering): Keep selling.    Ooh, looks like someone has an idea.    Excuse me, Penelope, but I need your help.  Why would I help a floozy like you?  You're carrying my husband's child.  But I don't want to be with Rake.  I want to be with Martin.  Why would I help a floozy like you?  You're carrying my husband's child.  Why would I help a floozy like  What's going on, Jane? If you don't know where you're going,  why are you dragging me into this?  I second that.  Jane, we're out of glasses.  Oh, I'm not working.  I-I know. But what should we do?  The-the dishwasher broke, I called room service.  We're literally out everywhere.  Have the bussers wash them.  The school didn't hire any bussers.  We're so shorthanded.  Okay, I'll handle it.  (sighs)  - Hey, I need your help. - Hey, Chuck, it's me.  Uh, you haven't been returning my calls,  and, well, that's rude.  - Ooh! - Oh, look!  Hey, ladies!  Bonjour. (chuckles)  'Cause it's  Monte Carlo.  Anyway, we're out of glasses, and we're understaffed.  So I was thinking that if we wash the dirty ones  during the auction, then we can fix this  without anyone noticing.  Wash the dishes?  (Xiomara groans)  -  - Rogelio again?  He settled. He loves his lawyer.  Okay, so maybe we were wrong.  I'm still glad we told him how we felt.  Yeah, except now he'll never stop gloating.      (scoffs) Yeah, right.  What?  He hopes we can settle things soon, too.  Yeah. I agree.  What?  I think you should forgive him.  You're on his side?  No. (chuckles) I'm-I'm on your side.  Always.  Which is why I want you to be happy.  And the truth is, you're happier when you have  your whole family in your life.  Just think about it.  (sighs) What are you thinking about?  Just work stuff.  I hate everything I've written. And I gave it a try.  I really did. And it's not a man/woman thing  It's a Jeremy thing.  And how did you learn how to wash dishes so fast?  Oh, I was on KP duty in prison.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I keep forgetting he was in prison.  That time just flew by, huh?  Hi there. I heard what happened.  Don't worry, we have everything under control.  Well, I appreciate that.  Of course.  And I'm so sorry again about the yelling.  I've been stressed out about Mateo and obviously  overly sensitive. And when I thought someone was saying  mean things about him,  I just lashed out.  I guess because it preys  on my insecurities. Which I'm working on.  Well, parents are their kids' fiercest advocates.  (chuckles) Just bring the fierce down a notch from now on.  Got it. Done.  And, of course, I asked Stacy to back off.  She can be a real bitch.  See?  I gave her the benefit of the doubt.  She's always been so nice to me.  - No kidding. - Big surprise.  All right, we get the point, ladies.  - Give him a break. - I'll just go take these glasses out.  PETRA: No, no, don't refill it.  I'll just take a fresh one.  Oh  Hey.  Everything okay?  Yeah.  Feeling a little smutna.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Say what now?  Yeah, your Czech only comes out  when you've had too much to drink. So  What's wrong?  It's Chuck.  He won't answer my texts.  He thinks I'm rozpacÃ­ch.  Em-Embarrassed.  Embarrassed of him.  Okay. Well, are you?  Obviously, yes.  He's rude.  He's coarse.  He slurps when he eats.  And let's not forget the other issue of the  bones.  Well, I guess you can't choose who you fall for, right?  You also can't choose who you aren't falling for.  Look, you know I like Abbey.  I mean, she's so nice.  But you obviously don't want to move in with her.  So just tell her already,  be done with this nesmysl.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like I said,  this one sneaks up on you.  PETRA: You know what,  - I'm drunk. - Ya think?  So I'm gonna go.  O-kay.  Petra out.  Get home safely.  Yeah. Who said she was going home?  I know.  You're mad because you think I'm embarrassed of you.  And you know what?  Maybe I am.  But I don't want to be, okay?  Because I like you.  And I-I just want to (speaks Czech)  And I know, I know you don't know what that means, but  you're gonna be very happy when you find out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. He's got quite the poker face.  What?  Poker night.  Like I said.  Guys, meet Petra.  Boom!  Villanue-bomb in before the deadline.  (sighs) Yeah.  Well, I just wanted to talk to you.  Psyched.  Because  I just don't think that we're a good fit.  - Less psyched. - I'm sorry.  I tried implementing your notes, but they don't work for me.  Jane  And I just really don't think that my book  needs any more external obstacles.  The Rake storyline was always supposed to be simple.  Josephine loved him, he got her pregnant  Wait, Josephine loved Rake?  That didn't come through at all.  It didn't?  No, it read like  an olden times one-night stand.  Oh. But that could be the missing obstacle, right?  Boom. Josephine's conflicted feelings in this love triangle.  - That would be enough? - Of course.  Dude, I'm sorry.  I never meant that the obstacles had to be external.  I just threw something out there. You seemed to latch on.  I thought I had to take your note.  No!  This is all a part of a long conversation.  That's how an editor-writer relationship works.  - Oh. Wow. - (chuckling): Yeah!  Of course I want your voice, Jane!  That's why I bought your hella good book.  So, look, you can handle these notes however you'd like.  It sounds like beefing up the baller love triangle  is the most natural thing to do.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here.  Now.  I  like you so much, dude.  Thanks.  You're hella awesome.  (clears throat)      I just can't write it, Abuela.  Somehow, deepening Josephine's love for Rake  feels like a betrayal of Michael.  Martin.    And intellectually, I know that  Mm.              Yeah.  Maybe.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, Jane wrote    Be brave.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's how Jane got her voice back.  - Again. - BRUCE: Guys,  - lower your voices, please. - What am I supposed to do?  She is ridiculously stubborn!  - He completely betrayed me! - Hey! Enough!  You're both here, so we're gonna work this out,  because you have a child  and a grandchild together, and everybody in your life  is happier when you're getting along.  Including the two of you. I mean,  are you willing to concede that point at least, Xiomara?  Yeah.  And you, Rogelio?  Yes.  I'm so much happier with you in my life.  Maintain eye contact, Xiomara.  Rogelio,  do you concede that you screwed up?  Massively, yes.  And swear never to do it again,  under penalty of never speaking?  You have my word.  What's that nod mean, Xiomara?  Do you forgive him?  Then tell him!  I forgive you.  Let's leave it in the past.  I'd love to. Thank you.  So glad he had another good day.  You know about Stacy's older son, right?  What?  So, I probably shouldn't say this,  but he isn't actually attending  an exclusive boarding school like she says.  He's at a behavioral center for juvenile delinquents.  Really?  I know! And don't even get me started  on her so-called ""perfect marriage.""  It's not perfect.  I heard he's had, like, three affairs  in the last two years alone  JANE: I just don't think it's appropriate  for Carly to be gossiping like that  about the kids and the parents?  - No, definitely not. - (sighs)  But how do we get rid of her now?  - Mateo loves her. - No, I don't!  What?  I just said I did 'cause I could  tell you wanted me to like her.  Okay, so, what do you not like about her, sweetie?  She's just always talking on her phone  and taking pictures of herself.  Hey, Mateo, I always want to know what you think, okay?  Not what you think I want you to think.  Huh?  Your voice is important to me.  We'll find you another aide.  That guy Alex seemed cool.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes! Redemption!  PETRA: Why are you smiling?  I had a nice time tonight, that's all.  Come on, we were out and about. Mmm!  In public!  And I like you, Solano.  Yeah, I like you, too.  Don't look so upset about it.  Mmm. So what do you say we bone?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oof, wrong choice of words there, buddy.  What? Too crass?  What is it?  Oh, come on, you can tell me, darling.  I want to.  I want to be honest.  So just say it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: How to find the words  Well, uh well  when we found Scott's bones  well, I-I  panicked, and I-I, uh  I kind I kind of  Well, I I moved them on to your side a little bit.  What?  Well-well, they were kind of on the line,  so I just I just I kind of I  I just scootched them over a little bit, and  Look, I've felt horrible about it ever since,  but it the case is closed, so, it's over, right?  Please, Chuck, you have  to understand, this hotel means everything to me.  And you could have destroyed mine.  No, I would have told before that happened.  Yeah. Somehow I find that hard to believe.  Jane.  Hi, Stacy.  I can't believe you told everyone about my son.  What?!  Oh, come on. Carly works for the same company  that my son's aide used to work for.  You obviously found out  the truth, and you just ran your mouth.  Carly did tell me about your son,  and-and I am sorry that you're going through that,  but I didn't tell anybody.  I would never want to make you feel badly about that.  Parenting is hard enough.  It was probably Carly.  She is a huge gossip, which is why I let her go.  Oh.  Well, thank you.  (sighs) Hey.  I'm really sorry.  ROGELIO: You're sorry?  - I thought this was settled! - It was,  but somehow it leaked that we started this smear campaign,  and now they're suing you  for violating the non-disparagement clause.  But don't worry! We'll fight back,  razzle-dazzle 'em.  But that's just more legal bills.  I just saved you $9.8 mill, am I right?  (jaguar roaring)  RAFAEL: No.  Nothing has changed.  Okay, I just I thought about it,  and I'm  I'm not ready to move in.  And that made me think about us,  - okay, and where we're at, and - Just stop.  I found this in your pocket.  You were gonna move in with me.  So I'm asking you again.  What changed?  You obviously don't want to move in with her.  I just rethought things.  JANE: She's gonna be totally shocked.  - Are you sure? - Trust me, if she thought  she was being proposed to, she wouldn't wear those sweats.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: OMG! Bruce is gonna propose to XO?!  Okay, guys, you remember the plan?  Places!  ROGELIO: Bruce?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh, something tells me this isn't part of the plan.  I went to your office, they told me you were here.  Yeah, now is not a good time.  Listen, I know we've had our ups, and we've had our downs,  but at the end of the day,  you are a really smart guy,  so I have an important question.  Is this the proposal?  Yes! The proposal of a lifetime!  I will do this now  and in front of everyone!  Bruce, you were right all along.  Donnie was sleazy, and I don't want him.  I want you!  He's not on his knee.  I will go down on one knee!  Bruce,  will you be my attorney?  (lively, upbeat music playing)  Well, this is just kismet!  What are the odds?!  (laughs)  BRUCE: Sure, Rogelio.  This wasn't for  Rogelio, was it?  No.  What?  BRUCE: Oh, what the hell.  This isn't how I planned it, but that's life, right?  Curveballs.  I love you so much.  And I love how far we've come.  And I lost you once, and I'm not gonna lose you again.  So,  Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva  will you marry me?  Yes.  - (Jane laughs) - (applause)  - Come on - (shrieking)  (laughs)  And you got a lawyer! Good job.  RAFAEL: So they're engaged?  They sure are.  Hmm. And the rewrite?  Jeremy thought I crushed the new pages.  I got four bangs, three sa-weets,  and two ""killin' it!""  I'm not surprised. I loved it, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I did, too.  Jeremy loved it, Raf loved it.  All the men in your life loved it,  not that you care what we think, but still.  You know, reading it really brought it all back  You know, how we felt,  how I want that again  with someone else.  (sighs)  That's why I broke up with Abbey.  You did?  Yeah.  I just realized we weren't moving in that direction.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh. And here I thought it was what Petra said.  And unfortunately, so did Abbey.  - What's this? - Don't know.  Came for you.    ABBEY: Hi there."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so to review our family tree,  Jane had a son with Rafael, and he was kind of a handful.  So we would like you to get him an aid.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Petra had twin girls with Rafael.  They were kind of perfect.  Which meant that Petra, well,  she was now queen bee of the preschool.  But Petra had other troubles.  For one, ex-employee Scott had died on the beach  in front of the Marbella, and she had   PETRA: I just scooched him over a little bit.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's not all.  She was also hiding this.  - What's this? - Don't know. Came for you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know. Who has a burn book, right?  Well, Scott, obviously.  I know. Straight out of a Telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this. Jane's father, Rogelio,  was estranged from her mother, Xiomara,  because Xo had been portrayed as evil on his reality show.  But Rogelio quit the show in a blaze of glory,  only to be sued.  Luckily, he found himself a lawyer:  Xo's boyfriend, Bruce.  Actually, I mean her fiancÃ©, because this happened.  - Will you marry me? - Yes.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah, relationships change quickly  around here, so pay attention, okay?  They say politics makes strange bedfellows.  You could say the same for prison.  By which I mean when your mutual baby daddy  -  - starts his prison term,  you might find yourselves unexpectedly closer.  You okay?  Yeah, I'll be fine.  It's only nine months.  Totally. It'll fly by.  (sighs)  Petra?  I just really don't want to mess this up.  Ruin them, you know?  You won't ruin them. I promise.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, back then,  in motherhood know-how, Jane clearly dominated.  Mateo, please stop it.  -  - No!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But, oh, how times have changed.  Come on. I have to get to work.  Please don't leave me, Mommy!  No, no, no, no, no!  - Mommy, don't go! - Mateo, please  - I don't want to go! - Please, okay?  I have to leave. You have to let go of me.  Need any help?  No, I'm good. Oh  No, no, no!      JANE: So here's the thing about Mateo.  He has the sweetest side, but  -  - Uh, let me stop you right there.  I like to go in without any preconceptions, you know?  Because if you put something out there,  that's all I'm gonna be able to see.  And I want to be able to pick up what Mateo's putting down.  You know, just discover him myself.  Yeah. Makes sense.  Totally get that.  Then again,  knowledge is power.  - Jane. - Mm-hmm.  Don't stress. Next week, we'll sit down,  I'll tell you what I observed,  it'll all be good.  (chuckles softly)  Maybe I'll just e-mail him.  That way, if he's looking for more context,  he'll already have it in his inbox.  He's a professional. Let's just let him do his thing.  Fine. I'll just write a draft so it's ready to send  in case he changes his mind.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, remember Jorge?  From the gift shop?    And, friends, that's when Jane heard him say  Jorge broke up with his girlfriend!  - He did? - Yes!      Oh, my God, Ma, stop it.  You know you still like him.  Now's your chance. Get in there.  Xiomara    He said the spark died months ago.  He wasn't even upset. He's totally open.    I may have followed him into the gift shop.  What?  I had to buy these. Here, Mom.  They can be your âsomething blue.â  I just got engaged, Jane.  It's a little early for accessorizing.  Come on, Ma.  It's time to make your move.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of making moves  Stop it right there.  I don't recall inviting you in.  I know you're still mad.  Damn straight I'm mad.  But think about it.  I didn't have to tell you  what I did.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To review   (thunder crashes)  Scott's death was ruled an accident.  You never would have known.  The only reason I told you was  because of us.  Come on, Chuck.  I like you.  More than I want to.  I'll think about it.  JANE: And that's how the hedgehog  and the alligator made up.  The end.  - Okay, Mr. Sweetface, good night. - (kisses)  How come you're never at school?  I just wen wand read to your class two weeks ago.  Yeah, but other moms are there more,  like for all the birthdays and special stuff.  I know, but I work.  So does Aunt Petra, and she's the boss,  and she's always there.  Yeah, well, it's not a competition.  Sorry, Mommy, I just really miss you sometimes.  BRUCE: God, you're so cute.  Stop it. I look terrible.  Impossible.  Good morning, future wife.  Good morning, future husband.  (phone chimes)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, you recall Bruce is  -  - representing Rogelio in his  breach-of-contract lawsuit.        Are you regretting his proposal?  No.  Are you regretting mine?  What? Of course not.  Why would you even say that?  Just I heard you up again last night.  How come you're not sleeping?  Uh, I think it's just stress.  I'm nervous about testifying at Rogelio's trial.  Hon, it's gonna be fine.  (phone chimes)  As long as Rogelio figures out  how to dress himself.  Sorry, I know it's more than you signed up for.    PETRA: What are you doing?  I'm room mom.  Oh, uh, yeah.  I know you were last semester,  but you complained about it all the time, so  Oh, I didn't complain, I just stated realistically  the time demands, which I don't think you understand.  I do understand. I can handle being room mom.  - Again, I'm room mom. - Well  WOMAN: There doesn't have to be just one.  Why don't you  do it together?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ha!  Oh, she's serious.  - Um, sounds great. - Yeah, sure.  Hey, uh  So, quick observation.  Impulse-control issues and loves attention,  - even if it's negative attention. - Yeah.  So if we could just fast-track that solution  Yeah. Reward positive behavior, ignore negative behavior.  Even if you feel like you want to scream,  just ignore, ignore, ignore.  Sounds like a plan.  Oh, and, uh, one more thing.  Lice notification.  - Ugh. - MATEO: Ow!  Well, it only hurts because you're squirming.  Ew, don't lick the sink.  I'm cleaning it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, Jane,  ignore negative behavior.  Or super-weird behavior.  Hey, hey, after I check your hair, do you want to check mine?  Good idea!  Yeah!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Nice work, Jane.  Lice are little bugs, right?  Yep. I hope I get them.  No, you don't hope you get them; they're gross.  So you think Hannah L. and Finn are gross?  No, they're not. No one is gross.  And you're good.  Ha, ha, no lice!  Yay! Now I get to check you!  Yep. Come on, buddy.  (grunts playfully)  There it is.  So gentle.  Good job.  Mr. Sweetface?  Hang on.  (scissors snip)  (gasps)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: OMG!  Did he just   Ignore, Jane. Ignore, ignore, ignore!  Mr. Sweetface, why-why don't you go put your pajamas on.  (screaming)  - Whoop-whoop! There's Mateo! - Here's Mateo.  We had quite the night.  Shh, shh. Say bye to Mommy.  Bye, Mommy.  Hee-hee! Mwah!  Boom! Nice.  You've really got to try  not to discuss any issues in front of Mateo.  He'll internalize them.  Well, maybe that's better than forcing me  to externalize them.  He cut my hair.  Whoa. Did you freak?  No, I ignored it, like you said.  That's awesome.  Well, I'm missing half my hair,  so I don't feel as great about it as you do, but Oh.  Morning, Petra.  I'll see you at the room mom meeting.  Mm. Make sure you have reviewed all the initiatives  on our agenda so I don't have to catch you up.  I have a very tight schedule.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, ignore negative behavior.  Mrs. Solano, there are  Not now, Krishna.  Two police in your office.  DENNIS: Some new information  has come to light about the Scott Archuletta case.  Sure.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no, they must know  she moved Scott's bones.  What can you tell us about this?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, I forgot all about  Scott's burn book.  And I think Petra did, too.  How did you get that?  Hi there.  Why did you have it?  Scott left that book in his employee locker  after he was fired.  I obviously didn't want anyone else to have it,  so I kept it safe.  Why didn't you hand it over when he was found dead?  Because you guys told me it was an accident,  so I didn't think it was relevant.  But, look, I was just trying  to spare my employees any embarrassment.  I mean, there's gossip in there about all the  Well, I-I'm sure you've read it.  We did.  He talked a lot about a guy  named J.P. Who's that?  I have no idea.  There's also a page missing.  And?  Did you remove it?  No, I didn't.  Do I need a lawyer?  I don't know. Do you?  Well, I was accounted for during the time of his death,  so I don't appreciate these accusations.  We need to get in touch with your sister.  Good luck. I haven't spoken to her in three years.  (door opens)  XIOMARA: There's no way it will end well.  (sighs) Don't be dramatic.  You and Petra? Co-room moms?  We're adults, we'll be fine.  Hey, Abuela.  Mm.  What's wrong?        Oh, Abuela  XIOMARA: Wait a minute.  When you say you went for it, what does that mean?  Wh-What was your move?  Now, these pirate shot glasses  are very well-made.  (sultry jazz music playing)    (scoffs) Ma, that's nothing!    Agreed, but there are steps in between.      Okay, so let's change that.  - A sexy dress - Oh.  Some heels, a little makeup.  Come on,  you've been in the friend zone too long.  Trust me.  When Jorge sees you next, he's gonna say  RAFAEL: Oh, my God.  PETRA: It must have been Abbey.  Uh, she walked in when I was hiding his burn book.  I was just  trying to keep it out of the wrong hands.  It was obviously a mistake.  (sighs)  Come on. Where's Zen Rafael, hmm?  Zen Rafael really doesn't want to be caught up  in covering a crime.  Petra, I have been to prison.  I don't want to go back.  I know. You won't.  (sighs)  I'm really sorry. Okay?  But this is all me. I messed up.  (sighs)  And Chuck knows?  Only about the bones.  But he hasn't said anything.  Yet.  It's time.  Are you ready for Sunday Funday, Matelio?!  Yes!  So what's the adventure this afternoon?  Sushi? Mani-pedis?  Well, my well-trusted counselor, Bruce, didn't like  my court wardrobe choices,  so we're gonna get fitted for bespoke suits.    Downscale and very humble bespoke suits, of course.  And Grandma's getting a dress, too!  Oh, terrific.  What are you thinking?  Black and tight.  For a wedding?  No, for my mom's Jorge makeover.  ROGELIO: Got it.  Are you ready to go, Matelio?  Adventure awaits, yes! (grunts)  (chuckles)  (giggles, sighs)  Everything okay, Mom?  Yeah, totally. Why?  Well, for someone planning a wedding,  you don't seem that into planning a wedding.  (sighs)  Jane, I don't know what's wrong with me.  I mean, I really love him.  But?  I just feel nervous and I don't know why.  I mean, things are good.  Not passionate like in the beginning  It can't always be like that.  Exactly. That's what I keep telling myself.  This is what happens in relationships,  and I'm just not used to it  because I've never stayed in one long enough.  - Exactly. - And I self-sabotage, too.  This might just be that.  And so, I don't want to overreact  and ruin something really good.  Really great.  True.  But maybe you shake things up a little.  Try to get that spark back.  You want to be sure.  ROGELIO: I have never been so sure in my life.  So normal.  Strikes the right balance between credible and gullible.  What do you think of yours, Matelio?  I look pretty good.  Never settle for good. Only great.  How can we make it great?  It's a little itchy.  Let's line it. Thai silk, please.  So, are you excited about Abuela's wedding?  Will she have a bouncy house?  Probably not.  As long as she's happy, though.  Do you think your Abuela is happy?  Uh, with Bruce?  I don't know.  (sighs)  I don't know either, Matelio.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also hoping for the best  Did you do something to your hair?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, me.  With this whole co-room mom thing.  Just thinned it out a little. Should we get down to business?  Yes, let's first divide up responsibilities.  So, I have a format for the weekly newsletter,  so I'll just keep sending that out.  Um, we have Spring Sing coming up,  so you can be in charge of photocopying the programs  and I'll M.C. the event. Okay?  - Well - Now, onto the drop-off situation.  I'm already hiring  a parking attendant. So, if you wouldn't mind  just setting up the traffic cones in the morning,  I'll greet.  So, Petra,  I can't help but notice that you are giving me  all the grunt work and yourself all the glory work.  This is about the kids, Jane, not the glory.  Okay, well, I don't even agree with some of these decisions.  For the kids.  Like what?  For one, I don't think we need to hire a parking attendant.  That seems kind of wasteful.  Waste-Wasteful?  What, to protect our children from speeding cars?  We can ask for parent volunteers.  - Here we go. - I'm just saying that  it is possible to deal with a kids' issue  without just hiring help.  Well, this is why we hold fundraisers, Jane.  I mean, where do you think the money  for the new reading nook came from?  Well, actually, that hasn't been  officially designated a reading nook.  Oh, now you're against reading. (chuckles)  (scoffs) I just think that  we can use a bigger indoor art space,  since the kids aren't reading independently yet.  The girls started last week.  In French.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: TouchÃ©,  Mademoiselle Solano.  Should we move onto lice?  Yes! This obviously requires urgent action.  So, uh, why don't you just start by telling me  what you have against hiring Hair Bears,  a professional company, to do lice checks?  - Well, again, the expense. - So what do you want,  parent volunteers for that, too?  Yes, I do, actually.  Okay, great, thanks for volunteering as Lice Mom.  Okay, you know what? Working together was  somewhat challenging for the two of us.  We just have different visions.  Both valid.  Totally. I just love so many of her ideas.  - Love. - Ditto.  No, it's just, uh  A little cumbersome having to make  all these bipartisan decisions.  So, we were thinking, why not have a runoff?  The kids can see democracy in action.  This time, free from Russian intervention.  Oh  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ugh. Don't remind me.  Okay. Just keep it friendly.  - Of course. - We're family.  - So, serious? - No.  Sounds good.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Get ready, folks.  - (triumphant fanfare playing) -   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, where were we? Ah, yes.  The race for room mom.  Okay, so they are skeptical about not backing the incumbent,  but they do care about cubby hierarchy.  Great. Thanks.    Hi, ladies.  CAROLINE: Jane.  Hi. Funny, we were just talking about the election.  I know, it's crazy, right?  Trust me, we wanted to do it together,  we just have such different visions, you know?  About where we want to take the school.  (patriotic music playing) What behaviors  we want to reinforce.  What values we as a community stand for.  Plus, the cubby situation.  I'm sorry, that was petty. I should go high.  No, it's an issue. (scoffs)  Petra's friends get all the cubbies on top,  so they don't have to kneel down all the time  to clear out the art projects.  We'll do rotating cubbies.  Every three months, the kids will change.  But won't that confuse them?  No. If anything,  it'll reinforce name recognition.  And I'll make little removable decals  that'll make it easy for them to switch around.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh.  Looks like they're leaning teal.  (mom gasps, screams)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh. They're going coral.  Oh, my God! Thank you, Petra.  Bad news: she's trying to buy votes  by handing out spa gift cards.  Get over to the east side before she gets to anyone there.  I'll hold down the base here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no.  Not another close election, please.  I can't take the stress.  (whimsical music playing)  Sorry, I just had to go to my happy place for a second.  Ladies, hi.    We're having a little promotion at our spa.  Thought I'd spread the fun.  Oh Jane, isn't that Mateo's aide coming?  (chuckles)  Hey, you want to show your mommy  what you did today, buddy?  This is you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yikes. That kid is not an artist.  But it could be worse.  It's you, Mommy.  Oh.  ELLIE: A dragon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: See? That's worse.  Ready to go to martial arts?  - Mm-hmm. - Yeah.  (chuckles): Oh.  He clearly thinks you should rock the hair.  (laughs) Yeah, that's not me.  Well, not now, but like I tell Mateo,  people pick up what you're putting down.  ""You know, rock it, and suddenly you're âEdgy Janeâ""  Yeah, okay.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Translation.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow.  Hello, Edgy Jane.    Work it.  What can I get you?  Surprise me.  I mean, his voice was still changing,  so I wouldn't exactly say he's Mr. Right.  But it made me think.  You know, you get what you put out.  And I guess I've just been projecting  this kind of Miss Havisham vibe out into the world ever since  you know.  Well, I don't know who that is,  but if you mean âhands off, I've got cobwebs down there,â  then, yeah,  that's the vibe you've been throwing.  Come on, Ma.  Cobwebs?  Figure of speech.  So, are you ready, you think?  To start dating?  No. Definitely not.  My grief group said that I wouldn't be ready  until I can get through the whole story of Michael's death  without tearing up, and well, you saw me at the reading.      Huh?  No. He won't.  You look beautiful!  See?  Aw.  BRUCE: I'm glad she felt good.  You hungry? What should we order?  Nothing.  Let's get drunk and go play pool.  What? Just, seeing my mom  all gussied up made me realize  that we haven't been out in forever.  Let's do something fun.  I'm in.  Okay, I'm buzzed.  And that means it's time for me to defend my title,  best drunk pool player in Miami.  Uh, I don't want to go out anymore.  I want to do something else.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Mm  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of sexy  Alba.  You-you look    Uh  (yells) Oh, my God!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, not the OMG Alba was going for.  - XIOMARA: Is she mad? - (Alba groans)    I mean, she's not happy.  Oh. Should I come over?  Can I get you anything, Abuela?    No.    - Maybe just give it a day. - (door slams)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oof, Alba's breathing fire.  RAFAEL: Girls were already asleep.  They were exhausted.  What are you doing?  Just strategizing for the election.  Oh, you guys are crazy.  Oh, you have me down as a vote for Jane?  Come on.  What?  You've always been on Jane's side.  Since you met her.  That was a long time ago.  Things have changed.  Really?  Yes.    So I'm abstaining.  (chuckles softly)  It's only fair.  So no change? She's still mad?  More embarrassed.  Don't worry, she'll get over it, eventually.  Now, tell me more about your night with Bruce.  It was amazing?  So amazing.  But?  But I don't know.  I still feel weird.  And it's not Bruce, it's me.  Yeah. Papa doesn't know if you're happy with him.  What?  (clicks tongue)  What?  No winking.  Flirting with the jury is pretty frowned upon.  Sorry, it was just instinct.  Let's take your testimony from the top.  (ringtone playing)  Ah, it's Xiomara.  Hello?  How dare you?!  You have no right to talk about my relationship  with Bruce to Mateo.  What could possibly possess you  to talk to a four-year-old about this?!  - I wasn't - Are you a four-year-old? Is that it?  I mean, what if Mateo had repeated that  in front of him?  I can't say.  Exactly!  Because you don't think.  (line beeps)  Your fiancÃ©e says hi.  RAFAEL: Are you mad?  No, of course not.  You should be neutral.  (chuckles): You're so mad.  I just thought you'd vote for me because my ideas  are genuinely better, but, hey, abstaining is fine, too.  I can see my path to victory  without the Rafael Solano firewall.  (chuckles)  PETRA: Chardonnay!  For everyone.  (laughter)  Call you back.  Hi there, everyone.  Petra. What's going on?  Oh, I just thought I'd get the girls together.  While I'm working?  I don't know your whole schedule.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Then again, she makes the schedule.  So, uh, can I get you another round? On the house.  Yes, my house.  (laughter)  You know what?  Everything looks like it's under control here.  I'll join you.  Yeah.  So, Virginia  Let me just, yeah.  I was thinking about what you were saying  about the birthday snack situation  Oh, oh, it's okay, we can talk about it later.  And besides, the snack situation has been handled.  Okay, great! So does that mean  that we're going completely nut-free?  Because that's what everybody wants.  I've been doing this for two years, Jane.  I believe I know what everybody wants.  Oh, I'm just saying that new ideas could improve things.  Okay, you want to have a debate right here?  - Kind of. - Okay. Let's go.    My vision for the room is clear.  To keep things under control, as I have for the past two years.  You keep talking about the past.  I want to focus on the future of our room.  I want it inclusive, optimistic  (clears throat)  Candidates, again the question was:  what improvements do you support for the playground?  Ms. Villanueva?  Yes, of course.  We clearly need a new surface for under the jungle gym.  My plan is to return to sand.  It's inexpensive, natural.  It's what we grew up with.  And definitely no wall.  Ms. Solano, a rebuttal?  Rubber mulch.  It's the only way to go.  It's cleaner, safer for falls, and we can choose  a bright color to go with the jungle gym.  There she goes again, trying to distract us  from the real issue.  Excuse me, I didn't interrupt you.  - Because I was making sense! - Okay. As you can see,  my opponent clearly doesn't have the temperament.  Ms. Villanueva, you will be given time to respond.  I'm sorry.  But what Petra's not telling us is that rubber mulch  is an expense we don't need to incur.  And for all we know,  she's in the pockets of Big Rubber.  It is a proven fact that animals  go to the bathroom in the sand.  Do you want our kids playing in squirrel feces?  Squirrel feces? Is that true?  No, it's not.  Petra is using scare tactics.    Okay, Jane, why don't we get sand,  so Mateo can throw it in kids' eyes.  - Mateo wouldn't do that. - Oh, no. Of course. What am I thinking?  I guess his preferred instrument of terror is scissors.  You know, maybe if  you disciplined him more, you wouldn't  have to pretend that awful haircut was intentional.  Well, maybe if you disciplined your kids less,  they wouldn't think you're a terrifying dragon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so who won?  Hey, Dad.  How'd it go with Mr. Sweetface?  Well, we were running lines for my testimony,  and then he just passed out in the middle of my big monologue.  What's wrong?  I just got into a big fight with Petra  in front of everybody.  She just, she knows how to get under my skin.  Well, you two do have the hallmarks of a classic rivalry.  What?  It's textbook Telenovela.  The rich versus poor, blonde versus brunette  Czech versus American.  I just thought we were past it.  I mean, her kids are perfect.  They know how to read. They never cry.  They're great. There's no competition.  I'm the one that's struggling.  I'm the one that has to do this for Mateo.  What do you mean?  Uh, he he wants me to be around school more,  doing stuff like this.  Come on.  He's four.  I bet if you ask him  if he'd rather you be a room mom  or, I don't know, eat chocolate,  he'd choose chocolate.  (chuckles) So you're saying it's more about me?  The best rivalries are not about the rival.  They're about the insecurities  that your rival brings out in you.  Preferably in the fifth act.  Is that why you trash-talked Bruce to Mateo?  Okay, look, it's hard to watch your mom get married,  I'll admit it.  But that was an honest mistake.  I never had  a meaningful relationship with a kid.  The closest I came was with my eight-year-old costar  in El Vaquerito.  But that kid turned out to be a backstabbing diva  who conveniently always had nap time when it got to my coverage.  Okay, but you can't tell Mateo everything.  I know. But it's just because I'm so happy  to finally have the kind of bond I have with Matelio  that I always wanted with my own non-you child.  I know.  And you'll have another kid, Dad.  Yeah. Well, maybe.  It's funny. So much has changed.  In a lot of ways,  my relationship with Matelio has filled that void.  It doesn't feel like  a deal-breaker for me anymore.  That was a long time ago.  PETRA: Look, I know it was a long time ago,  but I can't help it.  Jane just makes me feel like a bad mom  who has to ask stupid questions,  like how to deal with diaper rash.  Well, then you just have to remind yourself  that you're no longer that person.  I mean, you're the dragon.  You saw the picture?  It's so embarrassing.  What are you talking about?  They clearly think I'm scary.  No. No, they think you're a dragon  because last week, when they were having nightmares,  I told them they had nothing to be scared of  because they lived with the fiercest woman I know.  You protect everyone around you.  Like a dragon.  Really?  That's how I see you.  You're extraordinary, Petra.  The way you handled everything when I went to prison.  The girls, the hotel.  You are the only person I know  who could have handled all of that.  Thank you.  I needed that.  (laughs softly)  Can I admit something?  Hmm?  I hate being room mom.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here.  - Now  - Can we talk?  - (Gwen claps) - Okay!  Election day!  Shall we take our room mom vote?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes!  Please, get it over with.  Actually, can I say something first, if that's all right?  I just wanted to say,  I think it's obvious that there is one person  much more qualified to be room mom.  And that's why  I'm with her.  Oh. N-No, it's fine.  Actually, you can be room mom, Jane.  No, but you're much better suited than I am.  No, no.  - But this is something you really want. - No.  - And I've already done it twice. - Oh, my God, no.  - So it's your turn now. - I couldn't even take  No, really, I insist!  I'm sorry, uh (chuckles nervously)  Can you just give us a minute?  Oh.  - What are you doing? - I don't want to be room mom.  I realized it's not important to Mateo, so I want out.  No, no, no, I want out. I was just doing it  because I was insecure about being a good parent.  You?  - Yes! - I'm insecure.  Now you want to fight about who's more insecure?!  No, what I want is  to end this stupid rivalry about parenting.  Come on, it's hard enough.  So, what will it be, ladies?  Who is our new room mom?  Uh oh, God.  (patriotic music playing)  -  - Thank you so much for voting.  Cheers. Oh!  Hi!  Mwah!  XIOMARA: Rafael?  The people have spoken.  How about you?  Any epiphanies about getting married?  (sighs)  Well, I don't want to add to your doubts, but  I feel like I have to tell you something,  because it might  make things clearer for you.  Or less clear, I don't know.  What are you talking about?  Dad told me something.  The kid thing?  It's not a deal-breaker for him anymore.  Wh-What do you mean?  He feels like Mateo  has kind of filled that role in his life.  And I think he still has feelings for you.  And I don't know why I'm telling you this,  except I feel like you should know  because you're making such a big decision.  BRUCE: And how did this reality show  affect your relationship with, uh, Mr. De La Vega?  Try not to fidget so much.  The jury won't trust you.  Okay, sorry, go.  It destroyed it.  Completely.  I was devastated.  We didn't talk for two years.  He was such a huge part of my life,  and I missed my friend.  I really missed my friend.  BRUCE: But you weren't  together at the time.  It didn't break up a relationship.  Together or not, he was one of the most important people  in my life.  There wasn't one day that went by  that I didn't think about him.  Um  Even though we weren't together, you're correct.  Wow, wow, wow, what an amazing performance.  I-I totally bought it.  Yeah.  I totally bought it, too.  All right, one week down.  First, let me say, Mateo is an awesome kid.  Like I said, he's pretty hyperactive,  and he has issues with impulse control.  So, we're gonna work on slowing down in general  and making smart choices.  And now's your chance. Hit me up with his history.  Anything relevant you think I should know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, you're up, Jane.  Okay. His history.  (sighs)  So, when Mateo was 18 months old,  my husband died, his stepfather.  Pretty much out of the blue.  Well, he had been shot first, but, still, he recovered.  Only not fully.  He didn't pass his physical.  Uh, he had to keep his blood pressure down,  but after he died, the doctors said it was pretty much  a freak thing.  Uh, an aortic dissection.  So no one could've predicted it.  Anyway, after that, I was I was pretty much a mess.  For the first month, I mostly stayed in bed.  What?  You told the story about Michael without crying.  Oh, my God.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God.  Whoa.  Yeah.  So he's had some trauma.  I am so sorry.  But you should know, Mateo shows no sign of trauma.  He has a really strong, secure attachment  to both of you.  He's happy. He's not anxious.  I mean, his issues are normal kid stuff.  It's just the way he's wired.  (exhales)  (voice breaking): So he's not scarred?  Really? I mean, in, like,  your professional opinion?  Nope, no sign of that.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, there are the tears.  But still, they're different tears.  So he's not acting out because  I went to prison when he was two-ish?  What? Whoa.  Mind blown.  Yeah, for nine months.  I mean, he, um visited,  but he was old enough to feel abandoned.  No abandonment issues.  Dude, you're his hero.  (sighs)  (sniffles)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow.  Now everyone's crying.  You're damn right I'm upset!  Well, not him. He seems more mad.  The cops just came by, wanting to know  if I knew anything about a book that you took from the dead guy.  I know. That's why I've been calling you.  Look, I-I had the book separately  And what's with the missing page?  I don't know anything about that.  - And I don't believe you! - Calm down!  - Don't tell me to calm down! - Hey.  I think you should go.  Before I call security.  Thank you for believing me.  I don't.  Where's the missing page?  JANE: And then I told him.  The whole story about Michael, and I didn't cry once.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, you cried after.  - Wow. - I know.  So what does that mean?  Are you ready to date?  I don't know.  But I'm definitely ready to start thinking about it.  Mom, hi.  I've been waiting to talk to you. I know you're mad,  and I'm sorry I pushed you too far with Jorge.  I just love that you took my advice and      (laughter)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.  Looks like things are definitely  changing around here.  Everything's different now.  Everything's changed.  The stuff your dad said about you isn't true.  Plus, he's not even your dad.    Still hurts to read.  I know.  That's why I ripped out the page.  What?  See?  You're the dragon.  Protecting everyone.  You're the only one who sees me like that.  I, uh, can't do this.  I can't go to court like this.  What's wrong?  What's wrong is  what happened the other night.  During your prep, when you were talking about Rogelio.  Do you still have feelings for him, Xiomara?  I don't know.  Okay, then.  I'm sorry.  (softly): Yeah.  Hello, hello!  It's another beautiful day   To win a lawsuit!   Go, Team Rogelio!  (laughs)  So, are you ready to make everyone  fall in love with me, buddy?  We shouldn't do this.  I know.  But I really want to.  So do I.    (Petra moaning)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like I said:  politics makes strange bedfellows."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You guys, so much to talk about.  First, Jane and Raf.  They had a son named Mateo, who was quite a handful.  So we would like you to get him an aide.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So they got him one.  Also in need of a helping hand: Jane's father, Rogelio.  See. He quit his reality show.  And he' being sued.  And his lawyer?  Well, that would be Xo's fiancÃ©, Bruce.  Or at least he was her fiancÃ©, until  Do you still have feelings for Rogelio?  I don't know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know.  Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Which brings me to Raf's other baby mama, Petra,  and her twin sister, Anezka.  See, Anezka used to date Scott,  but Scott turned up dead, and Anezka's gone missing.  We need to get in touch with your sister.  Good luck. I haven't spoken to her in three years.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Luckily, Detective Dennis was on it.  You remember Dennis, right?  Used to be Michael's partner? Anyway, he noticed  Petra was acting all shady, which she was,  partly because she moved Scott's bones  off her property line and over to the Fairwick.  Unfortunately, that was her boyfriend  Chuck's hotel, and he was pissed.  And then, well, this happened.  I know.  OMG, right?  Oh, and did I mention?  Alba's longtime crush, Jorge, had finally asked her out.  So, yeah.  Things are getting hot up in here.  It should be noted that Jane Gloriana Villanueva  had been passionately in love  with exactly three men in her life.  The first was (record scratches)  Actually, I'm not ready to introduce him yet.  We'll get there.  The second, of course, was Michael.  Then Rafael.  Then Michael again.  And then  well, Jane's life became very much not about romantic love.    But three years, six months and 42 days later  she finally felt open.  Or at least open to being open.        (sighs)  - Oy! - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  It certainly was.      I mean  yeah, a little.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Certainly more than  the coffee stain on the tablecloth yesterday.  (chuckles)  (door opens)  Morning, Mom. How you feeling?  I'm okay.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You'll recall  Xiomara had just broken up with Bruce.  Okay. Well, let us know  if you need anything.  (door closes)  So, what do you think about the dress? I can return it.    Yeah?      MATEO: Mommy! Mommy!  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He doesn't. - Where's my raincoat?      (stomps) I need it for show-and-tell,  and it has indoor pockets.  Mommy said she'd find it!  Calm down, Mateo.  I've looked for it everywhere,  and it's not here, but I will find it  and drop it off, okay? I promise.  Now go get yourself dressed.  Mommy has to get to work,  and Abuela's gonna drop you off at school.  Why do you look so nice?  (chuckles)  Why, thank you, Mateo.  Just a good mood today.  (growls)  (sighs)          Abuela!  Mm-hmm.  (giggles)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, it was as though  the world suddenly became brighter.  Cuatro   Cool like that   Cool like   Cool like that   Cool like   -  Cool  -  Hola, papi   You wanna licky my ice cream   -  Cool like that  - Como aqua para chocolata   Cool like that   You're the whiskers of the kitty cat   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, things are looking up.      So, yeah, like Alba said,  love is in the air.  Or, at least, it was last night.  I just texted the nannies to take the girls to school.  That's great.  - Mm. - Uh, hey,  so last night was  A onetime thing.  We were both drunk.  Feeling low.  Exactly. (sighs)  It's not gonna happen again, so let's just  - Yeah. - Move on, yeah?  No need to tell anyone.  - Especially Jane. - Agreed.  It's just, my-my clothes are in the living room.  Oh.  Hey, Raf,  it's me.  Uh, Jane! H-Hang on!  Uh, coming.  Don't worry, I'm just grabbing something for Mateo  before I start my shift. And  I have coffee. (chuckles)  So, what do you need of Mateo's?  I'm happy to just grab it.  JANE: His yellow raincoat. He needs it for show-and-tell.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.  That's more show than tell.  Good morning, Jane.  Do you mind?  RAFAEL: Jane, listen, come on. Hey, Jane.  That was just, it was a, it was a mutually  - agreed upon mistake, okay? - No, I know what that was.  - Really, it's none of my business. - It won't happen again.  You don't have to tell me.  Can we just, can we just not talk about it?  Yep. Never sounds good to me.  - Great. - Mm-hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, look who got dressed.  Oh, God, not again.        What now?  We're here to offer you a deal.      Why would I need a deal?  I already told you everything I know about Scott's burn book.  And I was accounted for the night he disappeared.  We know you moved his bones.  By bones, you mean?  His skeleton.  Got a statement from Chuck Chesser,  who says you told him you, quote,  âScootched them over.â  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Dana! That's her name.  I knew it started with a âD.â  Now, we can charge you with  tampering with evidence, but we won't,  if you help us find your sister.  I already told you we haven't, we haven't spoken in years.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, it's so sad  when families grow apart  after one sister paralyzes the other.  Well, get in touch.  But why do you, um, want to question her?  DANA: We've been interviewing people  mentioned in the burn book, and one remembered  Anezka and Scott in a screaming match  the night he disappeared.  And who is this witness?  Just find your sister.  JANE: Ah, found it.  Ah, thank God. 'Cause the little dude  really wanted to show everyone that raincoat.  (sighs) Is there a story about it?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: There is now.  No idea. What happened?  Skateboarding accident.  Ooh.  Damn, mama.  Look at you in that dress.  (chuckles) I was just trying to mix things up.  There's no try, there's only do.  And you're doing it.  All day long!  (chuckles)  JANE: I think he was flirting with me.  I mean, it was subtle, but  (clicks tongue) Not even that subtle.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now, that's what I call flirting.                        (sighs)  Hello. Welcome.      Are you sure you're ready to listen?    I was saying that I think  Mateo's aide is flirting with me.        I know, and I'm not quite sure what to do ooh.  (sighs)        I know.  And if it happens again, I'll shut it down.  You okay, Mom?  Y-Yeah.  I just feel bad for hurting Bruce.  He's been so great.  But you couldn't marry him.  You know, not if you still have feelings for  (door opens, Rogelio yodels)  Remember not to mention Bruce or the breakup  until the court case is over.  I don't want things to be awkward.  ROGELIO: Can I just say,  I love Bruce so much!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Too late.  He got the reality show to settle,  so as soon as we agree on a number,  I'll be free and clear, which is a good thing,  because  drumroll, please.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, sorry.  (drumroll plays)  I got the offer for my new telenovela,  so I'm formally inviting you all to the first day of shooting.  Ah, we wouldn't miss it.    And Bruce, too, of course.  Is everything okay with him, by the way?  Yeah, he's great.  Because he hasn't been returning my texts.  Oh, well, I'm sure he's just busy with other cases.  So, what's the next step in the novela?  A very important special effects test  with the network bigwigs.      DIRECTOR: Cut.  Wow, that is looking so realistic.  Agreed. So realistic.  And you, your charisma leaps off the screen  even at a quarter inch tall.  Thank you. So often, I'm the big man in the room,  so Los Viajes de Guillermo, it's a refreshing change.        Not to be paranoid, but you are absolutely certain  that your paperwork will be signed  by the time we start shooting?  - 100% sure. - (sighs)  Beyond a shadow of a doubt.  Great. That's what we wanted to hear.    Well what do you think?  It's perfect.  ALEX: Little man.  Tell Mommy what you drew.  It's a mouse going to the doctor,  like in the story we read.  Well, I love it, and I can't wait to hear the story.  (gasps, mutters)  He sat there for 20 minutes. Great focus.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  that's when Jane's radar went off.  (whirring, beeping)        -  - (alarm buzzing)  Alex, uh, listen, you're great,  but this is strictly a professional relationship.  Anything else would be inappropriate.  So I just want to make that really clear  that this isn't gonna happen.  What isn't gonna happen?  Oh, nothing.  - Oh, hold on. - It was really nothing.  - You thought that I with you? - Just a miscommunication.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or a radar malfunction of epic proportions.  For the record, I am not into you at all.  Good. Great.  Yeah, glad that we cleared that up.  How much did you see?  You mean, did I see the part where you shut Alex down  for flirting with you, or the part  where he had no idea what you were talking about?  - Okay, okay, stop. - Uh, you better not touch me,  'cause I might get the wrong idea.  Abuela told me that if  he was flirting with me, I should shut it down.  And apparently, my radar's a little off.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Way off, in fact.  Let me show you what really happened earlier.    -  Cuatro  -  Cool like that   Cool like   Cool like that   Cool like, cool   Hola, papi, you wanna licky my ice cream?   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, let's not tell Jane about that last one.  Okay, you know what? We're going out tonight.  What?  Clearly, this whole Alex fiasco was a cry for help.  You cannot keep getting advice from your abuela.  I'm gonna help you get your flirt on.  - No, absolutely not. - I'll see you tonight in the lounge.  - Not happening. - 7:00 p.m.  - No! - ROGELIO: Yes.  Look right here!  There's a run in my stocking, and, also, my pantaloons  are hitting the middle of my calf!  I am really sorry.  I'm just stressed.  You should be allowed to enjoy fitting me.  Please, continue. Above my calf.    (knocking)  There they are!  My favorite network executives.  And there's our favorite star.  WOMAN: So, listen, we want  to beef up the love story a little,  add some complications, maybe a sizzling hot co-star.  Are you cool with that?  The hotter and sexier, the better!  (laughter) Great.    RAFAEL: You have to relax.  I can't. This is ridiculous.  This is a kids hotel.  You would be surprised how many  divorcÃ©e hookups we have here at happy hour.  Last week, we caught a couple in the pirate ship.  - JANE: Ugh. - RAFAEL: Shoot.  What?  Petra just walked in.  I kind of got a weird vibe from her earlier  when I went by her office to go over some stuff.  After what happened last night, when we had sex    Well, I just I'm worried she might have feelings for me.  Of course she has feelings for you.  She was in love with you for forever.  That's why you shouldn't have slept with her.  It was incredibly stupid.  Shh.  - What are you two doing here? - Nothing.  Just helping Jane get her flirt on.  She's a little rusty.  - Here? - It's not a big deal.  This is a kids hotel.  Those guys look single.  - Ew. - Seriously?  You should go to the Fairwick.  It's a total meat market during happy hour.  - Actually, I'm going home. - No, you are not.  Come on. The Fairwick. Let's go.  Perfect. I'll join you.  (loud, upbeat music playing)  Okay, what about him?  JANE: The guy in the tank top? Are you serious?  He's got a good body, a handsome face.  Okay, then you date him.  RAFAEL: Hoodie, three o'clock.  - Mr. Robot? - Okay, who do you like, then?  It doesn't matter, because no one's looking.  Because it looks like you two are together.  Look, we have to make it clear  that Jane is the third wheel here.  Come here, Rafael.  Now I'm gonna put my head here.  Great.  Look over there.  Tall drink of water, blue shirt, cute,  and he's looking at you.  Turn slowly.  JANE: He is cute.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Agreed.  Maintain eye contact.  Smile.  Tone it down.  Flirting is like perfume; a little dab will do.  Well?  (whirring, beeping)          -  - (alarm buzzing)  PETRA: Perfect.  Go. Go!  I can do this.    Mm.  It's nice to see Jane getting back out there, isn't it?  (whirring, beeping)          -  - (alarm buzzing)  Look, Petra, I want to be really straightforward.  Uh  What happened last night  -  - was a mistake.  What?  You're obviously into me  No, I'm not.  Jane isn't here, okay?  You don't have to be this close.  And earlier, when I stopped by your office,  and you moved closer  Yes, because I didn't want you reading my e-mails.  And also,  if you must know, Chuck is across the room,  and I'm trying to make him jealous.  What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, shoot.  I missed him, too. My bad.  - Oh. - Mm-hmm.  After everything he did to me,  telling the cops about the bones,  I want to make him miserable.  So just get over yourself and play along, okay?  -  - (alarm buzzing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let's move elsewhere, shall we?  (Jane laughing)  -  - (alarm buzzing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, that's better.  You have a great laugh.  Thank you.  So, Jane Villanueva,  soon to be published author,  why are you still single?  I thought somebody would have scooped you up by now.  Oh, um, well,  I was scooped up, but then my husband died.  (trombone plays âwah-wahâ)  No, but, I mean, I'm, like, almost totally fine.  That was, like, three years ago, so it's like, pshh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: OMG, I can't watch anymore.  PETRA: I think he's watching. Sell it.  Really? That's the best you can do?  Oh, Zen Rafael hasn't forgotten his moves, has he?  No.  He hasn't.  And I am sure  that you haven't forgotten my moves either.  It's all a blur.  Paris isn't a blur.  No, that's, um  hard to forget.  I agree.  Especially  when I  (whispering indistinctly)  (Petra chuckles)  That seems like a million years ago in some ways.  And in other ways  I know.  Damn it, this isn't working.  He doesn't even care.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, that was pretty intense.  I was actually starting to feel it.  And it looks like Rafael was, too.  Why am I even doing this?  I mean, I'm obviously out of his league. Right?  Honestly, I don't know what I even saw in him.  I think it was about self-punishment  more than anything else, because the truth is  that I was honestly just embarrassed  to be seen with him the entire time we were dating.  Petra?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, rough night for these three.  No one got any, but it's still a walk of shame.  Or, actually  JANE: It was awkward and awful.  And I don't know what I was thinking.  I have met exactly  zero people in my life at a singles bar.            Thanks, Abuela.        We're back on Jorge.          Wait, what?            I find that hard to believe.  But if you're worried, you should just  talk to Jorge about it.      Course you can. Come on.  You're a  semi-modern woman, Abuela.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.                                      ROGELIO: Do you have a second?  I went by your house  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no. Was Bruce home?  - And Bruce wasn't home. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Phew!  But it's weird, Xo, 'cause  I can't get him to return my calls,  he's barely responding to my texts.  Tell me, did I do something to offend him?  Did you forget to say âGod bless youâ  after he sneezed?  No, I don't think so.  - I'm sure Bruce is just busy. - It's just that the settlement talks  are coming up and this silence is giving me a bad feeling.  Will you ask him? I don't want to be all needy,  but if something's wrong, I'd like to know.  DENNIS: I want to know.  Well, it was okay  until I told him I was a widow.  I wouldn't say he ran away.  Well, he's an idiot then.  Make sure to follow through with your right hand.  Uh-huh. Got it.  I mean, dating would be so much easier  if people already knew.  Tell me about it.  What do you mean? One of the joys of being engaged  is that you don't have to worry about dating.  Lindsay and I broke up a few months ago.  What?  Why didn't you mention it?  She cheated on me.  Yeah, so  didn't want to brag.  Eh, I'm sorry.  You okay?  Yeah.  Better to know now than later, right?  (sighs) Yeah.  Well punch through the bag.  Ah!  You know, you might be better at boxing than I am,  but I would kick your ass at a story-writing competition.  (laughs)  Not a sport.  Eh  Mini-golf, I'd crush you.  - Yeah? - Yeah.  Oh, not bad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. Hold on a second.  Are Jane and Dennis  flirting with each other?  Nah.  Wait.  Maybe.  Let me check.  (beeping)          -  - (alarm buzzing)  - Okay, either my radar is off, too, - (giggling)  or this is happening, people.  A vibe? With you and Dennis?  I think.  Maybe.  Then again, I thought Alex was super into me, too, so  That's why I need you to go boxing with me next week.  - What? - To suss it out.  You owe me.  - Just text him. - What?  - No. - Why?  We don't just text.  That's the point.  He'll either encourage you or he won't.  But either way, you'll know.  Mm  Didn't you just tell your grandma to be a modern woman?    Oh, that's a nice touch with the ellipses,  makes it seem super casual.  -  - (gasps)  Oh, my God, he's writing me back already.  He's probably thinking of a nice way to tell me to back off.  Oh, my God, he's insulted.  - What? - I've actually insulted him.  He's thinking, âI should just ignore her. â      See?  Okay, now just wait a minute before you    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. We may have just witnessed  the beginning of a new romance.  And, sadly, here we are now at the end of one.  No, you keep the cappuccino maker.  You take more pleasure in it than I ever could.  Okay, so that's it.  Bruce, I just wanted to say,  if it's too hard for you to represent Rogelio,  you don't have to.  I'm a big boy, Xiomara, I can handle it.  What?  I just want to make sure that you're not letting our breakup  get in the way of his case.  What do you mean?  Well, Rogelio says  that you haven't been returning his texts.  He's starting to get a little worried.  Hold on.  Are you asking me to be nicer to the guy that you left me for?  - No, I-I'm just - Because let me assure you,  I am acting like a professional.  I'm treating Rogelio like I treat every other client.  No, I don't respond within ten seconds to his texts.  No, I don't reassure him and hold his hand  every time he contacts me.  But I'm doing my job.  You're right. I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have overstepped.  And I shouldn't feel badly, right?  I am clearly out of Chuck's league, right?    Then why do I feel like this?  Like I-I  like I want to see him?  I know, I know, I know, you think I still like him.  And maybe I do.  But I don't want to.  Not that it matters.  I mean, the heart wants what the heart wants.  And the truth is, I did say  some pretty lousy things to him.  I mean, you can imagine, you know how I get  when I'm heated. (chuckles)  I should probably apologize, right?  Thanks, Krishna.  My pleasure, Mrs. Solano.  Do you have a boyfriend, Krishna?  No, I'm gay.  Gotcha.    My mistake.  JANE: This whole thing's a mistake.  I'm gonna text Dennis and call the date off.  You are not.  Michael's his friend, it feels like a betrayal.  Michael would want you to be happy.  With someone else.  Yeah, but you don't have feelings for someone else.  You have feelings for Dennis.  That's the thing, I don't even know if I have feelings for him.  You know, maybe this is just my way  of trying to keep Michael in my life.      Basta! Do not make this about Jorge.  Look, hon,  it's one date.  And you know what?  Maybe it is about Michael.  And maybe it isn't.  But you won't know unless you go.  Okay, fine.  So, where are you going with Jorge tonight?    Go.          All right.  - I got to run. - Mm.  There you are, Bruce!  - Hello, Rogelio. - Oh, right, right.  Courtroom decorum.  -  - Good to see you.    What do you think?  I know I don't look my best.  I had my makeup artist age me up a little  so the judge would take pity on me.  Is it too much?  You look fine.  Is everything all right, buddy?  Sorry I'm late.  There she is.  - Hi, hi. Mwah. - Hey.  No.  No, everything's not all right.  I can't do this.  - What? - Do what?  You told me that I didn't have to,  and I can't.  It's too painful.  And more importantly, you were right.  Given the way I feel, I can't properly represent Rogelio.  - But - What now?  Ask for a continuance.  The judge is gonna grant it  because your lawyer is resigning.  All right, let's get started.  What just happened? Get him back.  (whispers): I can't.  Your Honor, I'm sorry, but Rogelio needs a continuance.  His lawyer quit.  Ugh. Annoying.  By law, Mr. de la Vega,  you'll have reasonable time to find a new attorney.  I can grant you one week.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no,  please, Your Honor, I can't postpone.  I start a new telenovela tomorrow.  I have to be in hair and makeup at 8:00 a.m.  And even though I'm tiny,  the camera picks up every detail, believe me.  Just give me one minute.  You have to get Bruce back.  - I can't. - Why? You know how important this is.  I broke up with him.  Right in the middle of my case?  Why would you do that?  - We'll talk about this later. - No, I demand to know the reason.  - Ro - No, now!  Because I'm in love with you, all right?  (sweeping romantic music plays)  I love you too, Xiomara.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, romance,  always full of surprises.  VoilÃ .  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, let's see where Jorge took Alba.  Mini-golf.    JANE: Dennis and I are gonna go play mini-golf on our date.        It's just mini-golf.  I think you have your Jorge glasses on.      Ay, Jorge.      Ay. (gasps)  Oh, no.      Ay.      (laughs)  Okay, I'm warming up.  I haven't played in a while.  I'm hearing a lot of excuses.  Just like Michael  Sorry.  - I shouldn't have - No.  We can talk about Michael.  Well, once, he accused me of using those illegal balls  that give you more distance.  Oh, trust me, I get it.  Mateo's a better sport.  (chuckles)  - He also, one - Maybe we should  Oh.  Just that, maybe we should try not to talk about Michael.  Okay. No more sports stuff.  Or work stuff.  Have you spoken to Lindsay?  Or ex-fiancÃ©e stuff.  Right. Makes sense, sorry. Uh  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm, a bumpy start.  (quietly): Now let's see  how things are going over at the eighth hole,  where we last left our other golfers in a tight situation.    (exhales)  Jorge?            Yeah, we got a couple creepers  making out in the cave behind the Eiffel Tower again.  (music playing)  What are you doing here?  Look, I know I said some not very nice things about you.  But our hotels are next door,  and I don't want this getting in the way of us being neighbors.  So I apologize.  Yeah, right.  That's not why you're here.  Yes, it is.  Okay, fine.  Then consider your apology  hog-tied and tossed down a well.  I'll see you around.  Okay, fine. You're right.  I'm also here because I like you. And I want to be with you.  So can we just please put all this behind us?  Sorry, the answer's still no.  Why would I want to be with someone  who's embarrassed to be with me?  Are you serious?  You called me a lowlife and said I was out of your league.  First of all, that hurts.  Second of all, you're uptight,  judgmental and no fun at all.  (scoffs)  Come on, look around, Petra.  You don't belong here.  Uh, yes, I do.  (chuckles)  You can't even say that with a straight face.  Ugh.  ANNOUNCER: Looks like we got a new rider.  - What's your name, little lady? - Petra.  ANNOUNCER: Go get 'em, Petra!  How long has Mr. Chesser stayed on for?  About six seconds.  (crowd whooping)  (chuckles)  CROWD: One, two,  three, four, five  Ooh!  Ooh!  Petra! You okay?  Holy jack-o-lantern.  - What? - JANE: The hole, the hole.  Come on, get in the hole!  Aw. How did that not go in?  Your stance is tragic and your swing is hopeless.  That's a bit dramatic, don't you think?  Don't worry.  I'm gonna drop some hope on you.  Show me your stance.  Okay.  Okay, now try it.  (taps ball)  Yes!  Thank you.  Uh, uh, oops.  Uh, bathroom emergency.  - A bathroom emergency? - I panicked.  He was moving in closer,  and all of a sudden I wasn't sure  if I wanted him to kiss me.  Or if I even remember how to, it's been so long.  And then I was thinking, the only way to get back  on the horse is to get it over with.  And then I thought, no, that is not the right attitude.  You should kiss him because he's really cute.  'Cause he is really cute.  (sighs deeply)  So maybe I just freaked  because I'm still not ready to kiss anyone yet.  After Michael.  Are you done?  - Yeah. - Okay.  You need to get back out there  and tell Dennis exactly what you just told me.  - Really? - He'll understand.  Maybe just lose the âgetting it over withâ part.  Got it.  I don't get it. If you weren't sure you wanted to kiss me,  then why were you rubbing your butt all up against me?  Wait, what?  And you were, like, looking at me and signaling.  I didn't want to leave you hanging.  First of all, I wasn't signaling anything.  Especially with my butt.  I was just adjusting my putting stance.  And second of all,  it was a pity kiss?  No! I mean, not exactly.  Maybe a little.  I'm sorry.  It's just that  I haven't kissed anyone since Lindsay.  And I thought that maybe I should just  well  Get it over with?  Yeah.  Kind of.  (laughter)  Hey, you. How was your date?  Pretty successful.  Yeah, he's giving Lindsay another chance.  Ah.  Hey, I had a date. It's something.  So? Did you settle your lawsuit?  Yes. For an astronomical number.  (laughs) Almost all of my salary  for the first year of Los Viajes de Guillermo  will go to paying it.  (both laugh)  Then, why are you both so happy?  To be honest, I just made love to your mother in the car.  Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, it's about time  these two got back together.  Okay. Thank you.  All right. You have a dentist appointment  first thing tomorrow morning.  I still can't believe this.  It's not that bad.  It's hardly noticeable.  (scoffs)  (laughs)  (laughs) Stop.  You look cute.  Oh, stop.  No.  You do.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is that his heart glowing?  Just a little? It's hard to tell with that pink shirt.  (knocking on door)  Must be the ice.  What are you doing here?  CHUCK: Why'd you run out of there in such a hurry?  Well, I don't know, I was humiliated.  Well, I thought it was the wildest, sexiest,  most outrageous thing  anyone's ever done for me.  Really?  (chuckling): Yeah.  DENNIS: You're gonna want to see this.  Petra took the bait.  She made contact with Anezka.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no.  This must be the e-mail  Petra didn't want Raf to read earlier.  And I can see why.  Wow, right?  Oh, my bad, you don't read Czech.  Well, mine isn't great either, but it translates roughly to:        DENNIS: She was lying about her sister.  Plus, she hid the burn book and moved the bones.  Sure seems like she's hiding something.  Yeah, no kidding.  I'm betting Anezka murdered Scott.  And Petra's covering up for her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!  Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Which brings us here.  Ugh. I just forgot how exhausting dating is  for someone like me.  The overthinking, the analyzing, the worrying.  I just wish I could date without my brain being on overload.  It'll happen. You're gonna meet someone great.  And when you do, it'll all be worth it.  Just like with your father and me.  Oh, my God! You're worse than Abuela.  Wait, by the way, did you see her this morning?  No, she must've left early.  But she said she'd be here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, there she is.  JANE: Is Abuela wearing the same clothes as yesterday?  Oh, my God, I think she is.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I noticed it, too,  but out of respect for Alba, I wasn't going to say anything.    JANE: Did you sleep at Jorge's house  last night, Abuela?    So no sex?    Oh, okay.    All right, let's get this shot off!  ROGELIO: I would just like to say  that I am so glad to be back in the world of telenovelas,  where I belong!  For now.  Until my Passions of Santos remake happens.  (applause)  Lovely, terrific.  We feel that way, too.  And on that note, I am so excited  to introduce you  to your new co-star, Rogelio.  Fabian Regalo del Cielo!  (clapping)  He's going to play your rival in your quest for love.  Rogelio. What a true pleasure.  I've been a fan of yours for as long as I can remember.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: They did say the co-star would be hot.  We are so thrilled to have you, Fabian.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, Ro doesn't look thrilled.  But she does.    Yup, something's glowing all right.  And it's not her heart."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, here we go. Let's start with our Jane.  As a child her grandmother  taught her to protect her flower.  And so Jane waited to have sex  until she married Michael.  And then, well you know.  Yeah. I still miss him, too.  But it's been three years, and since then,  Jane wrote a novel about their love story.  And she recently decided she was ready to date again.  Also ready to date, Alba.  See, she was crushing on her coworker Jorge,  and guess what. He asked her out.  And as for Rafael, well, he'd recently gotten closer  to his ex-wife Petra.  In fact, he was downright into her, lately. Only problem,  Petra was dating Chuck, the owner of the hotel next door.  Plus, Petra had other problems.  See, her former employee, Scott,  died on the grounds of the Marbella.  And Scott used to be married  to her twin sister Anezka.  But Anezka was long gone,  and according to Petra, they were no longer in touch.  But here's the thing Petra was lying.  And the cops were on to her.  Oh, and speaking of crime,  you'll recall Rafael's sister Luisa  was dating Eileen, but Eileen  is really her old girlfriend, Rose,  aka the crime lord Sin Rostro.  I know, straight out of a Telenovela, right?  And speaking of telenovelas,  Rogelio got a huge new part  playing someone very tiny.  Unfortunately, he felt chilly about his new costar Fabian.  But Jane was positively hot for him.  I know, right? I'm getting the tingles, too.  So let's get busy, people.  Ah, lust!  Jane Gloriana Villanueva  would never forget the first time she felt it.  MAN (on TV): Magdalena.    (woman moaning)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unfortunately, she was sitting between her mother  - and grandmother at the time. - (woman moans)  MÃ¡s!  MÃ¡s! MÃ¡s!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I'm uncomfortable, too.    I'm gonna do some homework.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah,  they clearly didn't want to talk about it.  But, oh, how times have changed.  -  - Tell me everything.  About what?  Come on, you're clearly crushing on Fabian.  I am not.  I am reading an article  about how underboob is the new side boob.  Oh, please. You've been finding the most ridiculous excuses  to go see your father on set.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True, for the record.  You forgot your sides at home.    We shot this yesterday.  (sexy music plays)  JANE: MÃ¡s  MÃ¡s MÃ¡s  Fine. I may have a small crush  in that he may excite me in a superficial way.  So make a move.  Mom, he dated Miss Universe,  Shakira's backup dancer,  and Gisele Bundchen's twin.  For someone who's not interested,  - you sure know a lot about him. - I'm just saying  that I'm not his type.  And-and he's not my type.  Maybe not to date.  But what about a fling?  You ever open to that?  With him?  Oh, yeah.  (laughs)    (woman moans)    So, just casual sex?  No strings.  Why not, right?  I mean, I waited.  I did it.  But now, like, everything's changed,  and, you know, what  Oh. (clears throat)      She says with an extra helping  of guilt.  Not everyone wants  to be celibate, Mom.  Hey, how did Jorge take it?  Hmm?  When you told him you weren't gonna have sex.  - Oh, my God, you didn't tell him. - Ma.    JANE: No kidding.  Would you like me to give you the advice you gave me?  No.    Need a flower to destroy in your angry fist?  Oh.  - (phone ringing) - Oh.  Hey, Jeremy, what's up?  Wait, what?  So that's it?  A big part of writing is knowing when to put the pen down.  Pen down.    I love it.  The plot really moves, the emotional payoff is huge  and it's romantic as all hell.  Ah.  I can't believe I'm done. Well, not done.  Writing's only the half of it, right?  Now the fun part begins.  We gotta drop it like it's hot.  - I'll bring the pot holder. - Great.  I set up a meeting with the marketing and PR departments  So they can figure out how to market it  to booksellers and audiences.  - That's amazing. - I know.  Anyway, what's up? Why'd you call?  Ah, it's terrible timing.  - What is? - Luisa's coming in tomorrow.  And we're pushing up our annual shareholder meeting.  Yeah, no problem. I'll keep Mateo till she's gone.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Can't blame them for being a little skittish  around the ex-girlfriend of the woman who kidnapped their son.  I'm sorry for messing up the schedule.  I just wish she would give us notice for once.  - (knocking on door) - It's fine.  I'll talk to you later.  Thank you, Jane. Bye.  So we set?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know what you're thinking.  Are we finally going to find out  what this shady dude is up to?  - Yup, Luisa's suite is bugged. - And she won't find anything?  No way. I went in through Petra's vent.  But trust me, if Rose tries  to get in touch with your sister, we'll know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup. Elvis isn't an ex-con  or a maintenance man; he's Raf's private eye.  That explains a lot.  Or rather, I just explained it.  Good. My family will never feel completely safe  until Rose is locked up for good.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know,  straight out of a Telenovela, right?                    Also known as a scientist.    Again, scientist.                  DIRECTOR: And cut!  Fantastic.  It must be nice not to have to worry about your body anymore.  Sometimes I feel like a sex object.  It must be very hard for you.  - Not really, no. - So listen, Ro,  do you want a stunt double for when you swing from her hair?  Well, I-I-I'd be happy to do it.  I was an award-winning stunt double  before I discovered my talent and passion for acting.  Rogelio De la Vega does his own stunts,  thank you very much.  You're very welcome.  Selfie? Yeah?  ELLIE: No more pictures.  We're just taking a test.  For the Gifted and Talented program. That's a big deal!  Critters.  I see critters.  (laughing): Oh.  Oh, now, why are my legs so heavy?  Did I step in something?  I didn't know the girls were hanging out with Chuck.  What happened to our six-month rule?  You waited six months to tell them about Abbey  and then broke up with her anyway.  Besides, they only know Chuck as Mommy's friend.  Hmm.  Hey, girls, who's this guy?  Mommy's boyfriend.  Smoochie, smoochie.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, they are gifted and talented.  Not again.  I already told you guys everything I know.  DANA: Yeah, well, unfortunately,  there are a couple of holes in your story.  JANE: My story.  Me, 90 seconds. That's all they need for the PR meeting.  A snapshot to help sell the book.  Well, you can start practicing now with Fabian.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Jane and her wing mom.  Don't worry. I have a plan.  What are those?  FABIAN: Oh, my God.  Goji berries! I love those so much!  Are you serious? They're, like, my favorite snack.  No way. What a coincidence.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or the result of a deep dive  - Internet search. - Have one, please.              Look at this. My hair is a mess, my forehead is shiny,  I'm holding a doughnut, and he didn't even use a filter.  - You look fine. - Exactly.  ""Fine.""  Fabian is clearly sabotaging me.  - What? - He's trying to get in my head.  First he comments on my weight,  then on my ability to do my own stunts.  I am telling you, this is an All About Eve situation.  Are you sure you're not overreacting?  This is exactly what happened in my Telenovela,  No Eres TÃº, Yo Soy Yo, Somos Nosotros.  One character tries to sabotage another character?  What?  No, I did it in real life.  Have you ever heard of Eduardo Espinosa?  - No. - Exactly.  What?  Wh-Wh-Wh?  Why is Jane giggling like that?  Take a deep breath.  She might have a little crush.  That's ridiculous. Jane would never be interested  - in that throw pillow. - Why do you think  she's been making excuses to come see you all week?  First he goes after my stunt,  and now my daughter?  Fasten your seat belt,  it's going to be a bumpy afternoon.  FABIAN: So I massage my kale  - for half an hour with olive oil. - Wow.  That's amazing.  I think super foods are just so super.  (laughs)  Excuse me, may I talk to my daughter privately?  Dad, where are we what?  Dad, what are you?  Dad, what is your problem?  My problem is that you've been pretending to come visit me  to ogle Fabian's bee-stung lips.  That's right. Your mother told me  all about your unholy mega-crush on Fabian.  And I forbid it.  (gasps)  See, Dad, look around. Actual walls for privacy!  I am sorry, Jane. I didn't mean for Fabian to overhear.  I'm just concerned. The guy's a total playboy.  I just don't want you to get your heart broken!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I don't think  Jane's thinking about her heart.  I know but I'm an adult.  I can handle myself.  Fine. I'll talk to Fabian and make things better.  No! Dad, you need to stay out of it and let me handle it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I bet you'll handle it, Jane.  - Jane! - (laughs)  Oh, uh, sorry. Forgot something.  So embarrassed.  (sighs)  Ay. Better.  What's up?  I just wanted to clear that up.  I do not have a crush on you.  My dad is a little overprotective.  Well, don't worry. I totally understand.  You're his little daughter.  Not little.  Well, then again, I'm tiny on the show.  - We need you in your fitting. - Well, bye, Jane.  I'm bringing you those chia seeds tomorrow, eh?  - You're gonna die. - Oh.  Right. Cool!  Actually, the opposite of die.  You're gonna live super extra long!  Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Stop leering, Jane.  You, too, Alba.  (groans)  Ay.  (whipping)  Stop it, both of you!  I am so, so sorry. Let's go.    Hmm.  Hmm.  (gasping)  Jorge.      -  - (chuckles)            (sighs)      DANA: No. We're not done.  Your client's story isn't true.  We tapped her computer.  - Is that legal? - With a subpoena, yes.  Which we got after finding out that you had just scooched  Mr. Archuletta's bones over to Mr. Chesser's property.  DENNIS: You said you didn't know where your sister was,  and you lied. You've been e-mailing her.  - You don't have to say anything. - It's fine.  I've been sending her money.  Yes, but it's just to keep her away.  It has nothing to do with Scott.  And I didn't tell you earlier  because, well, it's a personal family drama between us.        DENNIS: Well, we need to question Anezka.  So you need to convince her to return to Miami.  I'd really prefer not to.  Oh.  Well, it's your choice.  Of course, if you don't, we'll charge you  with obstructing a police investigation.  On account of lying to us.  Oh, and the bones.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of criminal enterprises  You remember Luisa, right?        And of course, her girlfriend, Eileen,  who, you'll recall, is actually    Which makes Luisa    EILEEN: Do you like them?  Yes, thank you.  Well, you Lou so good in linen.  LUISA: And  (rolling her tongue)  These are for Mateo.  Mm. I want my nephew to know that  he has an auntie that loves him,  even if I'm not allowed to see him.  Even though he wouldn't exist if it wasn't for me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I wouldn't brag about that, Dr. Alver.  I'm just going through some personal problems.  And these are for the twins.  Mm. Who I also hope to meet very soon.  Yes. Great. We'll see.  So, Raf, we saw a bunch of cops around outside.  What's that about?  They're investigating Scott's death.  I thought it was an accident.  Yeah, well, now they're not so sure.  Did you?  (mouths)  You know how hard it is for me to fall asleep  when I'm not in my own bed,  so I got this contraption that makes wave sounds.  (loud wave sounds playing)  (whispering): Of course I did not kill Scott.  (quietly): Oh, we were here right around then.  Are you saying it was just a coincidence?  Yes, because we were together that whole trip.  We sent away the real Eileen, and then we made love.  There was no time for me to have murdered him.  But you did leave the room once. Remember?  I had to stop having sex and then take a shower  'cause the lotion we were using gave me a rash?  And then we figured we might as well get some Chinese?  And then, while I showered, you went to get the food.  No, I was going to go pick up the Chinese food,  but we ended up having it delivered,  and the concierge brought it up to us.  Because at that point,  the oil was starting to bother me, too, remember?  (sighs)  And this is why I hate coming to the Marbella,  because we always start fighting.  I know.  You're right.  We need to switch rooms, just in case.  In case what?  In case the cops are here because of us  and your room is wired.  You're being paranoid.  So, yes, I was strongly influenced  by the telenovelas I grew up watching.  But also by the romance novels I grew up reading.  And I think you feel both influences in my book.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Relax, Jane.  You have a whole two seconds of wiggle room.  You're gonna crush this meeting.  So, you probably want to hear a little about me.  Where to start?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You're spiraling, Jane.  You've practiced enough.  Play chapter three.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good, yes.  A nice, juicy novel will help you relax.  MAN: Chapter three: selling yourself.  Let's start with posture.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oy.  Imagine a string  attached to the crown of your head, pulling upward.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here now.  So, you probably want to hear a little about me.  Oh, stop. We know all about you.  The artificial insemination, the virgin birth,  the kidnapping, your husband's tragic death.  Oh, wow.  Well, it's an amazing backstory, and the fact  that it's all thinly veiled in there  Well, it gives us a real angle to market.  Right. Yes.  Uh, here's the thing.  I know it's a wild story, but I actually think  that if it's out there, it would kind of take over.  And it was pretty traumatic,  so I don't really want to talk about any of that publicly.  - What? - I just want to stick to the book.  Answering questions like  process, influences.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember the string, Jane.  Uh, it's sort of a combination of the telenovelas  that I watched growing up, plus the American  But if you talk about your life, we can get you interviews.  Print, radio.  The Miami book fair's this weekend.  Maria Semple is moderating.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God!  One of her favorite authors!  And mine. Okay, freaking out a little.  Come on, Jane.  I'm sorry.  I really want the work to stand on its own.  Okay, well, uh, I think we have all the info we need.  We'll confer and then get back to you  about the size of the initial print run.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. All in under 90 seconds.  I know everyone's upset.  But we hadn't talked about that past stuff.  I didn't think it was a secret.  I mean, is that why you wanted to publish my book?  No. I liked your writing.  And I realized the marketing team could sell you.  It's all connected.  Listen, it is what it is.  I still love your writing, and I think people are gonna buy it.  It's just, the print run is not as big as I had hoped.  What's the number?  10,000 copies.  Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Not great, FYI.  How are my chances of getting into that book fair?  What's your social media presence?  Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter followers?  You know not as many as I'd like.    (sighs) Too bad.  A big social media following makes them think  you'll draw attendees, which is what the organizers are after.  How many followers do I need to get into the fair?  20K, minimum, but there's no way in hell  you're gonna get that many followers that quickly.  I happen to have a social media expert in my family.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now that's a Twitter feed!  Jane, hi!  Don't worry. I assure you I am not here to see you.  I just came to get help from my dad.  Oh, he pulled a muscle doing a stunt.  No, he's fine. He's just having an emergency massage.  Oh. (clears throat)  - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I just need his help  getting Twitter followers for this book fair.  A book fair? Oh, does that mean that you're an author?  I am. How did I not know that?  - I have a book coming out, too. - You wrote a book?  - Every word of it. - Wow.  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. - Hey, since you have a little time  while your dad's getting a massage,  maybe you'd like to go grab a cup of coffee?  I would love to find out more about you and your book.  Sure. I'd like that.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. Perhaps he's interested after all.  Oh. Hi.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He sure is.  Hey.  Just came by to check on you  and drop off some backpacks.  Hey, how'd your call with Anezka go?  Fine.  I, uh, bought her a ticket,  promised I'd buy her an electric bike.  She's on her way.  You okay?  Yeah. It'll be fine.  She'll answer some questions, then leave.  Oh, come on. It's got to be traumatic  to see her again.  Did you call your therapist?  CHUCK: She don't need to call her.  We talked about it a bunch. She's fine.  Appreciate the input, Chuck.  But, you know, you weren't around  when Anezka was here.  Well, Petra told me all about her.  Yeah, that's that's not really  the same as actually being here.  No.  It's better. You know, you're not  living in the past.  Look, I'm  I'm not living in the past.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh. Well, this feels familiar,  doesn't it?        - You done? - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah.  - Sorry. - Great.  I appreciate your concern.  But I can handle my sister.  (phone dings)    ELVIS: Your sister  switched rooms. Apparently the cannons  for the pirate tour can be heard from their suite.  What do you want me to do?  All right, I'll shut off their AC.  You go repair it and put in a bug.  FABIAN: I must hear everything.  Tell me all about your book.  Oh. Well, it's a romance novel.  Of course it is.  Yeah. It takes place in 1902.  Wh Yes, yes, yes.  Such a good year. Such a good year.  Oh, you know it?  Well, if you chose it  it must be great.  Oh.  (chuckles)  Tell me about your book.  Uh, it's-it's a memoir.  To help my fans understand the real me.  Not just the shirtless doctor under a waterfall,  or the shirtless detective under a waterfall,  or shirtless serial killer under a waterfall.  Can you pass the sugar?  Oh, sure.  I can't believe you're doing this!  After everything we've been through!  - Excuse me? - You broke my heart,  Jane Villanueva.  I'm done.  (shutters continue clicking)  - (exclaims) - Shh, shh. It's okay.  - It's me, Fabian. - (exclaims)  That was incredible, no? They're gonna think  - that you're my lady for sure. - Who will?  All the paparazzi I tipped off. You say you needed  more Twitter followers to sell your book,  and now you'll have them.  My fans will hate-follow you instantly.  You you did that so I could get more Twitter followers?  Exactly. For the book fair.  Oh Oh, that's  that's kind of sweet.  (chuckles) Thanks.  Uh, will you tell your dad for me?  Excuse me?  Oh, he's my hero.  Only I keep putting my foot in my mouth  every time I'm around him. Mm.  Will you put in a good word for me?  Uh, tell him that I tried to help you?  Sure.  No problem.  So (chuckles)  Hey, Dad. Feeling better?  So much better. I am refreshed and reenergized  and ready to help you with all things social media.  #Let'sDoThis.  Actually, Fabian already helped me.  - Huh? - Dad.  (exhales) I'm sorry. I know I'm not allowed to say  anything bad to you about Fabian. It's just  he's been a little hard on me.  What are you talking about? He worships you.  - What? - Yeah.  (scoffs) For a second I thought  he liked me and I got all excited.  But trust me: it's all you.      I have to say, I'm a little tired of everybody  being so happy that Fabian isn't into me.      What happened to my choice is my choice?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, with that big helping of guilt.    Wait for it.        What?  Hmm.    Abuela, I'm so sorry.      On the other hand,  meaningless sex with me would be so hot, Jane.  - Oh. - EILEEN: It's so stinking hot in here.  (sighs)  -  - Well, no wonder.  The AC is broken.  -  - I'm gonna call the front desk  and I'm gonna have 'em come fix it.  Don't you think it's a little suspicious?  - That the AC is broken? - Right after we happen to switch rooms?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, she's not a criminal mastermind for nothing.  (phone dings)    Aha you see? You see that?  - You're being paranoid. - Maybe. But I am not leaving  - this room unattended. - Well (sighs)  Then what am I supposed to tell Rafael?  I don't know what to tell you except it blows.  I couldn't get the book fair to bite.  But you said if I had 20,000 followers    I know, but my team did analytics on your followers,  and they're all from Latin America,  which won't convert to book sales  till it's translated to Spanish, which it won't be  if the first print run tanks.  Ugh.  I-I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated.  Yeah. Me, too.  (sighs)  So here's my frustration.  If you look up to me so much, why would you assume  I need a stunt double?  And why would you take that dig at me  about not needing to take my shirt off anymore?  No, those-those weren't digs.  I swear. All I meant was that  the show would fall apart if you got hurt.  Without you, the show is nothing.  Just my abs.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'd binge it.  So this isn't an All About Eve situation?  Um, I-I don't know who Eve is.  But I'm all about you, man. (chuckles)  I-I worship you.  Ever since I was a little kid, I  That's enough about that.  And no more using my daughter  and toying with her feelings.  - Jane? - Yes.  She's brilliant and beautiful,  with the soul of Gandhi  and the talent of Shakespeare.  But you do not mess with her emotions.  You don't have to worry She said she didn't like me.  (short chuckle)  Okay. General rule:  when you look like we do, you can never rule that out.  Ah! I get it. (laughs)  I understand.  Thank you.  Hey, uh, you want to get our nails done after work?  We're gonna be climbing that hair  all week. That means a lot of hand acting.    Actually, I can't.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. Rogelio's never  turned down a good, clear polish before.  JANE: ""A polished and lively debut""?  Something like that? I just need a quick blurb  about my book, anything would help.  From me? I'm flattered.  Well sort of more from your well-known writer friends.  You're kind of blurb-adjacent.  Oh, I see how it is. You only come when you need a favor.  That is not true. I am here every week.  -  - Yeah.  But, yes, I do happen to need one today.  The publisher only ordered 10,000 copies.  Ooh.  I know. Actually,  you're probably the one person who will understand this,  but I am trying to fight for my art.  - What do you mean? - Well, I could get them  to print more copies and give a bigger marketing budget  if I agree to talk about my whole crazy backstory.  But of course I said no, because  I want my book to stand on its own.  Oh, don't be an idiot.  - What? - I was once like you,  so full of integrity.  Oh  You know what being precious about your art gets you?  And there's a storage locker in Boca with the other  7,000 unsold copies.  Trust me. Sell it with everything you've got.  'Cause you don't get a second debut novel.  - Hey, Jeremy, it's Jane. - Oh, hi, Jane.  I've decided that the marketing people  can sell the book however they want.  What? You serious?  Just get me into the book fair, okay?  On it, yes.  LUISA: What's wrong?  I just I thought Eileen was joining us for dinner.  It's my fault. I forgot that her guru  is in town for a one-night-only breathing circle.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, good. So she's still out of the room.  -  - Oh, two virgin daiquiris.  You're on your phone.  - Already. - What are you doing?  Well, clearly, you only like  hanging out with me when I'm with Eileen.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Quick, get her to sit back down!  That's not true.  It's not.  Hey, the last couple years,  things have been really good with us.  Good enough for me to see your kids?  It's worth having a longer conversation about.  (sighs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good job, Raf.  (sighs)      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God, I can't take this.  I don't even know if I'm rooting for him  to catch her or not.  What the hell?!  I'm so sorry, ma'am.  - Ever heard of knocking? - There was a complaint  - about the AC on the floor. - Go! Go!  This is so humiliating.  (door closes)  JANE: ""Straight out of a Telenovela.  ""That's what comes to mind when you hear  ""Jane Villanueva's story.  ""And all that and more is poured into this vibrant  - ""and lively debut."" - So you're really  doing it?  It's ""on the book fair Web site"" official.  The more you talk  about Michael, the easier it will get.  Hmm.    I know.  It already is.    I'm scared.  (sniffles)  I don't  I just  I don't want Michael to be an anecdote, you know?  Something that once happened.          (exhales)    (sighs)            (sighs)  And this book is part of that process because I  wrote the happily ever after I never got.  Your real life story sounds so crazy.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: OMG, I can't believe it.  -  - First Britney, then Bruno,  -  - now Maria Semple?  The accidental pregnancy,  the kidnapping.  You talked about your late husband.  How much of the rest made it into the book?  Let's just say there's a lot in there.  - Thinly veiled. - Any hesitation  talking about this stuff?  Oh, yeah. Tons.  Because with writing comes exposure,  and with exposure comes vulnerability.  And there are all these stages  of exposing yourself.  First with writing the book.  Then marketing it.  Uh, and the last is people reading the book.  That's important,  because otherwise I'd just be writing in my diary.  So please go buy the book. Please, please.  (laughter)  (chuckles)  (romantic Spanish song playing)  Mommy, I want to read your book.  When you're older, Mr. Sweetface.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Much, much older.  I've read it. It's racy.  Sorry to interrupt,  but I just had to say hello.  - Oh, hello. - My friend works at a publishing house  and got me an advance copy of your book.  I loved it so much.  Wow, really?  You're the first person who's read it who I don't know.  I didn't get out of my pajamas until I finished.  You are making my life right now.  Can I take a picture with you?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is Jane fangirling out  - on her first fan? - Only if you agree  to sign this for me.  You want my autograph?  Mm-hmm.  (exhales excitedly) Aw.  I am passing the baton.  JANE: I mean  it was only three autographs, but it was kind of awesome.  And I can't believe I'm even saying that.  Good, you deserved it.  Celebrate in your room tonight  with this.  Don't be gross.  I'm over Fabian.  He texted and said he'd come to the book fair,  and then he bailed on me.  Fame is my new lover.  (doorbell rings)  (exhales)  Oh, can we talk?  Fabian, what are you doing here?  I (grunts) Oh.  I I couldn't stop thinking about you  after the book fair.  You were there?  Why didn't you say hello?  I was too nervous.  - What? - Your words  were so incredible.  What you said about being exposed,  it-it really spoke to me.  And I think you'll see why when you read my book.  Oh.  I can't wait to open it.  - That's my book. - Yeah, you just said.  (clears throat)  Also, I spoke to your dad,  and I told him that I was coming here  and that I wanted to ask you out.  - (grunts) - He said it's okay.  He did?  Is that what's happening?  It is.  (gasps)  Will you go on a date with me, Jane Villanueva?  I would love to.  (romantic Spanish song playing)  (record scratches)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, this is really happening.  I guess the sprinklers are just on timers.  - So, what time does Anezka get in? - Noon.  Okay, girls. Have a great day at school.  I'll come get you after martial arts.  ELLIE: Bye, Mommy.  Okay, come on.  Come on.  (chuckles)  Call me if you need anything.  Okay, so, when are we gonna have a talk  about the fact that your ex still has the hots for you?  (chuckles) What?  - No, he doesn't. - Yes, he does.  And if you can't see it,  you're blinder than a bat in a chimney fire.  Stop. You're being ridiculous.      Um    (sighs)                                ROGELIO: I heard the great news.  They upped your book order.  Well, it's only 5,000 more copies.  But it's something.  Oh, and you're here to see Fabian.  Wait, he said he spoke to you.  Of course. Of course, yes. Go to him.  You okay, Dad?  O-Oh, yes.  I just have to accept  that I'm no longer the only Telenovela star in your life.  Hey.  You're still the main one, okay?  (chuckles)  You're a great actor, Rogelio.  - I know. Thank you. - But you can't fool me.  What's really going on?  It's just hard thinking about Jane dating someone new.  And I know it's not fair. I know she has to move on.  No, it's okay.  I just don't want to start getting Mani-pedis  with Fabian.  Michael was my best friend.  I really loved him.  And I still think about him every single day.  I know.  A-And I never want to burden Jane.  I know that, too.  Thank you for telling me.  - Mm-hmm. - And trust me  Fabian is not taking Michael's place.    Actually, Abuela,  technically they aren't selfies.  They're stills from his snaps.  Mmm.      (laughs)  What's with all the giggling?  We're reading Fabian's book.  ""Chillin' in Capri pants in Capri.  #CapriToBeYouAndMe.""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, he wrote that himself.  - Let's give him some credit. - Oh, my God.  Let me see it. Oh, my God.  (gasps) Oh, wow.  - Yeah. - Mm-hmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR; Aw, what a difference  20 years makes.  (sighs) You may have to be married  to have sex, Abuela, but I do not. And trust.  - I am gonna hit this. - (gasps)  (Jane and Xiomara laugh)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also about to get screwed?  Anezka should have landed by now.  Okay, calm down. She's not that late.  I can't calm down. You have no idea  what she's capable of doing.      Why isn't she answering?  She's probably just getting her luggage.  No. Something is off.  - You're wrong. - I am not.  And I am sick of being cooped up  in this sweaty room.  So I am going to put my face back on,  and then we are going to leave.  No.  What?  I don't want to leave.  I'm finally having a breakthrough  with Rafael, and I might meet his kids.  Well  we can't stay.  Please.  I'm leaving, Luisa.  Are you coming with me?  PETRA: Hello?  ANEZKA: Sister.  Anezka, where are you? You were supposed to get in a cab  and come straight to the Marbella.  Well, I couldn't do that because when I got off the plane,  the police were arresting me.  Wait, what?  You said they were just going to ask questions  and then I would get electric bike.  Yeah, well that's what they said.  I'm in jail, Petra.  No. No, no, no. That That wasn't the deal.  No, they promised it was just questions.  Well, you better fix this,  or I will tell them all what I know.  And then you, sister, will be in orange jumpsuit with me."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, people, you recall we last left our Jane  crushing on Fabian, and, guess what,  the feeling was mutual.  Yeah, quite a kiss.  The kind of kiss you can't wait  to tell your best friend about.  In Jane's case, that would be Lina,  although we haven't seen her lately. Hmm.  Anyway, also feeling lovey-dovey Ro and Xo,  because they recently got back together.  And they weren't the only ones.  Remember Rafael and Petra's night of passion?  Well, after,  Rafael started having feelings for her.  (knock on door)  Unfortunately, Petra was dating Chuck Chesser,  the owner of the hotel next door.  And trust me, there was a lot of drama there,  because a body was found right between their properties.  Yep, it was Scott.  You remember Scott, right?  -  - Sort of annoying, kept a burn book,  -  - always blackmailing people.  -  - Married to Petra's twin sister, Anezka.    Anyway, fast-forward three years.  He's dead, and Anezka was arrested for his murder.  And Petra was freaking out because  You better fix this,  or I will tell them all that I know,  and then you, sister, will be in orange jumpsuit with me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know, straight out of  a Telenovela, right?  Which this is, after all.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva  was 14 years old,  she went on her very first date.  Well, double date.    Kiss him.  (whispering): I don't think he likes me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: See?  People can surprise you.  I never said it was going to be a good surprise.  Nope.  No way this was going to be Jane's first kiss  The one she dreamed about forever.  -  - JANE: It's gonna be my first fling.  Fabian is perfect fling material.    I'm definitely not into dating him,  but, oh, he is the hottest guy I have ever seen.  Yeah, it's kind of hard to say no to that body.  Are they shooting the tighty-whities scene?  How did you know that?  I saw it on Dad's script  and made a mental note in my sex brain.  Wow, you are really ready for this.  Totally ready. He's perfect.  - DIRECTOR: Cut! - Okay, I got to go.  Your dad and I are gonna grab lunch.  Wait. I miss you.  Maybe we can have dinner tonight.  But tonight is Fabian fling night.  Exactly.  I'm meeting him at 9:00  to Netflix and chill,  - so that means - XIOMARA: Sex.  I know. I'm not your Abuela.  I'll come over for dinner.  See you tonight.  Lina?  Jane!  Uh I didn't know you were in town.  Yeah, it was a last-minute trip.  Two days to do some wedding stuff.  Right. Yeah.  I was literally about to text you.  - Oh. - Ju Yeah.  Well, here I am.  Surprise!  (chuckles weakly)  - So let's see the ring. - Yeah.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I should explain.  These two haven't seen each other in quite a while.  Almost two years, to be exact.  And in that time, a lot has changed for Lina.  Yeah, that's been their main source of communication  ever since Lina moved away.  Oh, wow,  - it's even better in person. - Thank you.  I was literally about to text you.  Yeah, you said that already.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So sad, right?  These two were like sisters.  No, sister, I didn't kill Scott!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like regular sisters, I meant,  not like these two.  I loved him. You know that.  So you better fix this, or I will tell everyone  that you were in his apartment that night,  and you stole his burn book.  I was only in his apartment to get your clothes,  because you asked me to.  I didn't know he was dead.  Maybe you did this.  Maybe you killed him.  You always hated him.  That's ridiculous. Stop it.  Did you do it?  Of course not. I-I loved him.  Then why did you threaten him?  The police say they have a video.  Apparently a guest sent it to them.  What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I've seen the video.  It's pretty bad.  No. I hate you!  I wish you were dead. Never come near me again!  Did you kill him?  No!  No, I couldn't have  I don't think.  Okay, we have to go over everything  that happened that day Everything you can remember.  You guys were in a fight?  Yes, yes, he was flirting with a waitress.  I got very jealous. Scott was mad.  He hated when I would get jealous,  but I can't help it.  In the orphanage, you always have to  look out for your bread and your boyfriend.  That night, Anezka  Yes, I I got a text.  He was breaking up with me.  I texted him back    But he said no.    And that's when you found me.  PETRA: Oh, no,  - you poor thing. - (crying)  Let me help you.  I could get you out on the first flight tomorrow.  I'll pack up your things.  That way you don't have to see Scott again.  - No - No, no, really, it's  it's not a problem.  You should just go.  ANEZKA: And then we be going back to your penthouse,  and I be drinking my sorrows away.  And that's all I remember.  I fall asleep on couch.  Well, you're on a video,  so you must have gone back out  after I went back to work.  I was so drunk, I can't remember.  But no, I couldn't have killed him.  No, I loved him.  Oh, you know how much I loved him.  Please, beautiful sister, you have to fix this.  JANE: I want to fix it, of course,  but I just can't believe Lina came back to Miami  and didn't call me.  Yeah, Oprah and Gayle went through something like this.  A few years ago, Oprah was super busy  launching the Oxygen network, and Gayle  was really feeling it, so I suggested  they spend some quality time together  at Colonial House.  One night was all they needed  to get their friendship back on track.  Would you and Lina be open to something like that?  Thanks, Dad, but I think I'll just talk to her.  MATEO: Can somebody wipe me?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Pass.  Fine.  I'm sorry, I know it was just supposed to be the two of us.  Oh, no need to apologize.  I'm just glad you two are so happy.  We are.  But do you think we're moving too fast?  Do you?  I-I don't know. Maybe.  So talk to Dad about it.  I want to, but every time I try,  we just end up having sex.  Yeah oh, didn't need to know that.  And just try again.  I mean, you can wait five minutes.  Ha. Speaking of sex,  I have to go get dressed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So she can get undressed.  That's right, it's almost time to Netflix and chill.    You know that this was based on a true story.  There really was a Queen Elizabeth.  Is. There still is one.  Hmm?  Doesn't matter.  You know, I actually was hoping that  maybe tonight we could do a little less Netflixing  and a little more chilling.    (both moaning)  Mm, stop. We should stop.  Why?  Well, I'm, um, sort of saving myself.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Surprise.  You're a virgin?  No, no. I've had sex.  Oh. Lots of sex. All kinds of sex.  Monogamous sex, freaky sex,  kinky sex, hate sex,  love/hate sex, ex sex, fan sex,  cougar sex, Halloween sex  Okay, I get it. (chuckles)  But after a while, it just became meaningless.  So I decided no more.  I'm gonna wait.  Mm until it's?  A meaningful commitment.  Maybe even marriage.  (wind blowing)  Got it. That's so cool.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Brr. Is it me, or did it get  pretty Netflix and chilly in here?  Seriously, how did I find the one Telenovela sex symbol  that doesn't want a fling?  - (sighs) It's not funny, Mom. - (door opens)  Good morning.    Mom, I got to go.  Abuela, you know the rules.  Only 15 minutes of newspapers a day,  and never alone in your room.      Yes, things are bad, I know.  You should march with me.      Oh, I know something that'll cheer you up.  Fabian won't have sex with me  because he's re-virginized himself.    I-I don't know, we didn't get that far.  I was so surprised.  Anyway, I'm gonna end it.  What?    (clears throat) No.  It's because we have nothing in common.  And where did you learn that term?    Me?        We just want different things.    (Mateo laughing)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, just look at him, Jane.  If you don't give him a chance, I will.  Hey.  Oh, hey. Mateo was just teaching me  the proper way to ride an ant.  You have to hold on to his antenna.  - Like this. - Ah.  Oh, well, I hate to break up the party,  but it's time to go home.  - So go say bye to Papa. - (grunts)  (chuckles) Mwah.  Don't worry, I introduced myself as Rogelio's friend, not yours.  I know how important it is to have boundaries with kids.  I have a little niece,  and she's my very best friend.  See?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Geez, Jane, puppies.  What else does the guy need to do?  He's perfect.  So when are we getting together again?  I'm-I'm glad you asked.  Uh, sometimes when women hear that I don't want to have sex,  they don't want to see me again.  You're kidding. Ugh, people are the worst.  (chuckles)  Fabian, we're ready for you in the dining room set.  Okay. Well, I'll text you after I'm finished  climbing the giant candelabra.  - Okay. - (both chuckle)  (sighs)  (sensual music plays)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Eyes up, Jane.  I know that look.  (sighs)  And I know that look, too.  It's piney Rafael.  I haven't seen him in years.  I'll see you soon.  - Take care. - Bye.  Who was that?  Mm, the lawyer I hired to represent Anezka.  You're helping your sister?  The same woman who paralyzed you  and tried to steal your life?  Okay, yes, Anezka did some horrible things,  but she's no murderer.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oof, that's a pretty low bar there.  Besides, she would have never killed Scott.  She loved him for  whatever reason.  That might be true.  But that's not why you're helping her.  Fine.  Also  it might be me in that video  threatening to kill Scott.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Some of you might find this surprising.  I knew it as soon as I saw it.  I have a lot of experience with twins.  Petra and Anezka look nothing alike to me.  I just wanted them to end their ridiculous relationship  and get Anezka to leave.  Tell me what happened.  Everything.  I'd had enough, so I fired him.  Effective immediately.  Are you forgetting I have Emilio's will?  (scoffs) Rafael told his sister, you idiot, it's meaningless.  Now hand over your work phone and get out of here.  Then I texted Anezka from his phone  and ended their relationship.  Later that night, I slipped a little something  in Anezka's drink just to help her sleep.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Also known as drugging her.  And then I made it clear to Scott  that Anezka didn't want to be with him anymore.  ANEZKA: No! I hate you!  I wish you were dead! Never come near me again!  My plan would've worked perfectly.  Except then Scott had to go die and ruin everything.  May he rest in peace.  So you've been lying to the police this whole time?  I mean high-level, yes,  but it only became relevant when they ruled it a murder.  Look, I kept the truth from you  because I didn't want to ask you to lie for me,  not when you're on probation.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay,  wipe that dopey look off your face.  She said she doesn't want you to go back to jail,  not have another baby with you.  I just need them to stop focusing on my sister.  She couldn't have killed him, she was drugged in my penthouse.  It must've been someone else.  I have a P.I. I'll put him on it.  - (door opens) - CHUCK: Hey, babe.  Ready for lunch?  Yes, great.  CHUCK: I'm telling you,  that pretty boy wants to get in them shorts.  Oh, stop. You're being ridiculous.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He's not. I know the look.  Yup. There it is again.  Come on, Jane, you can do this.  - Remember, sex is off the table. - WAITER: All righty, mateys!  Something to nibble as your night begins.  That pirate reminds me of the time  (voice fades): that my sister convinced me  (sensual music plays)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, come on, Jane,  that's so not sexy.  And I love nachos.  Well, you're a mom, what do you think?  Hmm? What? Yeah.  Um I completely agree.  You agree that I'm going to Mexico next month?  Maybe.  (chuckles)  Come, Jane. What's on your mind?    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Think of something, quick, Jane!  Lina. My best friend Lina is in town  and things are awkward.  (sneezes)  (sensual music plays)  (blows nose)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, this is just ridiculous.  Wiping your nose is never cute.  Oh.  Perhaps I spoke too soon.  Oh, right on time.  And I pushed back our dinner so we can make love first.  Well, can we actually just  talk?  And I love you and want to be with you,  but I just don't want to make the same mistakes again.  I don't either, trust me.  And we've always moved so fast.  I mean, we said âI love youâ on Beach Day  in high school after dating for a week.  And it was true, I did love you.  And I love you now.  And I've spent  the last three years adjusting to life without you.  And it wasn't as good.  So we can slow down  if that's what you want.  But for my part,  we're not moving fast enough.            - Is that all? - Mm-hmm.          This is America.  You should learn how to speak English.  Ay.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: We all are, Alba.  We all are.    We, the people of the United States,  in order to form a more perfect union,  establish justice,  insure domestic tranquility.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Dang, Alba's getting all P.C. on us.    Probably none.    Ay.        You should do something.  You clearly want to.  You should march.    Why not?      It won't.      Ay.    (doorbell rings)  That must be Lina.    - Hola. - Ah!    You can look at my reflection in the ring,  so you don't have to pick.  (Alba and Lina chuckle)      - So where's Danny? - (both chuckle)  - Oh, he couldn't come. - That's too bad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm. If this is like riding a bike,  the bike is missing its handlebars.  And both wheels.  Hi, Mr. Sweetface! Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.  Hi, Mateo! Oh, my gosh,  you are so grown up.  Look, I brought you a present.  Oh.  I don't know you,  and Mommy says not to take gifts from strangers.  (both chuckle nervously)  Hey, Lina's not a stranger, she's your godmother.  Then why don't I know her?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Awkward.  Let's get out of here, Jane.  - Okay! Why are we still standing here? - Yeah.  Let's come on in.  Have you set a date yet?  - No, not yet. - Oh.  - But definitely in the fall. - Mm.  I'm not doing bridesmaids or anything like that.  No, I mean I wasn't (chuckles)  But, yeah. Fall is fun.  So tell me all about Danny.  You met online?  An app actually.  - Bumble. - Hmm.  Oh, it's pretty cool.  The girls contact the guys,  so it weeds out any weirdos stalking you.  You should try it.  When you're ready to date.  Oh. I am, actually. Dating.  Oh, wow.  - Yay! - I mean  But, I mean, no one seriously.  - Okay. - Yeah.  Well, here, l-let me show you.  I-I still have it on my phone.  I just pooped  and you don't even have to check my wipe.  - Oh! Yes, I do. - (phone chimes)  Timmy says checking is just for babies.  Well, Timmy is  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A dick.  Wrong.  So let's go.  Wait, Jane.  Danny just texted. It's terrible timing,  but this date just opened up at this wedding venue  that was supposedly booked,  and his mom just got us a last-minute appointment.  - You're leaving? - I don't want to.  I'd beg them to move it, but there's just no other time,  and we have a cake tasting  at 8:00, and I leave tomorrow morning, so  No, of course, I get it. Go.  I have a tush to wipe anyway.  Okay. I'm so, so sorry.  I'll text you.  Mm-hmm.  (softly): Okay.  Whatever, I'm not waiting by the phone.  (phone chimes)  It's Fabian.  (laughs) So, how's that, how's that going?  Honestly, I'm like this weird horndog around him.  It's all I think about.  Yeah.  It's hard dating someone who doesn't put out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, how'd you do it?  Well, I gave myself carpal tunnel, for one thing.  Oh, my God. I can give you a list of the Web sites I used.  Be serious! I am being serious.  But I loved you, right?  So, I always knew you were worth waiting for.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw.  (chuckles)  Well, I don't love Fabian.  (Petra talking indistinctly)  Raf?  - Hmm? - (mocking): Huh?  Oh, sor yeah, so just, uh,  find a way to take Fabian's looks off the table.  What's with the piney look?  You were just staring at Petra with this piney look.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hate to say I told you so.  What's going on?  And I just had this moment, when I was looking at her,  and I don't know.  It was like, everything changed.  And, suddenly, I thought, maybe what I've been looking for  has been right in front of me this whole time.  I mean, maybe we just went on this whole crazy journey  just to find our way back to each other.  Sorry, I'm, I'm I'm just  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Shocked?  Jealous?  A little of both?  Surprised, that's all.  I know.  I was surprised, too.  But I think I really want to be with her.  What is it?  Nothing.  Just say it.  Drop some judgment on me.  Come on, I'm asking for it.  You think you want to be with her, or you know?  Because it took her a long time to get over you.  And as someone who cares about Petra  But do not tell her that unless it's Saturday brunch  I don't want to see her get hurt again.  So just be sure.  Before you open everything up again.  That's all.  I know it's just something you say when you're a kid,  but I honestly thought Lina and I would be best friends forever.          Hmm?    (inhales)  Okay. How do I look?  That was a trick question.  It doesn't matter.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Good point? Where are they going?  JANE: This is fun, right?  FABIAN: Uh, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Is it weird?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Very weird.  Where are we?  No, it's great.  I've always wanted to try this.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Try what?  Seriously? What's going on?  - Ow. - Are you okay?  I just banged my tooth with my spoon.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, I know.  They are      Yup. It's the perfect place  for Jane to get to know the real Fabian.  So, have you read anything good lately?  Oh, yeah. I love magazines.  Plus, my scripts.  Hey, I bet you're a real reader.  You like books and stuff, right?  Yeah. I like books and stuff.  Ow. I poked myself with my fork.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, I've had enough of this.  We need to see.  Uh, so are you reading anything now?  Uh, well, because of everything that's going on, Orwell.  The popcorn guy?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's okay, Jane.  You can roll your eyes.  He can't see.  (phone chimes)    MAN: Hey! Turn that off.  WOMAN: No phones in here.  Hey, I couldn't help but notice your, your face  in your phone glow.  You seem sad. What's wrong?  It's my friend Lina.  I just have to accept that things have changed for us.  It's like my Abuela says,  in times of crisis,  you learn who your real friends are.  No! A real friendship is worth fighting for.  Look, I haven't known you for that long,  but you talk about Lina a lot.  You should talk to her.  She's leaving tomorrow.  That means you still got tonight. Go to her!  Don't let her leave town without telling her  how you really feel.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Spoken like a true Telenovela star.  - (phone rings) - And speaking of Telenovela stars  Okay, I hope you're excited,  because I can't wait to show you this house.  It's perfect.  XIOMARA: I'm sorry, but I have to cancel.  I've come down with something  and I'm home in bed, sick.  Oh. So, you are home, in bed, sick right now?  Yep. I'm just lying under the covers, feeling terrible.  Oh, well, I'll just, uh, call the Realtor  and ask if we can reschedule.  Feel better.      PETRA: Wait, what?  ELVIS: I said, I reviewed all their evidence,  and I also analyzed the graphic residue  on the missing page of the burn book through a light box.  Got it.  Sorry, I'm just so used to seeing you  as an incompetent maintenance man,  this whole P.I. thing is just a little much  to wrap my mind around.  Just tell her what you told me.  There was some writing in the corner that Scott erased.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, J.P.?  As in the elusive mystery person  the cops have been looking for?  - Shake him down? - Yeah.  Definitely doesn't sound good.  Bar's in Pensacola.  I'll head over this weekend to check it out.  We identify J.P., then we drop an anonymous tip  to the cops, let them do the rest.  Perfect. Thank you.  This is good. Right?  A way to get your sister off and not implicate you.  This J.P. could be our answer.  What?  And in that moment, friends,  she was reminded of what Chuck said.  I'm telling you, that pretty boy wants to get in them shorts.  (sighs)  Uh, I'm sure this is a stupid question,  but do you have feelings for me?  Like  romantic feelings.  And in that moment, friends,  he was reminded of what Jane said.  Just be sure.  What? No.  - Of course not. - Oh, oh. Phew. Okay, good.  - (laughs) - Good.  (both laugh)  Mmm. That's so good.  WAITER: I'm sorry, we're closed for a private event.  Oh, she just wants to speak to her very best friend Lina.  Jane?  Surprise.  What are you doing here?  - Uh - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well,  this really hot Telenovela star said to run to you.  Well, I knew you were leaving town tomorrow,  and I just wanted to meet Danny before you left.  Hi, Danny, I'm Jane.  - Hi. I've heard so much about you. - Oh.  Would you like to stay?  - Yes! - Oh, no, no, no.  This is your cake testing. Yes, we'd love to, I love cake.  We shouldn't have come. No, no, no.  - No, we should go. - Ay, don't be ridiculous.  There's no way they could eat this much cake.  No, stay, for sure.  (sighs)  FABIAN: Danny, let's let  - the ladies catch up. - Where are you from?  Who are your enemies?  Uh, no one?  And I'm from New York.  I'm sorry for all of this.  I I just felt like it was really weird earlier.  I know, it was.  DANNY: I had a great meeting with our Miami office  when Lina and I were in town last June.  Wait.  Wait, you were here in June?  Just for a couple days.  You didn't call me then, either?  FABIAN: W-Well, at least she called you  Th-this time, right? Right?  Oh, I feel like such an idiot.  No, no. I've been chasing after you,  and you obviously don't want to be friends.  Of course I do.  - You disappeared. - That's not fair, I moved.  That's not what I'm talking about and you know it.  Yes. Now we're getting somewhere.  Who is this guy?  Oh, uh, Fabian. And we're dating.  No, we are just getting to know each other.  Can we talk about this in the bathroom?  Fine.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, so where were we?  I did not abandon you. I saw you every week that first year.  The second year was even harder.  You could've tried to stay in touch.  - I did try. - No, you didn't.  After you met Danny, you stopped calling.  That's not what happened.  Okay, so?  I called you at first.  And then Danny and I had our first fight,  about a month in, about something stupid.  He, he was in touch with his ex-girlfriend,  and I remember, I called you then, too.  And you said  It's all insignificant in the big picture.  I mean, I'd give anything  to have one more fight with Michael.  Yeah.  That, that's a good point.  Oh, my God.  I didn't really say that.  I mean, I get it. In the scheme of things  No, no. You were, you were falling in love,  you were living.  I just, I really didn't know  how to be upset around you in a regular way.  Or happy around you.  And I really wanted to be happy.  I'd waited so long for my life to click together,  and finally it was.  No.  I get it.  (sniffles) I'm sorry.  No, you shouldn't be sorry.  I'm just so glad you're happy,  and I want to share that with you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw.  How sweet.  Sisterhood.  Shut your mouth, beautiful sister.  They want information,  I'm giving them you in his apartment.  Stop, just calm down, okay?  I've hired a P.I., he's following a lead,  - I-I just need some time. - Sister!  I have hearing Monday on plea deal.  I need to get out of here.  And you will. I-I just, I need until tiln.  Okay? I'll call you tomorrow with an update.  Oh, I have to call Rafael,  get the P.I. to head out now.  Ah, screw Rafael.  Let's not wait on him.  Let's you and me drive  to Pensacola, find this J.P. guy ourselves.  But why? Rafael has a professional.  Oh, Solano, don't make me spell it out for you.  You never need help, woman.  And now you do.  And I want to be the guy that helps you.  Uh, l-let's do it.  JANE: I can't believe that was your first kiss.  I know.  (both laugh)  Okay.  Can we talk about Fabian now?  Oh, my God, so not a match.  I'm gonna need you to show me Bumble again.  Find some real options.  Wait, why isn't he a real option?  He's waiting to have sex and I just want a fling.  Okay. I find both shocking.  (giggles)  Waiting how long?  Oh, until things are serious, and trust me,  it's not going to get serious.  How do you know?  He's too  Hot? Sweet? Happy?  No, we're just really different.  He doesn't read.  Neither do I.  (laughs)  I mean, I'm just saying,  on paper, you and I don't have much in common.  So don't write him off just because you two are different.  People surprise you. (laughs)  And I like happy for you.  I'm just That's all I'm saying.  I like it for you, too.  Okay, why do we always end up on the bathroom floor?  - Oh, I don't know. - I don't  But I'm glad that we always do.      I don't want to say it to you.  Okay.          It's hard sometimes.  This is America.  You should learn how to speak English.            Â¿SÃ­?                              So, Daddy called because he said you're upset about something.  Yeah.  Why do some people not want Bisa in this country?  Well, that's actually a really good question  and a really hard question  because this country was founded by people  who came from all over, like your great-grandma,  because they dreamed of a better life with more opportunity.                  But some people, well, they can't see that,  and that's just a stinky, old fact.  That is stinky.          But no one is taking Bisa away,  so you don't have to worry about that at all, okay?  Okay. Come on, Mr. Sweetface,  let's go change you before bed.  (grunts) Kiss.  (phone beeps)  (Jane chuckles)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: âChuck and Iâ? Ouch.                              Hmm?    Rogelio.    I'm sorry for canceling on you and lying to you.  I just realized  that I wanted to do things differently this time.  Oh, my God, oh, my God, I'm going to faint.  Who knew when we first said âI love youâ on Beach Day  I love you, Xiomara.  I love you, too, Rogelio.  That we'd end up here.  (sighs)  We've been through so much together  and so much without each other.  And life is beautiful and hard,  and the only thing I know for sure  is that I want to go through it all with you.  I had Botox this morning,  so the tears are struggling to fall,  but I feel them.  It belonged to my father.  Rogelio de la Vega,  will you marry me?  (chuckles)  Yes, yes, of course I will.  (cries)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, what can I say?  Every single time these two get engaged, it gets me.  All right, let's keep this romance train rolling.  Jane.  I'm so happy you're here.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on, give him a try, Jane.  Try to get to know him.  Well, our date was interrupted, so  I'm just really glad that you made up with your friend Lina.  Friendship is everything to me.  That's a really great quality.  (chuckles)  I thought you said you never read 1984.  I hadn't, but after our conversation I bought it.  I'm almost finished.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Like I said, people can surprise you.  How do you not have a corkscrew?  Well, I had it.  I just lost it when I was drunk.  Your album?  You can't just throw that out there.  You sing? Are you good?  No, I'm terrible,  but that doesn't matter when you're famous.  It's all sound engineers, I swear.  Sing this next verse.  (off-key):  Mi corazÃ³n en fuego   Tus labios deseo.   Yes!  - Victory. - Wow.  You really are amazing at checkers.  So, yeah, I waited until marriage  and I'm glad that I did, but now  Things are different.  I understand.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is it just me,  or does this sort of feel like one of those nights?  So, have you ever been in love?  Once  but then I got famous  and people became different.  That's why I decided to put sex on the back burner for a while  to prioritize what I really want love.  Plus, I wanted to get in better with the big guy.  Jesus.  (laughs)  I love your laugh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know, the kind that goes on forever.  Well, who knows?  But it certainly was a night of possibilities  for some people.  Hi, you've reached Petra Solano. Please leave a message.  (voice mail beeps)  Hey, um  look, I know when you asked me before, I denied it,  but the truth is  I do have feelings for you.  And I know you are with Chuck  but I don't know, I guess I'm calling  because I wanted to say, before it's too late,  that you shouldn't be.  You should be with me.  I loved Scott.  Like I be telling you, I wouldn't kill him.  I would want to kill whoever killed him.  Rip them to pieces.  Ooh, that's enough.  So, there's nothing you're not telling us?  Scott's burn book mentioned someone named J.P.  Do those initials mean anything to you?  Oh, you mean Jerky Pants?  What?  J.P. is short for Jerky Pants.  It's what we used to call the horrible man  who wanted to buy hotel next door  because he was always eating jerky of the gators.  Wait.  Chuck Chesser is J.P.?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no, but Chuck is with  Like I said, people can surprise you."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All righty, to catch you up: as a child,  Jane's grandmother taught her to protect her flower.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But now our Jane was ready to have her first fling.  With Fabian. But then she learned that he's  - I'm sort of saving myself. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah,  she wasn't expecting that.  And she thought she'd end it,  but then she had the best night ever.  Seriously, it was epic. And, speaking of epic,  Xo and Ro are engaged! To each other this time.  Oh, and Rafael declared his love for Petra.  I do have feelings for you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But she missed the call.  Because she was with her new boyfriend, Chuck,  who might have killed Scott.  Scott's burn book mentioned someone named J.P.  Those initials mean anything to you?  ""J.P."" is short for ""jerky pants.""  It's what we used to call the horrible man who wanted  to buy hotel next door because he was always  eating jerky of the gators.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: FYI: that weirdo's  her twin sister. But that's not the point.  The point is that Petra could be in real danger.  So, yeah love, sex, danger.  Let's get to it already.  You may or may not be surprised to hear this,  but young Jane Gloriana Villanueva  had a recurring nightmare  throughout her childhood.  - (cackling) - (Jane screams)  All the way into her teen years.  Yup. That damn flower.  Couple that with Jane's tendency to romanticize,  and, well, it often led  to our Jane getting a little ahead in her relationships.  So after a night like last night,  well, it's no wonder the next day she felt like  I'm just taking it slow and seeing where it goes.  You know? No expectations.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. I wasn't expecting that.  There was a time where you'd be  writing your wedding vows after a night like that.  Yeah, well, you know, that was a long time ago.  For now, we're just getting to know each other.  - (phone vibrates) - Oh.  Hang on, it's Jeremy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Her bro editor.  - Hey. - JEREMY: Tick, tick, tick,  boom! Huge news, J.V.  How would you feel about writing  a guest column for Cosmopolitan online?  A-A column? Really?  It's a good angle.  What it's like to be dating  as a widow at 28.  If you're up for writing about that?  Yes. I-I definitely am.  And, actually, it's perfect timing,  - because I just started dating. - JEREMY: Boom! Kismet.  Slay the column and you'll build some surefire buzz  for your book. And remember,  Cosmo's pretty sexy, so  don't shy away from the hotness.  I will slay it and I will bring the hotness.  I'm writing a column!  Ooh, like Sex and the City?  Yes. I am so Carrie Bradshaw.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm a Miranda. I know,  most people are surprised.      What?!  Son of a      (sighs) I just don't want it to be sad and dark, you know?  Totally. It should be fun,  breezy, romantic.  You told her?  We agreed to tell her together.  What?  No, I didn't, weirdo,  we were talking about something else.  - Oh. Well, carry on then. - JANE: No, hey, hey  what didn't you want her to tell me?  BOTH: We're getting married!  What?!  I proposed last night.  You did?  With your grandpa's ring.  Oh  I wanted to do things differently, and  I love your dad  and I know he's the one for me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No need to romanticize this moment.  I'm just so happy.  (giggles, cries)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It was absolutely perfect.  (sniffles) Oh.  Okay  how huge?  Richard Branson's private island?  Or did Elon Musk finally return your calls  and you guys are getting married in space?  First of all, Elon Musk always returns my calls  after a very tasteful interval,  just as one would expect from a very busy man. Mm-hmm.  Secondly,  we've decided to  do something small and intimate.  We're both in our 40s.  Very early 40s.  And Rogelio's done the whole big wedding thing  a few times already.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, Oprah's pretty sick  of buying him toasters.  And I really don't want one.  And you're okay with that?  It's fine.  I just want to marry your mom.  Again.  Rogelio. We need you on set.  On my way, Rudy.  Now I must try to wipe this joy off my face.  We're about to shoot a very tense and dramatic scene.  The key: never blinking.  It announces to everyone how focused and intense you are.  And a bit scary.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, yeah,  this is making me very tense.  Well, that and the hunting rifle in the backseat.  And the fact that we just found out he's the mysterious J.P.  who might have killed Scott.  Sorry, I must have dozed off.  No problem, darling.  We've still got a ways to go.  Can I use your charger?  Oh, I don't have one for the truck.  Whoa! What are you doing?  - Where are we going? - I know a shortcut.  Why so jumpy?  'Cause I only have 72 hours  to figure out who this J.P. guy is  before Anezka's forced to take that plea deal.  Hence the shortcut.  Next question?      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on, Jane.  This is your big Sex and the City moment.  What would Carrie do?    JANE: Although it's been three years  and I know it's time to date,  I couldn't help but wonder.  Can I find love again, after loss?  Or has this widow peaked?  RAFAEL: Hey, Jane, you home?  Uh (sighs)  - Mommy! - Oh,  Mr. Sweetface.  Hey, girls.  - Hi. - Hi.  Isn't it Petra's day?  She's away. With her friend Chuck.  Boyfriend, not friend.  - You okay? - Yeah. You know, what can you do?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I don't know, leave a message pouring your heart out?  Okay, I'm gonna get the girls to violin.  Hey, Xo. Congrats on your engagement.  Thanks. We're so excited.  Hey, when are we going wedding dress shopping,  - by the way? - I was thinking I'd go with  the cute white dress I wore to my birthday.  You're not getting a new dress?  I really like that one, and I only wore it once.  So, what are you and Fabian doing tonight?  I don't know. He says he has something planned.  - Ooh. - (squeals)  A surprise. How romantic.  So I thought maybe you could make me a reading list.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm.  Okay, well, knowing Jane,  that could actually be romantic.  A reading list?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I was reaching.  Well, I love Fahrenheit 451,  but I'm almost done.  So what should I read next?  Well, if you want something similar  Catch 22?  Hey, is that a gone-ra? Number books?  - I'm sorry, what? - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'm sorry, what?  Like 1984. Books with numbers in the title.  I-Is that, like, a gone-ra?  Oh. You mean genre.  Oh. I didn't know that the G was silent.  No, the G isn't silent, it's just  Never mind.  Also, I would like to discuss  a couple parts of the book with you.  If you don't mind.    I just think that book burning is wrong.  Yeah. Absolutely.  Freedom of speech isn't about just protecting, you know,  speech that we're comfortable with,  it's about protecting all speech.  - (imitates explosion) - Ha.  That That's genius.  You know, I'm  I'm actually getting pretty tired.  Oh. Well, I get it. My brain hurts too.  So should we pick it up tomorrow morning,  maybe at the library?  Look, Fabian, it's not that I'm not enjoying  this little book club. But I just want to make sure that  you're not into me just because of my brains.  I mean, are you interested in  the other side of me?  You mean butt stuff?  I mean the whole body.  Are you attracted to me?  Of-Of course I'm attracted to you.  Really?  I would love nothing more  than to burn all those books,  lay you down on the ash  and make love to you until you scream with pleasure.  - Ah. - Why do you think I've been  burying myself in books on all our dates?  It's because otherwise  I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off you.  Oh. Okay.  I just wanted to make sure that romance was still on the table.  I want you on the table.  No, I know what I said about  waiting, but with you, Jane, I I just can't wait.  I want to make love to you. Right now.  Are you sure? I mean, you don't have to do this.  I know I don't have to. I want to.  Are you serious?  I'm so very serious.  Let's make love, Jane.  Oh. Uh, great. Okay. Let me just go Oh.  Um, powder my nose.  And then we can make love.  (chuckles)  - (exhales) - JANE: Okay.  You're having your fling.  It's about damn time.  You can do this. It's not a big deal.    (phone vibrates)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: My God,  is that woman psychic?  Abuela?  -  - MATEO: Mommy!  -  - MATEO: I want my mommy!    -  - MATEO: I need you, Mommy!    No, it's okay, I'll be right home.  Sorry to do this,  but I have to go  Whoa! Oh (short chuckle)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hello, Mr. Big.  Uh  Uh Um, uh  I hope it is clear now I am very attracted to you.  Oh, yes, it is, thank you.  But I-I  I have to take a rain check. Mateo needs me at home.  Oh, no. Is-Is everything all right?  Oh yeah, it was just a bad dream,  but, you know, he was r-really upset  and, um, asking for me.  And, as a mother, you know, duty calls.  - Of course. Motherhood is a sacred duty. - Yes, right.  So if y-you don't mind grabbing me my purse?  It's just right next to your  - your penis. - Oh.  - Yeah. - Yes. Here you go.  - (both chuckle) - And I'll call to check in.  But if you're too busy being a mother  and you can't answer, it's okay.  - I understand. - Thank you.  Poor Mr. Sweetface. What happened, huh?  You had a bad dream?  - Yeah. It was so scary. - Oh.  You want to tell Mommy about it?  What does ""artificial"" mean?  Artificial. That's a big word. Um  It means not real, or natural. Why?  Timmy at school said his parents  told him I'm artificial.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh.  A little early to have the all  ""accidentally artificially inseminated"" convo.  Well, that's just silly. All kids  - are real. - How are babies made?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And this convo.  Well, it's Hmm.  There there is an egg inside the mommy.  And a  little  swimmer that the daddy has.  And when the two get together  How do the egg and the swimmer get together?  Oh.  Well  usually Mommy and Daddy  give each other a special hug.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah. The special hug.  Classic.  Can I ask another question?  Of course.  Do ants have bones?  Oh, no.  (laughs)  Ants do not have bones.  They are invertebrates,  another big word.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And crisis averted.  Well, one crisis, anyway.  I get it, Princess and the Pea, it ain't your penthouse.  It's fine. I grew up with less.  But you're mad.  Yes, I'm mad.  'Cause you got us lost. And the stupid bar was closed.  - Who closes a bar at midnight? - Who doesn't call first?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A guy who doesn't want you to get there.  I should've gone with Rafael's P.I.  A professional would've called ahead of time before driving  for eight hours and ending up in the middle of nowhere.  Yeah, I guess I screwed up again.  No.  I'm sorry. Uh, it's just my nerves are fried,  because I need this J.P. thing to lead somewhere so I can  get my sister out of jail and then out of the country  and everything can just go back to normal.  I'll get the rest of the stuff out of the truck.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now's your chance. Run!  Forget the phone and get out of there!  (sighs)      RAFAEL: Hey, uh, it's me. Quick question.  The twins' dojo called asking if we want  to sign them up for the next session.  Look, I know when you asked me before,  I denied it, but the truth is,  I do have feelings for you.  And I know, you are with Chuck But I don't know  I guess I'm calling because I wanted to say,  before it's too late that you shouldn't be.  You should be with me.  (knocking)  Sorry to bother you, Mr. Solano,  but we're looking for Chuck Chesser.  He's with Petra. They're out of town.  - What's going on? - DANA: We need to question him about  Scott Archuletta's murder.  We have reason to believe Chuck is J.P.  (phone buzzing)  (door opens)  - Something wrong? - No.  - (door closes) - What's with the gun?  I don't want my truck broken into.  Bad neighborhood.  Anyway, I reek like an old swamp possum.  Let's hope they got hot water in this place.  Want to join me?  I think I'll let you get the swamp possum off first.  - (chuckling) - Say, do you have any clothes in there?  I want to change.  Knock yourself out.  Everything's definitely been washed in the last two years.  (chuckling)  (water running in shower)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait. Those shells look familiar.  Oh, my God.  (quietly): Oh, my God.  (phone chimes)          (phone buzzes)  I-I'm with Chuck. I think he killed Scott.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Finally!  Where are you?  At some dumpy motel near Pensacola.  The-the the Copper Palms.  It's off the old highway, exit  There's no hot water in this hell hole.  Oh, God, what exit was it?!  He's coming out of the shower.  We're talking to the Pensacola police.  - Get out of there! - Okay. Okay.  Get out of there now!  Where do you think you're going?  I just needed some fresh air.  (sighs)  We need to talk.  I'm not feeling chatty.  Look  I've been lying to you.  About Scott.  I did know him.  I already know that. J.P.  What?  (groaning)  (whimpering) Petra!  - (mumbles) - (screaming)  Come here.  - (screaming) - Look, Petra!  Just listen to me!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or at least pretend to listen  to buy yourself some freaking time  so the police can get there!  I'm listening.  I'm not a killer.  I just knew the guy, that's all.  - How? - When I was looking to buy the Fairwick  a few years back, I needed someone  to help me get some inside information.  No! Continue from over there.  Anyway,  afterwards, I paid him.  Deal's done, right? No.  Little weasel upped his price.  So I called off the deal, called him  a few colorful names, end of story.  I have no idea what ""J.P."" means!  You lied to the police in a murder investigation.  And you've been lying to me for months.  You lied, too about the bones, and your lie was worse.  This is not a competition,  and you lied for longer.  And you've been acting jumpy all day.  - 'Cause I was nervous. - Because you're J.P.  - No! - Then why?  Because I'm trying to tell you that I love you!  What?  Yes. All day.  And then everything went wrong,  and I screwed up, and the bar closed.  That's why I've been so nervous.  Chuck  (police siren whoops)  (tires squealing)  OFFICER: Freeze! Police! Hands up.  (tires squealing)  JANE: I can't believe it.  - You think Chuck did it? - RAFAEL: I don't know.  The police are questioning him.  Hey, so why'd the school call?  Mateo's been running around the playground  giving all the girls special hugs  and telling them that they're having his baby.  Ooh.  Ugh. I know. I'll handle it. It's my fault.  You stay with Petra, and please tell her  if she needs anything at all, I'm here.  Thanks. I will.  (sighs)  I'm sure Jane said nice things, but I'm still rattled,  so I can't pretend to be touched right now.  Do you think Chuck did it?  He did lie about knowing Scott.  Yeah, I lied. It was stupid.  But that don't mean I killed him.  - Did you see Mr. Archuletta that night? - No.  I was supposed to, but I swear  on my mama's life, he never showed.  And that shell bracelet?  Identical to a shell found at the crime scene?  I'm getting to that.  I'd been waiting a while,  so I started walking the beach,  having some whiskey.  I saw this lady.  She said she'd kill for a drink,  so I offered her a swig of mine.  We got to talking, I told her  how I bought the hotel next door.  She gave me one of her bracelets.  Said they brought good luck.  - Did you get a good look at her face? - Well, good enough.  I could describe her for you, no problem.  First we'll need, in writing, a guarantee  that you're dropping those other charges against him.  Once you do, he'll be happy to talk to a sketch artist.  JANE: Mateo, stop coloring.  I need you to listen to me.  Hey. Psst.  Do you understand?  You can't go around giving your friends special hugs.  But I wanted to make a baby with my friends.  I know, but to make a baby,  you have to be an adult, and, also,  it's a different type of hug.  Meant for two grown-ups who love each other, not kids.  So you can't make a baby with your friends.  Do you understand?  Special hugs are for grown-ups  who really love each other, not kids.  That's right!  So that's what you and Daddy did to make me?  Um  You know what? Like, if you want me  to come back, maybe I can just Ugh. Okay.  No, it-it's actually  not exactly what happened with us.  So, how was I made?  Hey, you know what?  I forgot that I bought ice cream at the store today.  Do you want some before bed?  Ice cream?! Yes!  (sighs)  I know, I know.  Total parenting fail.  Put it out of your head. Mateo will be fine.  Are you ready?  I am so ready.  Ooh, nice bold lip.  Thank you.  I've gotten over the temporary guilt caused by years of  negative-sex messaging, and I am ready  to celebrate that with Fabian. Naked.  That's my girl! (laughs)  Now come on, show me what you're wearing.  (laughs)  - What do you think? - Ooh, I love!  But you don't have the underwear. Are these Abuela's?  Lingerie hasn't exactly been my priority lately.  Perfect. Then don't wear any.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, Samantha, calm down.  Good idea.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn, mama!  Now, remember,  there's nothing to feel guilty about.  You are two consenting adults  who are on the same page.  (giggling)  (sighs)  (knocking)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: They may be on the same page  Jane.  - You look amazing. - (laughs)  I have a very special surprise for you.  Meet my abuela!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But they were reading  from very different books.        I told you I was so very serious about you.  Mmm. You've got to admit this is the best you've ever had.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Dinner with Fabian.  - And his abuela. - Delicious.  Thank you so much, SeÃ±ora Belen.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Certainly an occasion  when one would rather be wearing underwear.  Let me get that for you!  I'll get it.  (laughing): Oh, just Here you go.        LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean, how much could he have said?  The guy's known Jane for five minutes!  JANE: So as I stood there, waiting to escape,  I started to wonder.  For this widow, should casual dating be left on the shelf?  As if mama's boys aren't bad enough.  Now we're dealing with grandmama's boys?  I'm ending it.  Fabian and I are clearly not on the same page.  Oh, honey, don't end it before you screw him first.  The man has ""Fab"" in his name.  It's like he's advertising that he's great in bed.  (laughs)    You've only dodged the bullet if the bullet is small.  Shh! Salma Hayek can't be hearing these things.  She's a lady.  Ugh. Trust me, there's nothing wrong with casual sex.  I just had sex in the bathroom.  Turns out hand sanitizer makes great lube.  (laughter)      What kind of girl is that, Ma?  The kind who has a healthy relationship with sex?  You're the one who needs to stop.  Your shame-flower has done enough damage.            Do you?  No. I don't. At all.  But it definitely affected the way I feel about sex now.  And not in the best way.  But that's beside the point, because now that I know  that Fabian and I are not on the same page,  I cannot keep seeing him.  I- support your decision. Thanks, Dad.  Just don't break his heart  until after we shoot our big action sequence.  I need him focused.  He's a nightmare with continuity.  He can never do the same thing twice.  He doesn't appreciate how important  it is that shots match.  Audiences notice these things!  - Okay, okay, I'll come by later. - What time are you guys done?  - At 3:00. - (phone buzzing)  Aha! My assistant got us an appointment at 4:00  on Tuesday, Miami Municipal.  You guys are getting married in the courthouse?  Is that what you want, Mom?  Yes.  Trust me, I was never the kind of girl  who dreamed of a big fancy wedding.    You saved this thing? Mm.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Before she became Slutty Crystal I hope.        Mm.      After we got engaged, we were talking.  So, listen, I know you're gonna want a wedding  at the Taj Mahal or something.  They don't do weddings. I checked before.  And I actually don't think we should do another big wedding.  It will remind Jane of hers.  That's exactly what I was gonna say.    He wants to know about his parents.  - It makes sense. - RAFAEL: I know.  - So we should tell him. - JANE: How? I mean, it's not  your typical birds-and-bees story.  We'll do it together.  And we'll just figure out some kid-friendly version.  Okay.  Come over tonight.  And wish me luck.  I got to go break up with a telenovela star.  - Ooh, your muscles! -   Oh, stop.  - They aren't that big. - Oh, wow. (laughs)  Jane! Hi!  Please, tell our American audience, who is this?  That is Jane my lady.  REPORTER: Oh. Wow. Is it serious?  FABIAN: Oh, it's so serious!  - Yes! - I can't believe how happy you seem!  That's because Jane is the most amazing woman I have ever met!  We're head over heels for each other!  - Really? - Yes! I'm crazy about this woman!  (whoops) LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, buddy.  That's risky business right there.  Oh, God, I can't watch. I wish my eyes were wide shut.  This is far and away the most embarrassing thing  I've ever seen.  What the hell was that?  I couldn't help it. I'm just so into you.  And everyone loved it when Tom Cruise did it.  Okay, Fabian, h-here's the thing.  There's been a massive misunderstanding.  I'm not actually  serious about you.  What?  I was asking if you were serious about having sex.  Because that's all that I'm serious about.  But you're not serious about me as a person?  Well, I  But I just performed a Tom Cruise for you!  I didn't ask you to!  And-and who does that for someone  they've only known for a week?  Some who's passionate and excited.  - And way over the top. - Over the top?!  You know what? I'm glad I didn't make love to you.  Well, I'm glad I didn't make love to you!  Well, you wouldn't be saying that  if I had made love to you!  (shouts)  (shouts)  - Hey. Hey, no - (laughing)  no jumping on the furniture, Mateo.  No matter how much you love Mommy.  (chuckles)  Can I stay in here until I fall asleep?  Sure, but just for tonight.  - (grunts) - (sighs)  So, instead of reading you a story,  tonight, Daddy and I want to tell you a very special story  about how our family came to be.  It's an unusual story,  because, usually, parents meet first  and then fall in love  and then they have a baby.  But in our family, the order was different.  Because you came first.  And it's because of you that Mommy and Daddy came together  and love each other.  This  is your Auntie Luisa.  So, Auntie Luisa  used to be your mommy's doctor.  And then, one day,  she was just  really distracted.  Like, you know when we tell you to pay attention?  Well, she wasn't paying attention.  And Mommy fell asleep.  And then Aunt Luisa  put Daddy's little swimmers in me,  because she thought I was somebody else.  Oh, my gosh!  (chuckling): Oh, my gosh. I know.  And that became you.  - Mm. - Yeah. And if you think about that,  if you think about all the things that had to happen,  that's pretty amazing.  Like a miracle?  (chuckles)  Yes.  Like a miracle.  Can you both scratch my back?  (chuckles) Yeah. Of course, Mr. Sweetface.  Oh.  Stay until I'm really asleep.  Don't sneak out.  Okay, buddy. We're not going anywhere,  - okay? - Uh-huh.        (chuckles)              I'm still up.  I wish we all lived together.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But, alas, this is a telenovela.  Which brings us here. Now.  Jane! Can I talk to you for a second?  To the big telenovela blessing!  Look, the clip of me jumping on the couch has gone viral.  All the press is here. It'll be completely humiliating  if we don't seem like we're here together.  So you want me to pretend?  Just for tonight. And then, after the blessing,  I'll do a fade-out on my Instagram.  Please, Jane. I don't want to be humiliated.  Fine. Just this once.  (exhales)  (sighs)                  (soft chuckling)  That was the hugest gesture of love.  Jane, how did you feel about Fabian's Tom Cruise moment?  (chuckling)  - I thought it was sweet. - (chuckles)  - Like sa-weet! - (chuckles)  How about you do a little couch jump and we can get a picture?  Oh, I-I really don't want to.  Oh, come on, the fans would love it.  (chuckles nervously)  I prefer to do my couch jumping in private.  (chuckles)  Ay, come on, mi amor, just one little hop!  Sorry, sweetie. It's just that my ankle hurts again.  I'd actually like to sit down.  Of course. Let me carry you.  Oh, no, you don't have to do that! (chuckling)  (chuckling)  - What are you doing? - Saving face.  (stammers, grunts)  I thought you were gonna help me out!  I am trying. But I'm not gonna jump up and down  - on the furniture. - Why not?  Because I don't want to make a fool out of myself.  (gasps)  So that's what I did? Well-well, I am sorry for expressing  - my feelings. - Come on, that is not what I meant.  This is such a disaster! What am I gonna tell the press?  And my abuela! You're exactly the kind of girl  that she wanted me to fall for.  (chuckles) Well, you didn't.  - I did. - No,  you love the idea of me,  a good girl that you can introduce to your grandma.  Exactly! So what's the problem?  The problem is the whole Madonna-whore paradigm is reductive.  I am a real person who you know nothing about.  So I'm sorry if this makes you embarrassed,  but I am not going to do any more interviews  about this fake relationship.      JORGE: Wow.    Mm-hmm.          (chuckles softly)      Mm.              (exhales)    (chuckles)  (exhales)    (grunts)    (chuckles)              LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the joy of telenovelas.  (sighs) Can I hide out from Fabian with you guys  - for a minute? - (chuckles)    (groans, sighs)  (indistinct chatter)  Why won't they have a real wedding?  I don't get it.    Sorry. I know I'm being selfish.  I just want to celebrate.  (exhales, chuckles)  You do?  We didn't think you'd want another big Rogeliwedding  because it would remind you of Michael.  Well, that's sweet, but come on!  The whole ""parents getting together"" thing is kind of  a dream come true, right?  I want to celebrate that. So go crazy.  Yes. (squeals)  But not too crazy.  - (chuckles) - Fabian, I'm not going to  I-I want to apologize.  Please?  So, I Googled  ""Madonna-whore paradigm"" and ""reductive,""  and I think I know what you're getting at.  I did see you as the type of person  that I could only date in a serious way.  But now I know that you don't want something serious.  No, I-I don't.  I just wanted a fling.  And I get that now.  I just put a lot of stuff on you.  Hey, I made assumptions about you, too.  You know? Because you're so sweet and hot  and I-I just  really wanted to have sex with you.  Well, I really wanted to have sex with you, too.  Yeah? I still do.  And I guess I could always start over next month.  Start over with what?  My no sex pledge.  It's been a month?  Um, 33 days.  So a month and a half.  - Huh. - Yeah.  But I do want to wait if it's going to be serious.  But now I know that, between you and me, there's nothing serious.  Just  chemical attraction.  Hmm.  Physical.  Mm.  Bodies  on bodies.  Yeah.  That's all I want. (clears throat)  Just sexual.  Exactly.  So  Huh. Mm.  Let's do it.  Huh.  Okay, maybe just once.  You won't say that after we're done.  (chuckles)  So, should we meet at my place in 30 minutes?  Make it 15.  - (exhales) - (panting)  Okay, I really want to have sex but I'm panicking a little,  so I just need you to talk me into it.  - On it. Go. - This time, we're both on the same page.  Definitely. Just sex. No strings.  Which is exactly what I want right now.  And do you really mean that  or are you trying to psych yourself up?  I-I really mean it.  (door opens)  Then why are you sitting here?  I think it's that stupid flower.  So I just need you to tell me I shouldn't feel guilty.  There is absolutely nothing to feel guilty about.  Now, if you don't go have sex with that  obscenely hot telenovela star,  your mother will never forgive you.  Thanks, Ma.  Okay, now get out of the car!  (chuckles)  - (exhales) - (door shuts)  Oh. There you are. Okay, I have some preliminary wedding ideas.  Totally off the cuff.  You know, I might have some ideas, too.  But of course. I welcome them.  - In moderation. - (chuckles)  (chuckles)  Mwah.  You look so beautiful.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And while someone was spying on Rogelio,  across town, Jane only had eyes for Fabian.  Sorry. That's no good.  But Sex and the City never had to deal  with these drastic tone shifts.  (moaning, panting)  W-Wait, wait.  - (grunts) - Just checking,  - one last time, this means nothing. - (panting)  - We've talked enough! (grunting) - Oh  (moaning)  - (sighs, chuckles) - Way to be Samantha, Jane.  (grunting)  (moaning)  They really are on the same page.  Well, many pages.  I don't know what these books are about,  but I can tell you this story had a happy ending.  - (pants) - You can stay over if you want.  (exhales)  I think I'm ready to head home, actually.  - (keys clacking) - JANE: So if you're still asking,  can a non-casual dater start dating casually?  The answer is  Oh, yes! Yes!  Yes!  I did it!  I had casual sex with Fabian,  and I didn't feel guilty about it.  I know this is a really weird thing for me to call you about.  No, it's great. I'm-I'm happy for you.  But, uh, listen, I got to go. I'm-I'm with Petra.  Oh, of course. Go, go.  Talk tomorrow?  Definitely.  (sighs)  (sighs)  I'm fine.  And I'm gonna go home.  You sure?  Yes.  Oh, and, yes, we should definitely sign  the kids back up for karate.  What?  Uh  nothing.  You heard my message.  I meant what I said.  I want to be with you.  Rafael  It'll be different this time.  We're different.  We can make this work.  We've grown so much.  Please, Petra,  say yes.  - (rapid knocking) - DENNIS: Mr. Solano.  It's Detective Chambers.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh, the police!  What terrible timing!  What could be so important?  We just got the composite sketch of the woman Chuck Chesser saw  on the beach the night of Scott's murder.  - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God.  Oh, my God."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Welcome back, friends.  You'll recall we last left our Jane,  yup, having a fling  with the very sexy Fabian.  And, yes, it's that Fabian,  as in Rogelio's costar in Los Viajes De Guillermo.  Onscreen, he plays his rival.  His teeny-tiny rival.  But you know what wasn't tiny?  Rogelio's happiness.  Because he finally got engaged to Xiomara, again!  And they had decided on a wedding  to match their love.  Go crazy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of big love,  Rafael was feeling it for Petra,  - and so he told her. - I want to be with you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But Petra, well, she just wasn't sure.  - I know, buzz-kill, right? - (knock at door)  And then they were interrupted by the cops,  who said they knew who killed Scott, and it was  (needle scratches on record)  Actually, you'll find that out soon enough.  One last bit of backstory on Rafael.  Sure, he's rich, but things haven't always  been easy for him.  A long time ago, he had cancer.  And remember his sister Luisa?  Well, she was dating Rose,  aka the crime lord Sin Rostro.  Though in public, Rose wore a mask, and looked like this.  I know! Straight out of a Telenovela, right?  Which, of course, this is, after all.  Once upon a time, there was a little girl  who believed in once upon a time.  ""And the glass slipper fit Cinderella's foot perfectly.""  That's right.  From a young age, Jane Gloriana Villanueva believed  in the magic of fairy tales.  ""And so they got married and lived""  Happily ever after.  The end.  But as time went on,  Jane exchanged that for a more realistic perspective.  -  - ""And so they got married and lived""  uh, together as husband and wife.  Uh, and they had their ups and downs,  and they faced difficult times  where their relationship was tested,  but they stuck through it,  because they knew that relationships take work  and, you know, life doesn't always work out perfectly.  The end.  Oh, and the princess had her own fulfilling career  outside the monarchy.  The Cinderella we're doing at school has a different ending.  Well, there can be lots of different endings,  that's what makes the story so great.  So, yeah. By now, Jane was over the whole fairy tale thing.  Okay, I'm ready.  Hit me with the wedding deets.  The theme is a fairy tale come to life.  Yeah, apparently Rogelio didn't get the memo.  Oh, wow, look at that.  Doves, sure.  Ha. Fireworks.  A carriage pulled by white horses.  And this is what you want?  Because it's your day, too.  The white horses happened to be your mother's idea.  I always thought I was too old,  that I missed out on the whole princess window,  but your dad convinced me  it's not too late,  and I started to think about how fun it would be  to wear the whole, big poofy dress, and  Unless you think I'll look silly.  I-I don't want to look silly.  I don't think you'll look silly.  I think you'll look beautiful.  Okay.  So, I'd like to ask you,  officially,  will you be my maid of honor?  Yes, of course. I would officially love to.  And I am ready to take care of your every bridal need.  Oh, wow.  That's a you're, are you, you're wearing a tiara?  No, this is for you.  I'm wearing a crown.       JANE: A yacht, too. (short chuckle)  Wow.  And all this is happening in two weeks.  Has to. We are all slaves  to the television schedule.  That's when my show goes on break.  But we already hired, uh, Jean Luc,  the best wedding planner around.  He has secured vendors,  fireworks, Malaysian doves    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here we go    Well  He created me, so, a very big role.    Ah. Ideally, Ricky Martin.    XIOMARA: Mom    We're not getting married in a church by a priest.    JANE: Okay, you know what, Abuela?  In my official capacity as maid of honor,  I'll remind you: it's their day.  Ooh, burn!  JANE: No, it wasn't  a burn.  (imitates sizzling)  I love you, Alba, but I have to go.  It is my last night shoot until after the wedding,  and it is murder on my skin.  Milady.  Until we meet again.  (phone rings, door closes)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, Fabian.  To catch you up: Once upon a time,  Jane had the most perfect fling ever.  Amazing sex with absolutely no strings attached.  She and Fabian  were on exactly the same page,  making things easy and uncomplicated.  So, yeah. I'm just messing with you.  I mean, the sex was good, don't get me wrong.  But then  -  - So, I should really go.  No.  Just five more minutes.  Uh you said that already. (short chuckle)  I know.  But time goes too fast with you.  Two more minutes?  Boop.  Fabian obviously still wants some kind of relationship.  So are you gonna end it with him?  Yeah. I have to.  (phone chimes)    Oh, but a part of me is just hoping  that he'll take a hint and fade away.  - (phone chimes) - (sighs)    Ooh. Yeah, he's not gonna take the hint.  I know. I have to tell him.  Yeah, well, do it soon.  It's a little selfish to not let someone know  where you're at, emotionally.  Petra still hasn't given you an answer?  No. She says she's still thinking it over.  But, I mean, how much longer? It's been a week.  That sucks. But it is a really big decision.  I know. And I respect that.  But if she brings it up, could you just  tell her you think it's a good idea?  - What? - You know, I just  If she brings it up at brunch or  I really don't want to get in the middle of this.  Mateo, hurry up, we got to go.  No, you're right, totally.  You you should stay out of it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now  I just can't decide.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: to their most awkward brunch  in their three years of brunches.  Well, by all means, please, take your time.  Well, I'm trying to decide. It's not like I'm not trying to.  Here, have a pancake. Last week you had eggs.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Do you think they're really talking about breakfast?  Okay, everybody with sticky hands, stand up  We're washing.  Mine are the stickiest.  Oh, come on, Mateo!  - I got him. - (sighs)  (whispering): Talk to her.  (mouths)  Can we talk?  Oh, um, yeah, sure. About?  Oh, stop it, I know he told you about his big declaration.  So what do you think about all this?  I think it's between you two.  That's ridiculous. You always have an opinion.  This is the one time I actually want it.  I'm staying out of it.  No matter how nicely you ask.  I have no opinion.  Of course I have an opinion.  It's a horrible idea.  Actually, that's not even an opinion,  it's just a fact.  They're terrible together. Volatile, mean.  And now there are kids involved. And two families.  Who are in really good places.    Nope.  Not my place.      - (doorbell rings) - (gasps)  That must be Jean Luc.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah yes, the famed wedding planner.  Oh, hi.  I didn't realize that there were two of you.  My parents will be here any minute,  they're just stuck in traffic.      So how long  have you two been planning weddings together?      Ugh.  (both speaking French)  Eight years.  Oh, wow.  Well, I can tell you a little about what they want.  I'm sure you heard that they're going for  - the full fairy tale. - Ugh.  - Hate it. - What?  Your mother can't do fairy tale.  - She's too old. - I have to agree.  And we never agree.  Well, I don't agree.  And, more importantly, she doesn't agree.  It's what she wants.  She'll look, uh, ridiculous in a poofy dress.  Totally, uh, ridiculous.  Well, you're entitled to your opinion,  of course, but I'd really rather  you not say that in front of my mom.  Of course we'll say it, that's what we're being paid for.  She has her heart set on this.  We'll have our names on it.  - I don't care! - (car approaches)  Look, they're here. My mom  wants a full fairy tale wedding, and neither of you  are gonna make her feel bad about that. Got it?  - Got it. - Understood.  (exhales)  Oh, wait, what? Wait, where-where are you going?  We cannot work like this.  JEAN: I have to agree. And we  - never agree. - (stammers)  Oh, hi, hello, sorry we're late.  - What'd we miss? - Oh, we quit.  Creative differences? What didn't they like?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Your age.  I don't know. I'm-I'm sorry.  It was my fault. I was pushy.  - No, it's fine. - Totally fine.  Just the wedding is so soon.  Yeah, and Jean Luc had great deals with vendors.  So it's not fine?  We'll hire someone else. Who cares what it costs?  No, we have to stay in our budget. It's already huge.  Maybe we can plan it ourselves.  I can't plan a wedding with my shooting schedule.  Rogelio  This is not the time for budgets!  I'll do it.  I'm done with my novel.  I have time. Plus, you already know the vendors you want  to use, it's just a matter of organizing and negotiating,  which I can do.  Let me do this for you.  As your maid of honor.  Okay, if you insist.  (exhales)  I am entrusting this to you.        Hey, Krishna, can you add karate pick-up for me  - at 3:30? - You'll be cutting it close,  you've got your appointment with Dr. Osmani.  Uh, just reschedule that.  Your oncologist? You can't reschedule.  It's just my annual screening.  I know, and you can't push it.  Just tell the doctor I'll be 15 late.  Great.  Oh, and your sister called.  What? Why didn't you tell me?  She said she'd call you back at 2:30 sharp.  Go, run, run!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know what you're thinking:  run where? What's going on?  Well, remember this?  We just got the composite sketch of the woman  Chuck Chesser saw on the beach the night of Scott's murder.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Here's what you didn't see.  Chuck Chesser clearly described your sister's girlfriend.  PETRA: Eileen?  She killed Scott?  RAFAEL: It must be connected to Rose.  I knew my sister was still involved with her.  Luisa,  hi.  LUISA: Rafael, hey!  Uh, it's-it's good to hear from you.  Um, I You know, I've been trying to get in touch.  I know. I got your message.  We haven't had great reception.  We're in the desert.    RAFAEL: Yeah. No, no, no, I-I get it.  Um, but, uh, look, I called because,  you know, we still need to have that board meeting  and, you know, you just you just ran off.  (sighs) I know, I'm really sorry,  but we'll come back soon, okay?  Well, how soon? Uh, I can't You know,  I can't plan a meeting without a firm date.  I'll let you know, but right now  - I have to go. - No.  - Uh, wait. - I have to.  The camels are here, the tour is starting.  Wait.  No, uh, just I just want to know why'd you leave?  It was so sudden. Did I-did I do something?  Of course not.  We'll catch up later, okay?  Sorry.  But it's it's hard.  You know that I want to have  a better relationship with him.  And you know that we have to make sure  he's not working with the cops.  He's not.  Trust me, I know my brother.  Were you able to trace it?  No.  Hopefully she comes back to town soon.  We can't go back anytime soon.  Come on.  We can go anywhere else  in the world. Hmm?  I'll even put on that uncomfortable mask.  JANE: I booked your makeup and hair  and I got the caterers to go down $20 a head  as long as Dad moves off that whole thing  about all the desserts being lavender.  Brr Oh, and one thing: the horses. For the carriage.  It's short notice and it turns out white horses are really  hard to come by. I found a speckled horse  that's Oh  You're disappointed?  I know it's dumb,  but I-I've always pictured white horses.  It's absolutely not dumb.  I will find you white horses.  Thank you. White will just pop more,  - you know? - Oh, it sure will.  (knocking at door)  Oh, that better not be Jean and Luc  trying to get their job back,  because I am killing it on my own.  Hi. So I need to talk to you about this Rafael situation.  Petra, look  And I don't care if you don't want to be in the middle. I need  to talk this over with someone and you're my only real friend.  So I don't know what to do. I mean,  according to your mom's bridal magazine, we're doomed.  ""Do you bring out the best in each other?""  No, definitely not.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. To recap  Petra and Rafael's fairy tale        I mean, it took so long to get over him, Jane.  I know.  And now he wants to open all that up again?  How is that fair?  Plus, we were terrible together.  Is he forgetting that?  And now we have this good relationship.  And these two great, happy kids.  When I think about messing all that up,  I mean, it just  doesn't seem worth it.  Right?  What do you think?  I think  that makes a lot of sense.  ROGELIO: It is absolutely worth it.  No, it's not.  The cakes aren't gonna be lavender, get over it.  We have to move quickly, you're getting married so soon.  Now listen, I want to go over some st  Oh. Aw, shoot.  Why are you avoiding Fabian?  I have to end it and I'm kind of dreading it.  I know, I know, I'll do it.  What, why are you staring at me?  Just are you 100% sure you want to break up with him?  - Yes. - (short whimper)  What did you do?  I dropped off an invitation to the wedding.  What? Why?  I thought it was going great  and you'd want to bring him.  Oh Ooh.  - Okay, well, has he seen it yet? - No.  I-I put it in his dressing room. And we're about to shoot.  (knocking at door)  Ah!  (exhales)  (gasps)  Jane?  - What - Hi.  Hi. I was just grabbing my phone.  You're probably wondering why I'm in here.  Well, I assume it's to make love.  Let's do it, they'll wait on set.  Oh, no, no, you can keep your shirt on.  I'm not here for that.  Well-well, then why are you here?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when she saw it.  Oh, yes, my last show.  Thanks to the trainer I became a very good rider. I love horsies.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, it felt like  one of those twists of fate  you only find in fairy tales.  Or telenovelas.  And do you still know the horsie trainer?  Oh yes, we go riding at least once a month.  Wow. Because, as it happens,  I am in the market to rent some white horses  just like that one.  That's great. My friend will help you out for sure.  Oh, thank you.  Of course. Anything for my special lady.  So, why are you here again?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And at that moment, our heroine weighed her options.  To give you this invitation to my parents' wedding.  You want me to go with you?  I sure do.  Oh, I'd love to.  Yay! (laughs) I'm so glad!    Of course I feel guilty using Fabian  and his equine connections.    But it's for a good cause.  It's not every day that my parents get married.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True. This is only  their second marriage and third engagement.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that if Fabian understood  how much it means to me to give my parents the perfect wedding,  he wouldn't even mind.  Okay, fine, he'd be pissed.  But it's not like I'm gonna keep having sex with him.      I'm not totally lying.  He wants more  a-and I'm open to more if  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He has a personality transplant.  We have a great time at the wedding.  Mm-hmm.      ROGELIO: Be careful with the frown face.  You are too young to get lines.  What's bringing you down?  I just got some pretty heartbreaking news.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: His shirtless scene was cut.  Jane told you, huh?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.  I get it.  Breakups are hard.  But there are other fish in the sea, and  with a chest as powerful as Poseidon himself,  you can catch any of them.  So Jane told you she was going to break up with me?  Of course, we're very close.  Plus, I am great at keeping secrets.  Okay, so in this next shot, Rogelio climbs the vine  to get to the top of the table. Then we push in  on Fabian, and your wheels are turning.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sort of like this.  Got it?  Yeah. I got it.  Perfect.  And action.  (knocking at door)  Rafael.  Can we talk?  You're ready?  Yes.  Sorry. I-It was just a lot.  And, um, surprising.  I know.  But listen, now that I've processed,  I've decided.  I don't want us to go there.  What?  We tried.  It didn't work.  Are you saying you don't have feelings for me?  I'm saying that what we have now is good.  With us, with the kids.  I-If it doesn't work  But if it does  - we could be happy. - We're happy now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sure have a funny way of showing it.  - Petra - Stop.  I thought about it a lot,  I-I talked it over with a friend.  This is better.  For all of us.  JANE: It's not as romantic as Ricky Martin,  but we have to have a backup plan.  Oprah?  - Dad. - Okay, Gayle.  (sighs) I found this Unitarian minister.  She seems really great.  Mom wants to meet her today.  What time can you do?  - 2:00. - Okay, I'll schedule it.  Don't be late, though.  Jane. I'll be there at 2:00.  I know how important it is.  This scene won't take long to shoot.  MRS. TAUB: So, rehearsals  are just running a few minutes long.  They'll be right out, and the kids  are very excited about tomorrow's performances.  - (Jane sighs) - What did you say to Petra?  Uh, what?  Oh, please. She said she talked to a friend.  It was clearly you.  What happened to staying out of it?  She just showed up at my house asking for advice.  - So you sabotaged me? - I didn't sabotage anything.  I hardly talked. I just sat there listening  to all the reasons why she thought it wasn't a good idea.  You were supposed  to tell her all the reasons why you thought that it was.  But I don't think it is.  Well, that's your opinion.  Exactly. And you were the one who asked me to get involved.  (phone rings)  Hi, Krishna.  I have your oncologist on the line with your test results.  (sighs)  Okay. Um, put her through.            I forgot my line.  No problem, let's just go again.  - Okay. - (grunts)  And, action.        I forgot again. I feel so stupid.  You say ""got it.""  That's the whole line.  Got it.  Hey, I just said the line.  Can we shoot now, please?  Um, I'm feeling a little shiny.  Can I get a touch-up?  What are you doing?  You and I both know you never get shiny  because you have perfect skin.  I demand to know what's going on.  What's going on is that your treacherous daughter  is using me for my horsies.  - What are you talking about? - She didn't break up with me,  but thanks to you I know that she was going to.  So let's just say, it's gonna take me a while  to remember the lines.  And you might not make it to your 2:00 appointment.    (sighs)      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.    (sighs)  (phone chimes, goose honks)    (geese honk)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh. Apparently, Fabian's  just led Jane on a wild goose chase.  With nary a golden egg in sight.  What do you mean, Dad never showed up?  Apparently, Fabian kept intentionally  screwing up his lines so Rogelio couldn't leave.  (sighing): Oh, no. This is my fault.  I-I tried to use Fabian for his horses  and now he's taking it out on Dad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A tale as old as time.  (sighs) I am so sorry, Ma.  Don't feel bad.  I'm just stressed and overwhelmed  with all this wedding planning.  I'm actually thinking  maybe we should just skip the stag party tomorrow.  What? No. No way.  The whole thing is my fault and I'm going to fix it.  And there's nothing that you can do or anything.  I just I wanted you to know  that I just got some bad news  from my doctor my annual.  Anyway, I guess,  my cancer is back.  So  call me, okay?  Let's hope she falls for it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean  I did for a minute.  I have to go see him.  It's not a good time.  To have cancer?  I'm going.  Are you coming with me or not?        (sneezes)  Sorry. Allergies.  You don't have allergies.  Yes, I do. I am allergic to terrible acting  and there's a lot of it in the air right now.  - Don't. - DIRECTOR: Cut. Guys, come on.  We've got a lot to shoot today.  Let's reset and go again.  - Jane. - Jane.  Hi.  Fabian, can we talk?  Talk.  Um, look.  I'm sorry.  It was wrong of me to try to use you like that.  But don't blame my dad for what happened between us, blame me.  Oh, I do blame you. I blame you completely.  You're a heartless slut and I wish I'd never met you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Did he just call her a slut?  Did you just call her a slut?  Did you just call me a slut?  Don't you dare  talk to my daughter that way!  Well, you should have never brought your daughter  to the set in the first place.  Tempting me with her goji berries.  ROGELIO: Jane is always welcome on set.  And she can bring any type of berries she wants.  Well, I refuse to continue shooting as long as she's here.  I am Rogelio De la Vega!  You do not want to make an enemy out of me!  JANE: Dad. Please, both of you,  just stop, just calm down.  I will not calm down!  We will fight.  My dad is not going to fight you.  Oh, we're fighting.  - Crew lunch in the parking lot. - (bell rings)  CREW MEMBER: That's lunch.  (cheering)  - No hitting in the face. - Obviously.  - FABIAN: Or the hair. - ROGELIO: Of course.  Everything else is fair game.  I feel like I'm in Jurassic Park about to fight a dinosaur.  When I knock you on your ass  I hope your butt implants don't explode.  FABIAN: That was a necessary procedure  to cushion my weak tailbone.  (Rogelio grunts)  Both of you stop this right now.  You're being ridiculous.  Whoa! Stop this right now!  (shrieks)  What are you doing here? I'm trying to defend your honor.  I don't need you to defend my honor, please, Dad.  Just calm down, I'll handle this.  Listen to me.  I'm sorry about the way that I handled things.  I know I hurt you.  - I clearly meant nothing to you. - Less than nothing.  - Dad. - Coward.  That is not true.  I've only slept with one other man in my whole life.  You're the first person that I slept with  since my husband died.  And trust me, that does mean something.  So please don't fight with my father.  (sighs)  Ah.  No hard feelings?  For the sake of my daughter, I will let bygones be bygones.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw. Jane the peacemaker.  Dad!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa. Looks like Jane's  boxing training with Dennis really paid off.  My nose! I think you broke it!  - My God. I am so sorry. - (groans)  Uh, it was just instinct.  You were gonna punch my dad.  In the face.  That's it. I'm done. I-I can't work with him.  ROGELIO: I can't work with him either.  - It's him or me. - It's him or me.  Girls, come on, hurry up.  We don't want to be late for your performance Oh.  When did you get here?  Uh, just now.  Oh.  Are you okay?  Yep, fine.  No. I'm not fine.  You know what? I don't care if I turned you down.  We're still family and you still have to tell me.  What are you talking about?  I heard you on the phone  telling someone your cancer's back.  What? No.  No. That was just to get Luisa and Eileen back to Miami.  Wh-what?  I'm working with the police, okay?  I just left her the message. I'm fine.  Oh, thank God.  I'm fine.  Girls, come. The stage awaits.  Yay. My shoe fits perfectly.  ELLIE: Let's hug.  And they lived happily ever after.  And they all got good jobs.  The end.  (cheering and applause)  Oh. Good job, buddy.  Girls!  - Daddy. - That was amazing.  - Oh. I'm so proud of you. - (Petra giggles)    Hey, buddy, you were amazing.  You did so great!  MATEO: Thanks. Can I get a cookie?  - Yes, you can. - (smooches)  Go on.  So, um, I'm sorry.  About earlier. You were right.  If I ask you to get involved,  then I have to accept your opinion.  Even if I don't like it.  Thanks.  NETWORK EXECUTIVE: The world does not revolve around you.  -  - Grown men fist fighting?  (both speaking at once)  You think I like babysitting?  Now, you are going to make up what you didn't get yesterday,  or there will be consequences.  Understand?  (phone ringing)  Are you on your way?  What?  I'm so sorry. I just can't leave now.  It's our bachelor-bachelorette.  - The bosses are here. - What?!  - It's not my fault. - It never is.  - Okay, that's not fair. - I agree.  You've missed every single appointment,  and I'm having to do everything by myself!  So hire a wedding planner.  I don't want a wedding planner!  I wanted to plan it with you.  Rogelio, we need you.  I'm sorry, Xo, about all of this,  but I'm at work. I have to go.  We'll talk later, okay?  Have a good shoot.  (sighs)  (door chirps)  Hey, hey, hey, who's ready to party?  I cancelled it.  - What? - I just texted everyone.  Your dad's working, and  I don't know I-I'm just not up for it.  And I know you're disappointed.  Yeah, but it's it's your night.  Honestly, I'm really not up for it, either.  - What's going on? - Ugh.  Please? It'll take my mind off things.  Can we at least have a shot first?  Oh, perfect.  Ooh!  So I'm standing there,  watching Raf go to Petra, and  I just had this feeling, like  (sighs) I felt  Jealous?  No. No, no, no, it was it was not jealous.  I-I mean, it's not romantic.  But maybe  jealous of what they would have as a family.  Yeah. I understand that.  (sighs)  Plus, you're so used to being in the middle of everything.  What?  Like in our family, in your relationships,  you've always been right in the center.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The heroine, as it were.  It's hard being on the outside.  I need another drink.  (laughs)  (laughs)  Hey. Whoa.  Just tell me the truth.  Why did Jean Luc quit?  Creative differences.  What does that mean?!  Tell me!  Okay, fine!  They rained on your fairy tale parade.  Oh, no!  - I knew it. It's stupid. - No way.  They're stupid.  No, they're experts.  Not in what you and Dad have.  After all you went through,  finding your way back,  you deserve your fairy tale ending.  You do, too.  I had it.  And you'll have it again.  I hope so.  I'd like to.  Aw.  - What? - (sniffles)  (voice breaking): You said you want to  Ma stop crying.  I can't. I just  feel so lucky that I gave birth to my best friend.  Aw!  (Xiomara sobs, Jane laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow. They're really wasted.  (knocking at door)  Huh?  Ah  Hi, there. I'm Prince Charming.  Apparently, there's a naughty  little princess around here.  (dance music plays, Jane laughs)  Oh, my God, I forgot  - to cancel the stripper. - Wait. No!  We cancelled. The party's off.  - Is he? - The same one  - that you hired for me, yes. - He's the only stripper I knew!  He's really good!  (laughing) All right.  What the hell. I'm in!  (Xiomara and Jane whooping)  (dance music continues playing)  Oh, my God. (whoops)  - Wow. - Wow.  (knocking at door)  Did he forget something?  Ma.  What are you doing here?  I left set after I got Jane's text.  What text?  I'm sorry. I just wanted him to prioritize you  because you deserve to be prioritized, Mom!  - Are you drunk? - Yeah, very.  - Huh. - But, Rogelio, what about work?  I'll deal with the consequences.  Jane's right.  You're more important, and I have to show it to you  right this minute.  Now come. Your carriage awaits!  Oh. Go. Have fun.  Oh. You weren't kidding.  I'm sorry about the miniature horses.  Apparently, full-size white horses  - are hard to come by these days. - Yeah, I heard.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And just then  (phone chimes)  It's Ricky Martin.  He can officiate our wedding!  (gasps) Oh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow!  Things are working out so well.  For them.  Mirror, mirror, on the wall,  who's the drunkest one of all?  So, I'm a terrible person.  And why is that?  I think I did sabotage you and Petra.  Because if I'm being honest  Which I should be, because Pinocchio  I wasn't afraid of what would happen if  you and Petra didn't work out.  I was afraid of what would happen if you did.  Because then, Mateo and I would be  on the outside of everything in your life.  We'd be like the extra people.  Which is a terrible reason not to support what you wanted,  so  (voice breaking): I'm sorry.  Well, first  thank you.  You're welcome.  And how drunk are you?  - I'm so drunk. - RAFAEL: Got it.  Well, hopefully, you'll remember this,  because I need you to know  that you and Mateo will never be on the outside of anything.  No, but it's okay.  It can't happen.  It won't happen.  Jane, when I think about  family you're who I see.  Thank you for that.  I love you.  So much.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends, that's when it happened.  (phone beeping)  In a twist of fate, or timing or storytelling  Oh. Can you hold on?  Hi.  So, I need you to talk me down.  Wha-What's going on?  I thought Rafael was sick.  He's not.  But it made me think about losing him,  which made me think about him,  which made all these feelings come up,  and I-I just need you to talk me down.  You know, remind me why Rafael and I should not be together.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, of course, Jane said  No. I was wrong.  You should go for it.  - What? Why? - JANE: Because  what if it works?  - Can you hold on for a second? - (phone beeps)  I'm gonna fix things.  What things?  (phone beeps)  The thing is,  Rafael is different now, and so are you.  And you two have a family together,  so you know what's at stake.  And that doesn't have to be a bad thing.  It could be a really good thing.  I-I mean, take-take my parents.  They were a disaster the first time,  and now they're so great.  I'm just  scared, Jane.  Because of your feelings,  which is good. Hold on.  (phone beeps)  - Go see Petra. - What?  Why?  If you want to be with her, go now.  And I get it.  It-it's scary  to have feelings again for someone,  but when it comes to love, there's always a risk.  And there's always a chance that you'll get hurt.  But the possibility of it working out  That's so worth it.  - Are you drunk? - JANE: Yes!  But it's still true.  Can you hang on?  Are you there yet?  Yes, I'm here.  (knocking at door)  What are you doing here?  We were thinking.  And Ricky Martin is great and all.  But we want someone else standing between us  and officiating our wedding ceremony.  Someone who's been right at the center of our relationship.  Someone who's even closer to God than Ricky Martin.  Will you marry us, Jane?  I'd love to.  (Jane sobs, Xiomara laughs)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And what do I want to say friends, except  they all lived happily ever after.  But alas, before we get to ever after,  before we have our love and laughter  (Xiomara laughs)  we have to catch our villain, don't we?  'Cause with her out there, no one's free.  This damn shoe doesn't fit. I should return it to the mall.  DENNIS: Police!  Don't move. Hands  behind your back.  - (gasps) - No!  (distant siren blaring, garbled radio transmission)  (gasping)  (wheezy gasping)  (gasps)  - No. No. - LUISA: No!  Stop! No!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Otherwise known as  the most wicked stepmother of them all.  LUISA: No! No! No!"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, friends, we've had our highs and lows.  Jane married, but then, of course, Michael died.  And three years later,  she was still trying to move on.  And then, the strangest thing happened.  I love you, so much.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know. Whoa, right?  But here's the thing: Rafael wanted to be with Petra,  but Petra was hesitant, because, well  We were terrible together.  And now we have these two happy kids.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Plus, she had this new thing going with Chuck,  the owner of the Fairwick Hotel next door.  But eventually, Raf won her over.  Yeah, he can be pretty relentless.  Which brings me to his sister, Luisa.  See, he didn't quite trust her, or her new girlfriend, Eileen.  If you want to be in my sister's life,  we need to do some medical tests.  And it turns out, Raf was right to be suspicious, because  You do realize, when you pass  this medical exam, you leave the country.  Or I will have you killed, make no mistake.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup, that's right:  Eileen was really the crime lord Sin Rostro.  Which brings us to Scott.  I mean, dead Scott.  See, the police recently identified his killer,  and it was Eileen.  And so, Rafael lied  and told his sister his cancer was back,  and lured her back to the Marbella.  And then, this happened  Don't move.  (gasp) No!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know! What a wild ride, huh?  And, speaking of  after breakups and make-ups and a horrible reality show  that Rogelio filmed with his ex, Darcy,  Jane's parents finally found their way back to each other.  And they wanted a fairy tale wedding.  But, of course, this isn't a fairy tale,  it's a Telenovela.  So let's dive in.  Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today  to witness a rite of passage.  By now, you know that the Villanueva women  have been by each other's side, in sickness and in health,  for richer and poorer  It's my dream.    Through first loves  His name is Adam,  and he's kind of artistic.  And first heartbreaks  I promise, you will fall in love again.  I won't. Not like that.  Through births  and baptisms.  And of the Son,  and of the Holy Spirit.  And even deaths.  And so, of course, they were together for this latest event  in the circle of life.      Okay! I'm ordained!  That was so easy.    No, but their swag game is on point.  Ooh, for $9 more,  I could get the âTell It On The Mountainâ package.  It comes with a parking placard  and a bumper sticker.  (laughs)  Do you think I need a tote?    Hmm.  Shouldn't there be some kind of template  for what to say at the wedding?  Actually, your dad and I were kind of hoping  that you'd come up with something personal.  We want the ceremony  only you could give us.  Oh! Of course. Of course.  Since you're a writer, right?  Yeah, no, I was just meaning as, like, a guide.  But, yeah, definitely, this is a Jane Villanueva joint.  I will just do a little research,  and I'll write the whole ceremony.  Yay!  Make sure you really wow us.  - (chuckles) - The full waterworks.  Don't hold back.  (high-pitched): Great!  Ah.          JANE: Please, God. Please, God.  Please. Please.  WEATHERMAN: And here's breaking news on the weather front.  As of now, it looks like tropical storm Dolly  is gonna just miss Miami.  ALL: Yes!  - Whoo! - Okay.  Time to ditch the rain contingency Plan B binders,  and go back to the original checklist.  Did you call the Palapa Yacht Club  and confirm our final head count?  - Done. - Programs?  - Printed. - Paparazzi?  âAccidentallyâ tipped off.  Enemies list?  All your ex-wives and ex-agents  send their regrets.  Marc Anthony is attending, and per your instructions,  he will be be asked âWho are you? â and turned away.  - Excellent! - You're on fire!  I know, right?  No, you're actually on fire!  Oh. Not again.  I have everything under control!  (chuckles): Don't worry.  I'm totally panicking.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, almost everything.  I keep trying to write the ceremony,  and I just feel stuck.  So, I was thinking that maybe  you could help me with the structure, as a colleague.  But way more important and legit.  I suspect your parents just want you to speak from the heart.  Right. But maybe also around a central unifying theme,  which you can suggest.  You know what?  Here's an assignment:  think about your parents,  why they're marrying, why they're meant to be.  Write it down, don't censor yourself,  for ten minutes.  I'm thinking a theme will emerge.  You're always giving me writing assignments.    Wait, a writing assignment?  FATHER GUSTAVO: A small one.  I always recommend couples write a letter  to each other before the wedding.  To read later when times get tougher  and you need to remember how you feel about each other right now.  I love that idea.  It's so romantic.  Well, that's 'cause you're a writer; it's easy for you.  What about, like, a basketball game once a month  to re-up our bond?  Michael.  Okay, fine. I'll write you a super-gushy love letter.  It better make me cry.  - You're an easy cry. - (grunts)  Sorry, I meant,  it'll be an easy letter to write.  Seriously, I'll just write about how lucky I feel  to be marrying you, because I do.  Every single day.  (sobs softly)  See? Bam!  (laughs)  Can that count as my letter? What I said?  Yeah.  Not really feeling as full of âmeant to beâ these days.  Maybe we read his letter?  Hmm?  Michael's letter.  I remember he wrote very eloquently about it.  Oh, yeah, he never actually wrote it.  He certainly did.  He showed it to me.  It was one of the most beautiful love letters I've ever read.  Oh, my God. I-I never got it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A letter out there?  About âmeant to beâ?  Sounds pretty âmeant to beâ to me.  Then again, what do I know?  (ringtone playing)  Dad! You're back from the spa.  ROGELIO: Yes.  And I'm confirming you will be at rehearsal at 5:00.  JANE: Of course.  And I'm sorry about not making the last one.  The last two.  Did you at least watch the practice video I sent?  - Yes. - ROGELIO: Oh, good!  So you know the Feather Step, Thunderclap, Pirouette opening?  Of course.  Liar! The new opening is a samba!  I can't believe your lack of commitment.  I'm very committed, Dad.  I've just been running errands for your big wedding.  The most important wedding  I'll ever attend in my entire life.  Save it for the ceremony.  I need you on time and on point at rehearsal.  And watch the practice video.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, but who's watching him?  JANE: Oh, no.  -  - A high pressure system's moving in.  We can expect gale force winds?  No. No.  Mr. Monkey.  Thank you. I don't have time for a meltdown right now.  Okay, gale force winds We can adjust.  Okay, we'll go to Plan B.  - (groans) - Mm-hmm.  - Hey. - (thunder rumbling)  The wedding is gonna be beautiful.  Even in gale force winds.  (sighs)  (heart beating)  - (door opens) - PETRA: Am I interrupting something?  Just me freaking out.  I, uh, should go and learn this dance.  I will see you two  lovebirds at the wedding.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: A slight overcompensation.  Nothing he'd notice.  What's wrong?  Oh. (scoffs) What else? My sister.  - (thunder rumbles) - She's, uh, getting out of jail,  and with this weather, she can't get a flight out,  so she's stuck here.  Trust me, I know how you feel.  I'm just hoping Luisa stays in jail.  She got a new lawyer.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, another thing these two have in common:  criminal sisters.  ROGELIO: And show me love!  (upbeat Latin music playing)  - Okay, stop. Just stop. - (music stops)  (sighs) Matelio,  help me out here, buddy.  Where's your mother?  Well, she was coming here.  But then she forgot,  because she suffers from short-term memory loss.  That's from Finding Dory,  which we watched together three times last week.  Sorry, Papa.  I know Mommy's really trying to get here on time.  Ma, don't worry, wedding Plan B is officially in play.  It's all good.  XIOMARA: You're sure? I'm freaking out.  JANE: Don't. I got this.  We're gonna just move the party inside.  I already spoke to the manager.  But I have to go now, okay?  Love you. Bye.  (knock on door)  Can we talk for a second?  Uh  (sighs): Oh.  (panting): Oh, hey.  I need your advice.  (chuckles nervously) Why?  It's your dad's.  Oh, my God.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, my God.  I know the timing is terrible.  I wasn't even gonna tell him about it,  but some tabloid got wind of my pregnancy,  and it's only a matter of time  until they put two and two together,  and I don't want Rogelio to find out that way.  Yeah, no, that-that would be terrible.  I've been trying to tell him myself,  but whenever I get close, I just chicken out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, that explains the creepy stalking.  So, what do you think?  Do I tell him now or wait until after the wedding?  Now. Definitely.  I agree. Can you do it?  Me?  I just think he would take it better coming from you.  Please?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Talk about a high-pressure system.  (thunder crashes)  - Hey, everyone. Sorry I'm late. - She's here!  - No, wait, stop. Dad. - Cue the music!  Dad, I really need to talk to you, please.  Five, six, seven, eight!  What are you doing?!  ROGELIO: Chin up, Jane!  Jazz hands!  - Oh, no, no! I can't! - Yes! Yes!  (stammers) I don't understand what's happening!  Point your toes. Point your toes!  Dad, I really need to talk to you!  Please, put me down right now!  Oh!  Now, shimmy! Shimmy!  Dad, it's important.  (music stops)  I just saw Darcy, and she's pregnant.  (thunder rumbling)  Well, God help that child.  Seven months pregnant.  It's mine?  She says it is.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that  Rogelio's first thought was Xiomara.  And then he thought of the baby this baby  And then a million other things,  including, âmaybe it's all meant to be.â  But in the end, he returned to  JANE: Mom?  Last fitting.  What's wrong? Is the train too long?  I went big, like Diana.  No, it's perfect.  You look beautiful.  But Dad is right outside.  He needs to talk to you.  Oh. Okay. Let me change first.  It's bad luck for the groom  to see the bride in her wedding dress.  (rain falling, thunder rumbling)  Xo, say something.  I just  How did this happen?  While we were taping,  we had hate sex a couple of times.  And you didn't use birth control?  I thought all of her eggs were in the freezer.  Look, I know you don't want to have any more kids,  so you don't have to have anything to do with the baby.  That's unrealistic.  Then I don't even have to have anything to do with the baby.  Stop.  PETRA: Just stop.  You don't have to keep thanking me.  I'm sorry. It's only that  I am so grateful to beautiful sister  for all of your help in getting me out of jail.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She wouldn't be so grateful if she knew  âbeautiful sisterâ set her up in the first place.  Here's how you can thank me: don't leave your room  until you get on your flight first thing tomorrow.  CHUCK: You like 'em?  Oh.  Look  I meant what I said.  It's over.  We've been over a bunch of times now.  It's different this time.  I'm giving things a try with Rafael.  (scoffs)  - Chuck. - What?  You told me you always feel like  you're in second place with that guy.  To Jane.  You deserve better than that.  You'd be my first choice.    (thunder rumbling)        Writing the ceremony.  The opening isn't right, and I want to get it right, and  I just want it to happen, Abuela.  I really want them to get married.      Ah, nothing.  Father Gustavo told me that Michael wrote me  a love letter before we got married.  I was just trying to find it.      What?    En la salud, y en la enfermedad.  Amarte y resparte  Ah. Amarte y respetarte.  Amarte y respetarte.  I always mess that part up.  You were supposed to say it 50 times last night.  I did.  Okay, 25.  My priest gave me homework.  I I had to write a love letter to Jane.  Oh. How did it go?  Pretty good, I think, for not being a writer.  Um, now I'm supposed to hide it away  and give it to Jane when she really needs it.  A rainy day.  Did he tell you where he put it?  No.    I can't stop thinking about him.  With the unexpected pregnancy and what's happening to Mom.  Except Michael had time to think about it, Rogelio.  We're supposed to get married tomorrow.  I know, the timing is terrible.  But I don't want to postpone the wedding.  I don't, either.  But we have to.  (thunder rumbling)  Everything's so up in the air.  You haven't even talked to Darcy yet.  And we need to give ourselves time to figure out  what it means for us.  I want to marry you, but not like this.  (thunder crashes)  RAFAEL: Wait, what?  Yes! I'm getting out of jail.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. The bad news keeps coming.  I don't understand.  You have been on the run with a fugitive.  I'm getting immunity for my testimony against Rose,  since I know where all the dead bodies are buried.  Literally.  I think some of them are on the island that we stayed on.  (thunder rumbling)  So when are you getting out?  Tonight.  My lawyer's just hammering out the final detail.  And, Raf, I'm gonna be there for you,  every step of the way, as you battle this cancer.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, right.  I forgot he told that whopper.  - So what's the treatment plan? - I don't know.  I'm, uh, I'm getting a second opinion.  But you know what, I really don't want to talk  - to you about it. - I'm just worried about you.  If you were so worried about me, then you wouldn't have  brought a mass murderer into my home.  (line clicks, dial tone hums)  We've hammered out the final detail.  (thunder rumbling)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here, now.  To the final detail.  You lied to me.  I believed you.  I trusted you.  It wasn't me.  I didn't kill Scott!  So, someone who looked exactly like your Eileen face  just happened to be in the Marbella that night?  Yeah.  Eileen!  The real Eileen  must have killed him.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which is true, for the record.  Come on! Eileen?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Let me explain.    (âCome On Eileenâ by Dexys Midnight Runners playing)  Hey.  Didn't I just see you, like, two seconds ago  with Chinese food in the lobby?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You remember that Rose had just threatened to kill her  if anyone figured out their scheme.  Oh, you have a twin or something?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It was her or Scott.  Come on, Eileen, oh, I swear   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So she ditched him.  At this moment, oh, come on, Eileen.   Oh, my God.  Oh, my God!  Do not touch the prisoner.  - I'm sorry. - GUARD: Time's up.  I told you you could trust me.  The person you shouldn't trust is your brother.  What?  Come on!  You really think his cancer is back?  MAN (over P.A.): Good afternoon. The tropical storm is picking up speed  and could reach Miami tonight.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This storm front has definitely arrived.  Everyone is advised to stay inside.  I know you never had a cancer relapse.  (thunder rumbles)  I still have some friends at the hospital  and made some calls.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, right!  Luisa used to be a doctor.  Well  it was the only way to get Rose back.  How could you lie to me about something like that?  You were dating the woman that killed our father  and kidnapped my son!  And that was bad.  But it was in the past; she wanted to change.  Oh, my God, you are completely delusional.  - I am not! - Totally crazy!  Just like your mother.  And you know what?  I am done pretending that you're not.  I don't care what you do now that Rose is behind bars,  as long as you stay the hell away from me and my family!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yikes.  This storm cloud just got dark.  (thunder rumbling)  MATEO: That stinks!  I wanted Papa and Abuela  - to get married! - I know.  Me, too.  And Papa and Abuela are sad about it, too.  I have an idea.  Oh.  Maybe I can give them some of the gummy worms  from my secret hiding spot  to make them feel better.      - (floor creaks) - Whoa.  Whoa, look at this.  We'll just have the landlord fix it.  Are you kidding?  It's, like, the best hiding spot ever.  Makes me want this place even more.  Yeah? What are you gonna hide in it?  Your spy decoder ring?  How do you know about my spy decoder ring?  Can you take Mateo to Rafael before you go to work?  - I got to check something. - ALBA: SÃ­.  (knocking)  (thunder rumbling)  Hi! I am so sorry  to bother you.  It's a funny story.  I actually used to live here with my husband,  uh, but then he died.  Not-not the funny part.  Uh, I-I'm I'm looking for a love letter  that he wrote me before he was shot.  Also not the funny part.  Anyway, um, there's a broken floorboard in the living room  that we used to joke around about,  and  I think that the letter still might be hidden there.  So, can I come in and check real quick?  ROGELIO: Thank you for doing this.  We thought it would be a good idea  if we all sat down and talked.  To put your mind at ease, I don't want any money.  I will support her myself.  (gasps) We're having a girl?  Yes.  Rogeliana.  We didn't agree on Rogeliana.  You said you were open to it.  That was just to get you to sign the contract.  And I agreed to sign the contract  If you think I'm gonna name my daughter after the planet's  with the clear understanding that you would  biggest narcissist  - name our daughter Rogeliana! - You are clinically insane!  Oh  Can we just table the names for the moment?  Agreed.  (thunder rumbling)  I want to confirm that we'll share custody,  per our previous agreement.  No. I want primary custody.  What?  The previous agreement was made  when we were gonna do this together  and we actually liked each other.  Everything is different now that I hate you.  Well, I hate you, too, but you're the mother of my child.  So I will keep that very real, intense,  and almost violent hatred inside,  because I want to be involved in my child's life.  You can have two weekends a month,  one major holiday, and two weeks in the summer.  No. I want more.  And you should want him to have more.  He's a great father; you know that.  No one has a bigger heart,  and no one  is more loyal or devoted.  Thanks for the input, but this is between us.  Now, wait a minute.  - It involves her, too. - Why?  I heard you two aren't even getting married.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, dearly beloveds,  in that moment, she realized  (chuckles softly)  Of course we are.  Who am I kidding?  I'm not gonna walk away from you; you're it for me.  Really?  Really.  So let's just get married.  Today, like we planned.  But we canceled everything.  All we need is you, me, Mom, Jane and Mateo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And 42 backup dancers,  12 doves and three costume changes.  Darcy, you'll be hearing from our attorney.  Now, let's go and get married.  Nothing can stop us.  MAN (over P.A.): Good afternoon. The tropical storm  has been upgraded to a hurricane by the National Weather Service.  (thunder crashes)  Sorry. Maybe this one.  (floor creaks, Jane gasps)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And at this moment,  Jane wondered, was this fate  or part of Michael's grand plan  that she would find this letter just when she needed to,  on this rainy day?  Nope.  Oh, okay.  Well, at least I gave it a try.  Sorry to have bothered you.  (cell phone chimes)  (thunder crashes)  Oh, my God!  What?  My parents' wedding is back on.  In two hours at the Marbella.  Oh, my God! I have to get a car.  Uh  Uber, Lyft they're both out 'cause of the storm.  A taxi.  VALET: I'm pretty sure we got you  the last taxi out there, Miss Alver.  And I apologize, but it's a ride share,  - so someone's joining you. - ANEZKA: It's me!  Hi, there.  Oh, you must be Petra's twin sister.  I'm Luisa. I'm Rafael's sister.    Pleased to meet you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now, was it fate that brought them together?  Or just a random coincidence?  Again, I ask these questions, but I don't know.  Your car.  But I do know that this car ride  is definitely gonna mess things up.  I'm fine, Mom. Raf picked me up.  We're just grabbing your dress.  Yes, I will be careful. Love you.  Bye.  Hurry. Oh, and be careful with the train.  I am being careful.  Go write your ceremony.  Dearly beloved, meant to be, and all that.  Oh, my God.  What did you do?  What is that?  That's my dress.  (laughs)  Shut it, okay? Just focus on my Mom's,  and I'll put the purple monster in my backpack.  We have to hurry!  (crash, grass shatters)  (gasps)  Oh, no, my car.  Guess we're taking the bus.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, yay, the bus!  I mean, oh, no, the bus.                  MAN (over P.A.): Attention, all Marbella guests and employees.  The hotel is official on lockdown due to the hurricane.  ROGELIO (over P.A.): Oh, and does anyone have L'OrÃ©al  visible lift blur concealer number 303 in medium warm?  No.  This simply won't do.  I need more colors to work with.  (gasps) Mateo, run over to Abuela's room  and borrow her foundations.  Go! Hurry!  One?  (chuckles) Dad says Mateo's being a good wingman.  Ha! Scared about what that means.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when  - Oh, my God. - (sighs)  You're famous.      That's my book!  BUS DRIVER: Sit down now!  It's so tiny I can barely see it, but that's my book!  That's your book.  Oh, I used to sit on this bus and write.  Dreaming of this.  - I know. - (sighs): Oh.  So doesn't that, at least, feel meant to be?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, what could she say, but  No, that doesn't feel like meant to be,  because that would make it sound too easy.  And it was an incredible amount of hard work  and effort and determination  and overcoming obstacles and fighting through disappointments  and failures.  It was a choice.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And that's when it hit her.  In a moment of fate, or destiny,  - or pure happenstance - Pen and paper.  I need a pen and paper. I need a pen and paper.    BUS DRIVER: End of the line.  Um  (thunder rumbling)  You think you can get us a little closer  to the Marbella Hotel?  I-I'm sorry.  He doesn't understand  how public transportation works.  Be careful with the dress!  This thing is so well packed,  we could take it to the top of Everest and we'd be fine.  Oh, God! Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no, no!  Not safe! Get it back in the bag quick!  Oh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I told you they'd make a mess.  (thunder rumbling)  Oh, quick!  (Jane screaming)  Welcome. Welcome to the Marbella.  Sorry the Fairwick failed you.  Next time, maybe choose a hotel that has a safety plan.  Wait. We can't do this.  We have to keep this room clear for the Villanueva wedding.  We're in the middle of a hurricane.  Rafael was very clear. He promised Jane.  Of course he did.  JANE: My dress is in my backpack, so  I am so sorry.  I feel terrible.  (thunder rumbling)  (sobbing)  (laughing)  Are you okay, Mom?  ALBA: Xiomara?  Of course my dress in ruined.  Look around.  We're getting married in the middle of a hurricane.  Oh, who cares?  I just want to marry your father.  Okay. Well, then we'll make do.  Hey, we got the hookup at the gift shop.  Oh, and you know what,  I won't even wear my dress,  so that I don't distract from the bride.  No, it's fine.  You're the officiant, so you should stand out.  (chuckles)            What?      (both laugh)        (electricity crackles, Jane gasps)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: On the bright side,  at least no one will see Jane's dress.  JANE: All rise.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It should be noted that on the day  of Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva's wedding,  the power was out, her dress was ruined,  there weren't even any paper cranes  because they were deemed a fire hazard,  but it was still completely magical.  And Xiomara, well, she looked perfect.  At least to the people who loved her most.  Which includes me.  (âBridal Chorusâ playing)      Dearly beloved,  we are gathered here today to witness  the marriage of two people  who are not meant to be.  (thunder rumbling)  It's true.  They met when they were teenagers,  and they were both a mess, honestly.  And then they didn't see each other again for 23 years.  And the reunion?  That was a mess, too.  Breakups and makeups and misunderstandings  and hurt feelings and old resentments  - (thunder crashes) - See?  Even Mother Nature seems to be rooting against them.  My parents are here today, not because they are meant to be,  but because they chose each other.  In the face of a million obstacles,  they chose each other.  When it seemed like they should give up,  they chose each other.  And they keep choosing each other,  in the face of every single twist and turn life brings them,  every single day.  And that is not destiny.  That is not fate.  That's commitment.  For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health,  through stormy days and sunny skies,  they have earned their happy ending.  And by the power vested in me  by the Circle of Life Sacred Church,  I now pronounce you husband and wife.  Dad, kiss Mom.  - Yeah. - (laughs)  (people whooping)  Pretty weird wedding.  What are you doing here?  My hotel was evacuated, remember?  (thunder rumbling)  And I was looking for you  'cause that ceremony, it reminded me of us.  Look, we break up, we make up.  We always come back together.  I was watching you all night long.  Watching him.  And all I kept thinking was,  âIs she gonna turn around and look at me? â  (door opens)  Rafael, I'm sorry. That was a mistake.  It didn't mean anything.  We've been back together for a week.  I know!  I was just feeling very insecure,  and-and he was saying all the right things,  and it just happened.  Insecure about what?  You and Jane.  Yeah, I know.  You're going to say you're just best friends,  but that's not it.  She looks at you  like like that's not it.  Okay, you are way off.  No, I'm not.  And you chose her before.  A long time ago. That's not what's happening.  So you're saying if you found out Jane had feelings for you,  that wouldn't change anything?  No, of course not.  I don't know that I believe that.  And, regardless, this is why I didn't want  to get back together with you.  I was past this.  I-I don't want to be worried about you and Jane.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, at this moment,  all Petra wanted was for Rafael to say no, to choose her,  and to keep choosing her.  Yeah, maybe you were right.  Okay.  So let's just  go back to how things were.  (thunder rumbling)  (gentle Spanish music playing)  Daddy!  - Family dance! - Okay.  (grunts)  Are you okay?  Yeah. Just, um  I just broke things off  with, uh, P-E-T-R-A.  I want to be down.  What happened?  Well, remember all those reasons you said we shouldn't date?  You were right.  We bring out the worst in each other.  No. No, I was wrong, remember?  Hey.  What?  Petra freaked out  because she thinks that you still have feelings for me.  And that if I knew that  I'd choose you.  Well, that's crazy.  That's what I said.  (lights click)  (people cheering, clapping)  Yes!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: âDestiny is a series of detours,â  a wise man once said.  Finally stopped raining.  Yeah.  So  talk to me about Rafael.  What?  As a married lady  I am an expert in hot and bothered,  and you looked pretty hot and bothered.  We were just dancing.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, fine. A little hot and bothered.  But I'm trying not to be.  Why?  Because he was getting back together with Petra.  He was?  (groans) I I guess it imploded,  and suddenly he was asking me if I had feelings for him.  Oh, my God. What did you say?  No. Of course not.  Do you?  It's a step backwards.  Or forwards.  Did you even listen to yourself up there?  How your dad and me kept choosing each other.  Maybe he's your destiny.  I don't believe in destiny.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: She will before the night is over.  At least talk to him.  So, you're a love guru.  Why am I always sabotaging myself?  Join the club.  (laughs)  I'm being literal.  You should join my exclusive dating club.  I could match you up in a heartbeat.  I already know who I'm meant to be with.  So what happened?  - Jane. - Ugh!  I am so over the Villanuevas.  No kidding.  I mean, I know she still has feelings for Rafael.  He might not believe me, but  Wait. Wait, you told him?  Oh, honey, no, no, no.  Darcy rule number 43:  the name of the ex is not said unless you want her in his head.  If you want to be with him,  don't take yourself out of the game.  Tell him how you feel.  Now.  Go!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, this was one of those moments  where life could go in either direction.  Jane, I've been looking for you.  Uh  Where did you get this?  Maybe it'll make more sense to you.  A couple from your old apartment got in touch  with the tenant from before them,  and then something about a floorboard.  Some guy brought it.  He's waiting on the south patio.  MICHAEL: Dear Jane,  first, sorry for being goofy in the priest's office.  I was just nervous, because I was scared about  writing something for you, a writer.  And I've been thinking about what to say,  which got me to thinking how lucky I was  to have met you at all, and all the small twists of fate  that led me to you in the first place  Krishna, have you seen Rafael?  (cell phone chimes)        MICHAEL: and how, in a way, our destiny  was just a series of detours bringing us back to each other,  again and again.    What should I do with these?  I don't care.        Raf?  Where is my phone?  Raf?  Hello, beautiful sister with the ugly heart.  Wh-What's going on? What are you doing here?  I stole Rafael's phone,  just like you stole my Scott's phone that night.  - What? I - Stop lying!  I know all of what happened.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This is true, for the record.  Remember the fateful taxi ride,  when I told you it'd make a big mess of things?  Trust me. I know alcohol.  There is no way anyone goes into a drunken blackout  off a little peach schnapps.  You were roofied.  The night my beloved Scott died, you text me from his phone.  He was never breaking up with me.  He was always loving me.  So now, I play same phone trick on you.  And it all comes kruh Se uzavrel.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or, âfull circle,â as it were.  Which unfortunately brings us here.  What the hell are you doing here?  I told you to leave.  I'm not going anywhere.  Where did you get that?  I am thinking we were meant to be in car ride together.  You helped me,  now I can help you.  My dead husband  found addition to your father's will.  Rafael gets nothing.  Zero. Zilch.  Which means the hotel, the trust,  everything is mine.  Which means you're the one  that needs to get out.  Now.  MICHAEL: A twist of fate.  The night we met, that's what it felt like.  I wasn't even supposed to be working.  -  - I'd picked up a shift for my buddy  whose kid was playing in a recital.  And then I was technically off, but I took a detour  and stopped for a burger a few blocks away.  And I was heading back to the precinct when  DISPATCHER (over radio): We've got a noise complaint on 25th.  Any units nearby who can check it out?  Yeah, I'm right there.  (siren whoops)  MICHAEL: If not for that recital and that burger,  I might not have ended up on the doorstep  of a drunk 21-year-old girl.  That's not just a series of coincidences.  It's destiny.  And I never doubted you were mine.  And never doubt that all I want, forever and always,  is for you to be happy.  MAN: Jane.  Adam?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes.  Jane's first love.  I did say we'd get back to him.  I used to live in that apartment.  I found the letter.  I didn't know it was yours.  I never thought I'd see you again.  (exhales)"
"1 Ah, friends, you remember our Jane.  Accidentally artificially inseminated.  Torn between Rafael, her baby's father, and Michael, her fiancÃ©.  And she chose Michael.  I always recommend couples write a letter to each other  before the wedding to read later when times get tougher.  Whoa. Oh, look at this. It's like the best hiding spot ever.  And then, the worst thing happened.  And Michael died. And nearly four years later,  Jane was finally open to love again, with one difference.  Not really feeling as full of ""meant to be"" these days.  Maybe re-read Michael's letter.  And so, she ran to their old apartment,  and, yeah, it wasn't there.  But still, all was not lost on the love front.  See? Jane's parents were finally getting married,  - despite a little hiccup. - It's your dad's.  Oh, and speaking of baby mamas,  Rafael and Petra got back together,  but Petra pulled away, because she thought  there was still something between Rafael and Jane.  And here's a secret, friends: Jane did have feelings  for Rafael, but before I get there,  Rafael's sister Luisa had a powwow with Petra's sister Anezka,  which didn't turn out great for Rafael.  Everything is mine.  And back to Jane's feelings.  She was on her way to tell Rafael when  Jane. A couple from your old apartment  got in touch with the tenant from before them.  Something about a floorboard?  Which brought her back to her first love.  - Jane. - Adam?  Oh, and one last thing, friends.  Remember Jane's adorable son?  Well, he's still adorable, but now he looks like this:  What can I say?  In novellas, you must be prepared for change after all.  When Adam Eduardo Alvaro  was 25 years old, he found a love letter in a floorboard  that altered the course of his life.  It wasn't even written to him.  It was written to someone named Jane.  But, oh, how it spoke to him,  in terms of what love should feel like.  And so he finally broke up with Heather,  even though he tattooed her name on his arm.  And he kept the letter in his wallet  because, well, you know Adam.  He did those kinds of things.  -  - But imagine his surprise  when he found out that Jane was his Jane.  Wait, what was her last name?  Villanueva. Jane Villanueva.  Yes, friends, that Jane,  as in the girl he'd almost married when he was 19.  So, can you blame him for thinking that was a sign?  And, you know, our Adam loved signs.    Friends, hello. I'm so sorry.  I don't know what happened.  I'm introducing Adam.  Shh. Not yet.  Ah, let's begin again, shall we?  When Jane saw Adam again after eight years,  he had brought Michael's letter.  Plus, cranes were flying.  So, can you blame Jane for believing this was meant to be?  - Or Adam? - But this is about Jane.  - There were fewer cranes, honestly. - I don't care.     I can't believe you lived in that apartment.  And that the tenants called you. I thought they thought I was crazy.  Oh, yeah, they definitely thought that you were crazy.  So, I guess we found our way back after all.  Friends, I'm so sorry again.  This is confusing.  The problem is, I didn't start from the beginning  because I was thrown.  All right, last time.  As you know, Jane Gloriana Villanueva,  grew up dreaming about telenovela love.  But she didn't think it could happen to her  until she was 19 years old.  His name is Adam and he's kind of artistic.  And once our Jane fell  well, she fell fast.  - So - Very fast.  Adam just got into NYU's Studio Art program.  It's so prestigious.  He didn't think he was gonna get in, but I knew he would  'cause he's so talented.  - Keep going, babe. - Sorry, babe. Right.  Anyway, uh, he asked me to go with him, and I started going on  about how it's not practical, and I couldn't afford it,  and I wasn't gonna live with somebody that I wasn't married to,  and that's when I saw he was down on one knee. We're engaged!  - What the hell are you talking about? -   - Mom, Abuela, wait. - No, you are way too young.  - I am over 18. -   Okay, hold up. You can't talk to my fiancÃ© that way.      Abuela, enough.  I'm getting married next week and you are going to be there  because you are family and family shows up.  And for the record, they did show up.  Unfortunately  And I just think that everyone's right.  We're not ready.  And I know you don't want to live together  moving to a new city.  too hard.  um, clean break, just  But  I love you.  I love you, too, so much.  I don't know. Who knows?  Maybe we'll make our way back to each other.  And friends, Jane knew  it couldn't end this way. Remember, this was true love.  - Telenovela love. - Babe.  You got to let go of the bike.  And yet, it did end that way.  Until, of course, now.  I'd love to catch up,  but you probably have somewhere to be  in that giant purple dress.  It's lavender.  Oh.  - Sorry. - And the wedding's over.  Let's catch up.  - So, who got married? - My mom to my dad.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.  - You found your pops? - Mm-hmm.  Which brings us to her pops  who had, indeed, married her mom  - What? - Darci just announced the pregnancy.  after discovering he was going to be a pops again.    She's making it seem like I turned my back on my child.    No!  Do not escalate the situation.  You have an ironclad custody contract.  Isn't that what your lawyer said?  Yes, he did.    Ah, ah, ah, ah.  You will be at the next sonogram  because you have legal rights.  Now, let's turn off our phones because we just got married  and tonight's about us.  - I love you, Mrs. de la Vega. - I love you, too, Mr. de la Vega.    - Babe Adam? -   Who is Babe Adam?  - A comic book artist. - Hmm.  Or graphic novels if I'm trying to impress you,  which-which I am, so let's go with that.  I'm impressed.  You're actually making a living as an artist.  ""Making a living"" in a loose definition.  So, are you a teacher, per the whole ten-year life plan?  Nope. I actually decided that I wanted to be  A crazy person, both of you. You can't spy on them.  Keep your voice down.  The babysitter said Mateo just got to sleep.  Seriously. I mean, how bad could this guy be?    - ""Heathen."" - Covering an ex's name.  You must've had a lot of exes.  No.  No, these, um, they mark  mostly important moments in my life, you know?  - Oh wait, are you still into astrology? - Oh yeah.  Seriously? A bad boy into astrology?  It has to do with his sister  who died of cancer. Dick.  - So, how's the family? Abuela? - Great. So supportive.    Well, it's definitely him.  Who cares? Jane has a good head on her shoulders.      That smile, though.  I'm sorry, what were we talking about?  I was asking about your original comic,  or graphic novel because I'm impressed.  Right. I know the story. I've drawn it.  I just need the words now.  After you've drawn it?  Yeah, for me  the words are the extra part.  What? No.  Words are everything.  They're how you get to know a character.  Well, no, that's through their actions.  How they feel, what they want.  You don't know what I want?  Oh, my God, she's taking off her dress.  I think they're going skinny-dipping.  - Now?! -     - Oh, Jane can take care of herself. - Xiomara!  Don't worry. I'll save Mommy.  No, no!  Matelio!  Matelio! Matelio!  Impressive.  You would not skinny-dip at 19.  I told you I've changed.  I guess we found our way back to each other.  Don't worry, Mommy!  I'm here to save you!  - Mommy, Mommy, don't you worry! - Sorry!  Matelio! Matelio!  Oh, Matelio. Oh.  And, friends,  maybe Adam should've run then and there  - But he didn't. - Adam! The tide went out.  So, yes, Adam came home soaking wet.  Thankfully, his roommates were away.  Ugh, you again? Sorry about that.  crazy that you were spying on me in the first place!  - I know, and I'm really sorry. -     Having fun.  Sweetie, I love that, but I'm just a little confused,  because two hours ago, you were about to tell Rafael  that you had feelings for him.  -  - You want to be with Rafael?!  - Shh. - I didn't say that.  - ROGELIO Well this is a lot to take in. -   - I mean, I'm not sure how I feel. -   No! Case not closed. Case none of your business. Got it?    I guess she don't got it.    Shh. Right here.  - Ooh, la-la! - I know, right?  But did he hear about her feelings?  Not sure. Be quiet.  - What are you doing here? - Oh, Luisa kicked me  out of the hotel and froze all my money, and I can't find my phone.  - Hey, buddy. - Guess what?  Mommy went swimming naked in the ocean,  and Bisa and I saved her from stranger danger.  - Okay. Can you put him to bed? - Mm-hmm.  So, what happened with Luisa?  She found out that I lied about my cancer relapse.  What-what feelings?  Just  romantic ones.  Well, but I-I didn't know where they were coming from,  or what they meant, which is why I didn't say anything.  Maybe I was just jealous that you were dating Petra.  Oh my God. Petra, she said  that you had feelings for me, but I called her delusional.  I need to, I need to apologize. Can I, can I use your phone?  Yes, of course.  Jane, wait.    You have a text.    Ah, yes, speaking of Adam  -  - No worries.  I'm gonna make the deadline.  Yeah, I'm drawing the big fight scene right now.  Yup. He's pretty whipped.  I just hope she's worth it.  Trust me, Jane is a very special person!  Mateo, this is the last time I'm saying it.  Put your shoes on!  What is it? What's the matter?    No, that's just a rich person thing.  He doesn't realize that we have one bathroom and water bills.  Mm-hmm.    I don't want to discuss it.      We spoke briefly, but then he had to call Petra back  and apologize for not trusting her.  And she won't even call him back because of me.    Huh? Oh, honestly, the whole thing's a mess. Hang on.  Shoot. That was Mateo's dojo.  Rafael's credit card is on autopay, and it was denied.  Guess we are taking a break from karate.  I don't want to take a break from karate.  Well, we're gonna have to, Mr. Sweetface.  It costs a lot of money and right now we want to save. Shoes on.  Just tell Daddy to go to the bank and get some more.  - Mateo, I don't like your attitude. - I'm going.  - No, you're not. - Am, too! Am, too!  You stop that! You stop that right this minute!  - No! - Hey, what's going on?  - Mommy said we have no money. - Wait, what?  - No, I did not say that. - Yes, you did.  You said that's why we can't go to karate.  Okay, hey, calm down, all right?  There is plenty of money.  Okay? Go get ready.  I obviously didn't say that. And clearly, he's way too spoiled.  I just don't think we should be talking to him about money.  Period. He's way too young.  Hello?  This is Jane Villanueva.  Oh, my God.  Which brings us to  I'm sorry, who is this rando?  Petra, I think.  What do you mean, ""you think""?  Look, it's a long story, but she's a twin  and they often do this thing where they switch places.  How important can she be  if you're not even sure who she is?  Petra, thank God.  See? It's Petra. Now, shh.  Are you okay?  Well, Anezka lured me out to the dock last night  and tried to kill me, but, yeah, other than that, I'm perfect.  Wait, I don't understand. Lured you how?  She stole your phone and texted me.        Thought there was a business emergency.  And when I got out there, she had a gun.  Okay, well, she's not gonna check that.  She's a ding-dong.  Now pay attention. This is important.    No!  There was blood everywhere and the current was so strong.  - Mrs. Solano? - Yes?  We've got boats heading out to see if we can find your sister,  but it doesn't look good.  Let's just hope she's dead.  Wow, this lady is a real charmer.  Back to Adam  No, not yet.  Can I borrow your phone to check my messages?  - Oh, of course. - Thank you.  And I just wanted to talk to you,  but not over a voice mail, obviously. Call me.  Oh, let me just turn off the Bluetooth.  Hey, Petra, it's Jane.  Raf said you haven't called back and I know you're mad.  - Shoot. Let me - and you should be,  but not at him. It's my fault completely.  I denied that I had feelings for Rafael and you were right, I did.  And maybe it was just jealousy or lust or  Well, you can just listen to that later.  I'm sorry, I was just trying to make it better.  You don't have to make it better.  - I just thought that I could help. - I don't need either of you to help.  - I'm so sick of this whole thing. - There's no thing.  No, no thing. Nothing at all.  I actually have a date tonight.  So, you're telling me you're 100% over Rafael?  Well  100% is a big number.  Uh, but I don't want to be with him  and he doesn't want to be with me, Petra. He wants to be with you.  - Oh. - Jane.  We all know deep down he'll always still have feelings for you.  - Petra. - Or maybe you don't.  You know what? Who cares?  The point is, my feelings clicked off  the moment you believed her over me.  Now can we go home?  Petra! Finally! I've been looking for you.  Whoa, who's the lady with the crazy eyes?  Rafael's sister, Luisa.  Well, here I am. How can I help you?  The voice is great.  Just the right level of holier-than-thou.  Just clean yourself up. Petra wouldn't wear sweats.  - Well, I-I was about to change. - Good. Is it done?  Is Petra in the storage locker?  Oh, my God, quick, Petra, do the accent.  Yes. Of course.  Petra is in the storage locker,  just like we planned.  Everyone is the hero in their own story.  And Rafael's story?  Well, for the longest time, it had to do with Jane.  Wait, what's with the slow-motion push?  Is what's-her-face, right?  Does he actually still love her?  - Shh! - Please be Adam.  It's Petra, for you.  Ugh.  So, we have a problem.  Your sister was going to put me in a storage unit.  - It's not the worst idea. - What?  Just long enough for Anezka to impersonate me  and sign the papers to sell the Marbella.  But, here's the thing.  She thinks I'm Anezka.  So, I had an idea.  Okay, fine. What's your idea?  But if it's hiring someone to put this together,  the answer is no.  Fine. We'll soldier on then.  You know, you do look very manly holding that hammer.  Oh, yeah?  - Mm-hmm. - You like that?  - Darci's going live on Instagram. - Maybe don't  Hi, Factor fans. It's Darci and boo-boo.  We are coming to you live from Dr. Ghazali's  where I'm about to see my sweet girl's face  for the first time in 3D.  She knows I'm supposed to be there.  Ro, stop.  Don't do anything rash, okay?  Just call your lawyer and let him know what's going on.  You're right.  Fine. I'll do that.  Maybe I'll just take a walk first, just to cool off a little bit.  Look how much money I got, Mommy!  What? Where did you get this from?  My friends. I just told them we were poor and they wanted to help.  I'll be right beack.  Mrs. Taub?  Hi there.  Mrs. Conway. Hello to you, too.  Just wanted to return some money.  Apparently, Mateo was running around saying that we're poor  and his friends wanted to help.  Why would he say that?  Um, honestly,  there-there are some financial struggles at home.  I guess he picked up on it.  I'll e-mail the parents.  And if you're not going to come back, you should let us know.  - Hmm? - The financial trouble.  Tuition is due in full by the end of the summer  and we do have a long waiting list.  Let me get back to you.  There's no way we're going back to that school.  Honestly, that was the last straw.  There's no concern, no empathy, just, ""Do you have the money or not?""  Forget that it was offensive.  But that is just not the environment I want Mateo to be in.  I say we take this opportunity and make a change. And just  Jane, can we just talk about this later?  I have a lot on my mind right now.  Oh, of course. I'm sorry.  Of course. Okay. Bye.  Everything okay with you two?  Oh, yeah. He's just stressed. All good.  Trying to get back to normal. And I have a date tonight with Adam.  Ah, yes, speaking of the dashing Adam  And a dash of Adam is all you get.  And you're 100% sure that's all you want with Rafael, friendship?  Why is everybody obsessed with 100%?  I mean, who's 100% sure about anything?  Look, I told him that I thought I had feelings for him,  but it was probably just because I was jealous.  - And he didn't respond. - How romantic.  - Ma. - Why are you hedging everything?  Because there is so much at stake.  We're co-parents and whatever we do affects so many people.  And it's not like he's made any moves.  Maybe you're not paying attention to the cues.  Why is your dad going live on Instagram?  And since I am the loving father of this child,  I have very clear rights.  I am here at the sonogram.  And, Darci, I demand to be a part of this experience.  Wow, Dad just put Darci's vagina on Instagram.  I can't believe you broadcast my cervix to the entire world.  It was an accident. And it wasn't the whole world.  Only 3 million people watch my feed.  Oh, well, 4.5 million.  Wow. You're getting a lot of likes.  Why are you laughing?  Because this went better than I could've imagined.  I knew eventually you would do something stupid  and violate the terms of our contract.  Did you read the fine print?  It protects my ""reasonable expectation"" of privacy.  I figured my lawyers would have to build a case slowly,  but revenge porn?  You've outdone yourself.  You were baiting me?  My cervix all over the Internet is a small price to pay  for a lifetime of not having you in our child's life.              Oh, wow.  I just have, I have that thing tonight, that date.  Right.  Stranger danger guy.  You know, let's-let's just talk later.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  You know, just, um, enjoy your night.  Oh, boy, Mommy looks beautiful.  Yeah. She really does.  Man, maybe she should cancel the date with Adam.  Oh, my God.  You have no idea what Adam has planned.  Which brings us here,  to the roof of his loft, a perfect date spot.  Go, Adam.  I thought we could eat outside. I cooked.  You cook?  Uh, well, grilled cheese.  One third white cheddar, one third yellow cheddar,  one third American. Right?  Mmm.  Come on, I wasn't gonna mess this up.  Oh, my 19-year-old self is freaking out right now.  - Yeah? - Mm-hmm.  And, uh, what about your 28-year-old self?  Well, she's taking everything in, playing it cool.  - Ah. - Mm-hmm.  Well, allow me to show you my inflatable living room.  Oh.  Do you still play guitar?  Oh, no. No, that's my roommate's.  And I'm-I'm so sorry for making you listen to me back then.  It's been brought to my attention that I suck.  Well, I loved that one song you wrote. Do you remember it?  28-year-old Jane is making me work.  Hmm.  Oh, my God, he wrote her love cue?  That's his love cue.  Wait, where are we going?  Ugh, are you serious? You're interrupting the date  for what's-her-face walking through a hallway with papers?  Please, tell me you have some good news.  We got an offer for the hotel.  Wait, what? They're working together?  It's Petra playing Anezka playing Petra.  I told you they do this.  Now, it's 30 million less than we wanted, but it's an all-cash offer.  I had Krishna investigate company and cash is real.  Here is offer.  30 million under is a big discount.  But you say you want all cash.  Why? If you don't mind me asking you?  - Had some expenses that came up. - Oh.  Expenses? Like what?  Will you slow your roll?  I was about to flash back to  Luisa and her lover, the recently jailed crime lord known as Sin Rostro.  By the way, if I ever get caught,  I need you to deposit $100 million into my account here in the Caymans.  - That'll initiate my escape protocol. - Mm.  Wow, I like these two.  They seem straight out of a comic book, which brings us back to  Oh, yeah. I totally see it.  Really ""yeah""?  Or ""yeah"" like you used to say when you couldn't see anything?  I can't see anything.  Okay,  we're gonna make this happen tonight, okay?  Just watch my finger.  You follow the curve of the Big Dipper.  Takes you down to Arcturus,  and that takes you right to Spica.  There's Virgo.  Yeah. Okay.  I think.  That is not good enough.  I want 100%.  - Oh, geez. - Bad choice of words.  Okay, let's try this. What's the brightest star you see in the sky?  - That one. - Yes. That's Spica.  That's-that's the brightest star in the Virgo constellation  that you are now most definitely looking at.  See? Adam's got this.  The stars are aligning for these two.  Wait, why are you being so quiet?  You always have something to say.  Well, the stars are definitely aligning.  - But -   Oh, come on. You've got to be kidding me.  Ah, yes, where were we?  Ah, stop. You know exactly where we were.  You okay?  Uh-oh.  Sorry. It's-it's not you.  Obviously. Adam's amazing.  I just right before I saw you,  I was on my way to tell my son's father  - that I had feelings for him. - Oh.  And now, I'm not 100% sure  how he feels  or how I feel.  Well, you should take care of that.  I'm really sorry.  You should be.  It's all good.  No, not all good. You are making a huge mistake.              Yes! I found it!  -  - I found it!  Okay. What's going on, Rogelio?  I asked our editor to send me all of the raw footage  of the De La Vega Factor Factor, and I've been combing through it,  and look what I found.  Hey, Darci, they're asking for you. Darci?  This is just footage of an adorable puppy. I don't understand  Oh, my God! Darci punched that puppy in the face!  - I know. -   In her defense, she was trying to punch the P.A.,  but America is not going to know that. I sent the video to Darci.  Either she abides by our baby contract  or this goes directly to TMZ. Darci Factor: Puppy Puncher.  Oh, here's her reply.  She will honor the contract and she hates me!  Yes!  - What? - Nothing.  Good.  I-I was just thinking how Jane is being so careful with Rafael  because he's Mateo's dad, you know?  Your point?  That puppy puncher, she's your baby's mom.  Which brings us back to our careful Jane.                And, friends, it's safe to say tonight, a line will be crossed.    And maybe it was the picture,  or the wine, or just the fact that she was tired  of being so damn careful  Actually, who am I kidding? It was mostly the wine.  But the point is, Jane thought about how Adam was right.  Less talking, more action.    - Hey. I'm home. - Hey. Hi.  So, uh  I know you wanted to talk  Yes. About Mateo's school and his trust fund.  Oh. Right. Okay. What about it?  Well, I paid next year's tuition with his trust fund.  I just told you that I wanted to leave that school.  Because they made you feel bad about not being able to pay tuition  so I solved that.  But the whole point was that I didn't want Mateo going back there.  And long term, things are gonna have to change.  They won't, though, 'cause I'm making a play to get the hotel back  right out from under Luisa. And the way that I'm gonna do that  is also with money from Mateo's trust fund.  Well, that explains the nerves.  - What? - Petra and I are borrowing  from all three kids' trust funds  to put together an all-cash offer to buy Luisa's shares.  What are you doing?  Fine. I was gonna get in the shower, but I changed my mind.  Ooh, how can you take money from Mateo's trust fund?  Don't you have to consult with me?  - That's not how it works. - Well, it should.  And what school Mateo goes to, that does need a consult.  I was just trying to get things back to the way they were.  And why were you trying to get in the shower with me?  Oh, my God. You have been sending me all these mixed signals.  - What mixed signals? - Who leaves out a glass of wine  with a Post-it saying, ""I'm in the shower""?  Someone who wants you to relax after a bad date,  and to also know that he was in the shower.  Well, you should have written that on the Post-it.  - Plus, you left the bathroom door open. - 'Cause your grandma  told me the room gets moldy when the water runs too long.  Eh, she only said that so you wouldn't take such long showers.  And you said that you were glad that my date with Adam didn't go well.  Because Alba's been complaining that this guy's a loser.  I just thought  What? That the world revolves around you?  - Well, it doesn't. - What is that supposed to mean?  I had this great thing with Petra, and you ruined it.  Are you kidding? I didn't ruin it.  You did, by not believing the woman that you were dating.  So stop twisting everything!  - Everything? - Yes! You knew I didn't want Mateo  to go to that school next year. You know I don't like those people.  You mean people like me?  I mean people who care only about money,  who look down on you if you don't have it.  Oh, my God! I am done feeling guilty 'cause I don't want Mateo  to have some small life where he counts pennies  and doesn't get on a plane till he's 20 years old!  You know, if Mateo grew up to say something like that,  I would feel like I failed as a parent.  I did say they'd cross a line.  Friends, last night there was a terrible fight.  Only because you led me to believe Rafael was  into Jane, with all the misleading push-ins and the long glances.  I was talking about Jane and Rafael's fight.  And for the last time, I'm shaping the story.  I'm actually glad that we fought, because now I know  how totally and completely wrong we are for each other.  And can you believe that he's in the shower again?  Who showers this much? I mean,  he's gonna be the cleanest homeless man in all of Miami.  Whatever. He'll be out of here soon.  Delivery for Rafael Solano.  Uh what is it?  All of his belongings, courtesy of Luisa Alver.  What the hell?  Your stuff.  Oh, my God. I am so sorry.  Look, this will all be dealt with later today.  Which brings us to  Luisa wants to meet Anezka in an hour to sign the paperwork.  - Tell me there's not a problem. - I'm not here because of the Marbella.  Got my iPad back.  And my phone texts were backed up.      Anezka didn't lure you to the dock with a business emergency.  Which means that your feelings didn't just shut off  when I believed Jane over you, which leads me to believe, or  hope  maybe that  there's still a chance for you and me.  I don't know, I mean  W-We don't work together.  But things will be different now we'll  communicate.  And I'll listen and trust you. Because you were right.  I was all caught up in Jane's  Story.  stuff, but I'm not anymore.  And I can tell you, 100%,  that I-I don't want to be with Jane.  I want to be with you.    I'll call you after I get our hotel back.  See? Everyone's a hero.  Your dad's sorry he couldn't come over,  but he's embarking on an act of heroism  for the sake of his unborn daughter.  His words, obviously.    He went to see Darci, and he's gonna try and make peace.  - Ah. - Well, I think that's great.  I know. Isn't it?  - Mm-hmm. - I'm really so happy.  Ma?  I'm sorry  I I think I just  never want to be sad around Rogelio,  you know, because  he's having a baby.  And that's a beautiful thing.  He's not here.  What's going on?  It just sucks, you know?  Because I'm supposed to be in Honolulu right now,  sucking down mai tais and having honeymoon sex,  not chasing after sonograms and getting into Twitter wars.  Yeah, that totally sucks.  - Right? - SÃ­Â­.  I guess I just want to feel a little sorry for myself.  That's totally okay. I feel sorry for you.  Well, thanks. And I feel sorry for you, too.  - Really? - Yeah. I mean,  the whole shower thing?  Oh. Right, that, too.  I thought you meant because I re-met my first love  in the most magical way, and he said all the things  my 19-year-old self just always hoped he would,  and I screwed it all up.  Aw.  When you put it that way        - We can't. -     - Mm-hmm. -     - So you've said. -       - What?! -   I called him, too.  - Oh, my God! -   I'm sorry, but there was no way you were getting married.    Uh-huh.    -  - Hmm.  And speaking of reaching out  First of all, you know I meant to punch the P.A., not the puppy.  And what are you doing here? I already said I'd honor the contract.  I know, I know.  But I want you to want to honor the contract.  What the hell are you talking about?  Our relationship, Darci. You're the mother of my child.  I want us to get along.  So I promise, I will never insult you again.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I don't think you're handsome.  Well, you're entitled to your opinion.  You're a horrible actor.  Well, art is very s-subjective.  You are the worst lover I have ever had.  Then I hope you find someone who can fulfill your every desire.  - Is this some sick game? - No, no. I promise.  Okay, Darci, I know you're upset,  but you don't have to do all this.  I think I'm in labor!  Oh!  - A baby sister? - Even better.  Hey.  I-I got your text.  So, did you clear things out with the other guy?  Yeah, I did.  Good.  Um  You want to get some coffee sometime?  I'd really like that.  And, friends, that's how Adam  got back together with Jane.    What are you doing?  This is how we end things.  Well, we still have stuff to do.  And he's part of our story now.  Ugh. Let me guess  more blondie signing papers?  Yes. And thank you for that transition.  So, I forged Petra's signature.  Now you sign and hotel is sold.  Perfect.  Hmm. And  just to clarify  you are Anezka, right?  Yes.  Then who's this?  Hello, beautiful sister.  Hello, ugly mister.  Does anyone besides you know him?  No. Just me.  And I'll take the secret to my grave.  Hmm. Yes, you will.  Step back.  Just add another 70 years to my life sentence.  Now, that's how we end things."
"LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Welcome back, friends.  You'll recall, Jane reunited with her first love, Adam.  And Rafael, well, he'd reunited with his first wife, Petra.  But things will be different now. We'll communicate, and I'll listen.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Sweet, right? Not as sweet  I am done feeling guilty 'cause I don't want Mateo  to have some small life where he counts pennies  and doesn't get on a plane till he's 20 years old.  You know, if Mateo grew up to say something like that,  I would feel like I failed as a parent.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And it seemed like they'd be  - stuck together a while longer. - What the hell?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, see, Raf's sister, Luisa,  had kicked him out of her hotel.  And even worse, she'd teamed up with Petra's twin sister, Anezka.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  And speaking of, Jane's father had married Jane's mom.  Only problem  - It's your dad's. - Oh, my God.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which reminds me, remember when  Jane slept with her father's co-star, Fabian,  and he introduced her to his granny, on, like, night three?  Well, ever since she ended it, things had gotten a little tense  between the men on set, but that was small potatoes  compared to this big news.  - I think I'm in labor. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know, right?  So let's give birth to this episode already.  As you all know, Jane Gloriana Villanueva  has always believed in following rules.  - You know the rules. Pick that up. -   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, boy, what did Mateo do now?  I am serious, you pick that up right now and you  chug that beer!  ALL: Chug! Chug! Chug  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, drinking games need structure, too.  Chug, chug, chug, chug! Who's the champ? I'm the champ.  Change that leaderboard, Flaco, and never question my dominance again.  Okay, one more round?  - I can't, I got to go home. - Oh, boo.  I know, I suck, but I have early morning school drop-off.  Say good-bye to Fun Jane. It's back to Mom Jane.  Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.  For the road.  - That is you and your alter ego. -   Kind of like Bruce Wayne and Batman.  I like it. And thank you for keeping the reference basic.  - Yeah. - Mm-hmm.  - And I am your Alfred. - Oh, you lost me already.  I'm the one that gets to see the secret part.  Mm, I like that, too.  - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm.  Mm-mm-mwah.  Hey  - Come back soon, bro. - Yup.  Ooh, save me some pizza rolls, fam. Fun Jane out!  MATEO: Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,  - I'm gonna slime you. - Nuh-uh-uh-uh. You know the rules.    No more shenanigans with protein shakes.  - Rafael. - Here's the thing.  Chase, you'd be crazy not to get in on this.  - It's a minimal capital ask. - [MOUTHING.]  You would acquire two-thirds of the Marbella,  and that means majority control.  How can you stand this? His crap is everywhere.      Abuela, that doesn't mean what you think it means.      Chase Chase, look,  you'll be kicking yourself if you pass this up.  Okay, we are gonna print money.  Zen Rafael was so much less annoying than Douche Rafael.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking of alter egos    [LAUGHING.]    Of course I'm mad at him.    But it is his fault that he wanted to get the hotel back  with a ridiculous scheme that pissed off  his crazy sister so much that she froze Mateo's trust fund.  And Mateo's school tuition check bounced.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn, Alba is ride-or-die for Rafael.  Okay, well, I also don't want to be late  for public school registration.  It's really a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Okay? To just turn a quick mil  Okay  Well, wake me up when you come to your senses, Chase.  - How many steps today? - Ah    So super awesome. So we can't be late today.  Well, we still have ten minutes.  Hey, have you started the wash yet?    - Oh, yes, thank you. - [PHONE CHIMING.]  Hey, Petra.     And I hear that, Petra, I do.  His ""mature relationship"" voice is even more annoying  than his douche voice.    Your tone is hurtful.  And I am sorry for hurting your feelings.  That was not my intention.  But, as you know, I am being followed and harassed  by my Oh!  I have to go.  Okay, what?  Do you just stand there looking through the peephole  until I come out?  -  - [LAUGHING.]: Don't be silly.  I have a high stool I sit on.  My biggest regret in life is that you didn't drown in the Atlantic.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You may be wondering why Petra didn't have  her sister arrested for attempted murder.  Go ahead, report to police.  It will become top news story, and hotel reputation will be ruined.  All beautiful sister has to do is  give Dr. Luisa permission to sell hotel.  I have papers to sign right here.  For the last time, I'm not selling my shares.  And stop calling her doctor.  - She lost her license years ago. - [ELEVATOR BELL CHIMES.]  Then how come she found my fibroids?  - Aah! - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, wow.  Last time I heard a scream like that,  Darci was going into labor.  Or, rather, false labor brought on by stress,  resulting in  Xo!  bed rest.  I said ""Xo,"" not ""Ro.""  Xo is indisposed. Can I get you something?  - [MONITOR BEEPING.] -   - [CHIMING.] -   Stay back. It's bad enough I can't be alone.  I don't need to see your big, stupid face.  Aren't you supposed to be back at work?  Or did they notice your ten-pound weight gain  and write you off the novela?  For the sake of our unborn child,  I will continue to rise above your insults.  And I return to work tomorrow.  What are you waiting for, then?  You only have 24 hours to learn how to act.  [LAUGHS.]  [GASPS.] Never go to the bathroom again!  Breathe. Now, go ahead, let it out.  She's the most maddening woman ever to exist.  And she called me fat.  That woman has gained at least 30 pounds since she got pregnant,  and even I know babies don't weigh 30 pounds!  What? Why are you smiling?  Because I've been thinking. Remember what she said  during dinner last night?  That my pasta is more flaccid than my  After that. The little dig about you going back  to obsessing about work after the baby comes,  and how she'll be stuck doing everything?  I have an idea.  RAFAEL: What was Chase thinking?  He turns down the deal, then offers me a job selling condos?  I don't sell real estate, I buy it.  Priorities, please. This is going to be  Mateo's school for the next six years.  Six years? No way. One, tops.  - I'm getting my money back. - Well, even so, we might love it.  I have great memories of the public kindergarten I went to.  - Here? - No, this one was overcrowded  and I was reassigned. But don't worry.  Okay, class sizes are capped in Florida now.  So just give it a chance, okay?  No way in hell is Mateo going there!  Now I see why their ratings are so low. The building is falling apart.  I'm so sorry, hon, I know you wanted to love it.  It is so unfair.  It has half the budget of public schools in wealthier districts.  How is that okay? I-I mean, it's a vicious cycle.  Rich kids get better schools,  better education, get into better colleges,  earn more money, put it back into their schools  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Preach, Mama.  Could you ever convince Rafael to go Catholic?  It's way less expensive than private.  Ro I mean, we could probably afford it.  Isn't he still paying off the De La Vega-Factor Factor lawsuit?  Yeah, but I've seen our finances, we can spare it.  Let me check if there are any openings first,  before asking Dad. And Rafael. But thank you.  Cool. Now, where are those arepas?  - [PHONE CHIMES.] - Darci will tear me a new one  if I come home empty-handed.  [GIGGLES.]  That's not a ""looking into Catholic school"" giggle.  It's Adam. He tagged my dinosaur.  - Kinky. - No,  it's not a sex thing, it's a phone game.  But, now that you brought it up,  I think I am ready to have sex with him.  Really?  So it's serious?  I still don't know. Our lives are so different.  But you were right I don't need to know  where it's going in order to have sex with him.  Unless you think I should wait to know if it's serious.  No, no, no, no, no, definitely not.  It's early, no need to think long-term.  You go over there tonight and tag that dinosaur.  [KNOCKING ON DOOR.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well those aren't beer pong clothes.  [MOUTHS.]  Okay, wow, yeah, great. Thanks.  Yeah, let me think on that and I'll call you back.  [EXHALES.]  What is it?  Something insane just happened.  I-I applied for a VFX job months ago.  And I-I didn't think I had a chance in hell,  but they just offered me the job.  But that's amazing!  - Yeah, I know. - [LAUGHS.]  Only the-the job is in L.A.  Oh.  Well  Still amazing.  Congratulations.  I'll, um  I'll really miss you.  Well, uh, that's the thing, Jane.  This might sound crazy, but  if you want me to stay, I will.  In a heartbeat.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa.  So I guess we are thinking long-term.  And so he has 72 hours to decide on the job,  which gives me, like, 71 hours to decide how I feel about him  or if he fits into my life or Mateo's life.  Except, how can I even do that when it's just  way too soon to even introduce him to Mateo?  DARCI: Sounds like classic passive-aggressive  commitment transference to me. That's a big red flag.  Unless he's the one. Pineapple juice?  How do you know if he's the one?  Oh, I've got tons of material from my course at the Learning Annex.  Compatibility quizzes, research reports, algorithms  Jane doesn't need a test to figure out her love life.  And you're not supposed to be working.  Well, I'm bored senseless.  The idiot celebrity magazines your husband keeps buying me  are killing my brain cells.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to take a whiz.  [GROANS.] This baby's riding my bladder like a carnival pony.  [SIGHS.]  How are you not blowing your brains out?  Because there's a plan in motion.  Ro's building a nursery on set to show how committed he is  - to being a good dad. - Aw.  I'll check it out while I'm there.  Our Lady of Mercy has an opening,  and I'm going to ask about tuition.  - Wish me luck. - ROGELIO: How lucky am I?  A cake! [CHUCKLES.] You shouldn't have.  -  - Thank you,  from the bottom of my heart, for excluding my archnemesis,  - Fabian! - Party!  Hello, hello, everyone, welcome back from reruns.  Meet Alejandro, a sickly kitten  that I rescued and nursed back to health.  Why does he get a cake?  You're just jealous because mine is bigger and better.  And my cake is, too.  Your cake is so vulgar and distasteful.  And posing in the nude with a feline is so 2014.  I'll show you distasteful.  [GASPS.]  [GRUNTS.] That's it!  I'm done. I'm never shooting a scene with you again!  Not if I never shoot a scene with you again first!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Talk about an epic catfight.  It is obvious what has to happen.  Use doubles and pretend we're in the same scene.  Excuse me?  For once, I agree with the talentless hack!  The editors can make it work.  There are all kinds of tricks you can do with doubles.  So, is it done?  Beautiful doctor, not yet. Petra still saying no to sign.  So step up your game. I need the hotel sold.  Y-Yes, Dr. Luisa. I call her again.  [PHONE RINGING.]  [PHONE CLICKS.]  - [KNOCKS ON WALL.] - Hello, darling.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes. I'm sure you remember  - our old friend Chuck Chesser. -     I'm here with a proposition.  - Oh. - A business proposition.  Eh. That's too bad.  A good one.  I'm putting together a silent investment group  to purchase two-thirds of the Marbella.  What I need is a public face, so Luisa doesn't get suspicious  and realize we're behind it.  Only an idiot would turn that down, Chuck.    If the sale goes through,  you basically get ten percent for doing nothing.     LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Depends if you ask Fun Jane  Wild night out. What, what?! [LAUGHS.]  - or Mom Jane. - Absolutely not.  What if we come home wasted and Mateo needs us?  And Alejandro is the ugliest kitten I have ever seen!  Uh, bad time?  Of course not. I always have time for my beloved daughter.  Aw, thanks, Dad.  Just make it snappy, I have ten minutes.  Right. So, the short version.  I found a great Catholic school with one spot left.  It'd be perfect for Mateo. It's just the cost.  Say no more. I will pay for everything your heart desires.  In the near to long-term future.  I'm not following.  Well, I'm having a few very trendy financial issues.  It's possible that I overspent a bit these past few years,  so I'm tracking Johnny Depp's lawsuit  against his business managers to see how that plays out.  -  - If Johnny loses,  I know it's my fault that I bought that time-share in Cancún  and part of that vineyard,  after my business managers warned me not to.  But if Johnny wins, then I can sue them  for my own financial negligence,  and I am back in the game, baby.  Got it. Don't worry, I'll find the $8,000.  Wait. Only $8,000?  Why didn't you say so?  That's less than I spent  to shoot Ricardo Montalbán's ashes into space.  You can swing that? Well, of course.  JANE: This is a deal of a lifetime.  I'm telling you, you'd be crazy not to get in on it.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Sorry, you know how I feel about Catholicism.  All that doom and gloom stuff, it's not what I believe in.  Well, do you believe in a great education?  [SIGHS.]  All my teeth are brushed.  Can you please tickle my back? Please, please, please?  - Yes. Come on. - Sure.                  Ow, can you guys tickle less hard?  ""Darci's Surefire Strategy to Spotting Your Soul Mate""?    Thought it could help me figure out what to about Adam.    I'm ditching the quizzes, and I'm going over there  and having a mature, adult conversation.      LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ouch.  Alba is definitely not ride-or-die for Adam.  Abuela, don't be such a downer.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh! I think it's time to see Alba's alter ego.  Can you spot the seven differences?          Fun Alba has spoken. What a surprise.  She agrees with Alba.      We happen to be fighting over sending Mateo to Catholic school,  so you should be on my side here.  Hmm.  Yeah actually, now that you two are besties,  maybe you can talk to him about Our Lady of Mercy.  Huh? Maybe between the kettlebell swings  and the Fitbit competitions,  you can convince him it's a good idea.    Thanks, Abuela.  You know what?  I am tired of being trapped in my own home  during mature chat time.  I'm going in.  - Uh - Yeah. Mm-mm. I am.  And I acknowledge your concern.  But on the other hand, the fact that I was involved with Chuck  makes him an ideal front man.  Anezka and Luisa would never think I'd be in business with him.  And I acknowledge your point,  but Chuck still has feelings for you,  and that makes me uncomfortable.  You think I'm comfortable with you living with Jane?  REMEMBER: she tried to get in the shower with you.  RAFAEL: I hear you, but for the millionth time,  I don't have feelings for Jane.  Me neither, just to be clear.  Regardless, Jane can't buy a hotel.  So you can't unilaterally rule out Chuck  without providing a viable alternative.  Look, Anezka's driving me crazy. I can't take much more.  I understand.  And I just happen to have a great lead.  Katherine Cortes.  Carlos Cortes' daughter?  - The hotelier? - Mm-hmm.  Well, why didn't you tell me about her in the first place?  Because we've been working on communicating better,  and I wanted to give you a chance  to process your feelings about Chuck.  Oh.  Thank you for that.  Yes.  Call her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is it just me,  or is all this communicating making them a little dull?  Now that's more like it.  What do you want to do tonight?  Ooh, make out and tequila poppers.  Absolutely not. We're having a serious discussion  about whether this relationship has legs.  Which it doesn't.  Why you looking confused?  I'm sorry. It's just  This big decision.  I'm a little in my head about it.  - Buzzkill. - Shh.  We need to know if Adam is capable of a mature, adult relationship.  Know what I do when I have a lot on my mind?  - Hmm? - Roofball.  And I think we have our answer.  ADAM: Okay, here we go.  Roofball. You score in the big trash can, or the little trash can,  or the flower pot that's covered in bird crap.  And do not fall off the roof.  - Has that ever happened? - Many, many times.  I am going to crush this.  Okay. We're playing for exactly eight minutes,  and then we're telling him to take the job and ""good luck.""  - Ready? - Okay.  Okay. That's, uh, that's one point for me.  You got to try to block me.  Oh, okay. Okay.  Okay, okay. Now you're getting it.  [BOTH GRUNTING.]  - Nice! - Oh!  - [LAUGHING.] Nice! - Okay, I got this.  You got this fast.  - Wow. Okay, cool. - Yeah.  Hey, hey, hey  - Oh! Oh! - No.  [LAUGHS.]  [GRUNTS.] Oh.  Where'd it go?  - Where'd it go, where'd it go? - [LAUGHS.]  [SHOUTS.]  Oh! Three points!  Bring it, bitches!  Our eight minutes are up.  Ow!  ROGELIO: Well, this is just a slap to the face.  WOMAN: I'm sorry the editors  couldn't make the doubles thing work.  But they did put together something  we're really excited about.      - [BOTH GASP.] - Oldest trick in the book.  Kill someone off to juice the ratings.  And since the two of you can't work together  The new plot will involve the lady scientist  accidentally swallowing Guillermo and Hector,  but only one of you will survive the journey  out of her tush alive.  We're putting your characters to a focus group  of women ages 34 to 55  bored housewives, our bread and butter  they'll make the call.  JANE: Yes!  I just have  so much fun with you.  Mm. That's a good thing, right?  Definitely.  It's good to remember that I'm young, you know?  More than just a mom.  Mm-hmm.  [SIGHS.]  Let's have sex.  Yeah? You ready?  Mm-hmm.  [LOUD POP, AIR HISSING.]  [BOTH GRUNT.]  [LAUGHS.]  Not a lot of inflatable swan sex?  Not as much as you'd think.  - Oh. - Let's go inside.  [GRUNTS.]  Oh.  Usually when this happens, I just jump down, but  I can jump.  Do I have to remind you that I am young and fun?  - Let's do this. - Mm-hmm.  [LAUGHS.]  [SIGHS.]  [SIGHING.]  Here I come.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  in that moment, Jane had never felt so free.  [GROANS.]  [SOBBING LOUDLY.]  Do you think it's broken?  Of course it's broken, you idiot!  So, a simple fracture of the distal fibula usually takes  four to six weeks of recovery.  Now, the pain meds will kick in soon, so she'll be tired.  She'll also need help in the shower. The cast can't get wet.  He can't give me a shower. We haven't even had sex yet.  Wait.  Can we even have sex?  It's, uh, possible.  Which positions?  I think those are the meds that you were talking about.  You'll need to do the driving for the next month.  He may not even be here in a month.  He got a job in California.  It's very exciting for him and very confusing for me.  Congratulations.  Uh, someone will be by with the discharge papers shortly.  [SIGHS.]  [SIGHS.]  Hey, look.  I can tell that my question's really stressing you out.  What? You have me confused for Mom Jane.  I am Fun Jane.  Stay, go, whatevs. I'm cool.  Still, I'm taking the decision off your plate.  I got this.  [CHUCKLES.]: Oh.  [CHUCKLES.]  You're so sweet.  Oh, I think those drugs are kicking in.  Mm. [CHUCKLES.]  [SIGHING.]  Oh, no.  Sorry, you passed out there. I couldn't move you.  No, I'm late for my meeting at Our Lady of Mercy.  What's Our Lady of Mercy?  Uh, it's a Catholic school for Mateo.  I was supposed to meet with them today. Ow! Oh!  [SOBBING.]  Ooh. Oh, could you pass me my pants?  Hi. This is Jane Villanueva.  Um, I had an appointment, um two hours ago.  What?  Y-You gave the slot away?  RAFAEL: I am so glad this worked out.  -  - I know how busy you are.  So let me just say this. This is easy money.  You'd clear ten percent without putting in a dime of your own.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like Katherine wants to tag his dinosaur.    I still can't believe that we never met.  I've heard so much about you from Chase.  He and my ex-husband are golf buddies.  [PHONE CHIMES.]    I'm sorry, it's about my kids.  Of course.  Thank God my ex and I never had kids.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: We get it, lady, you're single.    So, let's discuss things further, over drinks.  XIOMARA: Water with lemon.  About time.  You know it's not good for the baby to be dehydrated.  Were you working?  Just checking a few e-mails.  These aren't e-mails.  This is a dating profile.  Wait.  This is for you?  Why are you posting a profile?  Why do you think?  I don't want to raise this baby alone.  Alone?  [SCOFFS.]  Put this on.  I'm about to yell,  and I don't want to hurt the baby.  Doing this alone?!  We brought you into our home!  We wait on you hand and foot,  take you to your doctor's appointments.  In fact, my husband is on set right now  building you a nursery a surprise nursery  so you know you won't be doing this on your own.  So what? That's all stuff for the baby.  Neither of you would have anything to do with me  if I weren't pregnant.  Of course not.  But you are.  So we're stuck together forever.  That's called family.  And we're trying. You're the one who's not.  So, if you really want what's best for the baby,  worry less about getting dehydrated  and more about getting along with her father.  And you could be a little nicer to me, too.  ROGELIO: Pick me.  Choose me.  Love me.    Why do you look so worried, Papa?  Well, because these women are deciding if Papa  or a terrible ogre will stay on the telenovela.  Let's listen in, Matelio.      Sell it, woman with the lazy eye.      [SIGHS.]  Jane, what happened?  No big deal, just a small fracture.  Hey.  What's Fabian's grandma doing in there?  -  - [ROGELIO GASPS.]  Oh, my God.  That floozy has infiltrated the focus group.  Well, the jig is up, Granny.  Uh  Uh, w-wait, wait, wait! Think.  How is it gonna look if you storm in there and attack a grandma?  You're right.  I have a better plan.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which, my friends, brings us here.      Yup. Meet Rogelio's new alter ego.                LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa there, Granny.                      PETRA: I'm uncomfortable.  Because it's obvious that Katherine is looking for  a hookup with you in exchange for signing on.  And I acknowledge your feelings.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, man, I'm sick of mature Rafael and Petra too.  But you have nothing to worry about, because I can handle Katherine.  Just like I can handle Chuck.  He's the logical choice, a known entity.  You working with Chuck makes me uncomfortable,  because I have no interest in Katherine.  You and Chuck have a romantic history.  How many more times and ways can I explain to you  that I don't want to be with him?  I know you don't. But you've gone there before.  Slept with men to advance your interests.  Whereas I haven't crossed that line.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of crossing a line.  [WOMEN GIGGLING, CHATTERING IN SPANISH.]  Ciao.        [PHONE RINGING.]  [RINGTONE PLAYING.]  - Hello. -   The focus group chose me?    Say hello to your abuela for me.  And stay away from my daughter!    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw.  Who knew comic books could be so romantic?  I know. I'm getting misty, too.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  It's just a minor fracture.  I was playing roofball with Adam.  - Uh, roofball? - Mm-hmm.  As in playing ball on a roof?  Are you gonna be okay?  Yeah.  But we need to talk about Mateo's school situation.  Because of my accident,  I missed the appointment for Our Lady of Mercy,  and now we don't even have the option of Catholic school.  Can you not smile? That was the best option we had.  I have another one.  Did you know that your parents live  in the Elbamare School District?  It's a great public school  with a nine rating, plus music, art, TK.  We can enroll Mateo next year using their address.  And lie about where we live?  Of course.  Of course your option is to lie. Why am I surprised?  - That's not fair. - But it's true.  I mean, that's what you do. You try to game the system.  Why wouldn't you? You grew up rich and entitled,  and you think that the rules don't apply to you.  It was your grandmother's idea.  Yeah.  So as you're climbing off your high horse,  try not to break your other leg.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, hello, Douche Jane.  I don't understand. You told Rafael that we should lie  to get Mateo into a better school?  -  - What?          You used somebody else's address?                DR. GHAZALI: Back to real life for you.  No more excuses to lie around getting spoiled.  You are officially off of bed rest.  Hallelujah!  - Oh, thank God. - I'll see you next week.  [SIGHS.]  So before you drop me off?  Yes?  Let's go see that freakin' nursery.  Really?  But nobody better rub my belly  when I'm there. I'm not friggin' public property.  I think that look on your face will scare them off.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think that's a smile?  I would have gone with a less tacky mobile, but it's nice.  [SIGHS.]  I'll take it.  Thank you, Rogelio.  You're welcome.  And I swear I will not put work first when the baby comes.  I want to be a good co-parent with you.  I know.  We had a friendship once.  Long, long, long ago.  Can we again?  Let's try.  Now I have something to show you, too.  Welcome to your relaxation room.  Your lady cave.  Rogelio.  What's this for?  Well, I spent some time with some women today.  In a focus group.  And I learned that  sometimes women feel underappreciated.  And sometimes it's nice to have a room of one's own.  I know you're going through a lot  with Darci, the baby, the dance studio.  So whenever you want to decompress, this is the place.  This is so sweet.  And thoughtful.  My ladies group taught me that sometimes it's nice  to do things without being asked.  They did, huh?  [MOANS.]  That's not all they taught me.  I guess I realized that I was the one who was spoiled.  I took you  and your money for granted.  And I'm sorry.  It's okay.  It's not.  Look, I  I-I don't want to fight anymore.  Can we be friends again?  I'd like that.  Me, too.  And I mean that.  The financial privileges you've given this family  has been huge.  And parenting without it is gonna be harder  and lead to making harder choices.  And so, let's do it.  Use my parents' address. [CHUCKLES.]  Don't worry. It won't be for long.  'Cause I'm gonna get it all back.  The money, the hotel, everything.  Okay.  But until then, the family is gonna need to make some changes.  Buckle down a little, grow up.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here.  You have to take the job.  But I've already decided that I'm staying.  Well, you shouldn't, not if I'm part of the equation,  because honestly I don't think that we'll work long-term.  What are you talking about? These past few weeks have been  Amazing. But not real life. And it's come with a cost.  I mean, Mateo may not have anywhere to go to school next year.  And I can't drive for a month.  - Jane. - And this. This, this  is incredibly sweet. But it's a fantasy.  In reality, these panels would be lice checks,  and Mateo puking and getting in trouble at school,  and you texting me that you'll be home late,  but I don't get it because I already fell asleep,  and a lot of other not-fun things.  I know you have a kid, Jane.  And I know that makes everything way more complicated.  But just like the school meeting, if I'd known about it,  I-I would've set my alarm,  I-I would've dragged your ass out of bed.  You're the one compartmentalizing.  Because you can't meet Mateo yet it's too early  and without you meeting him,  I don't know how you fit in my life.  That's exactly my point. You can't know.  Then why did you ask me to make this huge decision about your job?  I didn't ask you to make this decision.  I-I was just asking you if you wanted me to stay.  - Of course I want you to stay! - Okay, well, then I'm staying!  I'm staying.  I'm gonna need you to kiss me.  What are you doing?  Making you work for it.  [LAUGHS.]  [LAUGHS.] Yeah.  [MOANS.]  [DOOR OPENS.]  PETRA: Rafael?  [DOOR CLOSES.]  Thought we could use a little romance.  Which we were not gonna get at Jane's house.  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY.]  Yeah, I've been thinking.  And you're right.  I should trust you.  Let's go with Chuck.  No.  You want to go with Katherine?  Neither.  I'm serious.  I've decided I can deal with Anezka long enough  for us to find the right investor,  someone with no strings.  I can handle Katherine.  Okay? I am not gonna sleep with her. I'm not that person.  But there'll always be a part of you that thinks I am.  What?  It's true.  And I don't blame you.  I've cheated.  But at the same time  that's not who I am.  And I need a fresh start.  What kind of fresh start?  Romantically.  Are you breaking up with me?  We just decided to be mature and try.  And we have been.  But I'm just tired of the effort, frankly.  And it's not what I want.  Then why did you get back together with me?  I'm not completely sure.  - I shouldn't have. - [SCOFFS.]  Maybe you just chose Jane so many times  that when you finally chose me, I didn't want to say no.  Or maybe I just needed to be the one to end it.  Well, I'm happy to help you on your journey of self-empowerment.  I'm sorry, Rafael.  Just go!  Even the stench of his mediocrity is gone.  It feels amazing to have my set back.  I will never have to see Fabian and his deformed kitten again.  [CHUCKLES.] Oh, thank you.  It's great to be number one on the call sheet.  Well, co-number one.  [GASPS.]  No, this can't be.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But it is.  [MAN LAUGHING.]  -  - Wow.    [GASPS.]  I was just seeing where I sit.  For when I win.  How funny. I was just seeing where I sit for when I win.  Well, we can't both win.  Dang it!  Cut!  [GASPS.]  Where's Fabian?  Get that delusional has-been back here this instant!  This is my worst nightmare.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: It's actually about to get a whole lot worse.  [LAUGHS.] Stop it.  Whoa, why are they talking? Why-why is she laughing like that?  XIOMARA: Oh, God.  I think he likes her?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ya think?  From chemical attraction to an indecent proposal.  See? Isn't this nicer than some crowded restaurant?  It is.  Wait. We have to toast to working together.  I just hope we're compatible.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Say good-bye to Zen Rafael.  PETRA: You won't break me.  I built this hotel, and nothing you can do will make me give it up.  Whatever you are saying, beautiful sister.  MAGDA: Hello, Petra.  That's right.  Granny's back.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know!  Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Which reminds me.  One. Of. These. People. Will. Die!  What can I say?  It's the oldest trick in the book, right?"
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: We're back!  And fate had brought Jane back to her very first love, Adam.  And she leapt right into a relationship with him.  - [CRIES OUT.] - LATIN NARRATOR: I know! Ouch.  But still, it's nice to see her happy, isn't it?  Less happy, our Rafael. See, he'd lost all his money.  And his sister Luisa kicked him out of the Marbella.  So he was scheming with Petra to buy Luisa out.  Oh, and did I mention, Petra recently dumped him.  - I'm sorry, Rafael. - Just go.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, so like I said,  Raf was in a bad place.  But at least he found an investor to work with.  Only problem: he had to work her.  And speaking of dark times, remember Petra's mother Magda?  You know, the one who was locked up in jail for murder.  - Well - Granny's back.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That's right. And she teamed up with Luisa,  who was also trying to sell the damn hotel,  because she needed the money  to spring her crime lord girlfriend from jail.  I know! Straight out of a telenovela, right? Well, imagine this.  Jane's father recently married her mother,  even though he was expecting a baby with his ex, Darci,  who he had a complicated relationship with.  But at least he was still a big star.  Although right now, he's playing someone very tiny.  Oh, and he recently got a familiar new costar.  That's right, Esteban's back, too. And he'd hit it off with Darci.  And things are due to drop, so let's dive in.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was seven years old,  she met one of her mom's boyfriends for the first time.  Unfortunately  [SCREAMS.]  Jane, are you okay?  Jane didn't know it was her mother's boyfriend.  Needless to say, Jane wanted it to go perfectly  when Mateo and Adam met for the first time.  And after grilled cheese sandwiches,  you'll give him a big bag of gummy worms,  and I'm gonna be like, ""No more candy, young man.""  And then you're gonna be like, ""Come on.""  And then I'm gonna be like, ""Okay.""  And then we'll go to a baseball game.  - Got it. When is this happening? - In eight weeks.  IKE: Eight weeks? Wow, that's like  two years in Jane/Adam time.  Your relationship is in, like, a time warp.  Dude, yes, yes!  They time warped right over Adam's panic zone.  [BOTH LAUGH.]  Don't you two have to get dressed if you're gonna make that movie?  [SIGHS.]  Sorry about that.  No, it's okay.  I mean, I understand if you're in panic zone.  - We are moving pretty fast. - I'm not in the panic zone.  I am in ""I want to spend every second with you"" zone.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: This goes on for a while.  Let's time warp through it.  - Peace out, bro. - Bye.  I should get home, too, get back to Mateo.  Hey, do you want to come over tomorrow after he goes to school?  Yeah, roger that. I will engage the Mateo Protocol.  Copy, copy, 10-4, copy.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, the Mateo Protocol.  That is the  Actually, let's just time warp to tomorrow morning to see it.  This trick is useful, isn't it?  - Bye, Mommy. - Bye.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [BELL RINGS.]  [RHYTHMIC KNOCKING ON DOOR.]  [RHYTHMIC KNOCKING ON DOOR.]  [TIMER DINGS.]  [GIGGLES.]  Okay, I think we can shorten the knock sequence.  No way. The complexity is what makes it so badass.     - [CAT MEOWS.] - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh.  I think our agent has been compromised.  [PHONE CHIMES.]  [LAUGHS.]  [GASPS.]  My publisher sent over the art for my book cover.  No way.  What?  If you saw this on the shelf, what would you think this book is about?  Hmm.  Is it, uh, a period piece about a woman who can't wait  to give her boyfriend the business?  [CHUCKLES.] Exactly. And no, it's not.  I just don't understand. Where's the romance? There's no magic.  It's all about sex.  And my book is about so much more than that, you know?  Actually, I don't.  It's kind of hard to judge the book by the cover  if I haven't read it.  That's my way of asking you if I can read it.  Mm.  Or, are we not at that point in our timeline?  Usually, that's like a five month thing,  but since you already taught me roofball  I'm going to say okay.  And I'll just casually wait really anxiously  until you read it, so be timely, please.  - Right on. - Mmm.  - I'm so stoked. - Mmm.  And I will just give my publisher notes on the cover.  Less sex.  That's for them, not for us, right?  Oh.  [GIGGLES.]  KATHERINE: This is not pillow talky.  This is work talky.  I just want to know the details.  So, you and your partner are doing an inspection  of the Marbella tomorrow?  Well, I got to look under the hood  and make sure everything I'm buying is good and fresh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, hello, Raf the boy toy.  You know, I could talk to your investor as well,  if it would make them feel more comfortable.  Don't you worry about it.  We're all on the same page.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I wish someone would explain it to me.  We're gonna buy the Marbella, hire you as CEO to run it,  and set up a payment plan for you to buy it back over time  plus interest, plus ten percent for me for the front.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: That makes sense.  And  And  your sister will never know about us.  Mmm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like Jane's not the only secret agent.  Don't worry.  [PHONE VIBRATES.]        - Everything okay? - Just a kid thing.  PETRA: What are you wearing?  Babicka gave us presents when we saw her in the kids' club.    Why are you so mean to Babicka?  Girls.  Your grandmother and I have a complicated relationship  'cause she's done some not-very-nice things.  Magda!  Our teachers at school say we should always forgive.  Well, they haven't met your Babicka.  [LAUGHS.]: Kidding. I'm kidding.  No, you girls are right.  I'll just have a chat with Granny tomorrow,  and we'll just work all of our issues out.  You stay away from my kids, do you hear me?!  You want me gone?  Then sign the deal from Luisa.  [SCOFFS.] Never.  I built this hotel. I'm not selling it.  Then Babicka will be talking to darling girls in hallway,  in lounge, maybe even teach them how to pickpocket.  Okay, how about this.  Whatever Luisa's paying, I'll pay you more to leave town.  She's paying us a million dollars.  Actually, it's a million Czech korunas, Mother.  Korunas?! That's only $46,000.  Wow, wow, wow!  Looks like you bet on the wrong horse.  ESTEBAN: Ride me, Darci!  Ride me!  - This is too much. - DARCI: Yes!  I can't tolerate having to hear Esteban have sex with my unborn child.  He's having sex with your unborn child's mother.  Who goes after a pregnant woman  and starts dating her within a week?  Is it some kind of fetish or something?  ESTEBAN: Yes, Momma!  They are both just doing this to get to me.  DARCI: Oh, yes! Yes!  I'm telling you, she's faking it. I mean, I should know.  Okay, enough. You need to chill. This isn't about you.  They have some kind of chemical attraction  that I'm sure is going to flame out eventually.  [KNOCKS.] New script pages.  Gracias, Rudy.  [GAGS.]  Who okayed this disgusting rewrite?!  ESTEBAN: I did.  On Five-O, the writers were always taking my ideas.  Well, this is not Hawaii Five-O.  This is a telenovela,  and your character cannot have sex with the lady scientist  when I'm still shrunken and living inside her.  Why not?  Because you can't just introduce a new love interest  three-fifths of the way through the series  and expect the audience to root for him!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, that reminds me, where's Adam?  What a great guy.  It doesn't make logical sense. And audiences need logic.  This is not the intestine I approved!  I am rejecting this rewrite. Period, period, period.  Technically that's, that's an ellipsis.  Fine.  Obviously, Rogelio wants the show to suck.  JANE: No, it-it's really good.  But I do have some thoughts. Uh, oh.  Go get dressed; Bisa's gonna take you to the park.  A snow globe is sort of the central metaphor,  so it would be, you know, it would be nice  to work that in. And it's a  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah, let's time warp through this.  I think that about sums it up. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much.  That was a really great call. I think they totally heard me.    Mwah. Have fun, you two.  Bye.  [DOOR CLOSES.]  [GRUMBLES.]: Come on.  [RHYTHMIC KNOCKING ON DOOR.]  - Nah. - [TIMER DINGS.]  You-you cut the knock sequence short?  We'll live.  - Mmm. - Mmm.  So  good news.  The publisher was really receptive to the notes  that I gave on my cover.  - [SQUEALS, LAUGHS.] - Whoa.  - So we should celebrate. - Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I got a few ideas.  - [DOOR OPENS.] - I forgot Mr. Monkey.  - Don't hurt my mommy! - Oh  - Hyah! - Ow!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, could be worse.  At least nobody had a knife.  Were you giving my mommy a special hug?! To give her a baby.  What?! No! No, that's not what it was.  So what was it?  More like a special kiss that's not about babies.  What's a special kiss about?  JANE: Um  well, it's, um, uh  it's a regular kiss, um, but longer.  I want a special kiss.  Oh, Mateo, no.  Mwah. Mwah.  - Love you, Daddy. - I love you guys.  Off you go.  I'll see you soon.  Wait. Can we talk?  What's there to say?  Well, I just want you to know  that I've got my mother handled.  Turns out she and Anezka are too inept to be much of a threat.  So, anyway,  if Katherine Cortes doesn't come through, we're fine.  We can wait for another investor.  The Katherine deal will go through.  How do you know?  She told me in bed.  I thought you weren't going there.  Hey, my personal life's not your concern. Remember?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of an uncomfortable personal life.  I'll do the belly jelly, honey bun. I'd love to.  LATIN NARRATOR: Geez, is there anything the man can't make porny?  Why is he even here?  Bringing your man to a sonogram after just one week of dating  must violate every rule in the Darci Factor rule book.  Rule number 97, Codicil L for love.  ""When your heart's been took, throw out the book.""  Geez, these two make Adam and Jane seem like they're taking it slow.  Okay. There she is!  [GASPS SOFTLY.]  I can't wait to meet her.  Neither can I.  [ESTEBAN SOBS.]  I've never wanted to meet someone so badly,  but at the same time, I feel like I already know her.  Baby that's so profound.  [WHIMPERING.]  RAFAEL: Okay, baby.  Call me as soon as the hotel inspection is done, alright?  I'll see you later. Kisses.  ""Kisses""? Already?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: ""Kisses""? Ever?  So give me some details.  Oh, come on, we used to talk about this stuff all the time.  - She's fun. - Mm-hmm.  And we're keeping it casual.  [CLEARS THROAT.] Unlike you and Adam.  Right.  So, that's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.  Um, Mateo met Adam.  It was an accident.  But it wasn't good.  Here's what happened.  You don't need to hear this again. Let's just see how he takes it.  From everything that Alba's told me,  I don't think the guy's a good influence.  Yup. Not well.  She hates him from years ago.  You went skinny-dipping on your first date  and broke your leg on your second.  It was actually the sixth date.  Point being, the guy doesn't just scream ""responsible"" to me.  You can't say that without meeting him.  Let's all have a meal, so that you can see  that he's not an imminent danger to our son.  - Fine. - Great! I'll tell Adam.  ROGELIO: I have an amazing announcement to make!  Our beautiful new daughter will make her world premiere  at the Ricky Martin Celebrity Birthing Suite at Miami General.  I pulled some of the many, many strings  available to me for our baby to enter this world  in this luxurious and 100% sterile environment.  Do you want to tell him?  Let's do it together.  - Rogelio, we're - We are  - No, you should start. - You go No.  - [LAUGHS.] - We always do this.  Okay, on the count of three.  One, two, three.  BOTH: We're having a home birth!  A what?  DARCI: A natural delivery at home.  With a birthing pool and a doula.  Esteban mentioned it, I researched it, and I decided  it's the best option for baby and me.  While I was shooting Five-O, I spent a lot of time  with the locals and got in touch with my earthy side.  And by locals, I mean Alex O'Loughlin and Scotty Caan.  They raved about home birth!  DARCI: Mmm, that's exactly what I want, Smush.  Oh, I'm so happy, Mush.  JANE: Ew.  This cover art is even worse.  What would you think this book's about if you saw it?  SONIA: Ooh.  Um an old-timey sex magician?  [SIGHS.] I'm just gonna give them more notes.  They made me do 26 drafts of this novel;  they can take another pass at the cover.  - True. - WAITER: Jane.  I've got a nightmare customer demanding to see the manager.  [SIGHS.]  JANE: How can I help you?  This salad. It's disgusting.  The lettuce is wilted and the chicken is not warm,  which the menu indicated it would be.  - JANE: I'm so sorry. - Taste it.  It's okay, I believe you.  You won't even eat the food that you served me?  Taste it.  Mm. You're right.  Let me get you a menu  so you can pick something else out, on the house.  What a bitch.  Oh, you mean Rafael's hook-up?  No, I mean the garbage human in the white dress.  Yeah. That's Katherine Cortes.  - She's dating Rafael. - What?! No.  Oh, don't worry, it's just a business arrangement.  He's using her to get the hotel back.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup.  That's pretty much how Petra hoped Jane would react.  - Is Adam usually late? - He's probably driving,  and he doesn't text and drive, which is a good thing.  And I met Katherine, by the way.  I have to admit, I was kind of  surprised that you were dating someone with so much  personality.  Until Petra explained  that you're just using her for business.  I'm with Katherine because I like her.  And because she's good for busines  We have a mutually beneficial relationship.  It's not like she's meeting Mateo.  By the way, being 15 minutes late  does not bode well for being responsible.  Adam. Hi.  Hey, hi. Sorry.  Sorry, dude,  traffic was crazy and, um, Waze was ""waze"" off.  - [GIGGLES.] - No problem, dude.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh, all right.  Let's time warp past this awkward part, shall we?  So, you have experience with kids?  Uh, not really, um, but I'm-I'm a big kid at heart.  And he's also totally mature.  - Right. - Super mature.  Like with everything: um, paying bills,  not putting banana peels in the garbage disposal.  Oh.  Okay, let's move forward a little.  - So do you have a car seat? - Does Mateo still need a car seat?  - I have a car seat. - Ugh, I can't.  Okay, hypothetical.  The three of you are on your roof, you get locked out.  - Do you jump off? - No! I call for help.  Trick question.  Mateo should never be on your roof.  [PHONE VIBRATES.]  Sorry, it's Petra; she's got the girls.  I'm failing the test.  I am so sorry. He's just in a bad mood and stressed.  Well, I am so proud of you for getting your yellow belt, Ellie.  Would you mind putting Mommy on the phone for one minute?  Oh. Hello?  Why the hell would you tell Jane about Katherine?  Oh. Was I not supposed to? I didn't know.  - Oh, please. - PETRA: Fine.  You wouldn't listen to me, so I thought maybe you'd listen to her.  Why would I listen to either of you?  - Because we're all a family. - RAFAEL: Yes, exactly!  And I'm taking care of things for my family!  You're on a plane with Mateo and the plane loses cabin pressure  and the oxygen masks drop.  Who do you put the mask on first?  Mateo, definitely Mateo, sir.  Trick question. Never be on a plane with Mateo!  - [GROANS.] - [GROANS, CHUCKLES.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of unhappy fathers  Why would she want to give birth in a kiddie pool?  It's a birthing pool.  Educate yourself  about home births before you start freaking out.  Fine. I will look into this ridiculous home birth business.  LATIN NARRATOR: Which he did, for the record.  Well, my mind is officially closed.  Now I'm even more outraged about the idea of a home birth  than I was before.  I forbid it.  You can't forbid it.  Well, I need to find a way to forbid it.  There's no point in talking to Darci; she's only gonna do  - the opposite of what you say. - [KNOCK ON DOOR.]  I just wish there was some way to convince her.  Five-minute heads up till your protoplasm scene, Rogelio.  Ooh, looks like someone is plotting something.  Which makes sense.  This is a telenovela, after all.  I need help, please.  The hotel is so hard to sell, and I'm all alone, Rose.  I miss you so much, and  I can't even put up a picture of you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I'll remind you, she's speaking  with her crime lord girlfriend who is currently in prison.  I swear to God, sometimes it feels like I'm the one in prison.  [SIGHS.]  Yeah, okay, okay. Yes, okay, yes.  That was insensitive. I'm sorry.  Can we please not fight?  Okay. I love you.  [KNOCK ON DOOR.]  We need to talk.  Um, did Anezka get Petra to sign the papers?  No, n-not yet.  Then we don't.  We are renegotiating our piece of the deal.  [SCOFFS.] Like hell we are.  [CHUCKLES.]  You do not want to cross me.  Oh, please.  I'm not scared of you, lady.  I was dating an international crime lord.  You killed two people.  She started a war in Ukraine with Paul Manafort.  There's no renegotiation.  And stop showing kids your eye hole! It's gross.  I feel terrible. We both do.  You should.  But you know what?  You were being pretty awful to Adam.  No, I wasn't.  You were grilling him, not getting to know him.  Because I want to make sure my kid is safe.  Fine. If it'll make you feel better,  I'll make sure that Mateo's never alone with Adam.  - Does that resolve your concern? - Yeah, okay, fine.  And how about you and Adam?  I'll be cordial with him.  But it doesn't mean I like the guy.  Me, neither.  Mateo.  What? If Daddy hates Adam, I hate Adam.  He's a stupid fartface!  ""Fartface"" is not a nice word, young man.  You're on a time-out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Honestly, I thought it was funny, but,  man, Jane was pissed.  Don't worry, I will fix this.  How?  I'll just act like I like him.  Mateo will see through it.  You three need to go somewhere and bond, without me.  How about a baseball game?  That is not necessary.  Okay? Just invite Adam over,  we'll act cool, and over time, he'll forget this ever happened.  Adam is important to me, and he's sticking around.  I know. Just give me two weeks.  If it doesn't work, then we'll do your baseball thing.  Which brings us to  -  - Have fun at the baseball game.  Hey, before we go, I finished your book.  It was really good.  Oh  JANE: Uh, ""Really good""?  ""Really good"" is what I told the publisher  about the cover that I hated.  Look. Romance novels probably just aren't his thing.  Plus, art is subjective. Trust me.  It's not like I think everything your dad does is genius.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, someone has high standards.  So what's happening with the book cover?  Well, I just got another version a few days ago.  So now I have three choices.  Yikes. I'm no artist, but  - these suck. - I know.  And apparently, that's their final offer.  So which do you hate the least?  One, two or  UMPIRE: Strike three. You're out!  - ADAM: This is fun. - RAFAEL: Yeah, it's so much fun.  - I'm bored. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Me, too.  Nine innings? It should be three, tops.  We just got here, buddy. Give it a chance.  Hey, Mateo.  Did you know that I work with a lot of superheroes?  Yeah. And I think that you might have some powers.  - Me? - Let me test it.  One thing that superheroes can do is manipulate time.  You see that scoreboard?  Okay. Squeeze your eyes really tight.  Okay, that's how you freeze time.  [GASPS.] Mateo, oh, my God. Look at the scoreboard.  It didn't change. You did, dude.  - You froze time! - I'm a real superhero.  DIRECTOR: Less like Superman, more like sperm.  Good note.  [GRUNTING.]  And cut!  What an amazing performance.  No one can do sperm like you.  I'm so glad we went with your script changes.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow. Rogelio is really buttering him up.  It's so great when someone can admit that another idea  is way, way better than his own.  Isn't it? And since we're talking about the greater good,  would you consider helping talk Darci  into giving birth in the Ricky Martin Celebrity Birthing Suite?  Ah, now I get it.  Look, Esteban, this isn't about me or you.  It's about a safe birth.  I've been doing a lot of research on home births,  and it's dangerous at Darci's age.  Thirty-two?  Sure.  It just gets dicey over 28.  Please, Esteban. I just want what's best for both of them.  Darci won't listen to me, but she will listen to you.  We're ready for you, Rogelio.      [GROWLING, GRUNTING.]    [GRUNTING.]    [SHOUTING.]  Ooh, cotton candy! Can I get some?  Oh, you're gonna have to ask your dad, dude.  Oh, shoot, he's on the move.  Hey, I'm gonna need your help, Mateo.  Could you use your time-freezing powers to help me catch him?  I'm like Wonder Woman, Daddy.  [CHUCKLES.]  [PHONE CHIMING.]    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh, who's Tara?    Uh-oh. Looks like somebody wants to get to second base.  One, two, three, freeze. Ha! I'm getting a gummy worm.  [LAUGHS.]  Thank you for going.  It seems like Mateo finally warmed up to him.  Yeah.  Uh, what's with the face?  Can we talk?  DARCI: We got to talk, right now.  And I am going to try to stay calm,  because seething rage is never good for a fetus.  - I agree with you. - Wonderful!  In the future, if you don't agree with me,  let's discuss it one-on-one,  instead of you trying to trick my lover  into talking me out of my choice.  I'm not sure what  Rogelio, I am three days overdue; don't mess with me.  I'm giving birth in a tranquil tub,  with jazz music, my beloved Esteban,  and our doula Sequoia by my side,  whether you like it or not.  What if something goes wrong?  Then we'll drive the 17 minutes to the hospital,  where my O.B. will be ready for us.  I'm not stupid. I have a contingency plan.  But I want to try to do this my way.  I've been waiting almost 32 years  [COUGHS.]  I want to experience the magic of natural childbirth.  What if we take Sequoia and the tub to the hospital?  No! I'll chicken out, I'll get an epidural, and I really want  to feel every moment of this amazing experience!  - It's not just about you. - XIOMARA: Yes, it is.  Sorry.  But it is all about her right now.  It's her body, and she has the right to choose  how she wants to give birth.  - Thank you, Xo. - Of course.  And really, anything you need.  Actually, I wouldn't mind having the baby here.  Nice big room, even closer to a hospital just in case.  Plus, way less mess at my place.  ADAM: You look tense.  Yeah, well, there's no easy way to say this.  But  Raf caught a glimpse of your phone  and saw text messages from somebody named Tara.  - Oh. - And her boobs.  And it's okay.  I mean, we haven't had the ""are we exclusive"" talk yet.  Of course we're exclusive.  And, um  this is probably gonna ruin the surprise a little bit,  but Tara was helping me with a project.  For you.  [CHUCKLES SOFTLY.]  [WHISPERS.]: Oh, wow.  [LAUGHS.]  I, uh, I designed it.  Um, Tara is the printer that I use.  I just thought you would like to see  what it would look like in real life.  We went back and forth a few times, notes on the boobs.  Hence the text.  It's amazing.  I thought you didn't even like my book.  What?  I-I said it was really good.  Exactly. That's all you said.  Well, I-I'm more of a visual person, not a words person.  I guess this is what I thought of it.  I love this.  Oh, wow, that woman's cleavage is perfect.  I am so sorry for jumping to the worst conclusion.  - It's okay. - Not really.  But I guess that's what you're signing up for.  My whole messy life.  My nosy baby daddy and my overprotective grandma.  A kid.  Now are you panicking?  Not a chance.  KATHERINE: Mmm, I'm all in.  Are you?  Are you?  You know I'm crazy about you.  I just don't want to misunderstand the nature of our relationship.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You mean that it's a mutually beneficial  business arrangement?  Because I've had enough flings since my divorce.  So, I'm looking for something more serious now.  So if that's not what you want  We are on the same page.  Great. [LAUGHS.]  So, can I meet your kids?  I mean yeah, I would love that.  Hmm.  Oh, it's just that  Jane has this really strict three month rule,  and if I push back at all,  she turns into a full-blown rageaholic.  Which brings us to our little rageaholic.  - It's fine. It happens to everybody. -   Don't sweat it, okay?  So you're Jane.  Hello, Katherine. What can I do for you?  Look, I'm a straight shooter.  So I wanted to officially introduce myself  since I'm gonna be a part of Rafael's life.  And his kids' lives.  What?  Yeah.  He wants to introduce me to them.  And just so you know, I'm not afraid of your temper.  - Excuse me? - I get it, you're a rageaholic.  Well, I can throw down, too.  And I'm in this for the long haul, sweetie.  The Cortes group is a few weeks away from buying this hotel,  which makes me not only Raf's girlfriend,  but also your future boss.  [CHUCKLES.]  XIOMARA: Are you hearing this?  [ESTEBAN AND DARCI MOANING.] They're trying to induce.  [LOUD MOANING CONTINUES.]  Look  I'm sorry for siding with Darci.  I should have talked with you about it privately.  It's fine.  Then-then what's going on?  I mean, you've been upset all day.  Are you gonna make me ask you three times in a row?  What? I don't do that.  What's wrong? Nothing.  - Are you sure there's nothing's wrong? - Yes.  Are you really sure there's nothing wrong?  Okay, the thing is that you're right.  It's Darci's choice on how she wants to give birth.  But this is the first big decision about our child,  and she and Esteban edged me out.  And I'm afraid this is the first of many  series of thing they're gonna edge me out of.  And I already missed out on Jane's birth  and all of her ""firsts"", and I don't that to happen again.  DARCI: Yes, baby!  Make it happen!  I'm sorry, Ro.  Oh, no, no, don't feel bad.  This is why I didn't want to say anything.  What happened with Jane is in the past.  This time, I need to be there from the beginning.  And at this rate, I'm gonna be on the sidelines for all of it.  Darci and Esteban will be that stars of the play  and I will be the stagehand.  And everyone knows that stagehands are losers.  Here's your water.  Oh, thank you, Rudy.  Okay, listen.  I'm glad I know what you're worried about,  because now we can make sure that doesn't happen.  I'm coming to this birth with you,  and I'm gonna make sure that you're just as much a part of it  - as Esteban. - ESTEBAN: I did it!  I broke her water!  We're in labor!  [WHOOPS, LAUGHS.]  [SCREAMS.]  You got this, Mushy. You can do it.  Yes, keep breathing.  See? You're just as much a part of this as Esteban.  - Okay, let's do this. - [DARCI WAILS.]  ESTEBAN: Just like we practiced.  [PANTING.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of mama drama  What is it now, Mother?  I know Katherine is cover for Rafael.  He's actually the one buying the hotel. Yeah.  And I will tell Dr. Luisa right now  unless you agree to give us ten percent.  And not Czech ten percent, American ten percent.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in that moment, Petra found herself caught  between a Czech and a hard place.  Okay.  Ten percent.  With the following conditions.  The day the deal closes, you two have to go back  to the Czech Republic. I'll pay you monthly.  And if you ever step foot in the U.S. again, payments stop.  Deal.  What's happening with the Katherine deal?  Well, I thought you didn't want me to see Katherine anymore.  Well, the calculation's changed. Magda knows we're behind it.  Look, if Luisa finds out you're involved,  she'll never trust another outside investor.  This is the only chance we have.  - And we need to move quickly. - RAFAEL: Hmm.  Well, I guess morals only take you so far, huh?  Well, you already slept with her. Might as well close the deal.  Once you throw out the line,  catch the freakin' fish.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong?  Just a little annoyed.  I mean, I-I wouldn't say that I'm in a rage.  Oh.  Katherine called?  Oh, no, no. She didn't call. She came and confronted me.  I'm really sorry. I panicked.  I knew you wouldn't want her to meet Mateo,  but I didn't want to drive her away.  Rafael! Can you even hear yourself?  You're obviously using her.  And she told me she's in it for the long haul.  - She'll be fine. - What are you even doing?  I'm trying to get my life back, Jane!  I need to get my life back. My money, my hotel.  That is not your life. You have these great kids.  Mateo worships the ground that you walk on.  And if you continue to date somebody  that you don't even like, he will pick up on it.  He picks up on everything.  Take a step back.  Look at the big picture everything you do have.  [WHISPERS.]: Yeah.  [SIGHS.]  Abuela is taking me to get my cast off soon.  You still good to watch Mateo?  I actually have a meeting.  I was thinking maybe Adam could watch him?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, she really did turn him around.  The baby's turned around.  - [SCREAMS.] - She's sunny side up,  and that's why it hurts so much.  She needs water! Get her water!  [DARCI SCREAMING.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ugh, I wish we could time warp this.  I can't do this anymore. I quit.  I want to go to the hospital.  - I need a freakin' epidural! - No.  No, you don't. I believe in you.  - Just push, Mush! - [MOUTHING.] Get in there.  I didn't mean literally.  You can do this, Darci!  You've got this!  You wanted to be in control of the birth then take control, damn it!  You said you wanted to feel the magic of a natural childbirth  because you've been waiting for this for your whole life!  All  32 years!  So keep going. Push! Push!  Yes, Mushy! What he said.  Push!  - Push! - [SCREAMING.]  [GASPS.]  [PANTING.]  ROGELIO: We did it! We did it.  You know, you guys could have worn swimsuits.  Darci had a baby.  I have a little sister!    Yay!  Hey, hey, hey, congratulations.  Mateo and I came up with a little special celebration  for you getting your cast off,  but I guess it's a double celebration now.  You want to go show her?  We made our own moves up.  Let's do the Time Warp again   It's just a jump to the left   [JANE LAUGHS.]  And then a step to the right   Put your hands on your hips   You bring your knees in tight   But it's the pelvic thrust   -  -  That really drives you insane   Let's do the Time Warp again   Let's do the Time Warp again   [LAUGHS.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, it's a really long song, so,  let's time warp through this ""Time Warp.""  Thank you so much.  Can I talk to you for a minute?  Oh, yeah, of course, buddy.  Let's sit on the porch swing.  That's where Mommy has all her big talks.  - Okay. - [CHUCKLES.]  All right, what's on your mind, Mateo?  Well, just about my mommy.  After Michael died, she cried for a really long time.  You know about Michael?  Well, sometimes she still cries.  So don't hurt her feelings and don't die, okay?  Yeah, you got it, buddy.  ROGELIO: This is the perfect child.  Have you ever seen such perfect toes?  Who knew toes could be so adorable?  Thank you for telling me to get in the tub.  I really needed that push.  XIOMARA: This is one lucky baby.  She doesn't know it yet,  but she has the best father in the world.  JANE [LAUGHS.]: Aw!  I can't believe I have a sister.  [CHUCKLES.]  We can see her tomorrow.  Oh, and I heard from the publisher.  They approved your cover. How cool is that?  - So cool. - Right?  [SIGHS.]  - Jane? - Hmm, yeah?  I'm panicking.    KATHERINE: I wasn't expecting this.  Well, I wanted to make sure it was clear where I stand.  [CHUCKLES.] Hello.  ALL: Hello.  Hello.  My name's Carl.  Rose sent me to help you get the money quicker.  [INHALER PUFFS.]  Really? [GASPS.]  What did she say? What what should we do?  We need to collect the insurance on this hotel.  How?  We're gonna burn this place to the ground.  LATIN NARRATOR: Okay, now I'm panicking."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Okay, friends, you'll recall  Jane was dating Adam, whose life was   slightly different from hers.  But it was going great.  He even bonded with Jane's son, Mateo.  Don't hurt her feelings and don't die, okay?  - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Unfortunately  - I'm panicking.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking of panicking,  Rafael was so desperate  to get his hotel back from his sister, Luisa,  that he made a secret deal with hotel financier  Katherine Cortez.  And Katherine was super into him,  and he was, well, trying to convince her  he was on the same page.  So Rafael made a big move.  But little did he know Luisa had plans of her own   My name is Carl.  Rose sent me to help you get the money quicker.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:  thanks to this creep.  I know, straight out of a telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this.  Jane's father recently got back together with her mother.  Only complication: his ex, Darci,  just gave birth to their daughter.  Oh, and she also fell in love with his archrival, Esteban.  I know, crazy, right?  So let's see what happens next.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was 28 years, two months,  and 12 days old,  she met her baby sister for the first time.  But it wasn't until five days later  that they had their very first photo shoot.  So cute.  Love it so much.  Jane, your sister found her light.  I need you to find yours.  - Great. - (CAMERA SNAPS)  Okay, not, let me see you smile.  More. More.  With your eyes.  As I taught Tyra Banks, you have to smize.  - Got it. Perfect. - Great. So that's a wrap?  - Yes. - Okay.  On that costume.  Um, well, uh,  how many of these are we doing?  Oh, we'll go as long as your sister has stamina.  Okay  time for eggs!  ROGELIO: Can you curl up and make yourself a little smaller, Jane?  You just look so big next to her.  She's 18 inches long.  Smaller.  If you don't believe you're a bear,  I won't believe you're a bear.  Come on!  Get in touch with your mama bear instincts.  Good! All right, everybody out.  - Closed set. - Why?  Oh, it's time for your naked shot.  - Your little bums side by side - Okay, photo shoot's over.        DARCI: Oh  I don't buy Jane as a bear,  but the baby's killing it.  No posting, though.  Oh, of course not. There's a complete  press and social media blackout on the baby  until we do our own photo shoot  - for the birth announcement. - Fine, but we can't  send out an announcement until we settle on a name.  And again,  it's a hard pass on Rogeliana.  Then what's your pitch? Because Darcella is also out.  Agreed.  We both have to love it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.  Looks like things are actually pretty good  between the two of them.  Actually, I had an idea.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean, the three of them.  And it is a beautiful name.  I really love it.  Don't let the fact that it came from me  stop you from embracing it, Rogelio.  Just get it over with.  BOTH: One, two  - Amada. - Amada.    Hmm. I actually like that.  Right?  - So do we have a winner? - Hold up.  I mean, would I buy a Lamborghini  without driving it first?  - You can't afford a Lamborghini. - The point is  I have to take it out for a spin first and see how it feels.  I felt ridiculous,  but the pictures are actually cute.  - (CHUCKLES) - I was thinking I could text one to Adam.  Like, with no context.  Like, me, ""Hey,""  coming out of an egg.  You really don't think I should?  I think you told me  not to let you reach out for a week.  Yeah, but isn't four days enough?  You said to say no.  And I do think a week of space is good.  You guys moved so fast.  You have to take a beat  and think about where you're heading.  I know.  I mean, I get why he panicked.  Thinking of having a kid around  is different than actually having a kid around.  - (CHUCKLES) - (MICROWAVE BEEPS)  I just like him so much, Ma.      Great. He's just on a deadline.  Can you tell Mateo that his ice cream's ready, please?  - Mm-hmm. - Gracias.  She just started liking him.  If everything works for us,  I don't want to go backwards.  I want two scoops.  (CHUCKLES) You know the rules. Only one.  Daddy's friend lets me have two.  Which friend?  I think Kathord?  ""Kathord""?  Katherine?  When did Mateo meet Katherine?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aka Kathord.  - Last week. - I thought you were gonna end things with her.  I never said that. You assumed.  Well, I certainly didn't assume that she'd be meeting Mateo.  - Well, he had just met Adam, so - That was an accident.  And you insisted on sitting down with him  to make sure that he was a good influence.  Oh, you want to sit down with Katherine? Look,  it was a casual thing.  And I get that you're upset that it happened  It didn't just happen. You decided to do it.  And then you decided not to tell me.  Because I knew you'd react like this.  And honestly, I thought it'd be easier  to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission.  Is that what you're doing right now?  Begging forgiveness?  Yes, Jane, I am. I am sorry I didn't  - talk to you first. - Oh, stand up.  You don't have to get down on one knee.  I was doing a lunge.  - Oh. - Look,  it was a quick meeting, okay?  It's not like she's suddenly gonna be  a big part of his life.  Well, if that changes, will you tell me?  Yes.  XIOMARA: So, please let me know,  because we'd love to have Kayla in dance class this semester,  but the session's almost full. Thanks.  Well, that's great news.  Session's almost full.  I thought you said enrollment was down.  It is. I just said that to pressure them.  I keep losing students to Stage Sensations.  Stage Sensations   The next generation   Of singing and dancing   And acting sensations.   ANNOUNCER: Coming soon to a mall near you.  I'm sorry you're stressed.  And so is Amada.  Who's Amada?  It's a name we're trying out.  Would you like to hold her before Darci picks her up?  I heard that holding a newborn for a few minutes  actually makes you more relaxed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, I'm guessing  he didn't hear that from a stay-at-home parent.  Next time.  I've got, like, a million calls to make.  SONIA: What are you staring at?  Oh, yeah. My customer's hot.  I think your customer's Jeffrey Mullins.  Let me see his receipt.  (GASPS) Oh, my God.  It is Jeffrey Mullins.  He is a huge New York literary agent.  Ooh, so cute and rich.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Book agent, not movie agent.  Made that mistake once.  You don't understand.  This is kismet. I've been talking with my editor  about meeting with an agent before my book comes out,  and here's one of the biggest in the country, and  Why is Petra air kissing  - Jeffrey Mullins right now? - Hmm.  Oh!  Petra, hey. (CHUCKLES)  You know Jeffrey Mullins?  He has a house in Palm Beach.  We've been to about a million fund-raisers together.  He's really into saving dolphins or sea monkeys or something.  Honestly, it's hard to focus on what he's saying.  - He's so handsome. - I would love to meet him.  Like, really love.  Because he's a book agent.  Oh. Oh, that's right.  - You're a writer. - Yeah, right.  I'm a writer. So, can you introduce me to him?  I'll do anything.  - Sure. I'll set up a meeting. - Oh.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm, that was easy.  - What? - I just expected a little more pushback.  Yeah.  Usually I'd try to get something.  Well, I guess since we're both over Rafael,  there's not much to fight about, right?  No more drama.  I like that.  No more drama.  (LAUGHS) Yeah.  (BOTH SCREAM)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Is it just me,  or does that seem like a bad omen?  What is that?  Are those ?  Oh, my God. Termites.  - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) - Ugh!  JANE: I feel like they're all over me.    (SIGHS)  - (VIDEO GAME BEEPING) - What?  - Mateo. - (BEEPING STOPS)  - Where did you get this? - I can't remember.  - What do you mean, you can't remember? - What's going on?  Daddy, don't worry. I didn't tell her who it was from.  (VIDEO GAME BEEPING)  I'm sorry, Mateo. You're too young for this.  - (BEEPING STOPS) - Mommy, that's mine!  It was a gift from Kathord.  - Well, you shouldn't have been given it. - Give it back!  I want it back this very minute!  I'm going to give you some time to calm down, Mateo.  Now! Now! Now!  Do you need some time to calm down?  She gave him an iPad,  and you told him to lie about it?  I didn't tell him to lie.  I just told him not to mention it.  Kind of like a joke.  Wait, you're justifying this?  I didn't know she was gonna give it to him.  But a lot of kids have them, so it's not that big of a deal.  - Except we have a no screen rule. - No.  You have a no screen rule  that I went along with, but you know what?  I've changed my mind. I am fine with them.  Too bad. My house, my rules.  Then maybe I shouldn't live here anymore.  Great. You can leave right now.  Perfect. I'll go stay with Katherine.  Terrific. Maybe if you're a good boy,  she'll buy you an iPad.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa! Looks like Jane  really got in touch with her mama bear instincts.  LATIN NARRATOR: As you all well know, in the animal kingdom,  it's kill or be   LUISA: Quiet. I'm thinking.  About what? You did great.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You remember  - this creepy dude, right? - (INHALER PUFFS)  - Sent by Rose to help Luisa. -   Phase one complete. You released the termites.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hmm, I thought his plan would be  a little more sinister, honestly.  - Now, all you have to do next is - (KNOCKS)  Hey!  No one can see me.  (SCOFFS)  Petra, what can I do for you?  - Can I come in? - No, you can't. Um  I'm in the middle of giving myself a  a breast self-exam.  Once a month. So important.  I'm gonna stay on you about that.  Well, I just wanted to update you on the termite plan.  The guests are being relocated to the Fairwick.  Hopefully, we can keep the kids club open.  And as far as getting rid of the termites goes  I called the exterminators.  We need to fumigate immediately.  They're coming tomorrow.  Wow. Yeah. G great.  Thank you for taking care of that.  I'll let you get back to your   exam.  Hey. I was wondering if we can talk for a minute?  Of course.  Should we take a walk?  Get some air, avoid some termites.  - Sounds perfect. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow.  These two have really turned a corner.  So, I am worried about Rafael.  And mad, too, but mostly worried.  Why? What's going on?  He's just not acting like himself.  And, well (SIGHS)  I think he's going into one of those self-destructive periods.  I mean, this Katherine woman is the worst.  He can't go into business with her long-term.  But whenever we talk,  we end up fighting, and I was thinking that maybe together,  we can get through to him.  No. Absolutely not.  - What? - In fact, not only would I not  talk to him about Katherine,  but I want you to stay out of it. Understood?  - Excuse me? - This deal is on the verge of going through.  This is not about the hotel.  Okay, how's this?  If you want me to set a lunch with Jeffrey Mullins,  you'll leave Rafael alone.  So, basically, she just wants you to not say anything  to Rafael for a couple of days  until he signs this contract with Katherine?  Exactly.  And Rafael wants you to stay out of it?  Right. Yes.  So stay out of it.  And go to the Jeffrey Mullins meeting,  and don't feel bad about it.  - Really? - Yes.  Which is obviously what you want to do,  because you came to me for advice instead of Abuela.  She might give you more of the morality crap.  ROGELIO: Ah, yes.  Alba, the wise old owl.  I'm sorry, what?  That's what I landed on for her photo shoot.  Alba has such incredible wisdom to share,  so she's going to be an owl.  This is my inspiration  - Wait, what happened to ""Amada""? - Unfortunately, I had to move on.  Ryan Gosling has a daughter named Amada,  and I don't want to make  the notorious Gosling-De La Vega rivalry even worse.  Uh, I'm sure Ryan will appreciate that.  I know, yeah.  And for you, Xo I was thinking,  ""unlikely-but-enduring animal friendships.""  They might not be blood related, but they are deeply bonded.  It is an homage  to your stepdaughter-stepmother relationship.  Did any animals leap out at you?  Not really. You choose.  Okay. Wish me luck.  I'm putting up flyers for the dance studio.  (SIGHS)  Hey there, Crystal.    Oh. Hey, Xiomara.  I heard you opened a dance studio.  I heard you opened a vocal studio.  Well, you can have this pole if you need it.  My enrollment is off the charts.  Then why are you putting up flyers?  The longer the wait list, the more exclusive the club.  Word on the street says your numbers are down.  Yeah, well word on the street says  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And then, friends,  the strangest thing happened.  That's true.  - What? - You must be more successful, Crystal,  because that place Stage Sensations is killing me.  Stage Sensations   The next genera   God, I hate that freakin' song.  I'm going into business with Crystal!  - Who's Crystal? - From high school.  Slutty Crystal?  - I don't call her that anymore. - Since when?  Since we decided to go into business together.  But you guys hate each other.  We used to hate each other.  But we actually got to talking and instead of competing,  we're going to combine forces.  Increase enrollment while reducing costs.  You know, kill two birds with one stone.  But what if the two birds peck each other to death?  Oh, stop. We're over it.  And she actually has some really great ideas.  Turns out Slutty Crystal is really Entrepreneurial Crystal.  - (PHONE CHIMES) - Right. Oh.          Wha    (SIGHS)    (SIGHS)    LUISA: I don't think I can do this.  You can.  What if someone gets hurt?  The hotel's gonna be evacuated.  That was the whole point of the termites.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, that makes more sense.  All you have to do  is steal a piece of tubing from the fumigator.  Then you'll coat it in an accelerant,  you'll wait till the hotel fills with fumes,  you light the tubing and you throw it in the hotel.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, is that all?  Now is not the time to look back.  You need the insurance money, right?  That's what you said.  If I ever get caught,  you need to deposit $100 million  into my account here in the Caymans.  That'll initiate my escape protocol.  Okay, let's do it.  Let's burn the hotel down.  - Jane! - JANE: Oh.  Hi there, Katherine.  So, I heard you weren't happy with the gift I gave Mateo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Remember, Jane, don't interfere.  Think about Jeffrey Mullins,  noted book agent to minor stars.  It's fine. I I know you meant well.  I just really like to limit Mateo's screen time.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well done.  Okay, look, that's not why I'm really here.  Are you gonna be a problem for Rafael and me?  - Excuse me? - Because it seems like  you tend to overstep your bounds.  So I just wanted to make sure  you're not going to get in the way,  long-term.  No.  I'm not.  She's the worst, Abuela, honestly.    Nothing.  He's just using her to get his hotel back.  -  - Yeah.  And it's not going to end well, I can feel it.    I tried. But he told me to stay out of it.  And Petra said if I don't stay out of it,  she's not introducing me to this big literary agent.          LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which, for the  record, is the advice Jane wanted.  Which is why she went to Abuela this time.  Every time we talk, we fight.  So I was thinking that maybe I can write him a letter?    NARRATOR: Which is pretty much exactly what Jane knew she would say.    That, too.  And so, write Jane did.      -  - And trust me, friends,  - the letter was epic -   and poignant and   Mommy, I have a question.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Damn, Mateo!  Way to interrupt her flow.    - MATEO: Hi, Adam. -   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait, what?  Adam, hi! It's me, Mateo!  - ADAM: Hey, buddy! - You promised me you'd show me your comic books.  Can I come over now and see them?  JANE: Oh. Nope.  Can you come here. (GRUNTS)  (LAUGHS) Oh, my gosh. Uh, hi, Adam.  I am so sorry.  Uh, Mateo snuck off with my phone.  I don't even know where he learned how to FaceTime.  Daddy's friend Katherine showed me.  NARRATOR: Geez, does this woman moonlight at the Genius Bar?  So can we go?  Uh, fine by me,  but it's up to your mom.  You don't have to  Aw, come on.  Swing by for a quick visit.  Yay! We're coming!  Oh! (SIGHS)  Wow!  -  - This place is awesome.  - Ah, just be careful, no running. - ADAM: Oops.  Sorry, buddy, that is a first edition.  Look at these action figures.  Cool, huh?  Thanks for having us over.  I know it's not a week yet.  One more day.  I'm glad you're here.  I've been, uh,  been thinking about you a lot and missing you.  Yeah? Me, too.  MATEO: Look at me! I'm a superhero!  Okay, Mateo, be careful. Pow! Zam!  Okay. We'd better get going.  I don't want to go!  Well, it's time.  Adam invited me! He doesn't want me to go!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I wouldn't be too sure about that.  You can stay a little longer, if that would  See? I'm not going!  Yes, you are. Right now.  No, no, no, no, no, no!  Hey, you better listen to your mom, buddy.  Be quiet! I hate you!  I hate you!  Sorry.  I hate you!  KATHERINE: How do you really feel about me?  What?  What are you talking about?  Oh, I ran into Jane,  and she gave me the sense that  you don't see us as a long-term thing.  - She said that? - No.  But I could tell she was thinking it.  Well, maybe she's just jealous.  Ignore her.  I wish I could.  It's just  when you have money, it's hard to tell if people want you  or they want your lifestyle.  I completely understand.  I had a lot of money, remember?  Yeah.  Still  I know this is a great deal.  But deal aside  how do you feel about me?  Because if you don't have real feelings,  you can just tell me  and we'll go our separate ways.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in that moment, friends,  Rafael's animal instincts kicked in.  He just needed to survive.  We are not going our separate ways.  Look, I didn't want to say this so soon, but  I'm falling for you, Kitty.  (EXHALES)  (SNIFFS)  Hey, Adam. I'm I'm sorry again about earlier.  ADAM: No, no, it's fine.  Look, I know we decided  to think about things for a week,  and it's only day six,  but can we just bag this whole time apart thing?  - What? - Well, um  unless you're over me.  No. I I'm  I'm just surprised, after what happened with Mateo.  It was cool, actually.  I realized I can put up with that, easy.  Oh.  Yeah, um  I I I don't want to be with somebody  that can just ""put up"" with my son.  Well, no, that's not what I meant.  I meant that it's worth it, for you.  I don't want to feel like I'm being tested  every time we're with Mateo.  No, it's coming out wrong. You won't.  I will.  - I misspoke. - JANE: I know.  But it's still true.  Look, Adam, I I think that we should  One more day.  - What? - ADAM: We said seven days,  so you can't break up with me today.  Just think about it one more day, okay?  Please, Jane.  Yeah. Okay.  We'll talk tomorrow.  ROGELIO: Who has the best husband in the world?  You do!  Because the soundstage has been  officially booked for your promo video shoot.  Aw, Rogelio!  And I was able to scrounge up some tasteful,  yet very dazzling wardrobe options,  so you and Crystal will have plenty to choose from.  Thank you, Best Husband in the World.  And since you'll be on set anyway,  would it be easier for you if I just schedule  your photo session with the baby for right after?  Uh, you know, I'd rather not.  It's gonna be really hectic that day,  and my head's gonna be totally in the game for the video shoot.  I got to call Crystal.  (SIGHS)  You may not have picked up on it,  but your mother hates Delilah.  Who's Delilah?  The baby.  Are you saying you don't see her as a Delilah?  No. Uh, it's cute.  And Mom doesn't hate her.  Really?  Because she hardly looks at her,  she doesn't want to hold her,  and she clearly doesn't want to do the photo shoot.  Dad, you have to remember that Mom didn't really want  a baby in her life, so it's gonna take some time  for her to warm up to Delilah.  Yeah.  I don't like it.  Well, you don't have much of a choice if Mom needs time.  No, not that.  Delilah. I hate it. Don't ever use it again.  Matelio, what do you think your aunt's name should be?  How about Pee Pee Pants?  - Mateo. - Okay, Poo Poo Pants or Dirty Diaper.  Mateo, where do bathroom words belong?  In the bathroom.  Mm-hmm.  Okay, Toilet Plunger or Diarrhea Poo.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: The kid's a potty mouth thesaurus!  ROGELIO: It's okay, baby.  We'll find a name for you.  So, they start out as babies, but they breed like crazy.  They lay, like, 30,000 eggs per day.  Uh, so how soon can you get this taken care of?  - Soon as the hotel's evacuated. - Oh, well, everyone will  be out by the end of the day.  And how long before it's safe to open our doors again?  MAN: Well, ideally, on a space this large,  you want to allow yourself a 72-hour  aeration process, but you'd probably get away with 48.  PETRA: But I I was told that we could  - leave the kids club open. - Yeah.  That's far enough away.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us to   Where's Rafael? Is he running late?  I don't know. I'm not his keeper.  It's Saturday brunch. We never miss brunch.  That's why I'm asking.  I'm sure he'll be here.  You don't have to worry.  Hey.  Hands off, right?  Come on, kids, let's go eat!  JANE: Well, actually, my hands have been a little on.  - Excuse me? - You'll find out soon enough,  so I might as well tell you.  Tell me what?  I wrote Rafael a letter,  and I gave it to Krishna to give to him.  What? Wait, wha I don't understand.  What kind of letter?  You remember, Mommy. This one!  (STAMMERS, LAUGHS)  You stole my letter?  No.  Stealing is wrong.  JANE: What?  Just like it's wrong to say  you're going to stay out of something  and then not keep your word.  That's lying.  Do we lie?  - BOTH GIRLS: No. - Sometimes.  Well, we also agree lying is wrong.  But there is a difference between lying  and changing your mind.  And we think the most important thing is to put  Daddy's well-being above his wallet. Right, Mateo?  PETRA: Great.  Then take care of his well-being after the papers are signed.  So they're not signed yet?  (SIGHS)  Just let it go, Jane.  CRYSTAL: The key is to never let go.  Really squeeze the thighs.  Why are there stripper poles here?  This is supposed to be a promo  for a kids' performing arts studio.  CRYSTAL: They're not stripper poles.  That's just what they're called.  Here, let me show you what I have for the video.  (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING)  He couldn't speak a word of English   But I could tell by his sighs   I couldn't speak a word of Spanish   And so we talked with our eyes.   (MUSIC ENDS)  You want to do that on camera?  No, of course not.  I want the kids to do it!  They're children!  Jane?  Jane, could you put your phone down?  We're trying to teach the kids it's rude to be on your phone.  I found him!  I can tell those ears anywhere. And that tight shirt.  And I know exactly where the Shangri La is docked.  What are you doing?  I'm giving him my letter.  He hasn't signed the deal yet.  No, you can't.  - You can't. - Mateo, stay with tia Petra.  Oh, no, you don't.  Rachel, watch the kids!  (PETRA YELLS)  (GRUNTS)  Stop!  A letter won't change his mind.  Then why are you trying to get it?  Ah!  No! (GRUNTS)  No!  No!  (LAUGHS)  Ah!  (YELPS)  No!  Oh  Ah! Ah!  Are you crazy?!  PETRA: Just let it go, Jane!  - Give it to me! - JANE: It's okay!  Mommies are just playing!  PETRA: Let it go!  No! (GRUNTS)  Ha!  - (GASPS) - Got it!  Ha!  Guess what?  I memorized it!  No!  - (GIGGLING) - Jane!  Wow.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, it's a real jungle out there.  Jane! Jane!  (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)  Run, run, run   You'll never get away.   See?  The kids can all be mountain lions and wolves,  and this way, we can do some of the less explicit moves  that you like to do.  That's not very sexy.  No, it isn't sexy,  because again, they're kids.  But we can green-screen the poles into trees,  and make a cool background forest.  I don't know, Xo.  It feels so random.  Hi, there.  Is everything all right?  Can we take five?  Fine with me.  I'm gonna go vape.  (SIGHS)  What's going on?  You hated Slutty Crystal since you were teenagers  and clearly nothing's changed.  - It's fine. - Why are you working with her?  I don't exactly have a lot of options.  Then take some time and find a better one.  - I can't. - Why?  Because I need to get out of the house  so that I don't get sucked into the baby vortex.  So  all this because you hate Fiona?  What?  I don't hate Fiona.  I don't think Fiona works.  Look,  it's the opposite, okay?  I love this baby,  whatever she's called.  Oh, come on.  How could I not with those cute little chipmunk cheeks?  But I know myself.  If I'm not careful,  I'll start to focus on her, and her needs,  and mine won't count as much.  And  I'm scared of that happening.  You know, again.  Then let me help you.  You don't need Slutty Crystal,  you have Slutty Rogelio.  I'm your partner. And you have my word  that if the baby starts to become the focus,  I will push you out the door myself.  Are we gonna rehearse this thing or not?  Uh  I'm sorry, Crystal.  I just think we have different visions for the studio.  I don't think our partnership's gonna work out.  (SIGHS LOUDLY)  You know what?  Everyone told me not to go into business with Skanky Xo.  Skanky Xo?!  Oh  Hey.  Should we work on the video for your dance school?  Drum up some business?  I have a better idea.  Okay, you're fierce.  You're protecting your chipmunk!  Now there's a predator approaching!  Guard her!  But happy guarding.  And smize.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the classic bond  between a she-wolf and her chipmunk.  Yeah, I don't know what to say about these two animals.  Jane, if you blow this deal, I will text Jeffrey  and tell him never to meet with you ever.  What the hell are you two doing here?!  - Nothing. We were just leaving. - We're here because I'm scared for you, Rafael.  You're not a user, but right now, you're using Katherine,  and the last time you did something like this  something you knew was wrong you ended up in prison.  And I don't want anything like that to happen again because  I love you, and I know who you are.  You are a good, smart, decent person  and a role model for your children.  For the last time, I am doing this for my family!  So, you need to go back down  to the kids club before you blow my whole deal!  Leave!  Now!  What's this?  - Open it! - (LAUGHS)  Cool!          No.  But I said everything I wanted to say,  and it was awful.  He exploded.  He is just convinced  he's doing this big, heroic thing for his family.  Bueno.      You were right.  About Adam.  I had this fantasy,  I guess, about him just sliding right in.  You know? Coming over for family dinners and  He panicked.  Because of Mateo.  And he said he wanted a week to think about things,  and now it's been seven days and  -  - No, actually.  Now he suddenly says he's ready.  But I can't do that to Mateo.  I want to be with someone  who sees him as a blessing, not a burden.  Bueno.    What?        Did you just call Adam mature?  (SIGHS)    I just don't want Mateo to get hurt.          When he said he was panicking,  I felt exactly the same, you know?  Like when I was 19 and he left.  JANE: And part of me feels  like you're going to break my heart again.  And that's the truth.  And I'm a little scared.  Yeah, me, too. Real scared of all this.  That's why I needed a minute.  Yeah, I get that.  But I am all in, Jane.  Yeah?  - You ready to go to dinner? - Mm-hmm.  (LAUGHS)  So, what does everyone think the baby's name should be?  - Oh, Dad, no. Not again, please. - You've hated every name you've tried.  - We're over it. - What do you think, wise old owl?  Who?  (CHUCKLES) Exactly.  You're already in character for your photo shoot.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, trust me.  You're gonna want to see this.      Hmm?      See?  Are you the wise old owl or what?    PerdÃ³n. Wise owl.  Gracias.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You know, I can kind of see it now.  What a hoot.  All right, I will agree to Amada for the first name  if I can choose the middle name.  Something meaningful.  I thought you didn't like Amada  because of the whole Ryan Gosling feud thing.  I've tried a million different names; nothing stuck,  so I will handle The Gos  and stomach the wrath of another ruthless Canadian.  For the baby.  Actually, I don't even really like Amada anymore.  This is getting ridiculous. Our baby needs a name.  I know!  Come on, baby.  Speak to us.  - What's your name, baby? - Tell me, baby.  Talk to me, baby.  (BABY COOS)  Is it me, or does Baby kind of work?  Baby.  It's perfect.  Hi, Baby.  Hello, beautiful Baby.  So, what's that middle name you had in mind?  Darci and I would like to introduce you all  to the newest member of our familia.  Baby Michaelina  De La Vega-Factor.  Michaelina? After Michael?  Well, he was my best friend, so  Oh  Can I hold her?  - Yes. - (CHUCKLES)  (LAUGHS)  Hi, Michaelina.  Baby Michaelina.  Yes, yes, you are a baby, Michaelina.  No, it's Baby.  - Who? - ROGELIO: First name, Baby.  Middle name, Michaelina.  Baby Michaelina.  - Oh. - Oh.  Oh.  - Should we show them? - Yes.  (WHISPERS): One, two, three.    - (CHUCKLES) - (LAUGHS)  Hi.  My baby sister,  Baby.  Hey.    I'm putting my stuff in storage  so you can have your house back.  - Oh. - And thank you for letting me stay here.    Well, as soon as I have this hotel deal in hand,  I am getting you a trainer and a gym membership.    Right. Forgot.  The Villanuevas don't believe in money.    Not Jane.  She's constantly telling me not to.  But what she doesn't understand  is that it's different to have it and lose it.    - Who? -               LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of losing something big   Okay, you ready to light the tube?  What is beautiful doctor doing?  Carl, this is Anezka.  Anezka  this is my friend Carl.  Uh, nice to meeting you.  We met in college.  I wanted to show him my hotel.  And he's also a fumigator,  so I wanted to get his opinion.  And have a cigarette.  I know I shouldn't smoke.  (LAUGHS): But I'm trying not to drink.  Anyway  Carl and I, we have to go. Bye.  ANEZKA: Mother   I think I just caught Dr. Luisa trying to burn down hotel.  What?  But that's not even craziest part.  Dr. Luisa introduced me to her friend Carl,  but there was no one there.  She just be talking to the air.  There is old saying in Czech:  ""If you talk to someone who is not there,  you are going crazy.""  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Speaking of talking to someone  who's not all there   you know, emotionally.  All you have to do  is file the paperwork with the lawyers,  and that's it.  The Marbella's ours.  And I want to take you on a trip to Greece to celebrate.  We can make it a family trip.  All the kids with the nannies, of course.  - Katherine, that's - Family dinners.  Private desserts.  All you have to do is say yes.  (OWL HOOTS)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Now, was that a real owl  or a Carl kind of owl?  Who knows?  The point is,  with Alba's words ringing in his ears,  Rafael said   I think we should talk, Katherine.  About where we're going  or not going.  What?  I just want to step back.  - I thought you said you were falling for me. - I know.  And, honestly, I kind of panicked.  You were so upset about Jane,  and I was anxious about the deal,  and I liked you, of course.  But, look, I don't want to be one of those people  you were talking about who just make you feel used.  I want to be honest with you  so that you go into this with both eyes open.  I know  that you think this deal is great for you financially,  so I hope, on a business level,  that we can still work together.  Thank you for your honesty, Rafael.  I'll need to think about it.  Of course.  (ENGINE STARTS)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, dear.  Looks like that kitty had claws."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Welcome back, friends.  When we left our Jane, she'd rekindled things  with her first love, Adam.  I am all in, Jane.  So, yeah. They were pretty smitten.  And speaking of smitten,  Jane's father Rogelio had finally married  her mother Xiomara.  Only complication,  he had a baby with Darci.  And they named her  Well, I'll let him explain.  First name, Baby.  JANE: My baby sister, Baby.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah. And complicating that  Oh.  Darci started dating his rival Esteban.  I know. Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Which makes sense, because Rogelio  was a huge telenovela star.  Though right now, he was playing someone very tiny,  who was swallowed by his love interest,  and was currently stuck inside her body.  Just go with it, okay?  And speaking of star-crossed lovers,  Jane and Rafael were currently estranged.  See, he'd lost all his money, and so he was scheming  against his sister Luisa to get his hotel back.  For the last time, I am doing this for my family!  And as for Luisa, well, she made a new friend, Carl.  Only problem Dr. Luisa introduced me  to her friend Carl,  but there was no one there.  So, yeah, Luisa was definitely struggling.  But Raf didn't know that. He just wanted his hotel back.  So he got into bed with hotel financier Katherine Cortes.  Literally. But he had a change of heart about using her.  And well, the consequences came fast and furious.  - [TIRES SCREECH.] - I know.  OMG, right? So let's dive in.  Ah, friends.  As you well know, our Jane played many roles.  And so, she had many labels.  She was a mother.  She was a lover.  She was a writer, of course.  But before she was any of those things,  she was a best friend.  To Lina.  Like my new hat?  I stole it from my sisters.  You're gonna get in so much trouble.  - [LAUGHS.] - NARRATOR: Of course, of the two,  Lina was the bold one.  She was adventurous.  Want me to teach you how to put on eye makeup?  Yeah. But no wings.  Then what's even the point?  [SIGHS.]  The kind of person who went for it.  [QUIETLY.]: Kiss him.  Which is why Jane knew  her bachelorette party had to be  A 1930s murder mystery theme?  Really?  I know. I was confused, too.  I had our favorite stripper on hold.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: He's my favorite, too.  But, apparently, this is what Lina and Danny want.  So, I will make it totally perfect.  Because that is my solemn duty as Lina's lifetime BFF.  - Oh, no. - Oh, don't tell me  that Dad can't get the costumes.  No. Sorry.  I just realized I forgot to take the pill.  Again? Why are you even still on the pill?  There are so many other options.  The ring, the shot, the patch, the cap.  Look at you, Planned Parenthood.  - Thank you. - [LAUGHS.]  Anyway, I've tried a few.  Your dad just wants to pull out, but  Oh. Okay. All right.  I'm gonna get going.  Please tell Dad thank you for the costumes and the props.  - [PHONE RINGING.] - Oh.  [SCOFFS.]  - Petra? - Everything's fine.  There's nothing to worry about.  What do you mean? Worry about what?  I just said there's nothing to worry about.  Well, that's a really weird way to start a phone call.  - Rafael was in a little car accident. - What?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Little?  He looks like he was hit by a Mack truck.  Or, say, a late model sedan.  But he's fine. Truly.  Uh, actually, we're just about to get discharged,  - so I'm just letting you know. - Okay.  Well, tell him  - I'm glad he's okay. - I will.  I'm telling you, it wasn't an accident.  Oh, I'm sure. I mean, you basically told Katherine  you were using her before the deal closed.  What were you thinking?  I just couldn't go through with it.  Oh.  You got Villanuevaed.    That's not true.  Or even if it is a little true,  I never would've worked with Katherine long-term.  Obviously, because she's completely nuts.  Oh, you don't think so?  My sister tried to drown me at sea. I have a high bar.  NURSE: All right.  You are officially discharged.  Wound care.  Keep an eye on the color.  We don't want to be seeing green pus.  We want to see red blood.  This stuff is terrific. Terrific!  Please tell your dad thanks.  Does he want to come, by the way? Or your mom?  We still have some roles to assign.  He'll be shooting, but I'll ask my mom.  Yeah, tell your grandma to come, too.  That's a great idea!  We need a dowager.  - Seriously? - Hey!  So sorry I'm late, babe.  [LAUGHING.]: Oh, my God. Still with the ""babe.""  I mean, nice to see you again.  Don't mess things up this time.  I'm trying really hard not to.  [LAUGHS.]  - Congratulations, bride-to-be. - Thank you.  This is my fiancÃ©, Danny.  - Hey. - Hey.  You look so familiar.  Yeah, you do, too, actually.  Did you ever live in New York?  Yeah. Fort Greene.  Oh, I had a bunch of friends there.  Uh, do you know Joey Brixton?  - Jenny Lawson? - Mm  Let me check our mutuals.  [QUIETLY.]: See? They're destined to be friends.  Wait.  Yeah, you two used to date, right?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Oh, sh-she's really pretty.  Not her.  Him.  Oh.  Cool.  He's also very pretty.     So, you're bisexual?  If you're into labels.  You date men and women?  I had a boyfriend in art school when everyone was experimenting,  and another in Fort Greene when everyone wasn't.  Cool.  It's just, we've had so many long talks.  How come you never mentioned this?  It just didn't really feel that relevant.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean, more relevant than who'd win  in an epic battle between Batman and Wolverine.  Which has been discussed at length.  And I guess I was nervous.  It's become an issue with people I've dated before.  Well, you've nev n dated me before.  Okay, you have.  N-Not recently.  My point is, is  [SCOFFS.] I'm totally okay with it.  You have exes, I have exes.  Everybody has exes. [CHUCKLES.]  PETRA: I'm trying, I'm trying!  How hard can it be? Just [SCREAMS.] Don't-don't pull!  I'm sorry! I'm just a little stressed.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: New role for Petra: nursemaid.  Don't be. We're gonna find another investor,  and we'll make another offer.  - [KNOCKING ON DOOR.] - [SCOFFS.]  Unless Katherine tells Luisa what we were doing.  The woman already ran me over.  I think she got her revenge.  [SCOFFS.]  I know Rafael was working with Katherine Cortes.  Guess she wanted a little more.  What are you doing here? Security!  - Someone call security! - Luisa! Luisa!  Rafael was just in an awful car accident. Look at him.  Please. Like I would ever  fall for that. It's obviously a sympathy ploy.  [SCREAMS.]  - What? - Ah. Oh.  - So it's not a sympathy ploy. - Luisa, please.  Can he just stay here till he gets better?  Look, there's a guest room.  No. And if you ever step foot  on my property again, I will have you arrested.  When did you become such a nasty,  - hateful person - Me? Me? No.  - You're the horrible person, - incapable of forgiveness  - and compassion?! - You can pretend you're not, but you are.  You're obsessed with money and power,  just like Dad.  ELLIE: Mommy!  Everything's fine.  Why don't you take the girls down to the gift shop?  We don't really need another sparkly turtle.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us to  Alba.  See, she, too, plays many roles.      Jorge's girlfriend.  [GASPS.] Hi, girls.  What can I get for you?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Top merchandiser.  Daddy's getting kicked out of the hotel again,  so we're supposed to buy something.    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And captain of Team Rafael.  [GRUNTS.]  You said it was a little car accident.  Well, technically, Petra said that.  What happened, Daddy?  I didn't look both ways before I crossed the street.        Hmm?  What happened? Where were you?  I broke up with Katherine.  I told her the truth,  that I was using her,  and she got pissed and tried to run me over.  - What? - Yeah.  She's denying it, but she did it on purpose.  And yes,  you were right. About her, and about this whole thing  being a bad idea, but I really don't need  ""I told you so"" right now, okay?  [VOICE BREAKING.]: Rafael.  What has happened to you?  To us?  That you think I would ever say that?  I'm just happy that you're okay,  and I just really want us to be okay.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup. Just a fantasy.  Here's what she really said.  Well, let me know if you need anything.  I'm gonna go to bed.  [INHALES SHAKILY.]  [DOORBELL RINGS.]  - Hi. - Hi.  - [LAUGHING.]: Hey. - [LAUGHS.]  - Oh. - Hi.  What's going on?  I just wanted to stop by.  Danny's at the airport,  picking up some of his friends for the party.  Hmm. Oh. You okay?  Totally, yes.  But listen, I'd love for you  to spend some time with Danny this weekend.  One-on-one.  Oh. Sure.  I'd love to get to know him better.  Perfect. Great.  Because I'm not sure I should marry him,  and I need you to tell me what to do.  - Lina, back up. - Oh, God.  What's going on?  Did you and Danny fight?  No. We never fight.  And maybe that's part of the problem.  Uh, what problem?  Where is this even coming from?  My sisters staged an intervention.  They are convinced that I'm making a mistake.  They think I'll be vorced by Christmas.  A-And what if they're right?  They know me.  And they've all been divorced.  Which just means they picked badly for themselves,  not that you did.  Come on. You fell in love with Danny for a reason.  What are some of the thi ts you love about him?  Well, he's-he's so sweet,  and smart and so supportive.  Plus, he's great in bed.  God, what a nightmare. You poor thing.  But he's such a square sometimes.  What do you mean?  He has bisexual friends from Fort Greene.  This murder mystery theme?  It was supposed to be  a bachelor/bachelorette party.  Why would he think that I would like something like that?  I don't want to have to learn a bunch of new words  for my bachelorette party.  What the hell is a dowager?!  A widow who got her title from her late husband.  Look, Lina, I was  surprised by the theme, too.  See? And, Jane, he likes to ski.  You know how much I hate the cold.  Plus, he doesn't have a spontaneous bone in his body.  What if I want us to quit our jobs  and travel the world for a year?  I mean, do you?  Assuming it's first-class airfare  and five-star hotels, which he would never go for  because he's so freaking practical!  Okay, you're spiraling.  I know.  Which is why I need you to tell me what to do.  XIOMARA: Not your place, and not your role.  Just tell Lina that Danny is great,  and you're completely on board with the two of them.  It's just the two of us. No Baby.  JANE: But she asked for my help.  I mean, don't I owe it to her  to give my honest opinion no matter what?  If you want to stay friends with her, no.  I absolutely want to stay friends with you.  Sexy friends.  Tell Dad I can hear him.  It's a lose-lose  situation, Janie.  If you say he sucks,  and she marries him anyway,  that will always be between you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And again, friends,  there was just so much she wanted to say.  Trust me, just leave well enough alone, Jane.  ROGELIO: Now what's wrong?  There's something I want to talk with you about  before we have sex.  Okay, a quick something, huh?  - Ideally. - Mm.  I want you to get a vasectomy.  Oh I think  it's a language thing, you know, but I thought you said  I did. I want you to get a vasectomy.  Are you insane, woman?!  It's a very common and safe procedure,  and I'm tired of taking the pill.  Well, then, tie your tubes.  That's an invasive surgery.  A vasectomy is just a snip in and out.  Well, the answer is no.  I'm not being neutered, and that's that.  Never. No way. It's not gonna happen.  Stop being such a baby.  Well, ""Baby"" is the greatest name in the world,  so I will take that as a compliment,  no matter how it was intended.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of penis panic  Here you go.  - Nice tats. - Oh, thanks.    So, is is that your type?  - What? - Just asking.  If I'm into the waiter?  I, uh, I didn't notice,  because I'm with you.  Right.  Sorry, I'm acting weird.  I'm just trying to wrap my head around it  because I'm not into women.  Maybe. Or maybe you just haven't  explored that side of yourself.  Just to let you know, my shift is over,  but my colleague Justine will treat you right.  It's been a pleasure.  [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING.]    Is that a yes on the refill?  Sorry, yes. Thank you so much.  JUSTINE: You're welcome.  [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY.]  Hey, look, is this something that's gonna get in our way?  What? No.  Because you seem pretty hung up on it.  Honestly, I'm not.  I'm completely hung up on it. And I don't want to be.  Well, it makes sense that you are.  Yeah, because it took him so long to tell me.  And because there's a double standard, you know?  When women hook up, it's looked at as sexy,  but men are immediately marginalized  because our whole culture revolves around the male gaze.      I'm not exactly following all that,  but I hear you about the double standards.  Your dad's killing me.  He said no to the vasectomy?  Again, he started talking about pulling out.  - Ma ugh! -   Again, I'm pulling out of this conversation.  We were talking about Ro's vasectomy.  Ah.      He owns more makeup than I do.  He's campaigning to be the next Cover Girl.        - Mom! -       Okay, now I'm pulling out of this conversation.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, the good old days.  DANNY: Is this a farthing or a tuppence?  I'm gonna say a tuppence.  [IMITATES BUZZER.] Oh.  Sorry, trick question. It's a ha'penny.  Oh. [CHUCKLES, SIGHS.]  Uh, so, where is Lina?  Running a last-minute errand.  - [PHONE CHIMES.] - Oh  [CLEARS THROAT.]    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Guess Jane's spending  that one-on-one time with Danny right now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, we last left our Jane  in a most uncomfortable role.          So, uh, have you done a murder mystery party before?  Yep. Never been the Duke though.  - Hmm. - I've been the Constable  and the Butler before.  Stuck being the Silversmith twice.  Don't even get me started.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I think you started.  [LAUGHS NERVOUSLY.]  Sure, I may have rigged it  so I was assigned the part, but I figure I can,  since I'm the groom and all.  I mean, if not now, when, right?  [BOTH CHUCKLING.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Quick, Jane,  think of something to say.  Uh, so, you're an accountant, right?  I am, indeed.  And how long have you been doing that for?  Five years.  No, six.  No, wait, five. Definitely five.  Five. Great.  And, uh, if you weren't an accountant  You know what, six!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Thought he was good with numbers.  Six. Got it.  And if you weren't an accountant,  and you could have any job in the world, what would it be?  You know, I actually like being an accountant.  It's steady, consistent  I don't like a lot of drama.  DIRECTOR: This is the most dramatic scene  in the whole telenovela.  - I know! - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, thank God.  I was starting to fall asleep.  But I cannot find the truth in it.  And finding the truth is very important  to my journey as an actor.  The truth is that you're saying good-bye  to the kidney stone that has been  your steadfast companion for your journey  down the lady scientist's urinary tract.  Come on, this is our big Cast Away rip-off.  Homage. And I'm just having trouble  connecting with the good-bye speech.  Well, I'm sure you'll find it on the day.  That's lunch.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, you'll recall  Ro and Esteban recently had a relationship breakthrough.  I hate him. Stay calm.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, it didn't last.  ESTEBAN: Hi, guys.  I call this the Bond and Tone.  Keeps me fit and firm, and puts Baby right down.  Well, she's going to wake up when you transfer her.  Oh, don't worry, I have this down to a science.  Yes oh.  I just take to child rearing so naturally.  In fact, Darci and I are already talking about number two.  The only number two you're having is in the bathroom.  You never had a number one.  Hey, Esteban,  what if Darci didn't want another kid?  Oh, well, of course, it's up to her.  Whatever Darci desires.  Wow.  Sounds like you'd do anything for her.  Of course. If she is happy,  I am happy.  - Very clever. - Just proving a point.  Would snipping me really make you happy, Xiomara?  It would.  And I think it would make you happy, too.  Are you not wearing a bra?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Looks like someone's taking  her mother's advice. I must have forgotten.  - Mm. - It's funny. I didn't realize  how much the fear of getting pregnant  was holding me back, sexually.  - Go on. - Well, maybe it's silly,  but I feel like once that tiny bit of fear is lifted,  I'll be able to fully express myself.  - Mm. - And it would be so simple, really.  Just snip, snip.  Boom.  All right, make the appointment.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Boom.  [GASPS.]  - Are you okay? - My laptop fell,  I-I didn't mean to wake you.  [GROANS.]  It's-it's okay. I'm fine.  I'm fine.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, again,  there was so much to say,  but that wasn't Jane's role anymore.  Then why aren't you asleep?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: But she didn't care.  What is it?  Rafael  I don't I don't know, I just feel, um  lost.  I keep replaying everything  in my mind that happened,  and how I got here.  I mean, she ran me over.  And then I think about the hotel, you know.  And the money like, what if it's all really gone?  But then I get mad at myself because  then I sound like my father or my ex-father.  And then I know I shouldn't even be thinking that  because I'm lucky to be alive.  And I know that. [SNIFFLES.]  I'm lucky.  It's okay to not feel lucky.  You shouldn't even be talking to me.  Hey, you're family.  Family shows up.  Plus, you know I love you.  Not romantically.  [LAUGHS, SNIFFLES.]  You think I should, um, just give it all up?  Just forget about the  the trust and the hotel and just start over?  It doesn't matter what I think.  I think that I have to.  Uh, you can, you can go back to bed now.  I know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, friends, we left with change  upon the horizon.  - Is that better? - Yes.  So, I prepared a few questions about the  Castration? procedure.  First, you've worked on other celebrity penises?  Yes. I've done vasectomies for many other celebrities.  - Who? - I can't say specspically,  but, uh, pretty big stars.  More or less famous than Michael Douglas?  Exactly as famous as Michael Douglas.  The snipping, is it painful?  Not at all. We use a local anesthetic.  What if I change my mind?  The procedure is totally reversible and, of course,  this will make things much easier for your wife.  That's why I'm here.  She already had her life derailed by Baby.  Oh, you had a baby.  Yes, my baby Baby.  XIOMARA: Just continue.  I want to do this for you.  Great.  But I just don't think I can.  [SIGHS.]  NARRATOR: Also having trouble pulling the trigger  Oh, Jane.  Here you are.  Finally.  What did you think?  - Hmm? - About Danny.  Just tell Lina that Danny is great  and you're completely on board with the two of them.  He's great. I'm completely on board. Marry him.  Yeah? What-what made you think that?  Well, he's-he's really interesting  and smart and he clearly loves you so much.  So you have absolutely no doubts?  - Yes. - You hesitated.  - I didn't. - Lady, give it to me.  Now.  Okay, look  it was a little hard to find a groove with him,  you know, conversationally.  Because he's boring!  I knew it! I didn't say ""boring.""  NARRATOR: Well, not exactly.  Oh, my God.  What was I thinking?  We are complete opposites.  I should be with someone sexy  and edgy and bisexual, like Adam.  Do you think I should call off the wedding?  No.  I talked to the guy for 30 minutes.  A-And it's not about me, Lina, or your sisters.  It's about you. How do you feel?  LUISA: How do I feel?  Bad, Carl. Bad.  You were supposed to help me  get the money, which I still don't have,  and my ex-brother just keeps lying and scheming.  Well, throw something else, then. Let it out.  Good idea.  [GLASS SHATTERS.]  - How long has this been going on? - A while.  [GLASS SHATTERING.]  And there's something else.  Spare me the dramatic pause.  Last week, I overheard Magda and Anezka talking.  Dr. Luisa introduce me to her friend Carl,  but there was no one there.  She just be talking to the air.  Are you absolutely sure they said ""Carl""?  [GLASS SHATTERING.]  I have to go.  [PHONE DIALING.]  Carl?  - Are you sure? - That's what Krishna said.  I just thought you should know.  [GLASS SHATTERS.]  What's happening?  Who's Carl?  Do you remember when I told you that Luisa  had a, had a nervous breakdown during her medical residency?  - Mm-hmm. - Well, she went into a psychosis  and said that someone named Carla  told her she had to barge into surgeries,  take over and save lives.  But there was no Carla.  It was a hallucination.  And she didn't believe anyone but me.  [SIGHS.] I got to talk to her.  Try to get her to accept help.  See? You show up, too.  ROGELIO: Wow.  You are a sight for sore eyes.  - Thanks for the costume. - Of course.  And I'm sorry I'm working tonight.  A-And I'm also sorry about the procedure.  I-I really wanted to do it for you.  - Don't say that. - But it's true.  It's not or you'd just  - get over your machismo. - It's not machismo.  - It is. - It's not.  - Then what is it? - I'm turning into an old man, Xo!  It's true.  I have gray hairs and things sag.  I'm in the makeup chair longer every day  and no matter what I do, it's just happening.  I can't stop it.  And this just feels like  I don't know, like I'm moving onto the next stage,  the old man stage  which, I know, sounds silly.  It doesn't. It actually makes sense.  Really? Because I was kind of hoping you'd tell me  I'm still the same hot, young stud you met 28 years ago.  You are to me.  And you always will be.  Don't worry about the vasectomy.  I'll figure something out.  Did you figure out your costume?  Did he ever. He was trying it on for me last night,  posing like no one's business.  [LAUGHS.]  [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING.]    [LAUGHS.] All right, later, guys. I'm late for work.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: No, Jane, don't ask.  What?  Nothing.  Were you wondering if I hooked up with him?  Say no.  - I was. I'm sorry. - Seriously?  - I'm sorry. It's just - That you can't deal.  I'm trying.  It's throwing me.  Obviously.  But I think it's because you didn't give me  a chance to react.  You immediately said that people acted weird,  which meant that I couldn't act weird.  Well, don't worry. You did.  - But that's why. - Maybe.  Or maybe I was right.  Once you knew, things would change.  Don't you have to meet Danny  with the rest of that party stuff?  Yeah.  I'll see you tonight?  Maybe.  Ah!  Hi. I am so sorry I'm late.  - Traffic was awful. - No problem.  Hey, have you talked to Lina lately?  Something seems off.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: You mean besides the fact  that she's not sure she should marry you?  Really? S-She seems fine to me.  No, I can tell something's wrong.  She isn't talking as much. And our waitress this morning  had really bad highlights, and she didn't say anything  and you know how sensitive Lina is to bad highlights.  - That's totally true. - My guess is  she's unhappy about the murder mystery theme,  which I knew she wouldn't be that into.  Y-You did?  Yeah, but I thought it would be a great cover  'cause I also know as much as she hates murder mysteries,  she loves surprises.  And I have a really big one planned.  Y-You do?  My groomsmen and I are planning  a little something that's more Lina  once the murder mystery is solved.  There will be glitter,  penises, cake ooh, and a striptease.  - Oh. - By me.  Wow. [LAUGHS.]  You know Lina really well.  W-Why would you think I didn't know Lina?  [BLOWS RASPBERRY.] No reason.  Did Lina say that?  That I didn't know her?  Is that why she's been acting so weird?  - That's it, isn't it? - No, no.  I-I'm the one that said something.  What?  I-I  I told Lina that I had doubts about your compatibility  because of our kind of awkward conversation.  That conversation was awkward because you were asking me  all these strange questions and I was trying to be polite  because I wanted to make a good impression  on my fiancÃ©e's overprotective friend.  Whatever, uh I'll see you at the party.  - Well yeah. - Yeah,  Looks like Danny does bring the drama after all.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Prepare, friends,  for a night of mystery, drama, and some very fine acting.  [WOMAN SCREAMS.]  [WITH COCKNEY ACCENT.]: Oh, no!  Ladies and gents,  chaps and birds, I've most dismaying news.  Ignacio de Lorenzo of Seville,  the most celebrated matador in all of EspaÃ±a  and honored guest of our host,  the Duke    has been found dead  [PEOPLE GASP, SCREAM.]  in the manor's maze garden!  [GASPS.] And what's worse,  the murderer is among us.  [PEOPLE GASP.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, so nice to be investigating  a pretend murder at the Marbella for once.  Okay, we need to talk real quick.  [WITH FRENCH ACCENT.]: We are supposed to stay in character.  Oui, Clara?    [WITH COCKNEY ACCENT.]: That's right, RenÃ©e.    I was 100% wrong about Danny and you should 100% marry him.  It's all good, old chap.  Okay. So, then, why is he shooting you the death glare?  [NORMAL VOICE.]: Because he found out about the sussing.  - What? - [COCKNEY ACCENT.]: No, but it's fine.  I said it was my idea.  He thinks you had nothing to do with it  and the important thing is  is that you're perfect for each other  and I can't wait to come to your wedding, old chap.  Really?  Ladies and gentlemen,  a suspect has emerged.  There's apparently a lunatic  from the asylum on the loose.  No. You're wrong.  Carl is not like Carla.  Carl is real.  He's not.  Think about it, Luisa.  No one's seen him but you.  Because he has to keep his identity a secret.  I know how that sounds,  but there is someone else who's seen him.  - Anezka. - She didn't.  Krishna overheard Anezka saying  that no one was there.  You were alone.  Oh, good. You're together.  Hopefully not trashing me at my own bachelor party.  - Of course not. - I wouldn't say of course.  - Danny, stop. - Sorry, I'm mad.  - Danny. I overstepped. - She was trying to break us up.  No, she wasn't.  I asked Jane if she thought we should get married.  It's not true. It's not. Carl is real  and this is one of your lies.  - He's not, Luisa. - He has blue eyes  and a peppered beard and he uses an inhaler.  This is your mind playing tricks on you.  No! I don't believe you.  I don't believe this.  You don't want to marry me?  - Lina. - Carl?!  - Carl! - Lina, answer.  Please, Carl, answer.  - Yes? - I don't know.  What should I do?  MAN: Proof!  I demand proof!  We haven't always seen eye to eye, but I trust you.  So, I'm asking you  to tell me the truth.  You see Carl here, right?  Uh  - Anezka? - No.  I am sorry, Dr. Luisa, there is no one there.  Carl, say something.  Well, it doesn't matter if I'm real to her, Luisa.  I'm real to you.  You hear that, right?  Anezka, come on, he's right here!  Okay, beautiful doctor.  Uh, hello to you, Carl.  Uh, I am loving your sweater.  He's right over here and he's wearing a T-shirt.  Okay, you just tell me what I see.  No. I  I don't understand.  If you can't see Carl, why didn't you say anything  the other night outside the hotel?  Because I did not want to embarrass beautiful doctor.  [SIGHS.]  [SNIFFLES.]  What's wrong with me?  Nothing, I promise, you're just scared.  Because he's just not who I pictured myself with.  So what?  He's who you fell for.  And he has so many amazing qualities.  I know.  But I shouldn't have these doubts  if I'm marrying him, right?  Everyone has doubts.  Did you, with Michael?  There's just so much we haven't talked about, basic stuff.  Marriage stuff. Tomorrow's just the wedding.  And the rehearsal was a disaster.  What if tomorrow's awful?  Huge doubts.  We made a list, actually.  A very long list  of all the things that we needed to discuss.  Danny loves lists.  He makes them constantly.  Aw, a man after my own heart.  He even has phone alerts  to remind him to do what's on the lists.  How have I not thought of that?  NARRATOR: And friends, that's when  Lina suddenly realized the role Danny played in her life.  - Oh, my God. - What?  I'm marrying the male version of you.  [LAUGHS.]  I mean, Danny is organized and smart  and responsible and kind of nerdy.  I mean, he's you!  [GIGGLES.]  And you're the longest relationship that I've ever had.  Aw, you're the longest relationship I've ever had.  I love you, Jane.  I love you, too.  [SULTRY MUSIC PLAYING.]  What the hell? Huh?  Were you gonna kiss me?  [LAUGHS.]: What?  No. Don't be ridiculous.  I mean  Yeah, I was.  Oh  I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Seemed like you were thinking of making out  with your best friend.  I guess I'm still a little freaked out  by Adam's big bisexuality reveal.  Well, a pretty smart friend once told me  that you fall for who you fall for.  Yeah, but this is different.  I'm not freaked out by his sexuality,  I'm freaked out that he kept it from me.  - Hmm. - What?  As your best friend in the world  and the person you just tried to make out with,  that's a bunch a crap.  Excuse me?  Don't try to make this about him hiding.  Figure out what's really going on.  Oh well, I-I guess it's because  Lady? Tell him.  Not me.  Because it's my freaking bachelorette party  and I need to go tell my fiancÃ©  that I can't wait to marry him.  - Go! Go! - [GASPS.] Okay.  Mwah.  Any more and you couldn't handle it.  [LINA GIGGLES.]  [JANE LAUGHS.]        Did you buy it?  Uh, sure?  Of course you didn't,  because I'm talking to a Styrofoam kidney stone!  Aren't you supposed to, like  pretend it's something else?  You know?  Something that means something to you?  DIRECTOR: All right, this scene moves us to the next stage.  - [BELL RINGS.] - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And friends,  it was one of those moments  when art and life come together.  Suddenly, Rogelio knew exactly how to access that emotion.                        - Cut! - [BELL RINGS.]  How dare you!  - I was in the moment! - DIRECTOR: I know,  and it was fantastic.  It's just that your eye line was off.  It kind of looked like you were talking to your penis.  [LAUGHS.]: Really?  Well, just go again.  Danny and I just had the hottest sex.  [LAUGHS.] Oh  I've never done it in a bathroom before.  At the Marbella.  At my own bachelorette party.  - [GIGGLES.] - [LAUGHS.]  [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS.]    - Oh, my God. - [WOMEN CHEERING, WHISTLING.]  That's my man.  - [WHISTLES.] - [WHOOPS.]  You look like you're having fun.  Yeah, can I go?  Your dad just texted.  He's getting snipped.  No more pulling out  Ma, again with the pulling out.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right, this time I'm pulling out.    Can we talk?  So, yeah.  It wasn't that you waited a long time to tell me.  It was what you told me.  Which became pretty clear after I tried to kiss Lina.  - What? - I know.  It was a momentary lapse of judgment.  But you're obviously right.  I did freak out.  I guess I-I  I just have questions.  Which are silly and stupid  No. Ask me.  Is being bisexual a stop?  O-On your way to coming out as gay?  Definitely not.  Um, it just means that I'm open to a connection  with a man or a women.  What else you got?  Well, I guess I feel a little insecure, you know.  It's not like I can give you what a man can.  Well, yeah, you're right, you can't.  But you can't give me what other women can give me, either.  But it doesn't matter, because I choose to be with you.  I don't want to be with anyone else,  regardless of gender.  - Really? - Yeah, really.  We're in a monogamous relationship.  Which means that you're not allowed to kiss anyone else.  I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  If it makes you feel any better, she hard core rejected me.  Well, then she's an idiot.  [GIGGLES.]  [BOTH MOANING.]  Oh, Bob  [LAUGHS.] I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.  - It's Jim, right? - [LAUGHS.]: Yeah.  LUISA: This is Mark.  You see Mark, right?  Yes.  What are you doing here?  I'm checking myself into a psychiatric hospital.  Or a wellness center if you believe the brochure.    I can't go down this path again.  Well, I'm really glad that you're getting help.  After everything that's happened,  the fact that  you're still looking out for me, it  Thank you.  And you can have your hotel shares back.  What?  That's not why I helped you.  I know.  That's why I'm giving them back.    Hey, you.  Everything okay?  Yeah.  [SIGHS.]  Luisa's going to get help.  That's great.  And she's giving me back my hotel shares.  - What? - Yeah.  She's giving everything back.  See?  You do the right thing and good things happen.  [LAUGHS SOFTLY.]  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, Jane,  after all your telenovela watching,  you should know by now, that's not true.  I know it's not how you wanted to get the hotel back,  but it's still a good thing.  My sister signed this last night.  All the shares are now back in my name.  Oh, well, unfortunately, due to your sister's mental state,  she's not allowed to change any contractual agreement.  - What does that mean? - It reverts  to the original agreement she signed six weeks ago,  which stated in the event of her incapacitation,  all her hotel shares go to  I am new owner of Marbella!  Good job, Anton.  We did it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I did tell you  there would be some very fine acting.  What Jane wants to say.  - I'm so proud of you. - I love you.  - What jane says. - Thanks.  But with the help of bestselling novelist Isabel Allende  Love, passion and killing.  Jane just might say it,  So I"
"1 NARRATOR: Ah, friends, our Jane has been through so much.  She got married to Michael, but then he died.  And so she wrote a book about their love story,  and it was going to be published.  So, great news there.  Plus, she reconnected with her very first love,  Adam.  Less happy? Our Rafael.  After he lost all his money  and was kicked out of the hotel,  well, he hit a real low point.  I just want to step back.  (GRUNTS)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Luckily,  Jane was there for him.  Not as lucky? His sister Luisa.  See, she thought she was going crazy  because she was hallucinating some guy named Carl.  You see Carl here, right?  No.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So she checked herself  into a psychiatric hospital.  But OMG! Carl was real.  See, Petra's twin sister, Anezka,  and their mother, Magda, set Luisa up  so they could assume control of the hotel.  In the event of her incapacitation,  all her hotel shares go to Anezka.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know.  Straight out of a telenovela, right?  Well, imagine this.  Jane's father was a huge telenovela star,  but he absolutely hated his costar, Fabian.  Luckily, Fabian was killed off  their telenovela.   Which reminds me,  I did say someone would die on ours.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva  was 14 years old,  she was given a gift  that would change her life.  I love The House on Mango Street so much.  What should I read next?  Is it time?  I think so.  We've been saving one of our favorite recommendations,  and we think you're finally ready  for Isabel Allende.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  as Jane tore through the trials of the Trueba family,  she realized she wasn't the only one who saw the world  a certain way.  It's called magical realism.  And there is a whole Latin American  literary tradition  to explore.  ENCHANTING MUSIC   (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)    LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And explore, Jane did.  (SIGHS)  Try this one.  Now this.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And over the years,  as Jane read  more and more stories,  her world opened up.    And often, she felt inspired.  (SIGHS)  Always write  when the spirit moves you.  Also, as a sidenote,  maybe it's time to have sex.  I mean, you are already pregnant.  (LAUGHS)  But, until then,  go on. Write.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And so, yes, this bookstore  always held a special place in Jane's heart.  Which is why  When my book comes out, it would mean the world to me  to have my launch party  - here. - Really?  I can't imagine doing it anywhere else.  We'd be so honored!  (ALL LAUGH)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here  now.    RAFAEL: Oh, wow.    It's your book, Mommy!  - It's finally here. - Yeah.  (EXHALES SHAKILY) I'm a published freaking author!  (ALL CHEER)  Hey!  (HUMMING)       RAFAEL: You know Mateo can't read, right?  Oh, he's not allowed to read my book till he's 25, anyway.  But, when that day comes,  I think he's gonna be very touched  that I wrote him a note that was so thoughtful  and moving.  (RINGTONE PLAYS)  PETRA: I need to vent.  Anezka's offering guests a discount for paying in cash.    RAFAEL: What? Why?  So that she and my mother can pocket it.  They act like they're running a backroom poker game,  not a hotel.  You have to help me get her out of here.  I'm sorry, but I'm not getting involved  with the hotel right now.  What?  Why not?  Is Jane sitting right there?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes,  the ghost of rivalries past.  This is my choice.  I've decided I'm letting the hotel go  until Luisa is better,  and then we'll see where we're at.  Your sister hallucinated a person.  She could be in the mental institution for months.  I just need to step away for my own well-being.  Ugh,  you need to get out of the Villanueva house.  Everything okay?  Well, my sister's shares have reverted back to a lunatic  who's running the hotel I built into the ground,  and I can't even go inside to see my children.  Remind me why I need to let go.  Because lying and sneaking around  got you thrown in jail in the past  and run over by a car in the present,  so we need to protect the future.  Not just for you, but for your children,  who need you as a role model.  Wow.  Guilt plus scare tactics. Well done.  Thank you.  And, not to pile on,  but seeing as you're stepping back until Luisa  is declared mentally competent  Which could take months  Why not put out some job feelers?  What?  Just to take off the financial pressure  until everything's sorted out.  (SPUTTERS) Plus, it'll give you something to do.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And get you out of the house.  Yeah. Why not?  Maybe I could consult somewhere.  Exactly.  Like a boutique hotel. That could be kind of cool.  JANE: Great.  This note's everything.  (GIGGLES)  I still can't believe it.  In hardcover.  (GASPS)  The new Angelique Harper?  And a hardcover. How decadent.  You okay?  Yeah.  Just taking it in.  Overwhelmed.  And how about that cover?  Stop, this isn't about me.  You're a published author.  I'm a published author!  Salsa   Okay, okay, fine, fine. I'll autograph your copy.  Do your thing. Yes.  - That is you and me. - Aw.  I'm the one with the longer hair.  (CHUCKLES)  Hey, so, how's that party coming?  Any agents RSVP yet?  Yes, two so far.  Plus Caridad PiÃ±eiro,  who is, like, the queen of the Latina romance world.  And I sent  a very carefully crafted tweet  about the party to Isabel Allende.  Who?  (WHISPERING) What?  She is, like, my favorite author of all time.  She's, like, my Stan Lee.  - Ah. Wow. - Mm-hmm.  What did you tweet?  (SIGHS)  Oh.      It-it may have gone on a little long,  but you get the point. I invited her to the party.  I am so proud of you.  I love you.  I love you, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yeah, that didn't really happen.  Thanks.  I'm kind of proud of me, too.  JANE: I can't believe I almost said ""I love you.""  I don't know what came over me.  Sounds like love came over you.  No. No, no, no, no.  It is way too early.  Uh, I think I just got swept up  with excitement about my book.  A-And he was so sweet about my party.  I'm not ready to use the ""L"" word.  MAGDA: Lakomy.  Velmi lakomy.   I'm not being stingy  because I refuse to let you skim cash off the bookings.  Okay.  Let's take a vote.  Who is for cash discounts?  Oh, wait, I control two-thirds of hotel.  Two to one. I win again.  MAGDA: Perfect. Anezka,  double the nightly rate.  You can't just double a hotel rate.  - There are price points. - Oh.  Speaking of price points,  ours has gone up.  If you want us to walk away,  we will need ten million.  I don't have that kind of cash.  Well, I guess you're just going to have to book  a lot of expensive rooms.  (LAUGHS QUIETLY) This plan makes no sense.  We just had termites. Bookings are down.  We're trying to bring people here,  not drive them away.  You don't have to go along with her.  You're the one in charge of the hotel.  Not her.  Yes. I am in charge.  That is why I have new business shoes.  And I trust Mother.  It is like I am queen,  and she is my hand.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Well, more like your hook.  I never thought that I'd miss having Luisa in charge.  MAGDA: Oh, really?  And did Luisa tell you she wanted to sell the hotel  to get enough money  to break her crime lord girlfriend out of jail?  (GASPS) What happened?  Oh, uh, t-the villain did something really bad.  So sorry I'm late.  Did Teresa finally tell Elena  that Rodrigo was really Juan Carlos in a bad wig?  I actually don't mind the wig, but no.  She decided to keep it a secret to use as leverage  for when Raul reveals that he's not actually dead.  Classic. Come on, Mateo.  You're coming to my house.  Okay, I'm off to drop signed copies of my book  to the bookstore because I  am a published author.  LATIN MUSIC   (CRIES OUT)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Look at her.  Nothing can shake that smile.      Oh, dear.  Looks like the bottom fell out of her plans.  Ah!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, come on, universe.  That's a little on the nose.  Hey, guys. What's going on with the store?  Oh, no.  - I can't believe it. - In all the chaos,  I-I just forgot.  - Well, what happened? - Our building was sold,  and the new landlord raised the rent.  - We can't afford it. - Wha?  We've been praying for a miracle, but  JANE: No one knows they're there anymore.  I mean, more of us buy our books online.  No one goes to the bookstores.  Oh, it's just so sad.  That little place is so magical,  and it's the only bilingual bookstore in the neighborhood.  Sorry, hon.  - What about your party, though? (SIGHS)  Well, I'll just have to go with Plan B, I guess.  I'll have it at the publisher's office.  (GASPS)  Plan B?  More like  Plan Blech.  Office parties are so sad.  All the fluorescent lighting. Sheet cake.  And all the cubicles  decorated with pictures of people's sad,  sad children.  NARRATOR: FYI Rogelio had a brief office job in 1998.  It still haunts him.  It'll be fine, Dad.  Come on, Mr. Sweetface! It's been five minutes.  - Time to go. - MATEO: (SHOUTING) No!  (MUMBLES)  - I have the most amazing idea. - You're not recreating  the bookstore on the set of your telenovela.  - Why not? - Because when you  recreated the house for Jane's wedding, it cost you 50 grand.  We don't have that kind of money right now.  The rent on our house  Our gorgeous waterfront mansion, you mean.  is exorbitant. Jane will be fine.  - She's a grown woman. - But it's my duty  - as her father - Rogelio,  if you build that bookstore, plan on moving into it.  No sulking.  Go to work. You're gonna be late for your fitting.    Oh. Good afternoon, ex-costar.  You must be here for your funeral fitting.  How is civilian life as number none  on the call sheet treating you?  Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that.  Hmm.  Now that you got what you wanted    I'm wondering if you can  find it in your heart to give me what I want.  A dignified farewell scene.  But you are already dead.  Not if I come back as a ghost.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh. Like in Our Town,  when Emily appears as a ghost at her own funeral.  Oh.  Like Amor en la Familia, when Matias comes back  from the dead to kill his stepbrother  because he slept with his father.  - NARRATOR: Or that. - Exactly!  Just one scene.  I'll come to my funeral at full size,  and make a short but impassioned speech  about the preciousness of life.  I'm up for a movie, and I'm looking  for something dramatic for my reading.  You know, to show my range.  Come on, sexpot to sexpot  can you help me?  After all that you have done  to try to destroy my life and sully my daughter,  how dare  you come and beg for more screen time!  I hope you never work in this town  again.  JANE: That's it, huh?  Yeah. My headhunter said the same thing.  I got to figure out a way to beef it up a bit.  It's not quantity, it's quality.  Plus, he says they'll run a background check,  and my criminal record doesn't help.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I mean, I could have told you that.  You just got to keep pounding the pavement.  - You'll find something. - I hope so.    JANE: It says that you're analytic,  fair-minded, result-oriented,  and incredibly sexy.  Okay.  (TAPS KEYBOARD)  Just joined LinkedIn.  - No! No, no, not LinkedIn. - What's wrong with it?  Oh, when you sign up, it e-mails everyone  in your whole address book for, like, eternity.  No, that can't be true.  PETRA: LinkedIn? Are you serious?  I didn't know. I'm sorry. Where are the girls?  On their way with their nanny.  And you should be working here.  My mother is a horror show.  We've been losing bookings left and right.  You think I don't want to be near my kids?  You think it's easy for me to watch your mother and sister  run our hotel into the ground?  Then let's come up with a plan.  Our last plan left me with three broken ribs.  I am done scheming.  I am looking for a short-term job.  NARRATOR: Pro tip leave ""short-term"" off your rÃ©sumÃ©.  Okay so what if the Marbella hires you?  As our general manager.  What? We need one.  You know the place. Why work somewhere else?  You'll see the girls.  You'll be able to help out with the hotel.  Magda will never go for it.  Let me at least try.  Absolutely not. Why would I do that?  To make the hotel profitable.  Rafael's the only person  who knows this place as well as I do.  Without him around to keep things running smoothly,  there is no way I can get you that money.  Trust me.  All I want is for you to leave.  Fine.  I will take a meeting with him.    LUISA: Carl is real,  and he uses an inhaler.  SUSPENS MUSIC   ANEZKA: Someone's clumsy.  Those shoes are ridiculous.  KRISHNA: But a lot of people have asthma.  Well, my mother doesn't.  And neither does Anezka.  Yeah, look, it's a long shot. Just show me the footage.  What time did you overhear my mother and sister  talking about Luisa? Close to midnight.  I remember because I looked at my watch,  and I thought, ""This is no way to live.""  Okay. Good, good. Go to 11:45.  Okay, now scroll through slowly till midnight.  Wait.  That's Luisa. It has to be.  (GASPS SOFTLY)  NARRATOR: Is it me, or does that shadow  totally have asthma?  Oh, my God.  Carl is real.  They must have wanted you to overhear them talking  about Luisa being insane They were setting you up!  Well, and if Carl is real, that means Luisa's  in a mental institution for nothing, right?  Well No, Well, not for nothing  she was still trying to break a mass murderer out of jail.  That's legitimately crazy, right?  But not hallucination crazy.  Which means I have to tell Raf, don't I? And I will.  Very shortly. But first I'm gonna use this  to get rid of my mother, and you're gonna help me do it.  Mrs. Solano  This is way beyond the scope of my job.  So I'm gonna need a raise.  ROGELIO: It's done.  The bookstore is staying open.  Jane, update your paperless post.  Your dream party is back on track.  I took care of everything.  So call me back. I love you.  Took care of everything? How?  Remember when I was in People en EspaÃ±ol's  ""50 Most Beautiful"" list?  You've mentioned it once or twice.  NARRATOR: A day.  Well, I stayed friends with the editor, Arianna,  and she's going to do a feature on the party.  That will bring the store tons of exposure, attention,  and, in the words of Abba,  - ""Money, money, money."" - What?  I told her everything Jane said  about what the community will gain by having a physical space  to shop, how the Internet  is ruining us all, uh, bilingual bookstores,  blah, blah, blah, and she said there's a story there!  But what does that have to do  with Alexandro and Enrique's lease?  Press plus celeb photos equals business.  And what if your calculation doesn't add up?  It will. Trust me.  And I cosigned the lease on the bookstore,  just to make everyone comfortable.  So if they can't pay their rent, we'll be responsible for it?  Yes, but, Xiomara, I know how press works.  Trust me, after the party, that couple  will be looking to expand,  they'll have so much business.  MAGDA: Let's talk business.  Did you cut the legs off this chair?  Few inches.  It's an old Czech intimidation technique.  So, I see  you've spent time in prison.  I like that.  Shows you can get scrappy.  Okay.  Great. So I'm hired?  Yes.  But not as general manager.  A bartender?  Apparently, the Prague pirate doesn't think  I have the experience to manage the hotel that I founded.  She's just doing this to humiliate me.  Yeah, and so what if she is?  Look, if you take the job,  you'll be able to keep an eye on the hotel,  you'll be close to the twins, you can help Petra  - when a crisis comes up - I can help Petra  by being the manager of the Marbella.  I am not some bartender.  What's the alternative?  You're gonna work the front desk at the Holiday Inn?  NARRATOR: Between you and me, he didn't get that job.  You got to get over yourself.  It's a job. You're broke.  Okay. You're right.  Huh! That was quick.  Oh, we're in a groove.  Oh, great!  Now, if you'll  excuse me, I have a date.  Are you stealing food from the kitchen?  Perks of management.  - MAN: Hold the elevator. - Oh.  (JANE CHUCKLES)  Hold the elevator!  Okay.  (BELL DINGS)    So, my publisher set up a mini book tour  - for me next week. - Wow. Fancy.  I might have oversold it.  Two stops, both in Florida. Ow.  Still pretty bad-ass.  Agreed. (LAUGHS)  Anyway, um  I was wondering if you wanted to come.  W-We can make it into a little road trip.  Make a playlist, eat fast food.  Huh? Maybe go wild and get a speeding ticket.  - Really? - Okay, no speeding ticket.  You want me to come?  Yeah.  Because I love you.  NARRATOR: Again that didn't happen.  Here's what Jane really said.  Yeah, it'd be fun.  - Let me just look at my deadlines. - Of course.  JANE: I can't believe I almost said ""I love you"" again.  XIOMARA: You're obviously feeling it. Why not say it?  Because I don't know if I'm  really in love.  And I don't know if he loves me back.  ROGELIO: That's ludicrous.  Anyone with a pulse will love you back.  I-I got to go, Mom. I'll talk to you later.  It's impossible not to love you.  Everyone loves you, Jane.  Rudy! How much do you love Jane?  Uh, a lot?  - Exactly. - Okay!  So, um, my publishers  e-mailed me, and apparently, they reached out to Arianna  a few times, and she hasn't returned their calls.  - What? - I know. Weird, right?  Maybe you can ask her to call them back.  Arianna's not gonna call them back.  And she's definitely not gonna write a feature  - on your book party. - What? Why?  Because I told her I'd appreciate it if she didn't.  And why would she listen to you, peasant?!  Maybe because I'm making sweet love to her.  (TIRES SCREECH) Oh!  Oh! Look who else just got screwed!  How did you know about any of this?  Well, the walls between our dressing rooms are quite thin.  And since I was in People en EspaÃ±ol's  ""30 Under 30"" this year,  I happen to know Arianna quite well.  ""30 Under 30"" means nothing  compared to ""50 Most Beautiful People!""  I was in high school when you did that!  JANE: Stop! I can't believe this.  How come you just can't mind your own business?  Maybe you should have your father explain that  to his friend Judy?  Judy was a spur-of-the-moment impulse  that paid off mightily.  But you planned this. You found out I needed a favor  from this woman, so you seduced her,  and got inside of her head.  - You're good. - JANE: You're disgusting.  So I assume you'll get Arianna back on the story  if I get you your pretentious ghost monologue?  Bingo.  Fine. I'll get the writers on it.  NARRATOR: What would a ghost even say?  FABIAN: Not good enough.  I want you to write it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, boo.  Why do you have to write it?  Fabian says it's because I wrote the monologue  that got Dad a Paloma nomination,  but I think it's just to torture us both.  Ugh! If your father hadn't co-signed the lease  on the bookstore, you wouldn't be in this position.  It's fine. I'm almost done.  And it's actually pretty good, you know, for a ghost soliloquy.  I mean, I avoided all the obvious clichÃ©s.  Still, it's just so outrageous.  Are you okay, Ma?  Because Dad does this kind of stuff all the time.  You know the guy likes to go big. You know that.  It's just  What?  My dance studio hasn't been doing so great.  Oh, no.  And I wanted to talk to your father  about putting some money there.  How bad is it?  I just need a little cash infusion,  but it's not like banks are lining up to lend money  to struggling local dance studios.  And our monthly budget is stretched  as it is because of the rent on our giant house.  Ma, don't stress.  Dad won't have to use this money.  I'll get Fabian the monologue ASAP.  He'll love it. It's perfect for him.  Super dramatic, you know?  So he can do his over-the-top acting.  I just can't do it anymore, Krishna! I just feel too guilty.  NARRATOR: Speaking of over-the-top-acting  Anybody would. You've been lying for a long time.  Look, you don't have to remind me!  It's my mother's fault.  She said we should use Anezka as a pawn.  (GASPS)  It's not true.  I am so sorry. I was going to tell you.  I (STAMMERS)  I-I feel badly.  But I knew Luisa wouldn't trust me,  and Mother suggested using you.  No.  You're lying.  No, I'm not.  You know what? Let's go.  We'll confront her together.  That is not true, Anezka. She is lying.  Mother, stop. I told her already.  MAGDA: I am not working with Petra.  Don't be stupid.  She's not stupid! She just didn't think  her mother could be so cruel.  - Don't let her use you anymore. She's a liar. You know this.  This is the same woman who abandoned you  because she said you weren't the pretty one.  She's just trying to get into your head.  I'm not trying to get into anyone's head.  I just don't want to keep deceiving my sister.  And I know this was my idea, but  I realized something: you're the evil one, not her.  This is absurd.  She has no proof.  Oh, yeah? Then how would I know Carl is real?  I'm done, Mother.  RAFAEL: I can't believe this.  Queen Magda has me scheduled for a shift tonight  during your book party, and she won't  let me out of it.  It's okay. I understand.  That's the way it is when you have a regular job.  I bet I can duck out for, like, an hour.  Stop. It's so not a big deal.  I'll give you a play-by-play.  Okay, well,  have fun tonight.    She seemed cool.  Not bummed  like, at all.  XIOMARA: I just hope Jane's books sell,  or Rogelio will buy up every last copy,  and then order a thousand more online.  This about the lease?  NARRATOR: Well, look who's become one of the girls.  He goes so overboard,  especially when it comes to Jane.  Maybe it's a guy thing.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Or not.  I'm not saying that it's okay,  just that it's this  feeling.  You know, like you have to provide.  And it's so easy  to lose perspective and go overboard.  Look at everything I did to try to get the Marbella back.  And I'd still do anything for my family, even  wear a silk screen bow tie.  Okay, next time you see me, I might be quitting,  because this book party might just launch my career.  (LAUGHING)  This monologue is a stinky piece of garbage,  and I hardly understand it!  It's like I'm falling for you all over again.  You need to fix this right now!  They are filming my coverage tonight!  Sorry. Any rewrite's gonna have to wait.  My book party's in a few hours. (SQUEALS)  Well, if you don't do the rewrite right now,  you can kiss the People en EspaÃ±ol article bye-bye-bye.  What?  No, no, you can't do that to me.  (GROANS)  ANEZKA: I can't do this anymore!  I don't know who to believe.  You were the only one who really loved me.  I wish you were here to guide me.  I wish  I could be kissing your face  and your beard.  Both beard.  If you'd just send me a sign  Yes, you're right, I should have a drink.  Maybe little snack, too.  - Can we get more nuts here? - NARRATOR: I don't think so.  It's already pretty crazy.  Oh, actual nuts.  Meh. Meh?  What-what does ""meh"" mean?  It means ""ugh, bleh,"" or (BLOWS)  Charming.  It needs more pizzazz, more sparkle.  It needs to be more flowery.  Okay, flowery. Fine.  I can do flowery. Flowery is my specialty.  Now it has too many describey words.  Adjectives?  No, words that describe other words.  You said you wanted flowery.  Yes, but not so flowery.  If I hand you a bouquet of flowers, you will smile.  But if I hand you a thousand flowers, you will  suffocate to death under the weight of all those flowers.  I'll make it less flowery, but we have to move fast here.  I have to pick up my dress from the dry cleaner by 5:00.      - Well, now it's just boring. - Ugh! I-I don't get it.  I-I don't understand what you want.  Okay, if I hand you a hundred flowers  No, no. No more flower analogies.  Just tell me what you want.  I want it to be epic!  I want people to weep.  I want them to feel sorry for taking me for granted!  Because they won't realize  until I'm gone how much they really loved me.  JANE: Honestly, Fabian, I tried everything.  I just feel like we're going in circles here.  I-I don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.  (GASPS) Yes! That!  That's excellent writing!  - I want those words in my speech. - You want  ""The light at the end of the tunnel"" in your monologue?  Yes. It's such a nice image.  Clean, original, specific.  No adjectives.  Hmm. Okay.  Do you also like,  ""Until my death we were two peas in a pod""?  Yes! Peas in a pod!  Another great image. Now you're getting it!  NARRATOR: And in that moment, Jane realized  exactly the kind of speech Fabian wanted.  And friends, I don't think Jane would mind me saying  that what she wrote was as hackey a monologue  as the world has ever seen.  Riddled with every clichÃ© she could think of.        It's perfect.  Oh, thank God for small favors.  You are on fire!  It's exactly like God has done me a small favor.  I knew you were a great writer, but this this, I-I  - Takes the cake? - Yes! Exactly!  - NARRATOR: Enough with the clichÃ©s! - Great!  So you're gonna call Arianna, make sure she's at the party?  Yes! I'll call her right away.  Now go, or as you so beautifully put it, ""Haste makes waste!""  No. Ma, stop. I don't have time for smoky eyes.  - Where's the sitter? - Inhala, exhala, Jane.  (DOORBELL RINGS) That must be her.  - This is so pretty. Can I wear it? - Of course you can.  Bling! (RINGTONE PLAYS)  Oh. I'm running late  so I can't talk, but I will see you at the party in 20.  ADAM: Wait. Wait. Bad news.  I just got slammed with notes, and they pulled my deadline up.  What? ADAM: Yeah.  I have to turn in the panels tonight,  so I can't make it to your party.

It's yours.  I'm sorry, but it is  because of you that we are in this situation.  You're on the hook for the lease. Mom is gonna be furious.  And the bookstore is not gonna get the press that they need.  All because you wanted to swoop in  with your ridiculous scheme to be a hero, when I could've just  easily had the party at the publisher's office.  I just wanted you to have the book party of your dreams.  I know.  But why do you always have to go too far, Dad?  Huh?  I guess I overcompensate.  I mean, I-I wasn't around when you were a kid  Seriously, this can't be your excuse anymore. We're beyond it.  You didn't even know I'd been born!  How can you blame yourself for something  that you didn't even know happened?  Because maybe I did know.  What?  I mean, I didn't know.  But a part of me I don't know  Always suspected, maybe  I mean, I-I knew how religious Alba was.  And-and maybe I didn't ever call your mom  because I didn't want to know.  In case.  I-I had dreams,  ambitions.  Do you hate me?  You were 16.  I get it.  - Really? - I mean, I wish you'd called.  Because I would have found you sooner.  But everything happens  for a reason, right?  And I like where we're at now.  So let's just keep moving forward  and not keep coming back to this.  NARRATOR: And in that moment,  Rogelio let the ghost of his past go.  - Thank you, Jane. - Mm-hmm.  Now go take care of your adoring fans.  (EXHALES) And remember what I taught you about selfie angles.  Chin down, camera up.  (CHUCKLES) First, I have to break the news  to Alejandro and Enrique.  (SIGHS)  (GASPS)  Do I know you?  (WHISPERS): Oh, my God.  You're real.  (CHUCKLES)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on, Jane, use your words.  I'm sorry.  I'm overwhelmed because you're,  like, my favorite author of all time,  and you're actually standing here.

When was that?  Uh, four years ago.  Oh.  I'm sorry. It's-it's the combination  of feeling him everywhere tonight. And you actually  being here feels like well  like magical realism.  Well, writing helped me through my grief, too.  There's light at the end of the tunnel, I promise.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Man, when she says it,  it sounds brand-new.  Sometimes I just feel so guilty.  Telling your story doesn't betray the memory  It keeps the spirits alive.  About  living, I mean.  Being joyful,  when he's not here to share it with me.  How can I be happy or in love?  I write about strong women  with passionate hearts.  It's all about the heart.  It's what drives us and  Determines your fate.  I'm sorry, I've seen your TED Talk,  like, a million times.  NARRATOR: Back off, stalker.  Well, magical realism can work both ways.  You are mine.  You are the reader I always imagined.  Let yourself enjoy your success.  Just live passionately,  love passionately.  - NARRATOR: Which brings us here. - The whole thing was perfect.  I did a reading, I sold 67 books,  and Isabel Allende was there.  - Wow. - And she was everything  I imagined her to be.  And she made me realize that I have to tell you something.  And you might freak out, because you might not be ready  (STAMMERS)  but I have to live passionately  and so what  what is wrong? (CHUCKLES)  (SHUDDERING BREATH)  I'm moving to L.A.  What?  The VFX house that wanted to hire me a couple months ago,  they-they contacted me again.  I said no,  but they came back with an even bigger offer.  When?  Earlier today, before your party.  I'm sorry. I just have to take it.  You don't have to take it.  You want to.  Is that why you didn't come tonight?  I didn't want to be in all your pictures.  I'm so sorry.  It's just watching what you've been experiencing  the past few weeks, your dreams coming to life,  it it just, it made me want  to pursue my own dreams.  Good luck in L.A.  I just feel so stupid.  No, Jane.  I can't believe I almost told him I loved him.  I can't believe I did love him.  (SNIFFLES)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And just then, she had a thought  Â¿QuÃ©?  Nothing. I just  I just realized I didn't think, after Michael,  I could ever have my heart broken.  So there's that, at least.  (CRYING)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, a small light  at the end of the tunnel after all.  How's Jane?  She's actually doing okay.  Good.  I wanted to apologize.  I shouldn't have cosigned their lease.  It's fine.  I know you were  just trying to take care of your family.  I was. Luckily, Isabel Allende bought a first edition book,  which paid for almost all their rent.  Wow. That's lucky.  NARRATOR: Or magical.  But you just can't keep doing these giant things for Jane.  I know. And I had a breakthrough, actually.  I was talking to Jane, and it goes back to when  you were pregnant and a small part of me wondered if you'd  - kept the baby, and that's - What?!  A very small part.  I just meant  I couldn't rule it out.  Jane wasn't mad. She understood.  Jane hasn't been beating herself up for the last five years  since you showed up.  You made me feel so guilty!  NARRATOR: Yeah, not quite the reaction he was hoping for.  No, no, no, no. It-it wasn't like that.  - I don't want to hear it. - Xo, please  I need some space.  (KEYS JANGLE)  RAFAEL: You look like you could use a drink.  Thanks.  It's been a little rough around here.  But I think I've got my sister handled.  And let's just say I don't think  you're going to be a bartender forever.  I've been working on  I don't want to know the details.  But if anyone can do it,  you can.  (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)  Stay here.  DRAMATIC MUSIC   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Whoa.  She looks like she's seen a ghost.  - EMT: Back away! - EMT 2: Make room!  NARRATOR: I'll give you a little clue, friends.  She didn't kill herself."

I  I saw your body hanging.  Th-There were EMTs.  Not real EMTs. Actors.  Mother and I always be hiring actors  to play prank on people.  A good example is Carl.  He is part of Orlando-based acting troupe,  and he plays evil Disney villain  in big parade. He plays  Now I'm trying to remember  who he plays. Not Gaston.  Anezka! I don't care what villain he plays.  You faked your own death?  Yes, exactly.  Well, because I was being so confused  about whether I should trust you or Mother,  a-and I just not knowing how to decide.  And then it felt like fate.  I want my funeral to be epic.  I want people to weep.  I want them to feel sorry for taking me for granted  because they won't realize until I'm gone  how much they really love me.  ANEZKA: And then I realize  I need to see who really loved me.  And now I see it was beautiful sister.  Still beautiful  even when you is crying your eyes out over me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in that moment,  Petra realized what she had to do.  I just  can't believe you're here.  I was heartbroken.  Oh.  I'm just so happy. (CHUCKLES)  See, I told you you could trust me.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wow, she's good.  She should join Carl's Orlando-based acting troupe.  And I hate to tell you this. (SNIFFLES)  Mother wasn't sad at all.  But you were always hating Mother.  Maybe you are lying right now  to convince me not to trust her.  Really?  ANEZKA: Oh, yes, that's who Carl played.  Captain Hook.  Anezka, focus.  Look, she's yawning at your funeral.  Maybe she's just tired  from sleepless nights of grieving.  Well, she still thinks you're dead.  So I'll prove it.  Let me know if you want   LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ooh, looks like someone else  went incognito.  To a higher place   So it's good we didn't tell Jane.  Let me show you how to rock my way   A toast to  Oh, this beer is lukewarm.  Just like my review. (LAUGHS)  Honey, you have to stop thinking about it.  Focus on something else.  Adam?  Damn it.  (CRYING): Oh.  Remind me again why he's the worst.  Mmm.  Exactly. He sucks.  Men suck. They think they can just  spring things on you, and you're not supposed to react.  What are you talking about, Ma?  He did? When?  You just left?  H-He proposed to you.  (LAUGHING)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And now to a very different  mother-daughter relationship.  If you're not done packing in five minutes, I'm calling security.  I have one hand. It takes time.  I thought you might like this.  It was Anezka's.  Ugh. Why would I want that?  Because your dead daughter clung to it every night  while she slept at the orphanage.  Might be a nice memento.  You really have no feelings for her?  If Anezka was stupid enough to kill herself  when she finally had control of the hotel,  then she deserve to die.  ANEZKA: Well, now I am knowing  how you really feel, Mother.  (GASPS)  You're alive!  God has given me a miracle!  Save it, Mother. You would never make it in Carl's troupe.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And speaking of wonderful actors  RAFAEL: Mateo's asleep.  His fever broke at the doctor's.  Just a virus, and he'll be better in a few days.  And I'm sorry for yelling at you.  No, you were right. I should have respected you  as Matelio's father.  You don't look so good.  Is that necessary?  I apologized.  I mean you don't look well.  Oh. I'm fine.  Except for the fact that it's 30 degrees in here.  Um  You must have thought about marrying Jorge, though.  - Aw. - But you don't have  to feel the same thing, right?  I mean, things with Jorge are pretty nice. You guys  get along so well. At this point  in your life, that's pretty good, right?  Yeah.  Meaning that  Oh, come on, Abuela,  - you know she didn't mean that. - That's not what I meant.  (SCOFFS)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And  that's why I don't drink tequila.  Abuela, stop.  That is not what Mom meant.  She just meant that,  at different stages, you need and want different things.  Ah.  Abuela, stop. You're being drunk and dramatic.  You are! Mom is not trying to put you in a diaper.  Anyone can see that you're still young!  Oh! And you know what young people do?  Mm. They dance. So come on.  There is a floor and we're about to dance on it,  so it's about to be a dance floor!  - No. No, no, no, no, no. I am going -  to be drunk and dramatic, too.  And you said this trip was about me, and I want to dance.  Come on!    What is that? You can do better!  Ay!  (WHOOPS)  Break it down!

Come on.  What are you guys doing?  So you're not mad anymore?  - I'm sorry! I - Okay!  You're bringing down the vibe!  Why don't you dance your apology?  What?  (WHOOPS) Yeah!  Come on! Yeah!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Dang, Alba,  those hips don't lie!  Yeah!  What the hell is this doing here?  The delivery company can't pick it up until tomorrow.  I was trying to keep it out of sight.  And you thought smack-dab in front of my office  was the ideal spot.  - Yes? - Put it outside the hotel  where the guests don't see it and I won't see it.  Understand?  (SIGHS)  (SCREAMS)  (SCREAMS, TRILLS)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Huh.  Kind of confusing when they're both dressed as Petra.  I'll give them name tags.  So, how did it go?  Beautiful sister was right about Mother.  She didn't really love me.  So I tell her to leave.  Mother is banished from hotel forever!  (SIGHS)  Well  that's exactly what she deserves after what she did to you.  Yes. So now I will be wanting to learn from you.  - Huh? - I know nothing  about ruling a hotel.  - âRunning,â not âruling.â - Yes.  I-I found this little show on the Internet.  All about rulers. And they all be wanting to sit  on this funny-looking iron throne  You mentioned wanting to learn from me?  Yes.  Will you teach me?  So I can use my shares wisely.  Let's do it!  ROGELIO: Don't touch me.  You don't want to catch this sickness, trust me.  I don't know how Matelio survived it.  (ALARM RINGS) Oh.  It's my reminder to apologize to Xo.  I've been texting her an apology every hour, on the hour.  Can you hand me my phone?  Actually, I think I'm too weak to type.  Can you do it for me?  I think you can skip an hour, Rogelio.  And for what it's worth,  I think Xo should be the one apologizing to you.  Come again?  When things got tough, she ran away,  and that's not okay.  You guys are husband and wife.  You got to stick it out and work together.  That's actually smart.  I-I'm feverish.  I didn't mean it that way.  Can you tuck me in a little tighter?  I've been thinking a lot about why  we aren't as close as we could be.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: They look pretty close to me.  You were a ladies' man when we met.  And you broke my daughter's heart.  That was a long time ago.  And Jane and I are not together.  I know.  But seeing how close you are  You are going on a book tour.  This is huge.  (HORN HONKS)  ROGELIO: Sometimes,  it just seems like a matter of time.  Which is silly, I know.  Hi.  I-I wasn't expecting you.  I know. Uh  But I read this.  My book?  How did you  I understand why you are writing it.  It's your way of grieving Michael and honoring his memory.  So  you have my blessing to continue.  Really?  I think you're gonna make Michael very proud.  But you and I need space from each other.  So I do not need to hear from you  or hear about the book.  You stole my pages out of the trash  and showed them to Patricia?  Thank you.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes, friends, this was  the second time Jane needed a push.  I want you to finish the book, okay?  Because I really like that Rake character,  and I want to find out what happens to him.  How did I get so lucky  to have you as my accidental artificial inseminator?  No, I'm the lucky one.  (SNIFFLING)  Looks like someone has Jane on the brain.  (WHOOPS) Yeah!  (CACKLING) (WHOOPING)  Wait, wait, let me have your phone.  I want to take a picture. We have to document this,  because, clearly, we are so drunk,  we're not gonna remember this in the morning.  All right! Come on! Let me see what you real  (CHUCKLES)  Bright light fever.   Mateo was sick and you guys hid it from me?  He was okay, and it was your book tour.  Mateo is much more important, Ma.  Of course he is, and Rafael was taking him to the doctor.  Which I need to know, because I am his mother.  I don't understand why you would ever hide that from me.  What's going on?  And, of course, we understand why,  given what happened with Michael.  That's absurd.  I don't overreact.  I react the way any mother would if her child is sick.  Does Rafael feel the same way, too?  You should talk to Rafael about all of this.  Oh, believe me, I will talk to him.  - Slow down, Jane. - No, I will not slow down.  Mateo's my child. I need to know what's going on with him,  especially in regards to health.  And, yes, I may be overly sensitive  to illness because of Michael,  but you do not need to protect me.  I wasn't protecting you.  I was protecting Mateo.  What?  (SIGHS)  Do you remember the first time you went away?  And Mateo got sick and then we drove to see you.  (WATER RUNNING)  Whoa, come here. (CHUCKLES): Whoa.  - Hey! - Come here.  Okay.  Well, it looks like you're feeling better.  Can we ask Mom to be sure?  Well, Mommy's in the shower.  How do you feel?  I think okay. We should ask Mommy.  Wh-Why do you want to ask Mommy?  Because I could catch a germ and die like Michael.  Does that scare you?  Okay. Look at me, all right?  You're not gonna die.  Okay? And you know something else?  You're strong,  like a lion.  I just didn't want him to be afraid every time he got sick.  I can't believe I did that to him.  I'm sorry.  No, stop.  It's not your fault you're scared.  And it's not your fault  that Michael didn't go to the doctor.  Thank you for saying that.  You okay?  Yeah.  I'll talk to you later.  (SHUDDERING BREATHS)  (PHONE CHIMES)  (SNIFFLES)  (SNIFFLES)  - What's this? - BELLBOY: Special delivery.  Do you want me to make up the swans?  ALL THREE: No!  He's got to stop already.  I'm texting him.  He says they're not from him.  (LAUGHING): He's mad at me for running away.  All these years, he  (SCOFFS) You should talk.  You ran away from Jorge.  JANE: Oh XO: Hmm?  Abuela.  Â¿QuÃ©?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, love.  - Don't you cry. - I'm not.  - I'm not gonna cry. - Because we're 30 minutes  from the Romance Writers Convention,  which is going to be live-streamed  - to hundreds of fans. - I know.  Abuela, remind me again, why Adam was so terrible for me.  - What? - Ma!  JANE: And so,  yeah, with all the lusty faces I make while I'm writing,  I can't, uh, write in a coffee shop anymore.  (LAUGHTER)  Yeah.  I saw your meltdown on stage with lyanla.  It was trending on Twitter for a few minutes.  Oh, good. (CHUCKLES)  Can you talk more about that?  - Hmm? - Like,  wh-what's it like to write romance through heartbreak?  Are you gonna write about the cover artist  in your next book?  Well, that is a two-part question.  First, romance through heartbreak.  I mean, heartbreak is a great place to start  for a character, right? Uh  not looking for love, suddenly it happens.  Suddenly feelings you thought were gone  are now awakened.  As for whether he'll be in the next book, specifically?  Every story needs a villain, right?  - Go, Mommy! - Oh, she's nailing it.  That's my girl. Now bring it home, Jane.  WOMAN: So, what now?  Are you opening the door to love again?  JANE: Personally?  I wouldn't go that far.  But  maybe a window.  (JANE CHUCKLES) (APPLAUSE)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: True, there were only eight people  in the audience,  but damned if she didn't charm  the entire octet.  (APPLAUSE)  Thank you so much for coming.  (CHUCKLES)  (INHALES)  Ooh. Who should I make this out to?  Patricia.  Sorry. Hi, I, uh  I didn't know that you were coming.  Well, um, I kept track of you.  A little.  And when  the book came out, I-I got it,  and and I read it.  And I felt Michael again.  And I didn't think  I would ever feel him again.  He would have loved this.  I love it.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends,  this was the only review that really mattered.  Thank you so much.  That means  everything.  I'm sorry that I said those things to you.  What happened, I know, was not your fault.  He was a grown man.  He should have gone to the doctor.  It's just  You can't get mad at the person who died, you know?  Yeah, I know.  (EXHALES)  (QUIETLY): Will you sign my book?  Oh Yeah! (BOTH LAUGH)  (XIOMARA SIGHING)  What?  - You you what?! - What? Mom!  (SHOUTS)  (LAUGHING): Yeah!  Can we finally take this top down and celebrate?    (LAUGHING, WHOOPING)  Yes!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yup. Back to real life.  I'm sorry.  You were right.  I-I shouldn't have run away.  I obviously have a lot of work to do  on being a married woman.  I'm still figuring it out.  And I'm sorry for who I was.  For my failings.  But I've changed.  Yeah. I know.  But there's still a lot to talk about, you know.  So I've been thinking,  I want to go to counseling.  That's a great idea.  You should go.  Not me, us.  We should go to couples therapy together.  (LAUGHS)  No way. I don't believe in that garbage.  But if you need me to go with you,  while they figure out  your issues,  I'm happy to do that.  (EXHALES)  Fine.  Let's do that, then.  Thank you.  (EXHALES)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And in that moment,  Alba knew the only answer she could give was  No.  JORGE: What? NARRATOR: What?  Well, I guess that window is officially closed.  Hello, beautiful sister.  Okay, first lesson.  Future lessons will take place in my office from now on.  No. They won't.  What's going on?  Well, for one,  I finally finished watching Game of Thrones,  and spoiler alert,  turns out Sansa becomes very powerful.  What are you talking about?  Beautiful sister thinks I am stupid donkey.  But I figure out truth.  You have been whispering lies to me  this whole time.  You don't care about me.  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, girls. (GASPS)  Do you miss your Auntie Anezka?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To clarify  Not really. We hate her, right?  But Mommy was crying at her funeral.  After we sprayed perfume in your eyes?  You know what I learn from my own funeral?  That I am all alone in this world.  And now that I know,  I will rule things my way.  Look, Anezka.  You're right.  I don't trust you.  But guess what.  It doesn't matter.  Because once I tell Luisa that you and Mother gaslit her,  she's going to get out and sign all her shares over to Rafael.  - I told her. - What?  I told her. Only, not that version.  The version I tell her  is that you and Rafael were the ones who had been sending Carl  and lighting her gas.  That's a lie.  (LAUGHS) Yes.  Well, Luisa be not knowing that.  And she seemed very,  very angry with her brother.  - What the hell, man? - Apparently,  she really didn't order the casket.  Oh!  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And I promise you, friends,  this time she really is dead.  Ned Stark dead.  JANE: To be continued.  Please, just read for five more minutes.  Mm, nope.  It's time for bed.  (KISSING)  Good night, Mr. Sweetface.  I'm a lion.  Right, Daddy?  Yes, but that's our secret, remember?  What was all that lion stuff about?  Eh, it was a father-son thing.  See? I knew you'd get there.  We make a really good team.  It's getting late.  (LAUGHS SOFTLY)  (WATER RUNNING)  (WATER STOPS)  Mateo seems fine.  Thank you, a-again, for not calling me.  - What's wrong? - The review.  Maybe I'm not cut out to be a writer.  That is just your doubts and your fears talking.  You have to keep writing.  You are a writer.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yes, friends.  This was the third time.  You need me to say it?  Be brave.  Be brave.  Be brave.  BOMBASTIC MUSIC   And, friends, he knew then and there,  that he had to be brave, too."
"1 LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, friends.  The times, they are a-changing. First, our Jane.  She was recently dumped.  Plus her book got mediocre reviews.  And then this happened.  I know! OMG, right?  Another OMG?  Alba said no to Jorge's proposal.  Oh, and did I mention  Rafael was living with the Villanuevas now?  See, his sister Luisa took all his money,  which meant Mateo had to say good-bye to private school.  Unfortunately, Jane's local school district  wasn't so great.  But  Did you know  that your parents live in the Elbamare School District?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: So, yeah, they decided to send him there.  On the down low.  Also facing child care challenges,  Jane's father Rogelio.  See, he was married to Xo,  but had a baby with Darci.  Oh, and did I mention,  Darci was dating his archrival and co-star Esteban?  I know! Straight out of a telenovela, right?  But imagine this.  Petra's twin sister Anezka  convinced Rafael's sister Luisa  that she was hallucinating some guy named Carl.  So, Luisa checked herself into a mental institution.  But here's the thing, friends,  Carl was real.  And to add to the crazy, Anezka started spiraling.  So she faked her own death to see who really loved her.  And she briefly thought she could trust Petra.  Until she realized she couldn't.  And then this happened.  Which, my friends, is where we left off.  When Jane Gloriana Villanueva was ten years old,  the day she had dreamed about  finally came.  The very first kiss  between Teresa and Ramiro  on Las Rutas de PasiÃ³n.  JANE: How do they know which way to move their heads?  Uh, well, they probably just rehearsed.  No, I mean in real life.  How am I gonna know what to do?  Okay, here's the real deal.  It won't be anything like Las Rutas de PasiÃ³n,  so set your expectations low.  The clouds aren't gonna part,  angels won't sing,  it'll probably be a little awkward.  So, what happens? What do you do?  Well, you just open your mouth a little,  and your tongue will touch his  Or hers, either way.  My tongue?  Yup.  - Do I just leave it there? - You move it,  b-but not too much.  How will I know if I'm doing a good job?  Trust me, you'll know.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Which brings us here. Now.  What was  I wasn't planning it, I-I-I just  MATEO: Mommy?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Oh, no, did he see?  I'm scared to go to kindergarten.  (BOTH SIGH)  Oh, sweetheart.  Oh, my Ah.  It's gonna be so much fun.  But I don't have any friends.  You'll meet some kids when we go to registration tomorrow.  Now, come on. You need some sleep.  Mommy will lie with you. Hmm?  (JANE CHUCKLES)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR (CHUCKLES): Well, he sure looks happy.  And she looks  She looks  I'm sorry, friends,  but I actually don't know what the hell she's thinking.  (SIGHS)  SOFT GUITAR PLAYING   (PHONE RINGING)  Back to reality.  Hi, Petra.  Hey, wait, wait, wait. Slow down.  I know your sister's dead.  No, she wasn't really dead before.  That she faked her death  because she was trying to figure out who loved her.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Reality, of course, being relative.  So she's alive?  No.  I found out, she attacked me, so I defended myself,  and she fell off the balcony.  So now she's actually dead.  Oh, my God. That's  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Straight out of a telenovela!  Self-defense.  So, listen, I need you to watch the girls.  The nanny can't stay overnight,  I'm stuck at the police station.  I'm going now.  Are you okay?  Do you have a lawyer?  No, I don't need one.  Like I said, it was self-defense.  Yeah, I knew a lot of guys in prison who said that, too.  Just get a lawyer, a good one.  I have to go. That's my other line. We'll talk later.  What the hell took so long, Krishna?  Well, it's a long drive, and I had to stop for gas,  - and then my debit card wasn't - Stop.  I don't actually care.  Are you at the mental hospital?  They prefer you call it a âwellness center.â  Krishna!  Sorry. Yes. I'm here,  - but Luisa's gone. - What?  She checked herself out, and she didn't leave any contact info.  - (IN A WHISPER) Oh, no. - LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Uh-oh.  Once I tell Luisa that you and mother gaslit her,  she's going to get out and sign all her shares over to Rafael.  I told her you and Rafael  were the ones who had been sending Carl  and lighting her gas.  And she seemed very,  very angry with her brother.  Listen to me, get a P.I., okay?  We need to find Luisa.  Oh, and-and, oh, get me a lawyer,  a good one.  DARCI: What's wrong?  What's wrong is that this is my time with Baby,  and you're sitting here milking.  Pumping.  And unfortunately, you fed her early  and got her off her schedule.  So if I don't pump, these babies will blow.  ESTEBAN: Darci produces so much milk.  She's overflowing.  Like a goddess of  milk.  DARCI: Well, this goddess  doesn't need another clogged duct.  Okay, get this in the fridge,  it's liquid gold.  Come on, Moosh, let's go.  (WHISPERING) Ask her.  ROGELIO: Darci.  I was thinking,  maybe Baby could stay overnight this weekend?  Overnight? No way.  Overnights don't happen until she's a year old,  per our contract.  Now, give Baby to Esteban.  (BABY FUSSING)  See you on set, Rogelio.  Bright side? Our really difficult  new family dynamic is something we can talk about in therapy.  I don't need to talk about that with a therapist.  I just need Esteban  to get a D-list, straight-to-Crackle film  that shoots in Guadalajara.  But like I said,  I'll be happy to accompany you to therapy  to help you learn about yourself.  Okay, terrific.  Are you sure? Because the last time I talked to you,  you wanted to marry Jorge.  (WIND BLOWING)  Yeah, it's a great feeling.  I didn't hear you come in.  So how's Mateo?  Really nervous.  How are you?  (WHISPERING) Maybe we should talk about us later.  I meant about Mateo.  And that lying about the address thing.  Oh. (CHUCKLES) Sorry.  NARRATOR: To remind you,  they'd enrolled in a great public kindergarten  using Ro and Xo's address.  I'm prepared, obviously.  This is the place where we'd get coffee every morning  if we did, in fact, live in the area.  And I'm going to run to my mom's  and drop off toys in case school officials ever come by.  You dropped off toys last week  when you set up a room for Mateo upstairs.  I know, pay attention, that's just what I told Rafael.  Why?  Because  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Come on, say it already!  Last night  he kissed me.  What?  NARRATOR: I know!  Completely out of the blue.  Well, not completely.  Couple months ago, you tried to get  - in the shower with him. - Exactly.  Months ago.  I mean, we're in a different place now.  Come on. How was the kiss?  I kissed Jane last night.  (GASPS)  And, Alba, it was  - Not good. - What?  I don't understand.  You've had great kisses before with him.  I know. Next level.  And I tried, honestly, I gave it my all.  I don't know,  it-it just felt  Exactly the same.  Completely different. And the timing?  I just had my heart broken. What was he even thinking?  And all I could think was, âFinally. Finally.â  It felt like  coming home.  I don't even want to go home.  You have to.  I know, I know.  I'll just  nip this whole thing in the bud.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Hey, that actually works.   NARRATOR: Ah, yes. Where were we?  You look like you need a big kiss.  Ah mwah.  You're gonna love kindergarten.  - NARRATOR: Debatable. - Now.  One last time, what is your name?  Mateo Gloriano Rogelio Solano Villanueva.  Good.  And what's your address?  1312 Mockingbird Terrace.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: To be clear,  - that was Xo and Ro's address. - Perfect.  And we need that last piece of mail.  Here it is. Thank you so much.  So many people try to get into this district,  we need to be really careful.  Only our taxpayers.  RAFAEL: Jane.  JANE (SIGHS): I can't believe  he's starting kindergarten.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: I know.  I remember when he was just a syringe on a tray,  waiting to be inserted into the wrong woman.  I know.  - Oh, you okay? - No. (CHUCKLES)  But I told myself  I can't get emotional until tomorrow.  It's just registration.  Kindergarten is a big deal.  Come on.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Wait. Is this a normal hug?  Or is it weird because of the kiss?  (CHUCKLES)  - Okay, I got to go pick up the twins. - Mm-hmm.  Uh, I will see you at home, and we'll talk  about last night?  Yes, good.  Actually, maybe kiss first and then talk.  I'm sorry, I know we have a lot to discuss,  but, uh (SIGHS)  that was some kiss, huh?  Yes, it-it was.  XIOMARA: I was shocked  that any part of Rogelio, no matter how small,  suspected I was pregnant  all those years ago.  And I want to be able to let go of it.  Rogelio, how do you feel about what Xiomara said?  Hmm?  Oh, well, um,  I agree on-on some level.  (HIGH PITCHED VOICE) But on another level,  I don't.  You weren't even listening.  Of course I was.  (GASPS) You've been tweeting?  No!  Just one little tweet.  (SCOFFS) I don't believe this.  I am expected to constantly tweet.  I'm a tastemaker, a 280 ambassador.  - But you know how important this is to me. - You have no idea  - And I don't need to hear - what an honor it was  - any more about how you got 280 early. - to get 280 early.  It's important to me!  - Okay, okay. - XIOMARA: Oh, my God.  I'm gonna break that phone.  I would like to see you try. (LAUGHS)  Rogelio.  Why are you reluctant to discuss the past?  Because he used to be a Scientologist,  so he doesn't believe in therapy.  That is not true. Leah Remini and I  totally changed our minds about that.  It's because we already talked about what happened.  THERAPIST: So, l-let's not talk  about your past with Xiomara.  Let's talk about your deeper past.  Oftentimes, by understanding the relationship  with the formative female in your life, your mother,  it can help you understand your relationship  with the women in your life now.  My mother is an incredible woman; she's perfect.  She's strong, caring,  kind, an amazing momager.  Wait, what's a momager?  My mother was my manager as a child.  So, when you say your line,  show them your beautiful soul  and your beautiful teeth.  THERAPIST: Having a business relationship with the woman  who's supposed to be loving you unconditionally.  All that pressure and responsibility  on such a little boy's shoulders.  How did that make you feel?  Well  yeah, it could sometimes be hard.  I mean, I had to support my whole family.  If I failed,  my whole family would suffer,  which is just a lot  f-for a little kid to handle.  PETRA: Oh, please, spare me.  You did this to get under my skin.  I didn't.  She came highly recommended.  Her name just happened to be  Jane.  - And you are Petra? - Yes.  And I really don't need a lawyer.  Then why am I here?  My children's father felt I should hire someone.  Because you were the only person at the scene of the murder?  There was no murder. It was self-defense.  Not sure the D.A. would agree with you on that.  I made some calls to see if there were any charges pending.  What are there?  No.  Not yet.  But 50-50 we're going to get there.  And unfortunately you're not the most sympathetic defendant.  And this isn't your first time being a person of interest  in a murder investigation.  Oh.  Got it.  And just to be clear,  I know what this is about.  Well, you see my expensive shoes,  you know my hotel is worth millions,  so you're trying to make it seem like this  is some complicated case that's going to require  hundreds of billable hours.  But let me be clear:  this is not complicated.  My sister attacked me.  We struggled, she fell.  Now let me be clear.  Here's what's going to happen.  First, the police are going to get a subpoena  for your e-mails and phone records.  Then they'll go after the hotel security footage.  After that, they'll ask for the reservation records,  so they can interrogate all the guests  and all of your hotel employees,  so you may want to put your shoe shopping on hold  because it is  going to cost you a lot of money to get out of this.  And you'll pay it to someone else  because I'm not interested.  Krishna!  Find me another lawyer not named  RAFAEL: Jane.  Is Mateo asleep?  Finally.  So, should we talk?  Uh, yeah. Great.  But first let me  just make my pitch.  And before you say no,  here's a list  of all the reasons it won't work out,  practically, with my counterarguments.  Come on, you like lists.  Number one.  We just got back to being friends.  And under that is my counterargument,  which is really just  me apologizing for being a jerk.  And-and talking  about how much your friendship means.  And how much I missed you.  And how co-parenting has to be our top priority.  That's the thing, Mateo  Yeah, that's in section two.  A list about how it would ultimately benefit him  if we worked out.  - âIfâ? - Just continue reading.  We take it slow.  Not much would change and we're already living together.  So we just treat it like any other new relationship  and-and we don't tell him for a while.  Why not try?  I just had my heart broken.  I know.  And there's a section about timing.  And how I know it's not perfect.  Come on, you don't have an incredible kiss like that  if there's not something there.  (SIGHS)  Honestly  it wasn't incredible for me.  - What? - The kiss.  It was kind of like  I don't know, not great.  Yeah, I-I don't understand.  What don't you understand?  It was a great kiss. I mean, I'm a good kisser.  This isn't an indictment of your kissing.  I'm just saying that I wasn't feeling it.  You know? Maybe things changed.  Or maybe your head wasn't in the game.  What?  Well, you were just caught off guard.  And all you could think about was all that other stuff.  You can't understand that somebody didn't  like your âmagical kissâ?  Look, I told your grandmother it was the greatest kiss of my life.  You spoke to my abuela about this?  She's my friend. I like her.  Well, then maybe you should kiss her.  Five more minutes, Mr. Sweetface.  Hey, hi.  You okay?  Are you super sad about Jorge or anything?  Okay, because I'm angry with you.  But I don't want to get into a fight if you're super sad.  Stop talking to Rafael about me.  You're supposed to be on my team.  There is no Team Jafael.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Yikes, sorry.  Where is this coming from?  An accident which we made the absolute best of.  Hmm?  Huh?  Therapy.  My grandson is starting kindergarten.  I'm hiding from your father.  All he wants to do  is talk about his childhood  and his feelings and his realizations  and his realizations about his childhood feelings  and his feelings about his childhood realizations.  Now we can't get through a five-minute conversation  without him crying about his mother.  (LAUGHS)  Hey!  All right, who's ready for the first day  of kindergarten, huh?  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, memories.  No! (SCREAMING)  - Go. You got to let Mommy go. - Oh, geez. I can't watch this.  (SHUDDERS)  Please, no more crying.  Honestly, I thought this would be good news.  It is. I'm weeping with happiness.  Thank you so much.  A telenovela sequel, it's beautiful.  Tell me a little bit about the idea.  You'll drink a lady scientist's potion  and kiss her as planned,  then, bam!  You start to grow big because you drank too much.  Brilliant, sexy, I love it.  Does Esteban know I'm getting a sequel?  Yes, he was told this morning.  Beautiful, perfect.  Is he devastated?  Can I squash him like a bug at the end?  Rogelio.  Yes. You are right.  Why can't I just accept my own happiness?  It must have to do with my mother,  who  Well, never mind.  I'll talk about her in therapy.  But thank you, thank you so much.  NARRATOR: Speaking of two people who could use some therapy  (SIGHS)  - Hope he made friends. - Yeah, me, too.  Hey, I'm sorry about last night.  No, I'm sorry. I feel so bad.  - Me, too, me, too. - I can't stop thinking about it.  I'm so sorry I caught you off guard like that.  You still think that's the reason?  - Hey, let's just leave it. - Do you?  Okay, you are a planner.  At least admit it's a possibility.  Admit it's a possibility that you aren't quite the kisser you think you are.  I was put at a kissing booth in college, all right?  People paid to kiss me.  Well, I wouldn't have paid.  Are you sure you're gonna be able to let this go?  Done. I've let go.  MATEO: Mommy, Daddy!  (EXCITED SCREAM)  How was school?  School was fun, I made friends.  Can I have a playdate?  Of course you can. Well  Yay, yay, yay!  Elijah! My dad says  you can come to our house right now.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Their house?  You mean Xo and Ro's house.  I, uh, I wasn't  - I didn't think - Exactly.  I'll handle this.  JANE: A playdate sounds fun.  At your place?  Ooh, actually, we were hoping yours.  We're undergoing renovations,  and the house is really a mess.  Or what about, um, Grafton Park?  'Cause it's so nice to get the kids outside, playing  Oh, I wish. Elijah has allergies.  (SNEEZES)  Could we come to your place?  - (SCOFFS) Why not? - (TENSE LAUGHTER)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Because you don't live there.  Uh, they will follow me home,  and we'll meet you there.  Okay, great.  Now, Mateo, where did you put that thermos?  XIOMARA: I'm hurrying.  - Where are you? - RAFAEL: I'm here.  What do you want me to do with this picture.  Just put it in your car.  How long do we have? Wh-Where's Jane?  (SIGHS)  I'm so sorry, my tank is below empty. Just give me one minute.  (PHONE CHIMES)  (SIGHS)  Okay, so, Mateo.  We are gonna play a really fun game this afternoon.  It's called:  Pretend That We Live at Papa and Abuela's House.  Why are we playing it?  It's a long story.  And did I mention that  there's a great prize if you win?  What do I get?  NARRATOR: A great public education.  Ice cream sundae.  Chocolate syrup?  (CHUCKLING): And rainbow sprinkles.  MATEO: Deal.  - Which brings us here. - Hey.  Welcome. Come in.  MATEO: I live here.  Mateo is so excited to have Elijah over.  Because I live here.  Uh, that's right, you do, Mateo.  Please come in.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah, yes, the playdate.  Be careful or the whole thing will come crashing down.  Thanks for the reminder, Mateo.  You sure do have a lot of breastmilk in your fridge.  Ah, yes, that would be Darci's liquid gold.  Sorry. I know lots of moms breastfeed  for an extended time nowadays.  I-I hope that didn't sound judgmental.  No problem, bud. (CHUCKLES)  I am one of those moms.  You know, what can I say?  Mateo's healthy as a horse.  - Can I see your room? - Uh Of-of course.  Mateo, why don't we, uh, take your friend upstairs?  Can I have a drink first, Mommy?  Oh, I'm just gonna go with water this time.  (CHUCKLES)  Interesting photos you've got in the restroom.  Oops, let me show you what she's referring to.  Actually, it's a triptych.  Who are those people?  Yeah, actually, those are my parents.  You have naked photos of your parents?  That's right.  We are a body-positive,  extended breastfeeding  hippy-dippy household up in here.  (ALL CHUCKLE) I can't take it. I feel like  they are going to be busted any minute. Which reminds me.  LAWYER: Of course there won't be a murder charge.  This whole thing will blow over.  Clearly, that other lawyer was just trying to scare you.  Thank you. That's what I  MAN: Petra Solano?  Yes, that's me.  This is a subpoena for your e-mails and phone records.  We also need to review  all security footage and get a complete list  of guests who were staying at the hotel the night your sister died.  Of course.  I have nothing to hide.  (CHUCKLES)  Call Jane Ramos.  Now. Tell her I don't care what it costs.  I'm just realizing the cost now.  How she had me sing and dance for the entire waitstaff  because one of the busboys recognized me  from a cereal commercial.  It was my birthday, they should have been singing  - to me. - You know what?  I-I was hoping  that we could enjoy a nice afternoon together  and maybe not talk about your childhood for a few hours?  It's been kind of nonstop.  Oh, well, excuse me  for having feelings and being in touch with my emotions.  Maybe the problem is that I'm touching a nerve here.  I've talked all about my past, and you haven't shared a thing.  Well, I haven't shared anything  because you haven't let me get a word in.  Okay. Get a word in.  Talk about your parents.  Well  there really isn't much to tell.  You know everything.  My relationship with my mom was complicated,  and my relationship with my dad was perfect.  Nobody's perfect.  Okay, well, yes, of course,  he wasn't perfect, but  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)  he was a wonderful dad.  I don't know if I ever told you this, but  one Christmas  he worked six extra shifts  just to get me a Madame Alexander doll.  (SIGHS)  A-And how did that make you feel?  Special.  I mean, I was so touched that he would do that for me.  I loved that doll.  Although, I-I guess, when I really think about it,  I would have traded that doll in a second  for more time with him.  (CRYING) This is so stupid.  I don't know why I'm crying about this.  It's called  a breakthrough.  CELESTE: Elijah, don't break that.  DANA: Sorry, he's not used  to such nice tableware.  (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)  Part of our parenting philosophy.  Uh, treat kids like little grownups,  and they'll act accordingly.  Elijah, look, I have a booger.  - Oh. - Oh.  (BOTH GIGGLE) Well, this has been fun,  but we should really get going. Go put on your shoes, Elijah.  (CHILDREN LAUGHING)  So, you guys obviously don't live here.  DANA: It's okay.  We get it.  We just want Mateo to go  to the best school.  Of course. We won't tell anyone,  but you should be careful.  Some parents are narcs.  RAFAEL: Thank you  for understanding.  And we are so sorry for lying.  We understand.  Really, and  the boys are buddies now, so maybe  we can go to your real house next time?  That would be great.  And whoever the porn stars are that live here,  they can have their place back.  (LAUGHS)  - Totally. - For sure.  (BOTH SIGH, LAUGH)  Can I have my sundae now since I lied so good?  Mateo, you weren't lying, we were playing a game, remember?  A lying game.  Next time Elijah comes over, do we lie again?  JANE: So, Mateo, you were right.  We did ask you to lie.  How come? I thought lying was wrong.  It is.  Most of the time.  But other times,  we make a choice,  and we weigh the cost of the lie with the benefit of the lie.  I don't understand.  We're pretending to live at Papa and Abuela's house  so you're allowed to go to your new school.  RAFAEL: You see, the school in our neighborhood  isn't very good.  Which isn't fair,  but it's also life.  So we're trying, in just this one case,  to make things a little more fair.  And in order to do that, we pretend to live here.  Well, what if I get mixed up?  Or I forget?  Hey.  Buddy, you can do this.  You're a big boy.  I'm scared.  They're probably not even gonna ask, Mr. Sweetface.  Oh, yeah.  And I actually had my own breakthrough.  Oh.  About Dad and the Madame Alexander doll he got me  and how much I missed him.  Yeah, but, I mean,  I missed him when he was alive.  H-He was gone so much.  I know, but  Wha?  Uh, but, Mom, of course I was so grateful to him.  But thinking back,  what I wanted more than the doll  was time with him.  It's not a criticism, I'm just  Oh, wha  (DOOR CLOSES)  XIOMARA: She was so pissed.  She just shut down.  Clearly, she has underlying issues  from her own dysfunctional relationship with her parents.  What were they like?  Well, they weren't exactly her favorite topic.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, that night,  our porn stars talked.  And I think I was scared of what my mother would say  if she knew about your pregnancy.  And that's another reason I didn't reach out to you.  And talked.  I think that's why my reaction was so big when you told me.  On some level, all these years  I've been projecting my anger  at my absentee dad on you.  And talked.  That's probably why I'm such a good actor.  And talked.  (GASPS) Ooh.  I'm a little tipsy.  Forget Drunk History  Stain all the carpets you want,  I love you so much, Xiomara.  I love you so much, too.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, that night  was the most romantic night of their lives.  They even made another triptych.  Not that one, obviously.  How's Mateo?  Um, he's asleep.  Good. How'd he seem?  Not as scared, but he definitely has more questions.  Oh, I forgot my  ROMANTIC GUITAR   brush.  (SIGHS)    I couldn't sleep.  Yeah, me either.  I don't think I realized what it would feel like.  Having to explain to a kid  all these different levels and layers to lying?  (CHUCKLES) Yeah.  It's hard.  And there's a lot at stake.  And we have to be on the same page  and focus on co-parenting.  I agree.  That's why I'm moving out.  I'm gonna move in with Petra.  Just until Luisa's better and we sort things out.  You don't have to move out.  I do.  Because if I'm being honest,  part of the reason I was staying was for you.  You asked me if I'll be able to let go,  and I said yes.  And I will,  but it's gonna be hard  because it means letting go of something pretty big  The possibility of us.  Which has been there for me in the back of my mind  for a long time.  And I just don't think I can let that go  living here with you.  Me, too, but  this is best.  It's just hard to  give up the idea that something perfect  might not have been perfect for everyone.  That was about you and Xo.  I heard you last night.  You had one experience, and she had another.  Which may or may not have been  similar to what happened with me and  (DEEP VOICE) she who will not be named.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  - Rafael Solano? - That's me.  Thanks.  It's from my sister.  This is my third message.  Please have Ms. Ramos call me back.  You scared me.  Let me know what you think.  Go ahead, read it.  âDear Rafael,  âIt's been a week. Finally I feel ready  to write to you and tell you what I think of what you did.â  Keep going.  âI know now that Carl was real.  âAnezka told me. She told me everything  How you set me up to get your inheritance backâ? What?  Stop lying.  I just went to the hospital, and guess what.  After Luisa checked herself out,  a woman named Krishna showed up asking all kinds of questions.  Even tried to bribe the staff  for information on Luisa's whereabouts.  Krishna? Well, she's fired, obviously.  Stop, just stop!  Tell me the truth.  My mother and sister set everyone up.  They hired Carl to make Luisa think she was crazy.  I sent Krishna to find Luisa  as soon as I knew Anezka said you did it.  How long did you know Carl was real?  I was going to tell you and Luisa  just as soon as I dealt with my mother and Anezka.  How long, Petra?  How long did you leave my sister in an institution  knowing she wasn't hallucinating?  A week.  (DOOR SHUTS)  I can't believe Petra didn't tell you.  I know.  And I need to be done with that.  With all the lying.  Which is why I don't want Mateo lying  about his school.  - What? No, that isn't fair. - Okay. Okay, hold on  Now, we made this decision, and I get that you're suddenly  So I found a studio apartment  in your parents' school district,  and I just signed the lease.  What?  I sold my car. Paid through the year.  Oh  I'll take the bus to work or  carpool with you?  You can totally carpool with me.  You got an apartment?  Don't get too excited, it's super small.  I didn't even know they made them that small.  It sounds  amazing.  NARRATOR: And speaking of amazing  And cut.  Moving on to the last setup.  Give me Baby.  I want time with her while they light.  (BABY COOS)  ALBA: Xiomara?  Hey, what are you doing here?  Ma, no.  I shouldn't have said that to you. I get it.  No, no, no.  EXECUTIVE: So, as we close out this journey,  I just want to thank you all for your devotion to Guillermo  - (IN THE DISTANCE) and for - I got the rewrite.  I saw you crush me like a bug once you grow big.  And we are officially announcing a sequel.  Rogelio, do you want to say a few words?  NARRATOR: And in that moment,  with Alba's words ringing in his ears,  Rogelio realized he had to be a bigger man.  But not a giant.  Drop everything. We need an emergency rewrite.  A baby needs her father,  which is why  I will take the next year off.  Esteban will be your lead.  (GASPS)  And I will be  your hero.  PETRA: Thank you.  For coming back.  L-Look, you were right about everything.  The police came for my e-mails,  my phone records, my time cards.  And I don't need someone who's gonna blow smoke up my ass.  I need someone to make sure  I don't go to jail for protecting myself.  You accused me of being a crook.  And I am so sorry.  Look,  I know this is not an excuse, but  this is obviously a very emotional time for me.  My sister's dead,  my hotel is in limbo, and  I-I don't have anyone on my side anymore.  I had my ex in my corner,  but I went and ruined that, so  And now I'm all alone.  What, do you get some sick pleasure in other people's pain?  Keep wearing your heart on your sleeve.  It makes you a much more sympathetic defendant.  If you become a defendant,  which I will work hard to ensure that you don't.  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Aw, look, Petra made a friend.  (IN A WHISPER) Thank you.  A friend who charges $600 an hour, but still.  I'd almost say things are looking up.  Okay, I'm her lawyer.  What's next?  There is no next.  That's all the pictures. It's just one room.  Well, it's great.  It will be great.  We'll decorate it on the cheap. I'm a pro.  I'm looking forward to it.  Me, too.  - Okay. - Hmm.  Let me just ask.  Oh, please, don't let this be about the kiss.  Do you really not think we have chemistry anymore?  - I don't know. - That's what you're saying.  Okay, fine. You know what?  Kiss me again.  Are you serious?  Let's do it. Go.  Okay.  - (LAUGHS) - Okay. Wow.  Sorry. Okay. No.  You are obviously not in the right headspace again.  I'm fine. I'm ready.  - No, I don't want to anymore. - It is now or never.  This is your window.  - Okay. - Mm-hmm.  Fine.  - Fine. - Mm-hmm.  But first,  you have to think about what comes next.  - I've thought everything through. - No.  What I would do  after we kiss.  What do you mean?  Like where I would put my  hand, for instance.  Oh?  And my  tongue.  Where are you gonna put it?  (WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)  Oh, wow.  That's just to start.  Then I'd  (WHISPERS INAUDIBLY)  Okay, kiss me now.  Eh.  (LAUGHS)  (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)  LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And, friends, what can I say?  It felt like  a telenovela.  MATEO: Yay!  You guys are kissing!  Does that mean you're getting married?"
