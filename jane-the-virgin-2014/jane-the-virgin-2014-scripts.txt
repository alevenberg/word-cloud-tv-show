internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who

father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him

means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with

are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really

take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a

unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last

not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here

thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought

that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh

didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed okay here's where we left off jane got acc our story begins 13 and a half years ago when jane gloriana villanueva was a mere ten years old it should be noted that at a mere ten years old jane's passions include in no particular order her family god and grilled cheese sandwiches this is jane's grandmother alba gloriana villanueva her passions include god and jane in that particular order really mom shh but this is so lame mommy shh this is jane's mother xiomara gloriana villanueva her passions include jane and paulina rubio the order is not important bien i can't and jane never did oh jane we should i know mm-hmm mmm stop we should stop whew ah don't forget this

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought

that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and

know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i

someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought

say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who

not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed okay where were we ah yes our heroine jan our story begins 13 and a half years ago when jane gloriana villanueva was a mere ten years old it should be noted that at a mere ten years old jane's passions include in no particular order her family god and grilled cheese sandwiches this is jane's grandmother alba gloriana villanueva her passions include god and jane in that particular order

life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way

baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell

of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter

this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father

cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree

i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break

you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed okay ready to roll the basics jane was our story begins 13 and a half years ago when jane gloriana villanueva was a mere ten years old it should be noted that at a mere ten years old jane's passions include in no particular order her family god and grilled cheese sandwiches this is jane's grandmother alba gloriana villanueva her passions include god and jane in that particular order really mom shh but this is so lame mommy shh this is jane's mother xiomara gloriana villanueva her passions include jane and paulina rubio the order is not important bien i can't and jane never did oh jane we should i know mm-hmm mmm stop we should stop whew ah don't forget this thanks for

whether oh you will you will maybe michael's gonna propose my sisters say guys get all cheeseball before they propose no way we have a timeline all right i haven't gotten my teacher's degree yet we just merged our calendars you've been dating for two years and you haven't boned he might move up your timeline everybody decent who are you roman zazo but everyone calls me zaz i work for the uh management company that just bought the hotel so you can think of me as your new boss pick a straw please pick one keeping in mind there's nothing to worry about as long as you're outstanding at your

look you've changed i mean of course you did if you didn't change then i'd be worried about you and you know what it's a good thing because you were so insufferable before hey as your sister i can say that i loved you then i love you now and if you do get a divorce it doesn't make you our father thanks lu now go home to your wife say hi to allison for me hey do you remember a guy named rafael solano when we worked at the yacht club he was like a member the jerk you had a monster crush on i didn't have a monster crush on him we talking about the same guy you had a magical kiss who'd you

i'm i'm so sorry for no no it's okay and i hope that everything turns out okay for you yeah i didn't know that you were coming i had the nurse unfreeze rafael's sperm a surprise for him that's why i didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't

of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter

this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're

babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed hi friends as a young girl jane was taught our story begins 13 and a half years

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that

it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the

start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i

someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day

of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and

know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe

insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that

not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way

baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called

why i didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the

know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not

jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a

why i didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her

up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here

that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed ready okay jane the virgin was accidentally our story begins 13 and a half years

drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought

that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh

that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the

start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the

said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's

what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a

all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way

life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every

unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last

your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father

cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the

jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't

didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here

jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't

didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason

thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a

babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the

to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept

late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared

was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there

said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant

manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day

of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and

know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i

someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty

actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a

say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here

all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every

unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last

your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false

need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father

cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way

it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations

makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this

unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last

your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here

walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything

teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't

unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva

your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a

gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every single thing in my life except you wow i love you and in that moment in the arms of the man she thought she knew so well jane gloriana villanueva really believed that to be true and then everything changed 1 latin lover narrator hola friends as our story begins 13 and a half years ago

someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an

room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see

said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day

of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and

start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i

someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come to my gig tomorrow night boo ah don't you judge the best way to get over a man is to get under a new man trust well as long as you're not talking to bruce i'm happy oh man you know that guy darrell who's dating slutty crystal well he found out that she's been boning mauricio but she tried to deny it but there was this text she sent him where she's like naked and grabbing her boobs you want to see pass i already sent it you all right baby fine i'm just a little nauseous wait why are you talking to slutty crystal i thought you hated her yeah i know but i just found out her brother-in-law knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father but he does know the father the father honey i have to go wait no i have to go one sec babe hey you're a little bit early yeah oh hey what's all this i thought we were going out i made dinner grilled cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for

pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and

know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way

illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a

all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh i love you because you're my best friend and i want to grow old with you and right now i'm confused about every

tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that

didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

knows paulina rubio's bassist so i got to kiss her ass hopefully i don't get an std oh mom i did not need to see crystal got fake boobs those are her breakup boobs hmm come on let's get up but you're not feeling good mom jane nausea and fainting spell solved you're pregnant it's i'm sorry but she's just not pregnant no i'm not pregnant we tested your urine trust me the test is wrong false negatives are frequent false positives are rare jane did you and michael no we didn't and it may be rare but it happened cause i'm a virgin a virgin yeah maybe we should talk in private no no we don't need to talk in private i think we do where did you get your degree from the university of dumb-ass my daughter said that she is a freakin virgin so do another damn test pink means pregnant but i've never had sex immaculata you are immaculata what no mom clearly she's not a virgin of course i am that's a mistake it's not a mistake or it's a hormonal thing exactly pregnancy hormones what i understand that this is unplanned hail jane full of grace hi hello this is jane villanueva i need to talk to dr alver because i have a crazy doctor saying that i'm pregnant blessed is the fruit of shh of the womb i'm not pregnant just say it no you're not i'm sorry no lu it's not your fault well you see it is actually what do you mean two weeks ago when i walked in on allison with it doesn't matter two weeks ago um i used your specimen on the wrong person excuse me you what i inseminated a girl with your sperm mistakenly she's here i had sex with bruce three days ago what why are you telling me this i don't know what if you're like a religious messiah i can't lie to a religious messiah hey there dr alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a pill that you could take um of course you are under no obligation to consult with the father

cheese that sounds perfect okay um before we eat i just want to give you fair warning that i'm about to say some pretty corny stuff okay ground rules not allowed to freak out cause this is a moment we're gonna be telling our kids and grandkids about michael what are you doing i'm proposing but i mean our timeline who cares about the timeline or that you know you don't have your teaching degree or that i haven't established my career or that we have debts or whatever other reasons we have for waiting as of today we've been together for two years michael just wait wait before you say anything i'm not doing this because i want to have sex with you okay i mean i i do want to have sex with you cause two years is a really really long time but that's not why i'm proposing okay i'm proposing because i want to spend my life with you and raise children with you and have sex with you so jane gloriana villanueva will will you michael i'm pregnant what will serve michael cordero jr well in the illustrious detective career he will go on to have is his ability to focus on facts okay i need you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here

jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything

from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a

didn't tell you you guys are so close i didn't want to put you in an awkward position oh i look if you don't do it someone else will and i know from the internet that you can't refreeze the sample so unless you want the sperm to die and suddenly just like that luisa realized what she'd done but alas it was too late jane's life was now the stuff of telenovelas later when asked about the so-called immaculate conception of jane gloriana villanueva luisa alver would say that it was the biggest mistake of her life come in it wasn't i didn't know who else to call you said it was an emergency i artificially inseminated the wrong woman so i need a lawyer i don't practice law anymore you know that i am scared i need someone that i can talk to your wife your brother i walked in on allison last night in bed with her assistant i'm sorry that happened and it was raf's sperm what petra came in for an insemination and i accidentally used his specimen on someone named jane gloriana villanueva were you drinking no no my god no i wasn't what did you tell petra i didn't i panicked i walked into the room and i inseminated her with saline you might be a father we'll know in two weeks i used your sample baby you what without telling me i wanted it to be romantic i wanted some part of the fact that we had to do it like this to to be romantic what are the chances this will take twenty percent don't say anything you're already on probation you could lose your license but what about raf i mean it was his only sample and it's gone how will telling him change that mom stop staring come

babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this new show how could you keep my daughter a secret all these years i wrote you 16 months ago what took you so long babe what are you doing here trying to be brave but before i propose you need to know all the facts and the fact is i'm having the baby and we're giving it to the father he and his wife they really want it and they're a really great couple she's giving us the baby yes she just called she said she wants it to grow up in a happy home where both parents want it so under the circumstances i thought it best not to mention our previous conversation michael yeah okay i'm okay with that okay oh that's not good you can stand oh can i great thanks okay all right oh i'm not good at this stuff so instead of telling you the reasons why i love you i'm gonna tell you the reasons why i don't i don't love you because you're smart and kind i don't love you because you're hard-working and competitive and way too defensive i'm not defensive i don't love you because you are incredibly sexy ooh

alver hi thank you for seeing me it's the craziest thing right these pregnancy tests keep coming back positive and there's got to a reason right like some kind of hormonal thing or there is a reason and the reason the tests came back positive is i accidentally inseminated you two weeks ago what you what it was a mistake i made a mistake and there was only a-a 20 chance that it would take so i-i thought that you would never know but things turned out differently i'm so sorry jane you're sorry you should be in jail lady you should be locked up mom there's options this is a prescription for a

you to tell me again everything that happened exactly as it happened going over how what happened doesn't change the fact that it happened i know i know i'm just i'm freaking out a little bit here babe i know me too and the fact was this sucked i invited over our families i was pretty sure you'd say yes michael i would have should we just pretend like you did for now yes probably shouldn't drink i need another drink i can't believe luisa didn't tell you yeah she's dead to me i want it the kid an unexpected by-product of cancer they should put that in the manual right being told you can't have kids will lead to you really wanting them petra'll never go for it dude this is the same girl who would not leave your side when you were going through chemo i'm not gonna lie i thought she'd bolt look i'm just saying maybe you're underestimating her thank you for coming what are you doing here man well i got to admit i was hurt you know not to get invited to my own brother's engagement party oh well i'm uh sorry i hurt your feelings billy uh-uh don't treat me like that like what like i'm a bomb that could go off which uh we know that i could right i mean everybody here your fiancée they think you're such a good guy do not threaten me do you understand me do you understand me whoa whoa all right hey look i just came here to uh congratulate you on your engagement that's all so why don't you um introduce me around i met jane's mom seems like a handful where's her pops where's he he's not a part of her life oh really bet there's a story there there's not a story jane has never met her father in fact xiomara herself hadn't seen jane's father since the day she told him she was pregnant the same day he told her to get rid of it until 16 months ago when she walked into carla's croquetas and saw jane's father again right there in broad daylight let's talk janie mom i'm not in the mood all right i got a big test coming up i just want to study but baby i know how you feel i was 16 when i got pregnant with you and i was so scared you were irresponsible you got pregnant because you were irresponsible i don't even have a dad and i've done everything right my whole life i've tried to do everything right so that i'd so you won't turn out like me i told you i didn't want to talk i got the prescription in case you don't have to have a baby would you have had me huh if grandma hadn't made you i'm glad i had you that's not what i asked yeah i know of course i want the baby it's your child so it's my child you look so surprised i guess i am a little my sister has to stop calling i'll take care of it luisa he really doesn't slow down slow down who works here jane the manager said you wanted to see me yeah look i'm sorry that i called you a jerk the other night i was just in this i'm the father what of the baby that you're carrying and i'm sorry about the other day too i used to work at golden harbor yacht club that's where we know each other from oh yes no i mean you don't have to act like you remember no no i do i remember i-i came in after tennis at the end of summer and the restaurant was closed you let me in anyways and you made me a killer grilled cheese sandwich one-third white cheddar one-third yellow cheddar one-third grated american and then we talked mm-hmm well it depends am i being practical or brave practical i'm a teacher brave i'm a writer i have never said that out loud before be brave and i never called i was kind of a jerk back then it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the station pink means pregnant but i've never had sex you don't have to have a baby we'd take it please for us don't have this baby some guy's here to see you xo if it's bruce tell him i'm serious i don't want to see him it's not bruce could i get some help here sorry it's this

it was a long time ago still i'm sorry i'm not ready to be a mom we'd take it and then what i live the rest of my life knowing that my kid is just out there so you're not gonna have it look i know that the reasons for me wanting to end the pregnancy are so selfish that i'm not ready that this wasn't the plan that i have worked so hard every second so that my life was different than my mother's i was an accident and i know my mom loves me but i also know that in some ways i derailed her life i don't want my kid to feel like that ever i want to be ready yeah that makes sense you didn't drop the cancer card the-the cancer card oh stop you know what i mean did you tell her that this was your only chance to have a biological child she was upset i'm not just gonna make her oh give me a break fine petra was always good at math according to her precise calculations and her equally precise prenuptial agreement i'll be the bad guy if that's what this is about no no it's not you know what don't do anything don't say anything i mean it we'll talk later oh abuela it is not what you think no i didn't i i got accidentally oh i don't even know how to say this in spanish no no i didn't the doctor made a mistake i went to the appointment and she accidentally put a sample of a man into me yes from his oh abuela please no but i know how you feel what luisa it's petra i need your help and in exchange i'll convince your brother not to report you to the medical board you're early yeah i just i got called into work yeah so i just wanted to come by and talk to you real quick in person you know yeah of course janie i want to say that i'll support you no matter what oh wait wait that's that's what i want to say but that's not how i feel i want to start a life with you and i don't want to start it with you having some other guy's kid and i'm sorry if that makes me a bad person but that's how i feel please for us don't have this baby okay after her teenage boyfriend rogelio told her not to have the baby xiomara had a real problem she knew she wanted the baby but she also knew she did not want rogelio it's true i'm pregnant some army guy i didn't get his last name and so xiomara kept jane's father's identity a secret yeah abuela asked me to never tell you what she said and i i didn't want you to look at her differently look at you being all selfless but no more secrets okay i-i just wanted you to know that you had a choice because having one it helps i think whatever you decide i don't know what to do mom michael doesn't want it and i get why of of course i get why but dr alver called and said that the father rafael he had cancer this is his only sample and he and his wife they're this great couple loving and wonderful and all they want is a child you want a divorce i do i took care of you when you were sick which is why i didn't do this a year ago and i think if you're being honest you knew that i also think it's the reason you used my sample and regardless i think we bring out an ugly side in each other don't you think nothing sir we had some girl come in there she took off zazo's the contact i'm positive i.d the girl already sent the images down to the
