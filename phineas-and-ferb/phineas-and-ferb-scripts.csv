"So, Ferb, what do you wanna do today? What about Perry? What does he want to do? Well, he's a platypus. They don't do much. I for one, am starting to get bored, and boredom is something of up with which I will not put! The first thing they're gonna ask us when we get back to school is ""what did we do over the summer?"". I mean, no school for three months. Our life should be a roller coaster! And I mean a good roller coaster, not like that one we rode at the state fair. Please exit to the left. Man, that was lame. Why, if I built a roller coaster, I would That's it! I know what we're gonna do today! Phineas, Ferb! I'm gonna go pick up a few things. You boys stays out of trouble, okay? Okay, Mom. We're gonna build a roller coaster! I'm in charge, right? You did tell them I'm in charge. Relax, Candace. Nobody has to be in charge. But what if there's an emergency? Like what? What if, uh What if a satellite falls out of orbit and crashes into the house? If that happens, you're in charge. Yes. Mom says I'm in charge, conditionally. Whatever. Wait a minute. What are you doing? Homework. It's summer. That's cool, you wait till the last minute then. Well, I'm watching you. And I'm in charge conditionally! Hello? Oh, hi, Stacy! No, I can't get to the mall right now. Mom just went to the store, she left me in charge, well, you know, conditionally. Oh, if you go, can you see if Jeremy is there? No, no, he's the cute one that works at Mr. Slushy Burger. Yeah, he totally smiled at me the last time I was there. I just about died! No, I told you I can't, I'm watching my brother and step-brother. Yeah, and they never get into trouble, 'cause Mom never catches them. One of these days though, I'm going to see the two as she catches them red handed. Will you hold it down? I am trying to use the phone! Mom left me in charge, so there will be no shenanigans today. What are doing right now? Why do you ask? What do you mean you can see it from your house? See what?! Phineas, what is this?! Do you like it? Ooh, I'm gonna go tell Mom, and when she sees what you're doing, you are going down! Down, down, down! D-O-W-N, down! We're gonna need a blowtorch and some more peanut butter. Hey Candace. Is Phineas home? Down, down, I say! Hey, Phineas. Hey, Isabella. Whatcha doin'? Building a roller coaster. In your backyard? Some of it. Wow. Isn't that kind of impossible? Some might say. Hey, Ferb. Does your step-brother ever talk? Ferb? He's more of a man of action. I was gonna go to the pool, you wanna go swimming? Kind of in the middle of something here. Oh, right. Okay, I'll see you later then. Okay. Hey, Ferb, you got enough rivets up there? Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us, he bought up 80% of the country's tin foil. I want you to get over to his hideout right away, find out what he's up to, and put a stop to it. As always Agent P, it is important that your cover identity as a mindless domestic pet remains intact. Now, get out there. We're all counting on you. So, the way I see it, the soil fuel rockets kick in at the mall's parking lot. Then we release the snakes during the corkscrew at the interstate. I'm gonna go get the snakes. Mom, you gotta come home, right now. Did a satellite crash into the house? No, no, no! You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Seems like we've had this conversation before. What do you mean? I seem to recall you telling me that the boys were training monkeys to juggle bicycles. And when I come home, there was a stunning lack of monkeys. I still don't know how they cleaned that up so fast. So, what's the emergency this time? They're building a roller coaster! Candace, seriously, isn't Phineas a little young to be a roller coaster engineer? Aren't you a little young to be a roller coaster engineer? Yes. Yes I am. Well, I must say, I'm very impressed. The forms all seems to be in order, although I'd never seen them filled out in crayon before. So, if there's anything I can get you, anything at all, just let me know. Do you think we could borrow one of those gadgets? Now, this is the life. Ah, Perry the Platypus, what an unexpected surprise. And by unexpected, I mean: completely expected! I, Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil. And when I put my giant magnet, next to my genius, Magnetism Magnifier, I will pull the East, in westerly direction, thereby reversing the rotation of the earth! You may well ask yourself, ""why would he do this?"" ""What could he possibly have to gain?"" Well, let me just answer that question, I haven't really worked on all the bugs yet. I mean, you know, tin foil alone costs a lot. But Mom, I'm telling you, they're building it, and it's huge! ""Phineas and Ferb present the Coolest Coaster Ever, now open""? Mom! Phineas and Ferb got a roller coaster? You'd think we get a discount if we bring the flier? Maybe we better take it. Here, look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy! I told you! And you're not crazy because? (screams) I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be at the dairy section if you wanna come yell at some cheese or anything. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages! May I present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making! The Coolest Coaster EVER! So, who wants to go first? To fasten, insert the tab inside the metal buckle. To release, just pull back on the- Oops. Well, you get the picture. Well, that's about it. Enjoy the ride. You guys all signed the waivers, right? Relax, they're just rubber. Hey, look, there comes the A-A-A-A! really make my money back. I-I-I could by a bunch of east-facing real estate, and sell it again with an unsentimental view. I just Ha! You missed! Aaahh! Ow, ow, ow, owwwww! Owww! Now, you are too late! Quake in your boots and watch helplessly, as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces, pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing the rotation of the-- Well, that didn't work. And now, we have a two ton ball of tin foil traveling 200 miles an hour directly at us! Quickly, we must separate the magnet from the Magnifier before it's too late! Now I know I have that club card in here somewhere. I always have it with me, but my purse is a disaster area, you know how it is. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom! Mom! It's no use! It's no use, we are doomed! You did it! You saved us, Perry the Platypus Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Look, look, look, see? Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at? No! It's not possible! I'm gonna go get the cart. It was right here, and it was huge! Mom! Time to go. I've got frozens. Okay, so you think that Phineas and Ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right? Well, yes. That would be my guess. Fine. Then lets go home, now! Oh, there you are, Perry. Nice hat, Isabella. Funny, I don't remember this in the blueprints. And I'm sure this is new. Ee-eee-ee, ha-hah-ha. I worry about you sometimes, Candace.\R Welcome to Mr. Slushy Burger. May I take your order? Anyone want fries? Croissant? Anyone want a croissant?\R You know, if that thing crashes into earth, Candace is in charge. We should have charged more. Okay, we're here. Are you happy now, Candace? Yes! See, Mom? I told you they weren't there! Oh, hi, boys. Hi, Mom. Come on, Candace, help me with the groceries. But-but-but-but-but-but-but Let's go. Hey Phineas, that was great. Way too cool. That was awesome! Can we do it again? Sorry, only one ride per customer. That was great, Phineas. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow? Don't know yet. Maybe you could teach Perry some tricks. Well, he is a platypus, they don't do much. They're the only mammals to lay eggs. Maybe he'll lay an egg. Cool, see you tomorrow. It really was the coolest coaster ever. You guys makes a great team. Well, a brother is a brother. But I couldn't have asked for a better one than Ferb. You know what I mean? (burps) Oh-ho-ho, man! I could smell the peanut butter! Well, that was impressive. See you guys. So, what should we do tomorrow? There's a world of possibilities. Maybe we should make a list. Mom! Give it a rest, Candace!"
"This is stinky dog coming to you on the hottest day of the summer. So, unless you live at the beach, I say take it easy and do nothing today. Yup, just find yourself a shady tree and maybe an aquatic mammal at some sort and blow the whole day off. Come on, Ferb! If we let a little heat  stop us from having the best day ever, then the morning deejays win. Whew! Boy, it's hot today. So, what are you up to? We're making our own beach right here in the backyard. Oh, how cute. Well, I'm off for my spa day. You boys behave yourselves and don't bother your father. He's finally cleaning out the basement. Bye mom! Yes! You heard her. We can't bug dad, which makes me in charge. By default. Carry on. We're going to need more sand. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning Agent P! Lawn gnomes across the Tri-State Area are disappearing leaving thousands of gardens unprotected from the evil of black magic. We suspect Doofenshmirtz. Get right on it! Aren't you a little young to be a landscape contractor? Yes. Yes, I am. Hi Phineas. Oh, hey Isabella. Whatcha doin'? Building a beach. Check it out. Can me and the other Fireside Girls be lifeguards? We need to earn our aquatic safety badges. Sure. I mean, I've been a friend of Susie's longer than Katie so I should have been invited to that party first. Who cares if they're lab partners? We're locker neighbors, and locker neighbors trump lab partners any day. Sorry, Stacy! Got to go! Welcome to our beach. Ha! You call that a beach? This is way below your usual standard. This isn't even worth a call to mom. You know, if you guys ever want to be popular, you're going to have to stop playing in sandboxes. Hey! So, Candace! What do you think? That's it! I'm calling mom. Hey Candace! Jenny? Stacy? You never told us you had a beach in your backyard. You're going to be the most popular girl in the neighborhood. I will? I just saw Jeremy and his buddies with their surfboards. Jeremy's here? Got to go!  Perry!  Oh yes! Yes! Just look at my bounty of gnome riches. Oh, this is a strange one. Wait! Who are you? A platypus? Perry the platypus! You are mine now! Oh, no, wait, wait, wait-- that was the garage door opener. You are mine now! And that was the TV remote. I've got to start labeling these things. Aha! You're mine now! Finally, I will rid myself of you. But first, turn your attention to the giant screen and-- maybe I need to turn the cable on first? Let's get this beach party started!  Well, we wake up early and wax our surfboards down   (We'll hit the beach, yeah, we'll hit the beach)   Throw our board shorts on and head for surfin' town   (We'll hit the beach, yeah, we'll hit the beach)  Hey, look! I can see our house from up here. Doh! How low can you go? How low can you go? Look! So that's how low you can go. They've been asking that question for generations. What? What's everybody looking at? For winning the limbo contest you're now officially crowned Queen Wahini  of the beach. All hail Queen Wahini! I can't believe it.  Listen up people and I'll teach ya   Bout Phineas and Ferb and the backyard beach, yah   Every morning, Phineas, he gonna say   (Say!)   ""Brother, whatcha gonna do today?""   Now you see we're having fun   Playing under the sun,   And get in line, get in line   Cause the wet ski's running   A backyard beach,   a backyard beach   Nothing's outta reach, we got the backyard beach   You can change in the broken hut,   Drink out of a coconut,   Three games for a token, but the rest is free   You got skiing, parasailing,   Surfing and a-flailing,   Your contacts need saline, or else you can't see   Got the backyard beach, a backyard beach   Nothing's out of reach, we got the backyard beach   Got the backyard beach, a backyard beach,   Don't fall into the breach, got the backyard beach!  I've never been happier in my entire life. Something is very wrong. Not a single call from Candace not even a text message. Oga, hose me down. I'm going home. Okay, I think I finally got the right one. Now, Perry the platypus You will finally understand my pain. Back in Gimmelschtump in the days of my youth, the Doofenshmirtzes were a proud family. But those were lean times for my father, and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed. Who would protect our ancient garden from witches, spells, and wood trolls? From a tender age, my father decided that it will be me. While the other children played kick the schumptel and ate doonkelberries, I would stand for hours. All through the cold night, as the spitzenhounds howled My only companion was the moon. And my neighbor Kenny. So, since my lawn gnome was taken away from me, I will destroy every lawn gnome in the entire Tri-State Area! Behold! The Destructinator! And now, Perry the platypus to activate my creation No! Surf contest! Out of my way, jennabelle. Hello, Buford! Perhaps you missed the sign. ""No bullying. No yodelling""? I don't like this any more than you do. First up in the surf contest is Bobby Nelson. Oh! And Nelson eats it on a 5-footer! And there's Django Brown shooting a curl. And here comes Buford Von Stomp. Oh! He pummels Brown with a philadelphia traffic stop. And now he's got him in a half Nelson. No, it's whole Nelson! Oh! And now he's actually beating him with Bobby Nelson! Here's the scores from our judges, and Buford doesn't like it one bit. Next up is Phineas Flynn, and it's great to see a young surfer shows such confidence. Uh-oh! What's this? Oh, those kids today and their holographic projections. He's in the pipeline. Now he's hanging 10. He's hanging 20! He's hanging 32! Now he's just hanging! The crowd loves it. I don't think there's a name for that. The crowd is doing the wave and Phineas is surfing it! Let's go to the judges. Ten to the fifth power, infinity, and oh! It seems Phineas Flynn's radical surfing has made judge No 3 rethinks Einstein's theory of Relativity. Cowabunga! Laws of nature! So, are you having fun?  Girl   The moment has arrived..  Just one second. Hello? Um, Candace? Is everything okay? Oh, everything is just wonderful. And Phineas and Ferb? What are they doing? Such a wonderful thing. Candace, honey. I'm coming home. Wait, what? I'm right around the corner. I'll be there in 2 minutes. Oh, wait! No mum! You can't! Oh, wait wait! Stay right there. Got to stop her! Oh. No, no, no,no, no! Mum! Mum! Please, Mum! Go away! Don't come in! Is that volcano? Gnomes! Uhn! Run for your life! It's gnome-ageddon! Who's protecting our gardens? Candace, tell me the truth. What is going on here? Phineas and Ferb built a beach in the backyard, just like they said they were going to. But instead of just a cute little beach in their sandbox, it turned out to be this absolutely huge beach, with a coastline, and palm trees and a pier, and hula dancers, waterskiers, and tiki huts and dolphins and dancing and surfing, and everybody from the neighborhood showed up Oh! and then I was just about to share a smoothie with Jeremy when a coconut dropped on my head and that and just for a moment, it seemed the wily Buford would steal away the coveted surfing trophy from under the noses of our heroes but I can only continue my benign reign and spread love, happiness and ultimate popularity throughout my kingdom! If you would just let me have my moment. Oh, there you are Perry. (Perry chatters) Well, everybody! Looks like that's all for today. Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! If you don't believe me, go see for yourself. That was great. Hey boys. Hey mom. So, how was your day at the beach? Wait! Wait! My kingdom! My Jeremy! It was all so beautiful! What have you done to my paradise? Candace, honey. I think it's time to get you out of the sun for a little while. I think she had fun.  If summer only lasted one day   (If summer only lasted a day)  Stinky dog here with a special shout-out to my two new pals Phineas and Ferb for hosting a beach party that was hot hot hot! And speaking of hot, slather on the sunscreen, listeners, 'cause tomorrow's weather calls for another scorcher! With a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes. Ha ha ha ha!  He's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action!   He's a furry little flatfoot,   who'll never flinch from a fray-ee-ay-ee-ay!   He's got more than just mad skill   He's got a beaver's tail and a bill   And the women swoon   whenever they hear him say  (Perry chatters)  He's Perry,    Perry the Platypus!"
"I met my love in a-  OW! Oh, boy! Did that kid stink or what? But maybe you've got what it takes to be The Next Super American Pop Teen Idol Star! Auditions open today at the Googolplex Mall in beautiful downtown Danville. Auditions! Today?! Yes, today! At two o'clock sharp. I gotta tell Stacy! That pop star stuff might be fun at first, but then you'd be stuck with a dead end job. Too bad you can't just do it once and move on. Well, what you're talking about is a one-hit wonder. A one-hit wonder? What's that? Well, a musical act goes to the top of the charts with a catchy tune and meaningless lyrics. (Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!)  I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun!  ( She's Lindana! ) ( She wants to have fun )  I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun!  Then they throw a big diva tantrum, lose their label, then fade to obscurity. Before they know it, their song ends up as elevator music.  I wanna, wanna, wanna have fun fun fun Years later, they have a reunion concert, and after that, they never sing again, and no one remembers them. Not that I would know anything about that. A one-hit wonder. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. But Stacy, what am I going to sing? Hello, what are you gonna wear? Hmmm. What do you think? Too much. Too little. Ugh, too clean. Too dirty. Too street. Too goth. Where'd you get that? My mom's closet. You like it? Nah, too retro. Perfect! Nice, huh? Yeah, you should've tried that on first. Let's go! Chika, chika, choowah. Meaningless lyrics done. How's the catchy tune coming along? Excellent! We'll be done by lunch! Hey, where'd Perry go? Hello? Hello-oo? Anybody there? Oh, good morning Agent P. We just received word that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up construction toys at an alarming rate. We need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it.  Perry!  We'll meet back in the entrance in an hour. Come on, Stacy! We gotta hurry so we could get a spot in li-- yayaya. I've never sang in front of so many people! Uh, Candace? I can't do this. Oh yes, you can. You're not a quitter; you're a fighter! I am? Sure you are! You're a lean, mean, singing machine! That's it, yeah! Now you're looking like a winner! Hey, Candace. And that is what a gorilla looks like when you try to take away its food. Oh! Hi, Jeremy! Are you auditioning too? Nah. I came to see this hot new band called PFT. I downloaded their song this morning. It's tight! The hundredth contestant gets to sing onstage with the band! Really? Hey, looks like that's you. Congratulations! You're the hundredth contestant! Ladies and gentlemen, this young lady has the honor of singing onstage with PFT. So now, the band you've been waiting for Phineas and the Ferb-Tones! Phineas? Candace? You're the hundredth contestant? How serendipitous. This'll be like a brother and sister thing! Now I'm assuming you've heard our hit single. I mean, who hasn't, right? It's a big hit. So here's the words but don't worry if you get lost. The lyrics are meaningless anyway. I'll point when it's your turn. Ladies and gentlemen, the Ferbettes! I'm Phineas and this is Ferb, and we're gonna sing a song! (Song: Gitchee Gitchee Goo)  Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!  ( That's what my baby says! )  Mow-mow-mow!  ( And my heart starts pumping! )  Chicka-Chicka, Choo Wah!   Never gonna stop!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!   I said a Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!  ( That's what my baby says! )  Mow-mow-mow!  ( And my heart starts pumping! )  Chicka-Chicka, Choo Wah!   Never gonna stop!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!   I said a Bow, Chika, Bow-Wow!  Candace! Wait a minute! What are you doing? I'm cuing you? How'd you get a hit single?! Well, it wasn't easy. It took most of the morning and half a dozen phone calls. But if you're willing to put in the work- That's it! I'm gonna tell Mom! Okay tell her what? Ooh, I'm just gonna tell.  Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!  Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, you've gotta see this! Let me guess. Is it unbelieva- WOOAH! Come on, come on, come on! Hi, I'm Ben Baxter, Huge-O-Records. Why don't you come by my office in an hour and we can talk about your future. Future? Cool. He must be a psychic. Come on, come on, come on! See?! There they are onstage!!! Ladies and gentlemen, once again Marty the Rabbit Boy and His Musical Blender! Hon, we're getting you an eye exam. No, no! Wait!  Perry!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ha ha, everything is ready! Oh, what is it now? Oh, you are my new temp? Well, let me just get you up the speed. I know it's bit of a mess. I'm just putting the finishing touches of my latest maniacal plan. You see, in a few minutes, I will unleash an unprecedented reign of terror upon the entire Tri-State Area! And Perry the Platypus will never be the wiser. Perry the Platypus? You're a temp? Are times that hard? Ugh! I told Mom I don't need glasses! What the -- Uh, No! No! Wait! Ugggggh MMMMMOOOOM?!?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incor--  Sorry, Perry the Platypus, but you are too late! Ooh, this one's nice. Mom! Come here! You've gotta see this! But Candace! I haven't payed for this yet! Hey! Ha ha ha ha! When it comes to havoc, nobody wreaks like me! Whoaa! Wait, wait, wait, you're not supposed to touch that! Hey, hey, no fair! Wow, what a great painting! How did you get permission for that? Oh, they didn't mind. The building's scheduled for demolition. Seeeeeee??!! AAAAHHHH!! Uh, ma'am, you're gonna have to come back and pay for that. Yes of course, officer. AAAAHHHH!! Hey, weren't you Lindana? Yes, I was! I can't believe you recognized me. Well, I was a huge fan. You still have to pay for the jacket. I know. Very clever, Perry the Platypus. I was trying to ignore you, but you forced my hand. And now I shall relax with a nice, tasty deli platter. Oh-ho-ho, where are my manners? Here you go, Perry the Platypus. Care for some pepper? Just say when. Anytime. Boys, let me start by saying we love your act and we want to be in the Phineas and the Ferb-Tones business. And by the way, aren't you a little young to be pop stars? No. Well, okay then! We prepared to offer you a very lucrative contract if you'll just sign exclusively with us for your follow-up single. Follow-up single? Who do you think we are, some two-bit hacks who will keep writing new songs just because you pay us obscene amounts of cash?! Phineas and the Ferb-Tones are strictly a one-hit wonder! Good day to you, sir! Diva tantrum, check. Elevator music, check. Ah, who needs 'em? We still got this video tape of their performance. We could do live CDs, DVDs, pod-casts, and we can digitally re-create their images to make our own sitcom! The Phineas and Ferb Show! We could squeeze twenty years of entertainment out of this one video tape. Whoaa! That giant robot's coming right at us! Wow, you sure like a lot of pepper. I'm more of a paprika man myself. (coughs) It will take more than condiments to foil my brilliant plan! (sneezes) The tape! Ooh! What an unbelievable stroke of luck! Oof! I'm okay! It's still better than the Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Oh, there you are, Perry. (Perry chatters) Come on, guys. We still have one thing left to do. And the winner of the today's ""Next Super American Pop Teen Idol Star"" is Marty the Rabbit Boy and his Musical Blender! Oh, give him a hand! He's going to Hollywood! Hey, Candace. What's wrong? I'm better than that guy. Oh, I should've taken blender lessons. So why did you run off earlier? My brothers. They always ruin everything. Well, you like to sing, right? Yeah. Then you shouldn't let your brothers' fun ruin your good time. You know, if you get a chance to sing, you oughta sing. I gotta go, I'll see you later. Hey Candace, you're still the hundredth contestant. Wanna come up and help us out? (Song: Gitchee Gitchee Goo)  Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!   That's what my baby says!   Mow-mow-mow!   And my heart starts pumping!   Chicka-Chicka, Choo Wah!   Never gonna stop!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!   I said a Bow, Chicka, Bow-Wow!   That's what my baby says!   Mow-mow-mow!   And my heart starts pumping!   Chicka-Chicka, Choo Wah!   Never gonna stop!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!   Gitchee Gitchee Goo means   That I love you baby,   baby,   baby!  ( Baby-baby-baby-baby, )  Gitchee Gitchee Goo means that I love you!  That was great! I've been thinking of my brothers all wrong! They're not a nuisance. They're my ticket to- Thanks, you've been great! This is the last time we're ever gonna sing that song. We're retiring, good night! The mall is now closed and will re-open at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow. Thank you for shopping with us. ( She's Lindana! ) (Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!)

"So Ferb, what should we do today? I mean, besides giving Perry a bath. (chatters) What is that wonderful noise? Awesome. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Oh, I have got to take a new picture of myself for my blog. I didn't realize mine is already a week old. That's better. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO MOM'S CAR?! We tricked it out! You don't even know how to drive. Well, duh. That's why Ferb built this remote. Oh, you are so busted. Mom?! Mom?! Mom?! Um, where's Mom? She's playing bridge at Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro's! Heh, they won't get away with it this time! Oh, Candace, dear. Bubela, how good to see you. What a coincidence. Do you know your mom is here? Mmm-mmm. Yeah, I do, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro. I need to talk to her if you don't mind. Oy-vey. Look how tall you are now. You must've grown a couple of inches since the last time I saw you. That was last week, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro. Well your mom's inside, dear. Where are your braces? I thought you were wearing braces. Yeah. MOM! MOM! MOM! What is it, Candace? Oh, you have got to see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Hey, Ferb. What's the red button for? MOM! What is it? What do you want me to see? Quick! Hi, Mom! Hi, boys! Well, if that's all, I'll just be getting back to the game. Good thing we've beefed up the suspension. Woah! What else can it do? Hi, Phineas. Oh, hi, Isabella. What'cha doin'? We're entering The Swamp Oil 500 today. Aren't you gonna need a pit crew? Do you know a pit crew? Well I know a few people who work well together. Great! You're hired! See you at the track. Hey Ferb, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons completely unknown, he's purchased a giant airship or blimp, as the kids say. Your mission is to find out why, and if necessary, put a stop to it.  Perry!  Hi, Phineas. I got your pit crew. Cool! See ya in the pits. Okay, girls. We're dealing with a 426 cubic inch, fully-blown V8, with hypo lifters, radical cam, and a limited slip differential. Would that be electronically fuel-injected? Phineas?! PHINEAS! PHIN-E-AS! Hey! I can't hear the cars! Hey, Candace! I didn't know you were a racing fan! Jeremy. Who, me? Oh, yeah! Yeah, I'm a big fan of those, those uh.. uh that red one is cute! Oh, that's Billy Ray Digler's car. He's great. Yeah, yeah, he's the best. That Billy Roy. Billy Ray. Billy Ray. I-I love it when he turns left and then he turns left again, and then- And in the 3rd lane, the newcomers Team Phineas! Now is it just me, or does he look a little bit young to be behind the wheel of a 700 horse power racing machine? Yes. Yes, he does. And look, he's already got his own screaming fans! PHINEAS! Hey, Candace is rooting for us! Candace, you're on the big screen! PHINEAS! And your little brother's gonna be on TV! Phineas--? On TV? TV! That's it! They are so busted! Can you wait here for a second? Thanks. What is it, Candace? I'm right in the middle of a 3-No trump. Turn on the TV! All right. All right, Candace. This better be good. Well? Well? Do you see it? Just a second, honey. Turn on the cable box first. Hmm. All right. Wait. 'Kay, that's not it. Um, is it this one? No, this is another phone.  If summer only lasts-  Oh, I turned on the stereo! Mom, hurry up! Okay, just a second! Are you embarrassed about flaking? Itching? Peeling? Candace, this is a dandruff commercial. Is there something you're trying to tell me? Okay, Ferb. Are we good to go? And with the race about to start, there's the Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated blimp!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. I'm glad you're here. Actually, I was just getting ready to serve some PLATYPUS UNDER GLASS! You're just in time to witness my latest invention my Deflate-inator Ray! Which I will demonstrate by deflating all the tires of the Jefferson County Motor Speedway! After which, I will deflate everything in the Tri-State Area! That way, if anyone wants anything flated, they will have to talk to me. Phineas, you are in big trouble, mister--! Candace, you've got a little Smile! Souvenir picture? Only a dollar. Wait a second. Hey! Now, I gotcha! Hey hey, Missy. Two pictures, two bucks. Oh, yeah, uh, I've only got a dollar, but uh, I just want the one. You can just tear the other one up, 'kay? I've got 'em, NOW! And on the fast on the inside lane is Number 42, Team Phineas! Hey, Ferb. Do you think we can get any more power? I mean, I know it's just a battery. But I was thinking, let's open it up and see what this puppy can- Uh, Ferb? We're actually slowing down now. Ferb? Hello? OH YEAH! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT! Hey, Ferb. We should bring Phineas in for a pit stop. All right, Fireside Girls, let's move, move move! That helmet looks so manly. Thanks. Hit it, Ferb. I'm so proud of you girls. And the bow was a nice touch, Gretchen. Listen to those fools, as they worship their candy-colored race car man. How about a little demonstration of my deflationary prowess? I got it! (Song: Go, Go, Phineas) The Team Phineas car is avoiding every obstacle! It's like he can see the whole darn track at once!  Go Phineas! Go, go Phineas!  OH YEAH! We're okay! Well Mom, what do you think of this? You'velooked better. Huh? What do you mean--? Already they fear me, listen to their screams, huh? Imagine the mayhem once my Deflate-inator ray is fully charged. Run! Run like the wind, my little indentured rodent. And I will give you some cheese. Heh, I know I had some around here somewhere. I think there's some- There used to be some Roquefort around the back here. I don't.. Hmm? Hmm. I suppose I should've seen that coming. But Mom, you've gotta believe me! Wait a minute. I bet it's still on TV! That's good, Candace. Go watch a little TV. And look at this amazing finish. M-m-mom-mom, quick! Come look-look-look-look-look!! All right! I'm coming. Oh no! A blimp is about to hit the broadcasting tower! Oh, the hu- Ah-huh? Meap. Deal me back in, Viv. Hmm. Looks like we're walking. ""Why don't you go back home, Candace?"" ""I'm busy with my bridge game, Candace?"" She has no idea!! Gotcha. MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM! MOM! Oh, Candace, hello. I can't believe you grown so much, it's unbelievable-- MOM! Mom, you've gotta see this! It's about your car! All right. Come on, come on, come on! Candace, you're wearing out the heels of my shoes. See Mom?! Look, look! I told you-- But who did this? Phineas and Ferb. You mean Yeah, yeah, yeah! they? They washed my car!? Yes!!-- No-- What? It's beautiful! I gotta admit, I thought you we're exaggerating a bit, but this is really worth getting excited about! Hi, Mom, we're home! Hey, boys! I saw what you did today. Yeah? How'd you like it? I loved it! Now who wants some snacks? Thanks, Mom! Honey, close your mouth."
"""To think"" ""To dream"" ""Whether 'tis nobler to love,"" ""I know not."" Ah, The Princess Sensibilities. My favorite play. What is going on out there?! Would you keep it down out here?! You guys ruin everything! I am trying to practice the art of acting. And I will not be disturbed by your little movies! Not so little anymore. Last week our website got 176,000,000 hits. Oh, sorry I'm late. They're filming down the street. Filming? What? What are they filming? A movie version of the play The Princess Sensibilities. I would be perfect for that part! I've been practicing it for my drama club all summer! I'm gonna get discovered! That's serendipitous. Hey, where's Perry? There you are, Agent P. There's something very strange going on with Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been very quiet lately. A little too quiet. I want you to find out what's not going on, anduh put a stop.. to it. I suppose. Good luck, Agent P.  Agent P!  There it is! Uh, excuse me. Uh, Mr. Producer, sir? I can't talk to you right now. My lead actress just quit! Well sir, this is your lucky day! ""To think"" ""to dream"" ""whether 'tis nobler to love,"" ""I know not."" Heh. That's not bad. And you know your lines. Mmm, I don't know. I'll do it for free. You're hired. Really? You bet! With the money I save, I'll be able to hire the hottest new directors in town. Hello? Wow! I could get used to this! Miss Candace, here's your contract and your bagel. This is Antoine, your dialog coach, Nikki, your swimming stand-in, and your personal trainers Olga and Chicago Joe. Charmed, I'm sure. Drop and give me 20! Candace, baby! Let me introduce you to the directors of this film. Hi, Candace. Phineas and Ferb? What are you doing here? We're directing the movie. Our new agent arranged the whole thing. Look. My client gets 3% of the gross and a piece of the back end, or he walks. Yeah, that's right. You mess with the bull, you get the horns, buddy. Hello? Syd, baby, you got that 3rd act in line yet? Wait, wait! Don't you think they're a little young to be big-budget movie directors? With 176,000,000 hits, they could be in diapers for all I care. Phineas, I don't remember any monsters in The Princess Sensibilities. We just finished the rewrites this morning. ""The Curse of the Princess Monster""? That is not what I signed up for! Besides, I can't wear this! No one will see my face! Yes, but in the end, the curse is lifted! And in your big dramatic scene, you will look stunning! This film could make you a star. Really? A a star? Hey! Ugly monster! You're needed on the set! I'm coming! Oof! Oof! Oof!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus? Why do you keep breaking down my doors? Why don't you knock first? It's not even locked! This time, you'll pay. That's right, fork it over. What? Are you kidding me? This isn't just drywall, you know! It's solid oak! That's more like it. You can't just go busting into people's houses for no reason, you know. Besides, I've given up evil to pursue the art of cheese making. Do you like stinky Limburger? It's a Doofenshmirtz family recipe. It's not ready yet. It still has to age for 58 and 1/2 years. But who's got that kind of time? Which is why I created, The Age Accelerator Inator. Okay, Candace. This is a very important scene. It is nothing less than the emotional backbone of the whole film. Oh, and the villagers are coming at you with everything they've got. Uh, what do mean the villa- Action! The air force! Ugh! Ow! Ungh! Hey! Wait! The space armada from the planet plumbing supplies! Uh! Uhnn.. Beautiful! That's a print! Oh. That's a little embarrassing. Okay, people, nice rehearsal! Let's take it from the top! Wow! Is this banana hat for some cool tropical dance number? We're trying to come up with some exciting camera angles for the big chase scene. So we strapped a camera on to this starving monkey. Aah! Get away! Sorry that monkey cam didn't work out. We're gonna try it with Ferb this time. Now take this sandwich and remember, Ferb hasn't eaten lunch yet. Hold on tight. Aah! Okay. In this scene, the monster; that's you, gets attacked by 800 cubic feet of rats, spiders, and snakes. There is no way I am doing that! Relax. They're made out of rubber. Well the snakes are rubber, anyway. AAH! Get em' off me! Get em' off me! Okay. Candace, this is your beauty shot. The curse has been lifted, and you are no longer a monster. Now this scene, is all about what the heart wants, but the mind can't have. Take one. ""To dream"" ""To be free of the curse."" Beautiful. Keep going. Cue the magical girly dust! ""Whether 'tis nobler to be loved"" (sneezes) Cue wind machine! ""TO BE CURSED' ""BY LOVE"" PHINEAS, MAKE IT STOP! CUT THE WIND MACHINE! Oof! Okay. Drop the flower petals! ""Whether 'tis no-"" Oops! Wrong prop. What the heck. Let's keep it! Oof! Okay people, that's a wrap! Here's your big dramatic scene, Candace. ""To think"" ""To dream-"" Cut! Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. Do it again! ""To think,"" ""to-to stink,"" ""to-to-"" Cut! This is horrible! I can't let anybody see this! That's what's called a rough cut. Ferb's gonna fix it in editing. Tighten up the dialogue, do a little voice modulation, play with the filters, and now take a look! ""To think,"" ""to dream,"" ""to be free of the curse."" I I I look beautiful! That's what they call ""Movie Magic"". You two are the best brothers a great actress could ever have! We've packed the theater with teenagers. They're our target audience. If they like it, we're in business. If they don't (hisses) The Curse of the Princess Monster. Looks like we got a hit movie! Now, Perry the Platypus, watch carefully as I demonstrate the Age Accelerator-Inator. Hooray, it worked! And now to make some perfectly aged cheese! Ah, perfect! You can actually see the pungent aroma. Here you go, Perry the Platypus. But I'm warning you. Once you start, you won't be able to stop. I'll go get some crackers. We're in luck! I still have some left over Melba To-- Oh no! The cheese! What happened to the stinky cheese?! Perry the Platypus, you ate all the cheese?! NO! I created this for peaceful, cheese loving purposes, but now you forced me to wield it in anger! Perry the Pla-- Perry the Platypus, hold still! Hold still so I can blast you! Wow! Those kids love it! Yay! Super stardom, here I come! Huh? What's going on in there? It's too loud with all the rock 'n roll! Where are my teeth? Waste of my time! Sorry kids. They hated it. The movie's dead. Well, at least we had fun. Fun? What about me? I was gonna be a star. Don't worry, Candace. We saved a copy of your best scenes. We're gonna put it on our website right away. I have you cornered! This time, I'll hit you with everything I've got! Say goodbye, Perry the Platypus! Wait, wait, wait, that's not right. Perry the Platypus, just- just look at yourself. You really let yourself go.  Perry!  Oh, so you had an Age Accelerator-Inator proof suit! Well, I have a little surprise of my own. Heh. Well, It's already 4:30. I think I'm going to bed. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Oh boy, this is gonna be great! You guys ruin everything! Whoa, check it out. I bet everyone we know saw it! Enjoy it while it lasts, Candace. Fame is fleeting. But the internet is forever. Good night, Candace. Hey, nice monster on the Internet! ""Uhh! You guys ruin everything!"" Hey Mom, that's the monster on my computer! I've got it! The Swamp Monster of Danville! YOU ROCK! She rocks. Yeah."
"Jeremy is so cute, especially when he's in his Mr. Slushy Dog Uniform. Candace, my jazz trio has a gig at the Squat 'n Stitch today. Why don't you, Phineas and Ferb hang out at the mall together? The mall? I can visit Jeremy at Mr. Slushy Dog! Testing. Welcome everyone, uh, we'll be playing some free formed jazz today. It might get a little crazy, so, hold on to those knitting needles. Hit it, girls! Alright, squirts. Here's your cut. I'll see you back here in 2 hours. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to Mr. Slushy Dog. Hey, where's Perry? Sorry about that, Agent P. Our slide waxing guy has jury duty this weekend. Anyhow, Doofenshmirtz has purchased some suspicious items: He's hiding out at the old abandoned cake factory on the edge of T-- Carl, the light bulb and the ""6000"". Still on the screen. Ah, thanks, Carl. Locate Doofenshmirtz and figure out what he's up to. Don't fail us, Agent P. Oh, hey Candace. Heh. My cell phone appears to be ringing. Whoops! My camera went off! Well, that was an interesting experiment. Excuse me, but why are you not studying? It's summer vacation. You know, no school, and teachers aren't around, and all you have to worry about are bullies? Eh, Buford? That seat's kinda taken. This table's taken. Sit somewhere else. What about Baljeet? Please go. You will just make him angry. This is gonna hurt. Hey! Put him down! Do as she says! Violence can only lead to more violence. Sounds good to me. Hold it! World heavyweight boxing champion Evander Holyfield? Aren't you a little old to be a professional boxer? Yes. Yes I am. Cool. If you have to fight, do it the time-honored way, out behind the mall at 3 o'clock. Uh, Ferb. How's our 3 o'clock? We'll be there. Don't be late. My mom's pickin' me up at 4. It looks like we found something to do today. What you have found is a one-way magic carpet ride to your own destruction. He's right. Remember what happened to the last kid Buford fought? You win this round, Buford. I don't want that to happen to you. It won't, 'cause I'm gonna train him. (Song: He's a Bully)  Your opponent is as big as an ape   So if you wanna avoid being mangled   Just like him, you've got to get into shape   And by shape I don't mean a triangle   He's big, he's dumb, he's got the I.Q. of gum   He's got the brain about the size of a sourdough crumb   But he'll beat on your head like a big bass drum   His behavior is truly unruly   He's a bully!  (He's a bully!)   Yeah, he's a bully!  (He's a bully!)   Yeah,   yeah!   Yeah,   yeah-yeah!  Here you go, brawl at the mall. Brawl at the mall. ""The Brawl at the mall""? What do you two think you're doing? You can't just go building a boxing ring out here in the mall parking lot! I'm telling Mom right now! Mom, Phineas and Ferb are at it again! Not now, Candace. Oh, My solo! Oh, I need proof. The flyer! Perry the Platypus! I trapped you in a giant bowl filled to the brim with Doonkelberry cake mix. You see, today is my birthday! Struggle all you want, Perry the Platypus. But in 30 to 40 minutes, the yeast will rise, and you'll be buried alive! Here, have some. Unfortunately, my birthday has always been the lousiest day of the year. It all began on the day of my actual birth Both of my parents failed to show up. By the age of 5, I was forced to throw my own surprise party. At Gunther Goat Cheese's. The goat-cheesiest place in all of Druselstein. Many of my closest friends were there. Count Wolfgang, Betty the She-Boar, Raputin, and the licekins, Olga and Chicago Joe. Hello, boys andâ Oh. Hmm Awkward. Uh, hey kid, lock up when you're done, okay? But one should never walk the paths of Druselstein. With uncovered Doonkelberry cake, lest the Doonkelberry bats swarm. But this year, I won't be celebrating my birthday alone. Behold! The Slave-inator! You see, the crowd will do whatever the Slave-inator tells them to do! I even have a cleanup party button, because the worst part of a party is the cleanup, am I right? Farewell, Perry the Platypus, and happy birthday to me! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! He's from a broken home, he's howdy's breaking bones, Buford the Bully! Aaaaaaand in this corner, he's got moves, he's got grace, his nose takes up his entire face, Fabulous Phineas Flynn! Okay, boys. Let's have a fair and square fight, and in no way should this ensuing fight contain the image of a potentially harmful, hurtful, or psychologically disturbing physical act, that could be found imitatable by an impressionable child viewer. Aw! Boys and girls,let's get ready to Thumb Wrestle! Sorry, we're out of flyers. Poster? Nope. Action figures? Sold out. Commemorative coin? All gone. Those sold like hot cakes. Photo! Yes! Photographic evidence! Perry the Platypus! Well, if you're gonna crash my party, you're gonna need a party hat. A party hat of doom! I declare a thumb war! The fighters spring to life, they're squaring up to each other, YOW! Flynn hits the mat! Buford gots him where he wants him, and look, and oh! Into the turnbuckle! Clothesline! That can't feel good! Hold onto your seats folks, this one's gonna be brutal! Still hanging around, Perry the Platypus? Why don't you let go? Doesn't it hurt your fingers? I don't think this is going so well. Nonsense, kid. Go for the gold! Fight fire with fire! Aw, shoot. Shoot him the stink-eye! Uh, grease the pig! Ah, I got nothing. A right hook! A darting left jab! No! Photo, photo, photo, photo. Buford is climbing the turnbuckles! He's on the top rope! Oh! The dreaded Boston belt sander! Mom!!! Finally, indisputable photographic evidence of dangerous and irresponsible behavior! Candace, this is your thumb in front of the lens. Oh you are coming with me! And now, Perry the Platypus, I will smudge your face with ice cream! Wait-wait, W-what are you doing? What is that? No! Wait!  It's going so badly!  No! Oh, the humanity! Flynn falls hard! The crowd's on its feet!  It's going so badly!  It's over! It's all over!  Our hero's on the rope and now it's looking like the end  Ice cream fell on you! Now we're both humiliated in public. Whaddya say? Even Steven? Sure Buford. Even Steven. Wait! How did you do th-- Hey, where did that whale come from? Oh, this is the worst party ever! Ahh! My birthday cake! Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! At least I still have my cake! Curse you, Perry the platypus! Hey, I have a strange urge to clean up this mess Me too Let's do it I'll take care of the whale Thank you, Mr. Holyfield. Yeah. Wouldn't have been real without you. Happy to help you boys find a slightly less valid way to settle your differences. There you are, Perry. SEE?!! Hi, Mom! Hi, boys! If you'll excuse me, Candace, I'm gonna get back for the second set. Hey, Dinnerbell, that was the best battle ever. Same thing tomorrow? Nah. I like to keep moving forward. Sharks have to continue to move forward, or they'll drown. You calling me a shark? Blagh! Fer-rb?! Well, he was all up on my face. What happened?"
"Yes! Hey, Ferb! It's Candace's birthday! We gotta do better than last year. Aah! Not our best work. This time it's gotta be something huge! (Song: She's Candace)  She's Candace  Like the Venus De Milo,   except she's not armless and handless   She's got a big, honking truckload   of ship-launching qualities   And this is the reason   she bears no resemblance to a   praying mantis!   (Candace)   A name with 7 letters!   (Candace)   Only wears designer sweaters!   (Candace)   She's got an allergy to dairy!   (Candace)   And she's anything but ordinary!  Perry? This is yours, I believe. Happy birthday, Candace! I made you a special breakfast! And after that, we have a surprise! What is it?! Where is it?! We have to drive to it. Oooh!!! Is it the mall? No. Okay But it's the mall, right? No, it's not the mall! Wait. Please don't tell me we're going to Mt. Rushmore. Isn't it great? Four American presidents carved into the side of a mountain. It was Phineas and Ferb's idea! You're welcome. Okay. You lot go on ahead. I'll find a parking spot and meet you there! We're going up to the monument. Come on, Perry. Okay, we'll join you in a minute! Okay, Candace. It's your birthday, you can pick out anything you want. Ooh, what about the Mt. Rushmore bobble heads? Mom, that's lame. Okay. How about this cute, cuddly Lincoln? Jeremy? Hi, Jeremy. Hey, Candace. What are you doing here? Ah, I'm just here on the Mr. Slushy Burger worker exchange program. Um Uh, oh, well, it's my birthday today, and I uh I gotta check something. Back in a flash, 'kay? Where'd they go? Hi, Mrs. Fletcher. Oh, hi, Isabella. What brings you girls here? Fireside Girls field trip. Um, is Phineas here? Mmm hmm. He and Ferb are up on the monument. Possibilities. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good again. We just discovered his new hideout is located inside Lincoln's head at Mt. Rushmore. I- I know. You were just there. Poor planning on our part, actually. Sorry. Phineas?! Ferrrrb?! Ohh. Hey, honey. What are them kids doing up on the monument? Let me see that. Mom! Mom, you've got to see this now. Here, look! Oop. Ran out of time. Oh, ooh! Here, look now! Oh, Old Reliable Geyser. How exciting! I'm just gonna go back to the gift shop. Ah, Perry the Platypus! Your timing  is impeccable. And by impeccable I mean COMPLETELY PECCABLE! You're just in time to witness my latest scheme. Behold, my Drill-Inator! I will bore a tunnel to China, build a toll highway, and make millions! So, as they say in China, Arrivederci! Now, where should we start? Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'? It's a surprise. Can I help? We could use a lookout! You got it! Uh, ma'am, if you handle the big stick, you gotta buy it. Mom! You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Uh, excuse me. Aren't you boys a little young to be restoring a national monument? Yes. Yes we are. Well, it's good to see young people taking an interest in our national heritage. Hull overheating. The molten lava of the earth's core completely slipped my mind. Oh no! THE LAVA IS FOLLOWING US! The lava is being diverted. You did it, Perry the Platypus! You saved us! I hate to be a stickler, but the lava is coming AGAIN!!! FASTER! Wait 'till you see what those two are up to! She's coming! She's getting closer!! We're running a little behind on schedule. Go to Plan B. Plan B, girls! You are gonna be shocked by what I'm about to show you, Mom. Hmm. I guess some things look better in photos. Oh, it's Dad. Hi, honey! I found an absolutely brilliant parking space! Great! I'll meet you at the gift shop, dear. I still have to buy that big stick. Huh? Now! Oops. Huh? Why it's i-it's IT'S BEAUTIFUL..! MOM!!! Mom! I've gotta show you something right now! Come on! Follow me! Candace, are you still trying to get the boys in trouble? No! No, no, this is a great thing! Oh, it's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me! You know, Candace, this is the second time I've climbed up there! I'm already down half a dress size! Come on! Hurry! Wait, where are you going? I'm okay, I -- Fie upon you, Perry the Platypuuuuus! Hurry, Mom! You won't believe it! Huh? Ewwwww! Huh! I'm at my limit, honey. Now where is it you want me to see? But-but! You're right! It's beautiful! Happy birthday, honey. Now let's go find your father. Ugh! Did ya like your birthday present? Uh-huh, uh Well, it was definitely better than the gorilla in the cake. Hey, Candace! I had a break, and I, uh, I thought I'd give you this for you birthday. I saw you looking at it in the gift shop. A Mt. Rushmore bobble head. Eh -- You like it? Oh! I absolutely love it Great. I gotta get back. Happy birthday! This was the best birthday ever!"
"And the candidates for what awesome thing we will do today are: Our blueprint for completely food-based water park, your schematic for the tunnel to the center of the Earth, this model for the chamber of invisibility, your other schematic for a microscopic zoo that rests on the head of a pin. Gee. We sure have lots of blueprints, models, and schematics. Hey, Ferb. Summer doesn't last forever, and we've got too many plans for just the two of us. We either need more days of summer, or more of us. What's this? The blueprint for that robot we invented? Ferb, you're a genius! We can make android versions of ourselves! We can make Phinedroids and Ferbots! Hey, where's Perry? Ho-ho-hold that elevator! Agent P, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. He's made 57 phone calls in the past hour. We don't know to whom, or why. No, not to Santa. Agent P, your mission is to find out what Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to and stop him. See, Carl, that's why I don't like using the chimney-vator. Besides, that guy totally owes me a pony from when I was five. Okay, Ferb. The robot building device is almost ready to be activated. Just a couple more commands. Okay, pictures please. Phineas. Ferb. Phineas and Ferb. Here we go. Robot building sequence activated. Wow, it worked! I'm so glad we tried our new android building device instead of using that old dinosaur. Phinedroids and Ferbots, we thank you for being here with us today. Please-- Uh, Ferb, your bullhorn's not on. Please take a blueprint and report to the backyard immediately! Ferb, would you do the honors?  Phinedroids and Ferbots  (Song: Phinedroids and Ferbots)  We're Phinedroids and Ferbots and we're stomping our feet   To the electric, magnetic mechanical beat   We've got light bulbs for eyes and aluminum noses   We're bustin' chillin' moves with our robot poses   Phinedroids and Ferbots   Phinedroids and Ferbots   Phinedroids and Ferbots   Word   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Pick up the phone! Pick up, pick up! Pick up, pick up! Oh, why won't you pick up? Oh, hi, Perry the Platypus. Thank you for using the key I gave you. It's much more civilized than crashing through my ceiling, don't you think? Yes, eh. Anyway, I-I don't know why you're here, but you can tell Monogram that I'm not, like, you know, ""up to anything."" Anyways, all I've been doing is calling my new girlfriend. We're having, what I call, a relationship bump. And now, she won't pick up the phone, and I'm tired of leaving messages. I'm tired! I'veâI've left, like, 57 messages and, I won't leave anymore. It starts to look a little desperate. Hmm? Oh, no, that-that's not an evil scheme. That's just a giant magnet. I'm going to wave it over my girlfriend's house and erase all the messages I left. Because, some of them are really long and rambly. Okay, I know, there's an ordinance against it, but What? Oh, come on, Perry the Platypus! Oh well, too bad for you! Too bad you don't believe in love! Too bad! I'd love to come over and watch you get your ears pierced, Stacy, but my Mom went to Zippy Pics and left me in charge of my brothers. Oh, here they come now, Phineas and Ferrrruh, Phineas? I'll have to call you back! Oh, wait till Mom finds out about Phineas and Ferb, and Phineas and Ferb and Phineas? Ferb? Phineas? Ferb? Phineas? Ferb? Ferbias? Phiniferb? They're my brothers and they're robots! They're bro-bots! What is it, Candace? Mom, I'm in the panic room Phineas and Ferb andâand then Phineas and Ferb andâand robots! Invisibility chamber! Elephants! That's nice, honey. Well, the pictures should be ready soon, and then I'll see the robots when I get home. Bye. Everything will be gone by the time Mom gets home. Isn't that right, Mr. Miggins? Unless Aha! Stacy? Oh my gosh! Guess what? Ugh, Stacy, I can't understand you. Why are you crying? Yeah. Crying, crying, it hurts, right. Got that. Uh-huh, Oh, hi, Mrs. Hirano! What? Stacy got her ears pierced? Gee, what a terrible thing that I had completely no idea about! Anyway, gotta run, Mrs. Hirano. Give Stacy my best! Poor, mixed-up Stacy. Hey, bros. How's the old Chamber of Invisibility coming along? Wow, it works! Well done. Hey, normally I'd be saying that to you, Ferb. Just kinda weird saying it to a Ferbot. Come on! Let's see how the Microscopic zoo is doing. Hey, guys. Mind if we see how things are coming along? Hold her steady, Ferb. Wow! That's amazing! And according to this microscopic newspaper machine, the zoo is really packing them in! Well, I guess we can categorize this project as a success. Hey, that is the best tunnel to the center of the Earth I've ever seen. Boy, I bet that was fun to build. You know, Ferb, even though these robots were a success and completely on model, I kind of miss working on stuff. You know, just you and me. Hey, what's this? Thanks. Hovercraft lounge chair? We were gonna build that next week! Oh, no! The Phinedroids and Ferbots are running out of projects, so they're designing their own! Have we learned nothing from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein? Look! They're starting their own overpriced coffee franchise! That's so '90s. This is terrible! We have an entirely new problem! The coffee's making them go haywire! And that one's having trouble falling asleep. Poor little guy. That's it! You guys are drinking way too much coffee! I'm shutting her down! Well, that's no good. Time to show these robots who's in charge. Uh, Ferb? I think they're in charge.  Bow, chicka bow-wow,   that's what my baby says   Mow, mow--  Oh, there it is. My new girlfriend's house. Now I can erase all those embarrassing messages. And then I can start leaving new ones. What? Perry the Platypus! How did you escape my net? It was the mouse, wasn't it? Get out of the way, Perry the Platypus!! Don't make me drop this giant magnet on you! Well, then, as a lazy tailor would say, ""Suit yourself."" But that doesn't make sense! It's the middle of July! Ho, ho, ho! I'm on a summer run! Farewell, Perry the Platypus! Bah, humbug. So this is how it ends, Ferb. Defeated by our own doppelgÃ¤ngers. If only we had some sort of device that can stop them from I know, I'm just messing with ya.  Phinedroids and Ferbots   We're Phinedroids and Ferbots and we're here to stay   Now our work is done, we're shutting down for the day  Ah! '80s music is so 2002. Mom, mom, mom! Oh, hi, honey. I got some very nice shots here. Yeah, that's great, Mom. Check this out! Ta-da! That's a very nice bag of manure, Candace. What? Aaah! Candace! You made me drop my pictures! Maybe it's not too late!  Our imagination   We're Phinedroids and Ferbots and we're here to stay  Mom, mom, mom! You've gotta see this!  Now our work is done, we're shutting down for the day  I know. I've done this nineteen other times. But this time, I can say with the utmost confidence that there are Phineas and Ferb robots in the backyard! Yes, Candace.  Phinedroids and Ferbots  There are ""Phineas and Ferb robots"" in the backyard.  Word  Who wants to see pictures? Candace. It's a Candroid! Oh, give me that!"
"Behold! Feast your eyes upon the fashion of the future! Hey, Candace. What'cha watchin'? Only the latest looks from the world's greatest fashion designer, Gaston Le Mode. I don't get it. Why would anyone want to wear such goofy looking clothes? It's not goofy! Fashion designers create art. That people live in. Hmm. I never thought of it that way. Ferb, put the Cold Fusion Reactor on hold! I know what we're gonna do today! As now, to my world tour, I, Gaston Le Mode, will be at the Googolplex Mall! today! Stacy, I know what we're gonna do today! testing Agent P, you're early! Carl, cut to close up! Oh. Basically, Doofenshmirtz has been acting up again. He's stockpiling the usual strange and unrelated items. This time, it's copy machine and ink cartridges by the thousands. We need you to find out what's going on right away. Okay, Ferb. If we're gonna tackle this fashion design thing, we've gotta do something really special. It has to be cool. Comfortable. And undetectable by radar. Something that absolutely screams summer! Ah, I think you're on to something, Ferb! Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Ferb and I are working on designs for our new clothing line. Take a look at what we've got so far. Very impressive! Need any help? The Fireside Girls and I are trying to get our sewing badges. Excellent. Let's go!

I have captured the rare ""Duct-Taped Platypus""! You know, like duck-billed and Never mind. Anyway, let me show you my evil plan. I call it the Copy and Paste-Inator! There is nothing I hate more than waiting in line. All the time wasted in stores, and amusement parks, where I could be spreading more evil in the Tri-State Area! I will make copies of myself, and they will do the waiting for me. I know, it sounds a little bit crazy but, look! You're all tied up. And I am stepping into a giant copy machine to make duplicates of myself. Who's crazy now? There it is, The world's most famous runway of Gaston Le Mode. Oh, Stacy, can you imagine the glamorous life of a supermodel? Hi, I'm Candace. I'm sure you recognize me from my countless magazine covers. You know, being a supermodel is hard work; the bright lights, the deafening applause, and all those paper cuts from counting my huge stacks of money. That's why I start every morning with Candace O's. Candace O's. Part of a nutritious breakfast. Candace? What? Candace O's? I really shouldn't fantasize on an empty stomach. Finally! After years of bitter struggle, I, Gaston Le Mode, have created the ultimate design; The ne plus ultra in haute couture. But alas, I cannot find a single model with a neck long enough to complement my design. Sorry, Gaston, but only someone with a freakishly long neck could fit into-- Yes. Everyone is sorry. Where will I find that swan-like neck? Pardon, monsieur, I have great news! A Jerry Lewis marathon on TV tonight? I wish! But no. Better yet, I have found  her! Hi. Look at this! Mon dieu! It is perfection! You are my ""coup de crayon."" Your ""coup de crayon""? Cool! Allez! Allez! Let's get you to makeup. I think I just tanned my eyeballs. Ugh. Now, with a push of a button, I will make history! By the way, do you like my mural? I did it myself. It's a silhouette of me going All right, let's see, now. Oop, needs a little more toner. Oh, copy jam. Uh Why is it when people copy their butts, it comes out perfect? We're almost ready. now, let me see. Oh! Absolutely beautiful! Oh, why, thank you! Now, wait right here while I introduce you to the crowd. Package for Gaston Le Mode. Is it a poster of Jerry Lewis? I wish! All right, all right. But this better be important. Ooh! Gasp! This design! It's comfortable. Cool. And undetectable by radar. It absolutely screams summer! This isn't new! I've seen this before! Do you know who designed it? We did, sir. It's part of the Phineas and Ferb: Summer All The Time collection. C'est magnifique! What are you guys doing here? It's all thanks to you, Candace. We thought fashion design was lame, but you convinced us to give the glamor world a chance. But-but-but-but-- Mademoiselle, Candace, there has been a change in plans. You will put this on, s'il vous plait. I-I-I-- Or you could wear this. Not in this life! Sayonara, amigo! I am so telling Mom, and you guys are so busted! I'm okay! But mademoiselle! Sigh. Okay, ladies, time to get changed and strut your stuff. Thank you, Gaston. (Song: Forever Summer) Ladies and gentlemen, I, Gaston Le Mode, am proud to present this stunning new collection Summer All The Time.

Our designs have really caught on. Everyone who is anyone is now wearing Summer All The Time. Not a bad morning's work. Nice outfit, handsome. You are on fire. When Mom hears about this-- Hey, wait a minute. Where did you get those outfits? These? Why, there're the only the latest hit designs from the Summer All The Time collection. Everybody's wearing them. I mean, jeez, where you been? ""Phineas and Ferb, The Kings of Couture!""? That was fast. Candace? There you are! Stacy? You left your cell phone and your clothes in there. Stacy? You too?! You look just like Ferb! Wow, thanks, Candace! Most of this is a genuine label, but the shoes are total knockoffs. I heard there's a riot uptown at this one store that got a fresh shipment. I gotta run before they sell out. Bye! Oh, and Candace? Friendly tip; That Gaston stuff is so 42 seconds ago. Ugh! You see, Perry the Platypus, a whole army of Doofenshmirtzes! Perfect copies of me! Hiya, handsome. Right back at ya, fella. You, here! Go grab me some corn dogs! Sure thing! You, fetch me some movie tickets! You bet your britches! And you, go ride that new rollercoaster a couple of times, okay? Okie-Dokie! Oh, me too! Go, go, my facsimiles! Go wait in line so I never have to! Geronimo! Whoopee! Santa Claus! Native American icon! Hey, there's the mall! Well, that was fun! Ooh, what fun! Oh, I landed in a puddle. Look at the puppies! Hey, you see what these people are wearing? Some kind of retro pharmacist outfit. I feel so 2 minutes and 5 seconds ago. Hey, let's get back in style! Now I have two! Aren't they adorable? How about you jump, and fetch me something too, huh? Something like, um your doom? Hey, don't hurt the little bunny rabbit. How did you get out of the trash, you drop-out bohemian? I'll be right back. I've got some deleting to do. That's right, tremble, my rejected friend. Oh no! I pushed the ""Delete All"" button by mistake! Look what you made me do! Oh, guess who's paying for this! What is this? Hey, why did you jump out that-- Oh, you clever, little plat-- aah! Well, that wasn't very bright! Now we're both going-- CURSE YOU, PERRY THE PLATYPUS!  Agent P!  Come on, Mom, you want to see something crazy?!! Oh, I think I'm looking at it Look, Mom! You see?!! So you dragged me all the way down here for a pharmacist convention? Face it, mon ami, your designs are so 3 minutes and 37 seconds ago. Oh, well. We had a great time. Hey, Gaston? What's with the new outfit? Are you kidding? No one's claiming this look yet! I have to get out in front of this thing and take credit for it all. That's how you stay ahead in this business, kid. Au revoir! Well, Phineas, I still like your style. Thanks. Hi, Mom! Oh, look. We're all here. Why don't we get some lunch? I think there's a pizza place right over there. Oh, there you are, Perry. Yeah, go ahead. Eat all you want. My dreams are smashed to pieces, and all you can think of is food! Well, just remember, Gaston said I'll always be his ""coup de crayon"". You do realize that that's French for ""pencil neck""?  Phineas and Ferb"

What are you doing here? I just earned my milking badge, and it was so easy. All you do is squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull and squeeze and pull, and- so, whatcha doin'? We're riding ponies, but it makes a feller hanker for the real thing. You know, livin' out on the open range. Ridin', ropin', brandin'.

Then everyone will have to buy aluminum siding from me!  Doofenshmirtz' Aluminum Siding!  You're through, Perry the Platypus. Through! Now it is time for Platypus FlambÃ©! Vanessa, did you bring the little wooden head the termites made? So anyway, I was like, ""You talkin' to me?"" and she was like all in my face, and-- TERMITES! Holy cow! Wow, a stampeding herd of cattle. They're headed straight for town! We've gotta do something! All we need are a couple of horses and we could-- Huh. Let's go! Let's round us up some cows!

Hey, this cow whistle doesn't work! Oh, they're so going to get it. Mom, they're driving a herd of cattle right through downtown. Well, um, I'm a little busy, sweetie. I'm having my hair done at Babs. Oh, yeah, that's perfect! Well, they're coming your way! Quick, look out the window! Do you see any cows? That's cute, Candace. Okay, Babs needs to comb me up.

"So, what are you boys thinking of doing today? Uh we don't know it's too hot to think Yeah, mom and I are getting rid of a few old things at the antique store, but I think I've got just what you need. A snow cone machine just like when I was a kid! How does it work? Well, you pour the ice in here, you give it a crank, add some syrup, and Bob's your uncle;  Snow cones for everyone  Honey? We need to go. The antique show closes in just 12 hours. Okay, kids. I'll leave you in charge of the machine. Be easy on your sister? She's been a bit on edge lately. Wow. Snow in July. That's it! I know what we're going to do today! We're gonna need a lot more ice. What is all this? It's a snow cone! You want some? You mean crushed ice covered in blue carbs? Lame. Maybe Perry wants some. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. I'll get right to it. This time, we're worried about Doofenshmirtz buying laser pointers. I mean, 2 or 3 of them would be fine, but he just put in an order for 18,000 of them?! Only a crazed, evil and diabolical mind would do that. I'm sure you'll know what to do, Agent P. Hey, Phineas. Hi, Isabella. Whatcha doin'? We're making S'Winter! S'Winter? It's a unique and logic-defying amalgam of winter and summer. Why have snow in the winter when it's too cold to enjoy it?

Wait a minute. I got it! with my Melt-inator 6500. There. Did you get it that time? Well Well, I'm not going over it again. Time to get started.

In five four three-- two and a half two and a quarter Is that it? Is that--you're not going to do anything? You're just going to stand there like a dead fish? I'm giving you a chance to do something here! Oh, this used to be more fun. One and a half one and a quarter You know, in some cultures, it's considered rude not to particip-- Ugh! Perry the Platypus? But how did you-- You ate your own heinie? I must aim it quickly! Oh, the kids are going to love this Austrian-style cuckoo clock. Oh, I wish you'd let me buy the large one. Maybe we should pull over and see what's going on. That's peculiar. Good thing we also bought those 4 spare tires, huh? Thanks, Buford. Now, all I need to do is find my Jeremy. Oh no! He's talking to Dee Dee! I gotta put a stop to this! Oh, Jeremy! Wait! Jeremy! Who's that? Why does this keep happening to me? Too scrawny. Throw it back. Wow, Dee Dee! You're really great skier!

Well, hold your horses, kids. It says here that the lead of Cirque de Lune has severe allergy. They're canceling today's performance. Well, that's a bummer! If it's anything like Candace's parsnip allergy, ooh! I don't blame them for not wanting to appear in public. She gets blotchy. Red, weird voice thingy. Not good. Well, honey, looks like that frees you up to join me at the mall. Our trio is recording our first album today. Live at the Squat 'n' Stitch. Hmm mmm, should be swinging. Cheer up, guys.

Good morning, Jeremy. ""Good morning, gorgeous."" Oh, Jer! I'll be right back, Jeremy. What's going on? A circus? Can't they give me a break for one day? This looks great, Ferb. Hey, have you seen Perry? I put on his costume. Okay, Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is buying bio-mechanical equipment and elocution tapes. We- we don't know why. Wh-where are you going, Agent P?

The peeps are gonna love. I'm not even gonna call Mom. No, not gonna call! Candace, honey, listen. I can't talk. We're recording. Is it life or death? Well, no, but I gotta go! Bye! Ughh! Hey-ah, Candace. Oh! Hi, Jeremy. My mom told me to bring over these homegrown veggies for your family. You know, she and your mom are doing that jazz thing today. Thanks! So, circus, huh? Cool. Cool. I guess itâs more of a cirque than a ""circus"".  Aaahhh  ""Good morning, gorgeous."" Oh. Don't you think? What? Don't you think we should sit together, to watch the show? If- if you want to. Yeah, yeah. Uh, Candace, are you okay? Say, are there any wild parsnips in here? Uh, I think that's all that's in there. Later. ""I'm dancing with your wife, pal."" ""You got a problem with that?"" I'm dance ""I'm dancing with your wife, pal. You got a problem with that?"" Oh, yes, that does sound tough. ""Yeah, I ate your last nectarine."" ""You got a problem with that?"" Yes, I ate Perry the Platypus, look. Could- could you use the front door from now on? Could you just do that for me? I mean, yes, ""I ate your last nectarine."" ""You got a problem with that?"" Sounds tough, huh? But not tough enough! You see, ever since I was a child, I had a high, squeaky voice! But not anymore. Behold! The Voice-inator! It bio-mechanically transforms normal air into Doofelium, which'll make everyone else's voice higher, making my voice deeper by comparison. I was going to lower my own voice, but, you know, it seemed like too much trouble. Oh, come on! Of course, it had to be wild parsnips. Allergy pills, allergy pills. Aha! Quick! Before my voice goes through the reaction. Noo! Hey, Jeremy. Wanna sit together at the show? No, no, Mindy can't sit with Jeremy. Gotta stop this, gotta tell Mom! Can't go out looking like this! So, how about us sitting together? 'Scuse me. Oh, it's good, bro. Thanks, but- I promised Candace.  Agent P!  Weâre moments away from Ferb and The Amazing Perry! Hey, Ferb. You guys are up next. Where's Perry? Oh, there you are. And now, for my final trick, I will reattach my thumb! Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme, come on thumb, it's healing time. Let's hear it for Baljeet the Stupefying! But now, prepared to be astounded when The Amazing Semi-aquatic Perry, aided by Ferb, attempts to jump through that hoop into the shallow pond! Ooh! Yeah! Let's hear it for the Amazing Semi-aquatic Perry! Psst. Mom. Candace, have you been near the wild parsnips again? Yes, but you gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing. What is it now? (Song: E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S.)  Those boys are always up to something   And it's bringing me to tears   'Cause just before you get home   It always just magically disappears   Those boys are evil!   But before you get home they somehow always clean up the mess  Testify, Candace! Testify!  Those boys are evil  Let me spell it out for you, Mom  E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!   They built a roller coaster   And a beach in the backyard   Drove cattle through the city   And messed up the boulevard   They took me back in time   When we went to that museum   They built 50-foot tree house robots   But still you didn't see them   Those boys are evil   Their crazy shenanigans cause me all kinds of distress   Those boys are evil   Sing it with me!   (E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!)   I know you think they're saints   But Mom, I'm here to tell   Those B-O-Y-S, they're just E-V-I-L   Those boys are evil   They're making me feel like my head's in a hydraulic press   And that don't feel too good!   Those boys are evil  Everybody!  (E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!)  That's what I'm talking about!  (E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!)   That's right those boys are   Evil little boys!  Okay, Mom, so you gonna come home with me? Are you kidding, hon? Let's do another! Ugh! Perry the Platypus! But you are too late. Wait! Wait, don't touch that! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, I told you! S-Stop it! Stop it! I said, keep your hands off of that. Hey! I got my costume all set. Be sure to introduce me as The Amazing Baggo. You know, we've been thinking about your act and have some suggestions. Modify your torque and reverse the angle of trajectory. I still get to land in the mud, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. I want the mud. Thank you, Django, the Human Pretzel! That's gotta hurt. And now, our next act will catapult through the heavens, and land in a pit filled with the mysterious Aztec mud of doom! Ooh! Hoo! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! He saved me a seat. I give you, The Amazing Baggo! Taa-daa! Hey! Guys, cut it out. Let go! That dude's stealing my act! Hmm. He must have been lighter than we calculated. No! No! This is Buford's moment to shine! Hey, everybody! Over here! Wait. How'd he get down there? Perhaps Buford truly is amazing. Oh, great, now this thing's broken. And now, ladies and gentlemen! I give you our entire cast in our grand finale, featuring The Amazing Perry! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Thanks, Phineas. I thought your circus rocked, Phineas. That was awesome! You're the coolest. That was the best circus I've ever been to. Hi, guys. Mom! Dad! You missed our cirque. Well, it sure looks like you had fun. Who wants to hear my CD? Ooh, I do. All right, come on! Cool. Oh, well, at least I'm back to normal. Hey, Candace. My mom played me some of their CD. Your singing is awesome! How'd you get your voice to sound like that? Oh, same as all the great blues singers, wild parsnips."
"You know, kids, this theater was built over 70 years ago in this Neo-Egyptian style. And apparently, there used to be a whole pharaoh's tomb display with a mummy in a sarcophagus. I mean, you couldn't pick a better place to watch a classic, old mummy movie. There's an inscription here. An an incantation of some sort. ""Owah"" ""Tagu"" ""Siam!"" Dad, where do you find a mummy? Hidden deep in the bowels of the pyramids. Whoops, better put this on vibrate. The incantation will make the mummy come to life and obey your commands. Well, beat me with a chicken. Ow! What?! Ooh! Hey! Stop! It's an--ow! Cool! Hey! Dad, is it hard to get into a pyramid? Yes, indeed. Often you had to negotiate various booby traps that were set centuries before. You ridiculous mummy. You just tripped one of your own booby traps. She's gonna blow! Awesome booby trap! Ferb, we should get our own mummy. (Song: My Undead Mummy)  Ba da ba ba da bah   Let me tell you 'bout my buddy, he's 3,000 years old   He's wrapped in bandages and covered in moldy debris   My undead mummy and me   Mm-mm   If a bully ever tries to poke me in the eye   I'll introduce him to my decomposing guy and he'll flee   From my undead mummy and me   All the kids at school are gonna have a conniption   When they get a load of my funky Egyptian emcee   My undead mummy and me   Yeah   Undead mummy and me  That would be awesome! Dad, can we-- Come on, Ferb. We'll be back before he wakes up. Oh, those bozos aren't pulling anything on my watch! Hey, Ferb. Where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is at it again. It appears that he's purchased a string of odd items. One pound of blood sausage-- Ech that's my grocery list. Here it is. One magnet, one map of the city's drainage pipes and 2 tons of scrap metal. It's in your hands now, Agent P. Over and out. Dive. Dive. Dive. Mr. Employee, sir, where's the mummy exhibit? Manager assistance requested. Yes? These boys want to know where the mummy exhibit is. It's in storage. In the basement. Guess who's goin' to the basement! Uh, excuse me, where are the restrooms? Manager assistance requested. Yes? There they go. Look! Pith helmets! We might be going the right way. Say something pithy. That's it. I'm calling Dad. Ohh! Oh, forget it! I'm going in myself. You hear that? Maybe it's the mummy. Eww. My shoe is all squishy! Uh, Ferb? What are you doing? Woah! Who know looking for mummies would be so much fun? Watch this! Ugh! Hey, Ferb. This was our first booby trap! Woo! Hey, look! The storage! We're here! Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, when I catch them Oh, give me a break! Bubble gum? Oh, really old, stale bubble gum! Blaugh! Phineas! Almost done, just this one more little bit! Perry the Platypus! As usual, your timing is incredible! And by ""incredible"", of course I mean, COMPLETELY CREDIBLE! No use, Perry the Platypus! I made this out of something that cannot be penetrated! Pure evil! And a blend of space-age polymers. You see, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to unleash the water being held by this dam into that huge drainage pipe that leads directly to the ocean. The additional water will raise the sea level by 2%, and then my property one block from the shoreline will become beachfront property! And to release the water from the dam, I've invented a ray, which attracts wood like a magnet attracts metal, The Woodenator! Which was almost complete until you rudely interrupted me. Oh, look at this, Perry. It's my paintbrush. You know, the one you knocked out of my hand a few moments ago. Maybe you want to try to take it back from me now, huh? Huh, you want to try? Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! Owah Tagu Siam! There's nothing down here but fakey promotional lobby junk. For all we know, there might not even be such thing as a mummy. Yeah, I'll be right with you. I mean-- Phineas! Wow, I didn't expect them to be so scary. I mean, can you imagine the angry, twisted soul hidden under those bandages? Phineas! Makes me shudder. But you know what? We came down here looking for a mummy, and I'm not leaving without one. Let's get him! Hey, Ferb. We got our own mummy! Now, how are we gonna get it home? And finished!  Perry!  It is working! It is functioning properly! Perry the Platypus? You defeated my bubble of pure evil? Ooh! Oh, no! What? Is my nose really that pointy? You know what this is? Our second booby trap! There you are, Perry. WOO-HOO-HOO! OH YEAH! WOO-HOO! OH-HO HO YEAH! Hey, Candace, you missed all the fun. Allow me to introduce our mummy. Hey, where's our mummy? Mummy? Mummy?! Well, Mummy has supper waiting for us at home. Candace, why are you all wet? Ugh! You know, mummies had their brains pulled out through their nose. The lucky ones."

I bet the bus driver's gonna be a spaced-out rocker! H-Hello, girls. My name is Dennis, and I'm with the radio station. That is Sir Bacon, the band's mascot. According to our focus groups, girls your age overwhelmingly find that cool. Totally! Whoa, this place is a total pigsty. We love it. Look, Stacy. It's them. Shh  We're on a bus,  They're creating.  between shows.   Here comes two chicks nobody knows.  We're your biggest fans. Yeah, we won the contest. and now we get to hang out with you all day.

Would you like to be part of the music-making process and help us write a song? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Would we? Great. First, we can't possibly write a song in this filth, so you girls can start by cleanin' up the bus. Here you go. All right, Ferb. What should we do today? One - an escalator to the moon? Two - become secret agents? Three - clone giant hamsters. Hey, where's Perry? Huh. I wonder where he goes when we can't find him. What the? Some sort of secret room? Wow. What in the world? A secret underground headquarters, with a particle disruptor and, oh, a hovercraft. Looks like we're gonna be secret agents, huh? When did you find the time to build all this, Ferb? Actually, I -- Hello, Agent P. Hang on, hang on. It's here somewhere on this clipboard from which I have yet to look up. Agent P. ""P"" for Phineas. Nice touch, Ferb. Actually -- Ah, yes, here it is. Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Heh. What a surprise. Building some sort of destructo ray. End of the world. Yada, yada, yada. I'm faxing you the coordinates. Cool. Good googly-moogly! Do-- Carl. Carl, who are those kids? Oh, boy. They're Agent P's owners, sir. Looks like they found one of our secret tunnels. Sweet. We got our mission, Agent F. To the hover jet.  Phineas and Ferb   Phineas and Ferb Is that the hover jet? Oh, no, they didn't. There you are, Agent P. Those boys are in jeopardy and not covered under our hover jet insurance plan. So, stop Doofenshmirtz and protect those boys. Oh, and where are you going, Mr. ""The Boys Will Never Find The Tree Tunnel""?  Phineas and Ferb   Phineas and Ferb  Wow. Laser beam, magnet ray, cup holder. You really thought of everything, Ferb. Actually â Hold that thought. The Bettys' tour bus. Candace is on there. We should go say hi. We're all done cleaning the bus. Oh! We can't get to our song till we deal with our fan mail. Think you could help? Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Great. You can start with this bag. And here's the shredder. Check this one out. Ahem. ""Beloved Bettys,"" ""your band is the biggest, baddest, most bangin' buncha -"" Hey! This is my letter. They didn't even read it. Yeah, but don't forget! We are on the bus helping the band write a song. Yeah. I guess you're right. And you know what the best part is? I haven't even thought about my brothers the whole day.  Phineas and Ferb   Phineas and Ferb  Stacy, look, it's my brothers. Huh? I don't see anything. B-But I could've sworn I â I think the cleaning supplies are starting to get to you. That must be it. That's gotta be it. I'm not even gonna look. Stop Doofenshmirtz. Protect the boys. Stop Doofenshmirtz. Protect the boys. Ah nothing like a nice snack before testing the Destructinator. Agh! Hey, Perry the Platypus, why do you always go for the nose? Here you go. All 250,000 letters opened and shredded. Oh, I just thought of something. The outside of this bus is dirty, too. You know, Stacy, I'm beginning to think that The Bettys have just been taking advantage of us this whole time. What are you talking about? They've been nothing but Look out! nice to us since we got on the bus. Hah-hah-hah. My automatic tennis ball server can go all night, Perry the Plat- Destructinator countdown initiated. Thirty Twenty-nine Twenty-eight Wow, Ferb! this evil villain lair is awesome. Twenty-seven Twenty-six I see you carved it out with dynamite. Twenty-five Nice, nice. Aw, cool! Twenty-four You got an automatic tennis ball server. Twenty-three Twenty-two Sweet. Hey, what's going on, Perry the Platypus? Well, we're finished washing the outside of the bus. It nearly killed us, but we're finished! Great work, girls. You've earned a special ""surprise."" Really? You get to scrub the toilets. What? Yay! Toilets! And be sure to get underneath the lid. Ah, that is it. We're through being your tour monkeys. Right, Stace? Yay, a Betty bowl brush! You've just been using us this whole trip. I mean, is this how you treat your fans? It should be your fans that inspire you to make music. I mean, if you can't see that by now, then can you just drop me off at the next Betty bus stop. Unfortunately, guys, she's right. I feel like a bit of a Betty butt-head. We're sorry for treating you so bad. How can we ever make it up to you? I'll let you bang my Betty bongos. Or play my Betty bass guitar. Hey, guys, that's it.  You gotta bang your Betty bongos   And bring your Betty bass guitar   And with the Betty back-beat  Um you'll go Betty, Betty far? Perfect. That rocks. Hey, girls, what's goin' on? We just helped the Bettys write - Wait a second. Dennis, if you're here, then who's driving the bus? Oh, come on, I'll show you. Autopilot. Wow! Cool. Seven By the way, Six I love that giant ray gun counting down to zero. Five Four Okay, seriously, Three when did you make all this? Two Look, for the last time, I didn't â One He fainted. Ungh, ungh. There's something wrong with The Betty brakes, and I can't stop the autopilot. Grab The Betty emergency brake! The Betty brake broke! How did you make a working destructo ray? Hey, that's the bus Candace is on. I get it. We have to save Candace. What a cool mission.  Phineas and Ferb   Phineas and Ferb  Say, what's all the fussin' about? Curse you, Perry the Plat- Oof. Bleah. Curse you, Perry the Plat- Oof. Bleah. Curse you, Perry the - Bleah. Why did I buy so many mops? Oof. We're coming, Candace. Agent F, activate the magnet ray. It's too heavy. Whatever you're doing is working. Ferb, you designed this thing. Can you give me any more power? Excellent.  Agent P!  We did it. Our sister's safe. Brilliant! You did it! Agent F,  Phineas and Ferb  let's head home. Way to go, Candace. Now we are your biggest fan. How can we thank you? Well, you can come to my house and clean up my room. I'm serious. How about you sing with us onstage instead? It's a deal. I can't wait to get home and tell Mom all about our secret spy adventure. Hey! What's goin' on? It's like we're stuck in some sort of tractor beam. Hi, Phineas! Seriously, Phineas, what are you doing? That, my friend, is classified information. Oh, what a great day. Not one phone call from Candace with some crazy, unbelievable story aboutâ Mom! Mom! Guess what Ferb did! He made a secret tunnel and a spy headquarters and a villain's lair and a hover jet shaped like Perry! Tell her, Ferb! Actually, I -- Wait a second. Why are you two soaking wet? Ah! I give up! We fell in Isabella's pool. Well, that I believe. Oh, hi, Perry. I wonder how Candace is doing. Oi! We'd like to bring a very special person to the stage. She's not only Bettys' best fan, but she also saved all of our lives! Ladies and gentlemen, Candace and her best friend Stacy! (Song: Ready for the Bettys)  You gotta bang your Betty bongos   And bring your Betty bass guitar   And with the Betty back-beat   You'll go Betty, Betty far   So drop your boring baggage   And come with Missy, Tink and Crash   There's a Betty bandwagon    (There's a Betty)    (bandwagon)   Goin' to a Betty bash   (Goin' to a Betty bash)   (Get ready for The Bettys, ready for The Bettys)   (Get ready for The Bettys, ready for The Bettys)   Ready for The Bettys   (Get ready for The Bettys, ready for The Bettys)   It's the best thing you can do   (Best thing you can do)   Get ready for The Bettys   'Cause The Bettys are ready for you  What do you think your brothers are doing right now? Who cares?"
"Okay, Isabella. Say ""Aaaah"". Ahhhh Oh, good. The swelling has gone down dramatically. I'll be back to check on you soon. So, Isabella, what'cha doin'? Oh, just recovering. But I finally got my tonsillectomy patch. We just came by to cheer you up. And to see if you're feeling well enough to go on with our event. Sorry, guys. My throat still hurts like crazy. That's cool. Sorry, gang. We've got to postpone the Trojan War reenactment till further notice. You know, the best part of getting your tonsils out is that you get to eat all the ice cream you want. Really? Mountains of it! We could have the biggest ice cream sundae ever made! Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today! First, we gotta draw up some plans. Wait. No time for that. You go to Blueprint Heaven, I'll head home and meet the delivery guy. Hello? Blowtorch City? Yeah, I'll hold. When are they letting you out of this joint? This afternoon. Perfect. We should have just enough time. So, I'm going out, Vanessa. Remember, you're at your Dad's this weekend. Great. A whole 48 hours of evil. Vanessa Doofenshmirtz, your father is not evil. We just didn't get along. We wanted different things. Was one of those things ""to be evil""? Because he's evil. He's not evil, honey. No one's evil. No, Mom. He's evil. You don't notice about him? He has evil schemes. Normal people don't have schemes of any kind. And there's this secret agent that always bursts in, and-- I think you're being overly dramatic. Mom, I'm not being dramatic. Dad builds evil contraptions every day. Wait. Let me check on something.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorpora--  Yup. He's even got his own evil jingle, right on his answering machine. Listen! Hello? Oh, hello, Heinz. Dad! Why'd you pick up? You always let the machine get it! Well, I heard it ring the first time, so I was standing right by the phone. Oh, by the way, could you pick up some blueprints for me on your way over? Thank you, sweetie. Great. Now he wants me to pick up some evil blueprints for his latest evil contraption. And as soon as he's done building it, I'll have proof! I'll call you, and you can see for yourself. So, you need plans to build a giant ice cream sundae maker, do you? Hmm! I'm not sure we sell blueprints for that anymore. Whoa! Hold on, sweetie. No need to get upset. I'll go check in the back, okay? Okay. Let's see. Giant sundae machine. I got a yogurt machine! How's that sound? Yeah. I don't care for yogurt either, baby. I'll keep looking. You're in luck. I found one! Now, what do you need, sweetie? I'm here to pick up an order for Doofenshmirtz. Oh, yes. Your Daddy just called. Hey, how's it goin'? Can you bring it back here? Thanks. That's great. You're not going to believe it, Stacy. But when I turned around, Jeremy was standing right behind me. Well, actually he was sitting, and he was a couple blocks away, but he was right there! Keep it coming! Keep it coming! Okay, stop. Great. Stack 'em over here. Um, Stace? I'm going to have to call you back. And that's the last of it. Eh, just need you to sign right here. Say, aren't you a little young to be using titanium plating and an industrial arc welder? Yes. Yes, I am. I get that a lot. Phineas, you know I'm in charge, right? Well, isn't that just if a satellite crashes into the- No, no, no! When Mom's at her cooking class, I'm in charge. Now, what are you up to out here? I'd like to tell you, but it's gonna be a big surprise. Hey, wait a second. Have you seen Perry?  Perry!  Sorry to wake you, Agent P. Looks like Doofenshmirtz is getting sloppy. He sent his daughter right into our sting operation and purchased blueprints for a Space Laser-inator. We intend to pass him fake plans, but due to a rookie error, and by ""rookie"", I mean, Carl. Sorry. My bad. The plans he received are real. Terrifyingly real. Again, I must apologize, I was in character-- You better step on it, Agent P. Before it's too late. Can you give me a hand unpacking this stuff, Candace? I'm not gonna help you. But as soon as I figure out what you're up to, I'm calling Mom! Okay. Say hi for me! Bonjour, class. Today, we will be making crepes Guilbaud. Candace, is everything all right? Well, if you don't even know what he's doing, how do you know if it's a problem? Is there something you would like to share with the whole class? Sorry, sir. Candace, I'll talk to you later, okay? Ugh! I'm keeping an eye on you. Hey, Ferb. You got the blueprints? Excellent! Isabella's gonna love it! Perry the Platypus, you-- you're early. I haven't even started yet. My- my daughter should be here any minute with the blueprints, though. Oh, there she is. Good morning, Vanessa. You remember Perry the Platypus. Yeah. Hi. Perry the Platypus, why don't you have a seat in my waiting area? Read some magazines! Sorry they're all in Spanish, I-- I steal them from my neighbor. You know, evil never rests. So, Dad. This plan, it's evil, right? Oh, yes. Yes, it is! It's nice to see you taking an interest in the family business. That's all I need to know. I'm in class now, Vanessa. I have to go. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Yes, Vanessa, I'll leave my phone on. Teenagers. Ugh. What are we making this week? I think it is crepes, but you know, I can't understand his accent. (Song: Busted)  I can see the things you're doing   And you think that I'm naÃ¯ve   But when I get the goods on you, she'll finally believe   She says it's all just drama   But every bubble's got to pop   She's gonna see just what you're doing   And then you're finally gonna have to stop   Don't think you're gonna win this time   'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime on you   I'll get ya   (Yeah!)   I'll get ya   (Yeah!)    And when I do, you're gonna be busted   (Busted!)   I don't wanna put the hurt on you   But you better believe me when I tell you   That I finally got the dirt on you   You're busted   (Busted!)   Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light   This is how it's gonna be   When she finds out that I was always right   You're busted!  Oh, Perry the Platypus! It's finally ready! Too bad you can do nothing but watch as I prepare to launch my Space Laser-Inator! Wow, I bet that thing must be really evil, huh? Vanessa, take a look out that window and tell me what you see. Uh, not much. Exactly! Ever since that stupid billboard went up, my panoramic view is completely ruined. I used to have this perfect vantage point for enjoying the delicious misery of others. Oh, man! Oh, man! You owe $78,000. Oh, man! But, after I launch this baby into orbit, my problem will be solved! Then, I can go on to eliminate all the other annoyances that make my skin crawl! Like, uh Nature! Beauty! Aw. Morning talk show hosts! Yeah! Soon, there will be nothing that can withstand the wrath of Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Doctor? Since when are you a doctor? They don't just give these out to anybody, you know. Anybody with 15 bucks, they do. That's enough looking! I'd love to debate you, but I have some pressing business to take care of, like remaking the Tri-State Area in my own, twisted image! Oh my gosh! This is worse than I thought! Oh, Dad is going to be so busted.  Busted  Now, carefully pour the batter. Slowly, slowly. Oh, for Pete's sake! Vanessa? Candace, this better be important. He's doing what? Honey, are you sure you're not exaggerating just a little bit? Well, it's not that I don't believe you, honey But every time I race home, I find out everything is just fine. Yes, I'll be right over. I'm on my way. Teenagers! Tell me about it. Now, to launch my creation and begin my reign of terror! Evil terror. Huh? Ah. Ugh Well, this can't be right. Get ready for a giant sundae! Well, this can't be right. Lemme see those blueprints. Oh, wait a minute. Those are the plans for a Space Laser- -inator, apparently. I was wondering what that thing was for. That must be the laser. It's a good thing we didn't attach it, huh? Mom! Mom! Hurry! Come on, come on! Hi, kids. How are you doing? Huh? We're just about to make a nice handmade sundae for Isabella. Oh, that is so sweet! Come on in the kitchen. I'll help you with it. C-Come on, Mom! Hurry! See?! Evil! I told you! Hmm. Um, that's not evil, dear. A bit much, perhaps. Heinz, what is all this? I thought you were lactose intolerant. I am! Oh I'm paying you way too much alimony. And what's over there? That is no way to treat your pet! But Mom, that's a secret agent! A secret agent? He's just a little platypus. They don't do much, you know. Wow, guys. This is amazing! I was afraid you guys were gonna go overboard and build some giant sundae contraption or something! Actually, we were gonna do that, but we accidentally build a space laser instead. Ferb, you're usually so focused. How did you get those plans confused? Hey. How's it goin'? Hey, Ferb. Snap out of it. What happened back there? I was weak.  There's a new cop on the beat,   and I'm bringin' down the heat   My eyes are wise to all your lies, 'cause you're not that discreet   And I don't care what you heard   'Cause there's one 6-letter word   It's gonna set me free   Gonna set me free   It starts with a ""B""   Starts with a ""B""   Goes ""B-U-S-T-E-D"", you are busted"

And the best part is Jeremy works right across the aisle! I can watch him make hot dogs all day. Any moment now, Jeremy will look over and notice how cute I look. Candace, you're not wearing your Shimmy Jimmy hat! Candace? Is that you? Candace, look! You have your first customers! Oh, and don't forget to do the laugh! Go on! Welcome to the Har D Har toy store. Har Har Har Har. Oh, honey. I'm so proud of you. I'm just going to leave the boys here to browse while I make some exchanges. Back in a bit, working girl. Could we hear the laugh again? Don't bug me, you insects. Ahem. Candace? Let me introduce you boys to Shimmy Jimmy, the must-have toy of the century. It's totally awesome. Seems like that would get old really quick. Oh, like you geniuses can make a better toy. I know what we're doin' today. Okay, then. What we need is a toy so stupidly simple So basically bland So idiotically uncomplicated That it can do absolutely anything. Hmm. Say, where's Perry? What'd ya got? Ah, there you are, Agent P. We suspect that your nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, has been pilfering bricks from buildings across the Tri-State Area. Animals are rioting, convicts are escaping from the zoo. It's chaos. You've got to stop him, Perry, before it all falls down.  Perry!  As you can see, our sales have plummeted. Kids just aren't interested in climby toys anymore. Yeah, but we've always made climby toys. I mean, who could forget Climbin' Simon? Or what about Ascendin' Brendan? And then of course, there's Ladderman Larry. Or the classic Climby Jaimie? Stop it! Ow! What we need is a fresh new toy! Greetings, movers and shakers. I'm Phineas and that's Ferb. We have a toy for you. Hold on there. Aren't you a bit young to be toy designers? Well I don't think so. And now, it's fresh, it's new, it's incredibly hip. Soon to be the biggest hit of the new toy season, Perry the Platypus. Uh What does it do? That's the beauty part. It does absolutely nothing! Now it can be anything we want! Like an airplane Or a race car Or maybe a bucking bronco. It can even turn a mean Tango. Just a minute. We could promise the moon without really promising anything. I love it! What, are you all crazy? It's just a a stupid block of wood and it doesn't do anything!!! I love it. What are we talking about? Glad we're all on the same page. Phineas and Ferb, we're gonna produce your toy that does nothing. I'll put both of you in charge, and double your salaries. What'd ya say? Actually, we've never made a salary. Well, then, I'll triple it. Here's the factory, boys. This is where it all happened. Wow. Somehow I never pictured a toy factory's being this boring. Time for a makeover. Boys, I got an angle on our new toy you are going to love. Perry the Atomic Super Platypus! He's just a platypus. Right. Got it. Just a platypus. You're gonna flip for this. Are you ready for The Mad Marauding Marsupial of Death? He's just a platypus. I don't get why we have to wear these silly outfits. I like it. It gives me purpose. Huh? This is a toy factory. How'd this chocolate river get here? Who the heck are you guys? We are the Ba-dink-a-dinks! You set us free when you remodeled the factory. We'd been trapped in the basement for years, making foam peanuts and snipping the tabs off of plastic. We will now lay waste to the surface dwellers! Okay, then. Carry on. This one is dynamite. Secret Agent Perry the Platypus. Huh? Do you have anything else? Um, no. No-no, I don't. ""Perry the Platypus Inaction Figure."" ""It does nothing""? That's it!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Annex!  Well, if it isnât Perry the Platypus. You've arrived precisely on cue. Allow me to explain. Voila! A precise 1/100th scale replica of the Tri-State Area! You'd be surprised how much free time I have. Now, with all the bricks that I've eh collected, I'll construct the Great Wall of the Tri-State Area, thereby cutting off the citizens from the rest of the world. But how do people get in and out the city, you ask? With this official Doofenshmirtz-approved toll booth. I- I haven't really worked out a price point yet, but it won't be cheap, I can tell you that. I want a green one. Here you go, little angel. Yay! My own Inaction Figure! Candace, come on out. You're kidding, right? Fantastic! You look like number one. I feel like number two. That's the spirit! Now, go out there and bring us some customers. Oh this is so embarrassing. I'm just so glad that Jeremy's on break. If he saw me in this thing, I think I'd plotz. S'cuse me, sir? Oh Candace? Wow, in that outfit, I couldn't even tell you're a girl. Har Har Har Har. See you later, Candace. This isn't worth $3.50 an hour. I'm here live with Phineas and Ferb, creators of the international toy phenomena, Perry the Platypus Inaction Figure. Exotic backgrounds not included. Simply amazing! What was your inspiration? Well, we have a pet platypus named Perry. Oh, hi, Candace. Nice suit. Now, as I was saying, he's a platypus. He doesn't do much. Oh, I should've known those two were behind this! Time to call Mom! What is it, Candace? Okay, Candace. Calm down. I'll come by and see you as soon as I'm done with the exchanges. Perry the Platypus? How did you escape? Hmmm I probably should have used cement. Ah, no matter. Youâll never catch me. You can't stop me, Perry the Platypus! You can't stop me with a million Perry the Platypuses, because I am unstoppable! Finally! I lost you, Perry the Platypus! I am free of you! Get 'im off of me! So, did you see the game on Saturday? Yeah, a real nail biter. Shoo Shoo Go-go away! Wow, that was just disturbing. No. no! No, no! Get 'im off of me!  Agent P!  So, Ferb, I think the sale projections are Hey, people! I thought we agreed we weren't gonna do this. How many times do I have to say it? He's a platypus. They don't do anything. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Wait, wait! Where are we going? Is that sea water I smell? I hope I'm not on a boat, 'cause I get seasick. So, how does everyone like my new suit? Excellent! Fantastic, J.B. Do you lose weight? You look really great, J.B. Um, that man isn't wearing any clothes. There you are, Phineas and what's-his-name. Perry the Platypus is a smashing hit! So, what's your next big idea? We're going home. But-but-but-but Why? You're at the top of your game. You've got your whole career ahead of you. It's supper time. Mom's makin' fried chicken, but thanks for a great day. Oh, that's just great. Any of the rest of you geniuses have an idea? I found this in my office with a pile of shattered glass, J.B. What's this? A brick? That's brilliant!  Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick   Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick   It's fun.  Now, who would buy a brick for a toy? It does absolutely nothing.  Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick   Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick   It's fun.  Sweet! They have it! Oh wow, they got the brick! The brick! It's fun! The brick! These brick toys are selling like pancakes. Candace, keep up the great work! One at a time. One at a time! You'll get your bricks. Hey, Candace. The things they make us wear, huh? At least you don't have a weenie on your head! Ahh He understands me.  Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick   Brick, Brick, Brick, Brick    It's fun."
"Hey, we're almost there. What's the first thing you're going to do at camp, Buford? Find a nerd, take his underpants, and run 'em up the flagpole. I don't think Camp Phineas and Ferb has a flagpole. Then I guess I'll just find a nerd and take his underpants. You may have my underpants. They just got very messy all of a sudden. Thanks, but it ain't the same if Buford don't rip 'em off of ya. How about you, Isabella? The Fireside Girls and I are going to work on our accomplishment patches. Yeah! Accomplishment patches! How about you, sis? What's the first thing you're gonna do at camp? First of all, it's not camp. It's just Grandma and Grandpa's cabin, and it's boring. But we made T-shirts. Secondly, I don't like the outdoors, okay? I don't like bugs. Phineas, are you even listening to me? I seem to have misplaced my ant farm. Mom! Yes, Candace? Do I have to go to Grandma and Grandpa's? Oh, I think it's rather sweet that Betty Jo and Grandpa Clyde invite you kids and all your friends every year. But I'm not a kid. I'm a young adult. Can I do something with you guys? Of course you can, dear. You can join us at the antiques symposium. This year's keynote address will debate Shellac vs. Lacquer. Woo-hoo! I'll take one of those shirts. Where are they? Look. Oh, here they come now. Hey! Hiya, Grandpa! Well, hello Phineas! You haven't changed a bit! Grandpa, that's not me! That's Perry! Huh? Huh? Oh, oh right. Looks like I need to get my glasses fixed! With the glasses. And Turbo Ferb-o! Put 'er there Put 'er there Put 'er there Put 'er there Put 'er there Put 'er there Still a man of a few words, I see. Well, actually I-- So, where's your sister? Hello? Hello?! What do you have to do to find a cell signal in this place? Candace? Oh, hi, Grandma. How can you stand living out here in the middle of nowhere? Oh, come on, honey. It's not so bad. You'll see. Alright, nature lovers! Time for vittles! ""Vittles"" is Grandpa-ese for ""food"". Hey, where's Perry? Sorry about that, Agent P. We haven't used that tree slide in years. Not since I was at The Academy. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz seems to be up to something, Agent P. He's hold up at his evil woodland retreat. Your mission is to find out what he's up to. Please, Agent P. Be careful. The Academy. But I don't want to go to The Academy, Daddy. I'm not your father, and it's been decided. I love you, Daddy. Oh, pesky bugs! I am trying to tan here! Hey, Candace. I thought I'd bring my favorite camp counselor of Phineas special. That is just a glass of limeade. And I am not a counselor. Hey, Phineas. The girls have finished pitching the tents. Can you sign here for our Tent Pitching achievement patches, please? Sure thing. What are you doing? Well, as camp director, I'd say I'm ""doing my job"". Gather around, kids. There's an old legend Well, not that I believe it, about the Sasquatch. A race of giant, hairy creatures living up here in these very woods. If my memory serves, I think there was a song written about it. Really? Do you remember any of it? (Song: He's Bigfoot) He remembers.  He's Bigfoot   He's Bigfoot   He'll eat you with his taters and his greens   He's Bigfoot   He's Bigfoot   'Cause to Bigfoot you're a fleshy tangerine  Oh no!  He goes barefoot, so he's always free to stomp ya   He carries a big stick so he can whomp ya   Sharpens up his teeth so he can chomp ya   So I think you'd better flee, 'cause I'm telling you that he's   Bigfoot   He's Bigfoot   He bathes in the water that you drink  Yuck!  He's Bigfoot   He's Bigfoot   So watch out, 'cause he's closer than you think  Boo! One more time!  He's Bigfoot  Ugh!  He's Bigfoot  Am I the only adult here? Why can't my grandpa act his own age? I think you should act your age. And have a little fun. Sorry, Grandma. There's all sort of fun a young adult can have here. You've just gotta use your imagination. So, come on! We're making stick figures! Out of real sticks! Grandma! All right, all right, all right. We'll think of something else. Tonight! It all happens tonight! Perry the Platypus! How unexpected! And by unexpected, I mean Un-Unexpected. What are you doing here? This is my week off. Oh, that. Well, uh Well, I suppose you should know I- I've started dating again. I met someone online. I know what you're thinking, but- But we're meeting tonight for the first time, and I'm-- Oh, you gotta go. Oh no, Perry the Platypus! She can't see you! She doesn't know I have a nemesis! Oh, and I- I don't have time to destroy you. Uh You could be my pet. You think you can act like a mindless animal? Oh, uh, hello. I'm looking for Strudelcutie4427. Wow, aren't you the cutest little thing? Are you my date for this evening? No, no! Uh That would be me. I'm Strudelcutie4427. Nice to meet you. Uh This is my pet platypus. He was just going outside for a nightly walk. Oh Could I hold him a little longer? He's so sweet. Oh, yes. Yes, you are. Well, I guess he can stay a- A little bit, but You know what they say. Three's a crowd and whatnot. Ahh. Just how I like 'em. You just earned your marshmallow patch, my friend. Ugh. So, Grandpa, what should we do now? Tell scary stories? I got one! Oh, Phineas. You always start. Why not give another kid a chance? Yes. How about you, Candace? No. Okay. Anyone else? Uh, Baljeet? W-What? Uh Uh Oh. Thank you. Well, this is a story about a kid who comes to this country, and goes to camp. He like, has to share a tent with a bully. It's really quite terrifying, actually. Quite terrifying. Take it away, Phineas. All right, Grandpa. I've got a good one. It's about Bigfoot! Bigfoot? Bigfoot? Bigfoot? Grandma! Sorry, dear. You are the cutest thing I've ever seen. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You know, some people say we look alike. Uh, I don't think so. Not at all. No, not at all. Uh, darling, you haven't even touched your cucumber water. I made it especially for you. You know, Strudelcutie4427 was a lot less needy online. Oh, yes.. Yes Ah I'm going to go get some air. lot less needy online. Oh, I don't even like cucumbers! Why do I always get the crazies? And they say that when the moon is full, like it is tonight, Bigfoot will return, and exact his revenge. Huh? What was that noise? I really should have packed more underpants. That sounded like screaming children! But it's not my birthday. You guys crack me up! Phineas, what are you talking about? There's no Bigfoot! It's just Ferb in the tree! Look! See? They're just dummies! Nice rope skills, my friend! Then who is this? Ah, it's an inflatable Ferb. Sounds like Ferb too. That was awesome! What was that? You better stay here while I investigate. Oh! Bigfoot? Huh? What? Bigfoot! No, no, no! Wait! It's me! Ugh! Strudelcutie4427? Whoops.  Agent P!  Whoa! That was a good one, boys. You sure got us. I can't take it anymore! It was just a joke, Candace. You're a joke, Phineas! Candace, honey, calm down! Calm down? Calm down?! I don't wanna calm down! But your screaming might attract a real Bigfoot. A real Bigfoot. Oh, give it a rest, Phineas! Everyone knows that there's no such thing as a real-- Oh, fine. What's this one made of? Popsicle sticks and glitter? Uh, no. Huh? Looks like we fooled 'em, ma! Did you see the look on their face? That was so cool! Oh, good one! And you got an inflatable Grandma, too. Oh, I'm not inflatable. I'm your Grandma's identical twin. I only come out once a year when these two want to prank someone. Well, back to my closet. See you next year, Lorraine. Oh, come on. Let's round up those scared kids and have some hot cocoa. It's not the worst date I've ever had. There was that one that kept stabbing me with a fork. Get this off of-- I sure got you guys! You should have seen your faces! Only unsophisticated, immature brains would believe in monsters. Yes, it takes a mature adult, such as myself, to know that there's no such thing a-as BIGFOOT! Oh, I do not believe her one bit. Too much overacting. Yeah. Yeah. Mmm-mmm I smell ham. Mmm-mmm Hey, Perry. Why are you all covered in lipstick?"
"Hey, boys. Hi, Mom! What are you up to today? We're racing our remote-controlled monster trucks. I don't see any monster trucks. Oh, that's 'cause we rigged them to go light-speed. You know how those stock motors are. They never give you enough action. You boys have such active imaginations. You must get it from your father. Let's see Green goes to number 5. I'm painting! Oh, Charlene's here. I'm off to my cooking class. Bye, Mom. Final lap, Ferb. Aw! Another photo finish. I'm never watching closely enough to see who won. Despair speaking. Care to explain why ""Despair"" isn't picking up her cell phone this morning? Because of a little thing called PARALLEL PARKING! See, yesterday, Dad was teaching me how to drive Okay, Candace. All you have to do is park between this plastic trash can, and that plastic trash can. So I put it in reverse AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! Then Dad said my parallel parking needs a little work! It means I'll never get my driver's license! I'm such a loser. Oh my gosh, Ferb. I can't believe it! I've never noticed how soft our carpets are. But more importantly, we have to help Candace get her confidence back. Any ideas? This is perfect! The Candace Crusher! Nothing says confidence like a monster truck. Hey, where's Perry? Oh, hey Agent P. So, get this. I got this memo this morning on Doofenshmirtz. And somebody abbreviated his name and it Guess how they wrote it. Doof! The Doof! It's times like these when you really appreciate having a cool name like Monogram. And Carl. I already told you your name's not that cool. Anyway, do your stuff, Agent P, and stop that DOOF! Take it all the way back. Keep it moving. Waterfall, the orange cones, parts, left to the garage Bleachers, right Um Giant Baby Head Anywhere's good. Oh, hey boys. Dad, you might want to wipe the queen off your face. Oh, oh, yeah, thanks. CRIKEY! A monster truck! Yeah! Isn't it sweet? It's to help to teach Candace how to parallel park and stuff. We figured out if she learned how to drive on of these monsters, she's got the confidence to drive anything. Oh yeah. Brilliant. But I better check with Mom about this. Uh, hello honey. Yes, yes. Oh gosh, I love you too, darling. Uh, are you aware the boys have a monster truck in the backyard? Honestly, you're as bad as Candace. Okay, okay. Just checking. It's a go, boys! I'll get your sister! Ah-Ahem. Madam Flynn, I have told you a hundred times, NO PHONE CALLS IN CLASS! Hello? It is for you. Hello? Mom, I think the boys are building a monster truck. Um Honey, I gotta go. No B-Big chef. Big meat tenderizer in front of mommy. Bye bye. Oh, this seems like a good idea. I gotcha. Oh, what's the point? I'm never gonna be able to parallel park. Don't worry, sis. It's just to build your confidence. Okay, don't forget to buckle up. But we can't drive here. It's just the backyard. Meap!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Gentlemen, I have a unique investment opportunity for you. I'm sure you're all aware of the popularity of monster trucks, right? But you know, they are not really monsters, just big, stupid trucks! So I came up with my own line of monster trucks! Behold! Very evil, don't you think? And there's even one that looks like me! Look, look! We'll corner the markets! And just to be sure, I have created, The Monster Truck Away-inator! You know, to do away with the competition. But is it safe to use? Sure, let me demonstrate. See? Doesn't affect people at all! Except maybe a little swelling. But don't worry, it will go down. You know, probably. Now, watch what it does to this miniature monster truck! I don't know where it sends them, maybe another dimension. Of course, that was just a toy. Let's try it out on a real monster truck. Huh? Which brings me to my next invention. The Monster Truck Locate-Inator! Perry the Platypus? Guess what? That's not a monster truck locate-inator at all! It's a Chinese platypus trap! I got you. Here's the real Locate-inator! Okay, now, where is the nearest monster truck? Yes! Right here in Danville! Okay, everybody, get in me and we'll go. Are you sure you want to bring him? Perry the Platypus? Well, yes, of course. He's my nemesis. I have to show him everything. Good afternoon, Danville! Dink Winkerson here, and this is little Isabella Garcia-Shapiro from Fireside Girl Troop 46231. And she got a little announcement to make. WEDNESDAY, WEDNESDAY, WEDNESDAY! GIANT MONSTER TRUCK RALLY RIGHT HERE IN DANVILLE! CANDACE THE CRUSHER TAKES ON ALL COMERS! BE THERE, BE THERE, BE THERE! WE'LL GIVE YOU THE WHOLE SEAT, BUT YOU'LL ONLY NEED THE EDGE! Thanks, Dink. All right, Candace. All you have to do is maneuver through this traffic cone course. Oh. So I put it into drive AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! I don't think we're gonna get a deposit back on those cones. Okay, Candace. All you have to do on this test is go up this gentle incline. Dad, you look nervous. No, of course not. I- I have full confidence in you. Phineas, this incline is getting kind of steep! Don't worry, Candace. It gets steeper! Next, the break portion of the test. I can't believe I did it! Oh, well done! Okay, left on to Maple Drive, and here we are! Oh, great. There's no parking spot! I should've invented a Parked Car Away-Inator. Oh, ya! That is something that I would buy. Oh, look at him. He's got a big head, suddenly some sort of marketing genius. Oh, well done, Candace! Let's- You're Candace the Crusher? Yes? I heard pigs could fly, but now I've seen everything! That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't have to, I got a monster truck! Woohoo..! Candace, those dudes need to suck our mud! (Song: Truck Drivin' Girl)  Now let me tell you all the story 'bout a truck driving girl   In a custom made monster truck she took for a whirl   That little speed demon gonna be a star   With her learner's permit and an adult in the car   She may be out for a long, but she can't parallel park,   She's a truck drivin' girl!   She's a truck drivin' girl!  AAH!  Well, someday she'll get her license and she'll have it all   She can pick up her friends and take a drive at the mall   That little redhead gonna rock my world,   She's a truck drivin' girl!   She's a truck drivin' girl!   She's a tire-spinning,   gear-grinding,   clutch-burning,   backfiring,   paint-trading,   red-lining,   overheating,   throttle-stomping truck drivin' girl!  It's a photo finish! The winner will now be decided by our final event, The Parallel Parking Challenge! Parallel parking? You're goin' down, girlie! Check out the finesse! AAH! AAH! AAH! See, Candace? AAH! Even a trained professional has trouble from time to time. AAH! ARGH! AAH! AAH! Now, I want you to just relax, AAH! ARGHH! and park this car! AAH! ARGHH! AAH! Yes! Perfect! Time for some Monster Truck Away-Inating! Okay, steady now Here we-  Perry!  Perry the Platypus? But-but, but how did you get out of the Chinese platypus trap? Ancient Chinese secret. I don't remember inviting him. No, wait! Perry the Platypus! No, no! Please! Don't turn the dial to the ""Doofenshmirtz mobile and Evil Investors away-inator""! I have to rethink my dials. Hey, look guys! My swelling went down! Oh, shut up. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! I did it! I'm proud of you, darling. You really made them eat mud. Gotta admit it girl. You're good. Hey, aren't you Buck Buckerson? The famous monster truck rally promoter? That's right. Me and my boys are headed to a rally up in Badgertown. Only the track up there ain't near as good as this one. You can have ours. We're through with it. That's mighty nice of you. Haul her away, boys. Thanks for the ride, Charlene. Hi, Mom. Candace, why on earth are you all covered in mud? Because She's a tire-spinning, gear-grinding, clutch-burning, backfiring, paint-trading, red-lining, overheating, throttle-stomping truck drivin' girl. And I learned how to parallel park! Great!"
"Mi Mi Mi Mi Mi   La La La La La La La  Ferb. Are you hearing what I'm hearing? Candace singing. Early in the morning.  Mom, it's your birthday   Thanks for all the care and love you give  Yeah, yeah, that's all right. I like that.  Mom, it's your birthday  It's Mom's birthday! How can we forget Mom's birthday? Where have all the days gone? We can't forget Mom's birthday. We can't forget Mom's birthday. We can't forget Mom's birthday. We can't forget Mom's birthday. We can't forget Mom's birthday. Isn't there something I'm supposed to remember? We should do something nice for Mom, what with Dad being out of town on business and all. Okay, Candace. Once from the top.  Mom, it's your birthday  I got an idea.  Eggs and bacon   Oh, yeah  Mom, let me be the first to say-- Happy birthday, Mom! We brought you some periodicals, like Mom Daily, Mom Weekly, Mom Bi-weekly, and just the way you like it, half-caff, double-frapp, mocha choco-latte mezzo-espresso. Oh, wow. You boys really outdid yourselves. Au contraire, ma mÃ¨re. I declare it's our mission to give you best birthday ever. So relax, enjoy some reading, and no peeking till we come get you. Oh, those boys are too much! Mmm. Oh, I smell eggs and bacon. Thank you, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro! We appreciate you helping us out. Ooh. Another call. Talk to me. Buford, my man. Uh, hold on. Needs roughage. Thanks, Buford. Glad we can count on you. Hey, Candace. Wanna man the omelet station for Mom's birthday? I'm doing my own thing. Well? Aren't you going to ask me what it is? Sure. Uh What are you doing? It's a secret. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. He's hiding out in his mountaintop castle laboratory, where he's purchased some suspicious items over the internet, including a giant metal sphere, and two animatronic wax robots. You know, like they have at theme parks. Gosh, those things give me the creeps. The way they're all robotic and waxy?  Perry!  The boys may have won breakfast, but wait till Mom sees this homemade birthday card. ""Love, the child who loves you most, Candace."" All right, Mom. Almost there. Oh, this is so exciting. Okay. You can look. Happy birthday! What a beautiful breakfast. Mom? Made with love. And sweat. And by ""sweat,"" you mean hard work. Uh Sure. Mom, this may not be a fantastic breakfast, butâ Ladies and gentlemen. Mom's birthday card! ""To Mom""? Heh. It may be big, but bo-ring. Oh, boys. I can't believe you two made it yourselves. Ah, The Unicorn Whisperer, the feel-good movie of the year. And soon it will be gone. Oh, no! It's Perry the Platypus! Ha! I fooled you, Perry the Platypus! I'm not really scared! I'm not scared, because I have a new security system. Voila! Do you like them, Perry the Platypus? Get him. I got them very cheap from a wax museum that went bankrupt. I love it when dreams fail. As you know, I've been trying to take over the Tri-State area for quite some time now, and I realized this Tri-State area's filled with things I detest. So many things, like like blinking traffic arrows. Stop blinking at me, telling me where to go. Point. Point. Point. Ooh, I hate you. Let's see What else? Ear hair. Oh, yes, I've always hated you. Pelicans. Terrible creatures. Whatâwhat are you, a bird or a garbage disposal? And musical instruments that start with the letter ""B"". You get the idea. It's a long list. I've been working on it for a while. Anyway, I realized I should build something that would make all those awful things disappear. Behold, Perry the Platypus! Shrinkspheria! You like it? I was going to call it a Shrinkinator, but I've done that whole ""inator"" thing before. It's just been done to death. Bring him over here! I want to show him how it works. I enter the name of something I hate. P-E-L-I-C-A-N. Pelican. And Shrinkspheria homes in on its molecular structure and then turns all the particles into sparticles, thereby shrinking it into a teeny, tiny speck so small I never have to see it again. So good-bye to you, Perry the Platypus. Enjoy your presidential suite! Glad you like the card, Mom. It's a simple postmodern fusion of origami and pop-up. Yeah. And just wait till you see your present. Okay. Stay right there. Oh, I hope the boys don't go overboard with my present. All I'd really like is that dress from that cute little sundress shop. You mean that really cute one with the polka dots? I know what she wants. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress. Hey, Perry the Platypus! Say goodbye to blinking detour signs! Forever! Yes! I'm an evil genius! Now I have to wait 4 minutes for it to recharge, which isn't so bad. I think I'll go with pelicans next. What do you think, Perry the Platypus? Pelicans next? I cannot tell a lie. I'm melting. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress. Cute little sundress! Yoo-hoo! Mr. Pelican! I'm going to shrink you now. Wh- Wh-why is it not working? Something's blocking the- Hey! Hey, everybody! Look what- You got to be kidding me. Our first supermodel sports a chic, stylin', notcouture sundress, perfect for our birthday queen to sip iced lattes, while enjoying a faboo day in the sun. Huh. Well, they have the wrong sundress. It's okay, but it is not as great as this. Aah! Aah! Candace? Candace? Where'd she go? Ow! Oh. Oh, well. Good-bye to musical instruments that starts with ""B""! Wait a minute! I can still give Mom the one thing the boys can't! The gift of music! Played on my friend, the bass. Huh. Oh, well. It's a good thing I play the banjo! It's a good thing I play the bassoon! It's a good thing I play the bugle! It's a good thing I play the bongos! Five minutes later. It's a good thing I play the balalaika! It's a good thing I play the bagpipe! I should've manned the omelet station! Candace, honey. Come join us. The boys have put together a little video. Yeah. Here. You can do the honors. Fine. Whatever. Happy birthday, Mom. From birth, to young adult, to mid-sized adult, from the 80s, to the 90s Mom enchants everyone she meets. But who is this person, we call Mom? Uhh A house divided cannot stand. Yeah, what he said. Oh, Perry the Platypus! You melted their wax, but you can never melt what's inside pure evil! Ehh. I should have seen that coming. We can't seem to get a break. Your breath smells like candles. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Isnât this wonderful? Yeah. Really great. But the true testament, to what a great Mom you are, is that your daughter would take the time to write this song.  Mom, it's your birthday  (Song: I Love You Mom)  Thanks for all the care and love you give  Nice song, sis.  Not to mention the meals   And times I get kind of nervous  Come on!  And forget to tell you how I feel   (Shoo-be-doo, shoo-be-doo)   I'm a little high-strung   (Doo-doo-doo-ahh)   It's just because I'm young   Mom, I adore ya   And I'll do anything for ya!   Although my brothers make me frantic   With every single crazy antic   And when I'm bouncin' off the walls   You're the one who stays calm   (You're the one who stays calm)   Because you love me for who I am   I'll always love you, Mom!   (Ooh)  What a beautiful song, honey! Oh, I only wish Dad could have heard it. Well I really wanted you to have a happy bir- Oh. I almost forgot. We set up a satellite up-link with Dad. Ooh, a satellite up-link? Hello, love. Happy birthday. Hi, honey. I miss you. And you're missing the festivities. The boys threw me the greatest party. And Candace wrote me this really amazing song. Can you hear me?  (Ooh)  Oh, hey, Perry. Where have you been? You missed all the fun."
"What a beautiful summer day. Do you boys have anything exciting planned? We're either gonna make this nuclear-powered submarine or this incredible shrinking ray. But for some reason, Ferb and I can't seem to make up our minds. Well, I've made up my mind. You two have the most wonderful imaginations. It's real, you know. What's real, dear? The submarine? The shrinking ray? They're really gonna build that stuff. Well, actually we haven't decided yet- Anyway, when I try to bust them, everything will just magically disappear. Always happens. You'll see. Well, you won't see. I'll see, trust me. As usual, the imagination in this room is astounding! Hello? Hi, Candace. It's Jeremy. I was wondering if you wanted to go for a walk today? I would very much enjoy going for a walk. Wherever shall we go? To my uncle's restaurant? Yes! That sounds doable! Why not pick me up around noon? Okay! Goodbye. Oh, my gosh! Guess who just called and asked me out on a date! Who!? Jeremy! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Hold on! Let's conference in Jenny! Okay! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! LET'S GO OUTSIDE! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Submarine. Shrinking ray. I just can't make up my mind! What'cha doin'? Oh. Hi, Isabella. Hi, Phineas! You remember Pinky. Oh, yeah! Hi, Pinky! Hey, check out my new sash! It's got all my accomplishment patches sewn onto it. See? Wow. That looks totally irreplaceable. Oh no! Pinky, I need that sash for a Fireside Girls ceremony this afternoon! Don't worry, Isabella. We'll get your sash back. But how? It's in Pinky's stomach. Hmm. Ferb, you're a genius! Hey, where's Perry? Agent P, thanks for coming. It's Dr. Doofenshmirtz. He's been hiding out in the old abandoned vacuum cleaner factory. You know, at building across town with the- giant vacuum cleaner on top? Man, I can't believe that place closed. I blame the Internet. Your mission, Agent P, is to find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to, and then stop him. So, how are we gonna retrieve my sash? Here. Ferb made this multimedia presentation. We shrink the sub down with Ferb and me in it and put in Pinky's dog food. After he eats us, the sub extrudes two mechanical arms, which fold up the sash to microscopic size and pull it into the sash storage unit. Finally, we pilot up into the mouth and have Pinky drool us out. Easy. Gross. But cool! But Pinky will eat anything but dog food. He likes grilled cheese sandwiches. Not a problem. You make the sandwich. We'll make the sub. Okay. A subatomic shrinking module, hydrostatic ballast tank, and a case of AA batteries. Sign here, please. Aren't you wondering if we're a little young to be building a submarine? Yes. Yes, I am. Yeah. We get that a lot. One grilled cheese sandwich, hot off the Oh, cool! Hey, Isabella. You're just in time. You guys amaze me. When we're inside, we'll activate the shrinkage. You take care of the rest. Check it out, Pinky. Your favorite. Ready? It worked! All right, Pinky-Winky. Time for some cheesy-weesy! No! Pinky! Chasing the cat is so cliche! You're better than that! Listen up! Jeremy will be here any second and I wanna tell you Ooh, grilled cheese. My favorite. Might as well eat now, so I don't look like a pig on my date.  Doofenshmirtz's Abandoned Vacuum Cleaner Factory!  Perry the Platypus? I You know, we always do the same thing. I have a scheme, you try to stop me, I trap you, I tell you my scheme, you escape Then we fight, and I'm defeated. Let's mix it up a little. Let me tell you what. I-I will tell you my scheme first, and then I will trap you! What do you say, huh? Yes, this is much better. Okay, so here it is. The Make-Up-Your-Mind-inator! You know, when you're waiting to order a pizza and the person in front of you can't decide on a topping. Ohh. I hate that! I hate it! I will destroy anyone who can't make up their mind! Destroy anyone who can't make up their mind! Ferb and I can't seem to make up our minds. Should I go with Make-Up-Your-Mind-inator? Or is that too-on-the-nose? It's funny. Now I can't make up my mind. Oof! Perry the Platypus! What are Well I- I did not see that coming. Calling headquarters, huh? Hmm. Yes, you- you didn't even give me a chance to trap you. See? I was going to put you in that giant snow globe over there. Now I have to return it. Agent P? What's wrong? Oh! You caught Doofenshmirtz, huh? That's weird. Usually he traps you, then you escape and then We mixed it up a little! Hang tight, Agent P. Backup is on the way. I mean, it would be, if we had some. Uh I'm gonna make some calls. Oh, yeah. This is good. It worked! Pinky's chewing! Prepare for swallowing! Jeremy's here! Whoa! Whaah! Wow. Pinky's neck is really long. Hey, Candace. Hi, Jeremy. Whoa! Excuse me. We did it, Ferb! We're inside Pinky. How about a little road trip music? (Song: Hemoglobin Highway)  Just the two of us   In an esophagus   It's time to get this mission rollin'   Don't wanna make a fuss   But that was the pancreas   Look down before we reach the colon   On the hemoglobin highway   (Hemoglobin)   In a mini submarine   (Mini submarine)   If you're goin' my way   You'll see what I mean   Hang a left at the spleen  Now to find that sash. Hey, tacos! Ah, tacos. You know who makes the best tacos? Mom. These kind of remind me of the ones we had for dinner last night. Hey, Pinky didn't have dinner with us. Wait a minute. Candace's favorite cereal? Hello? Phineas? Where are you? Pinky ran away, and when I came back, the sandwich was gone! Okay, let me call you back. Yeah, we're inside Candace's stomach. That's creepy on so many levels. This backup of yours is taking forever. I have a travel chess set in my bag over there. Do you play chess? Over there, actually. I tricked you, Perry the Platypus! Do you like my Any-Flat-Surface-Magnet-Belt? It sticks to any flat surface. Guess what? There's no travel chess set in this bag, either. There was one of these in both bags, so whichever one you chose, you would be stuck. Just like I'm stuck right now. What, uh Wh-What time is that backup getting here again? Oh, here we are. Let's tap into Candace's nerve center so we can see what she sees. Ears. Eyes. Look, we're getting an image. She's on her date with Jeremy. That means we're on a date with Jeremy. Again, creepy on so many levels. Oh, excuse me. My phone is ringing. Hello? Candace, I know this sounds weird, but Ferb and I shrunk down in a submarine. We were in that sandwich you ate, and now we're in your stomach. Are you wacko? Don't call me! Wait! We can prove it! How do we prove it? Whoo! Yeah! What is going on? Hey. Monkey bars! Do you still get sick when you hang upside down? Yeah. Why? Sorry, Candace. We have to help Isabella. So Arms and legs! Candace, are you okay? Never better. Never better! Phineas, I'm going to It's working! All right! Yeah! What happened? Candace, are you sure you're okay? Come on, my uncle's restaurant is right over here. Any other ideas? I-I have a tickle in my throat. Stay right here. I'm gonna go get some water. We did it! You guys are so busted! Oh, hey, Candace. Hello? Mom. Phineas and Ferb built a SHRINKING SUBMARINE! Candace, I'll see it later. Right now, I have to swing by Jeremy's uncle's restaurant and pick up some sandwiches for your father. Perfect! Farewell, Perry the Platypus! Mom, Mom, Mom! Submarine! Submarine!  Perry!  See? It's a submarine! Urgh! So imaginative. Hey, I've been lookin' everywhere for you guys! Pinky threw up and I got my sash back! Hmm. Gross. But cool. Speaking of pets Where ya been, Perry? Candace. I have a surprise for you. Check it out. Sandwich menu? ""The Candace Special""? Oh, you had a sandwich named after me? Yeah. Grilled cheese. 'Cause I know it's your favorite. Shall we eat inside? This is the end of a perfect day. My very own sandwich! I can't wait to try it! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Hello? Where am I? Oh, it's all gastrointestiney in here. Hmm Brain. I'm inside a dog! Perfect. Now I can pee all over the Tri-State Area! Oh, what am I doing with my life?"
"Hey, you know, kids, these fossils are of creatures that lived right here in Danville millions of years ago. Lucky these things aren't still here today. No. Lucky would be if we weren't still here today. Oh, look. This T-Rex footprint was found not 30 yards from this very spot. Hey, it says here that this fossil was dug up right near our very own neighborhood. Didn't we have a dog named Bucky who got sick and went to live on kindly Old Man Simmons' farm? Oh. Uh Let's move on, shall we? This next exhibit is kindly Old Man Simmons Hey! Who's up for milkshakes? Hmm? ""Gadgets Through the Ages"". This exhibit was made for us, Ferb. Hey. What are all those people looking at? And this is one of our most curious pieces. A time machine made by a 19th century scientist named Xavier Onassis. But, of course, we know he never finished it, or else we'll still see him here today. Right? Right? Eh? Anyone? All right. Moving on. A time machine, huh? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Right. Let's fix us a time machine. Hey, where's Perry? Uh, Agent P? Hey, it's me. Carl. The intern? We got a bit of a situation here. Major Monogram has been frozen like this pretty much all day. Solid as a rock. Oh, sorry. Any-who, if the Major were able to, I'm sure he'd say, well ""Ouch"", first of all, am I right? But seriously, I'm sure he'd say ""Doofenshmirtz was up to something, and you should get to the bottom of it"". Am I right? Sir? I'm gonna take that as a yes. Good luck, Agent P. And this fossil is the only representation of the glichiolous species from the Jurassic era. How exciting. Ugh. Why do I have to endure this suffering while Phineas and Ferb are off who knows where doing who knows- What are you doing? Fixing a time machine. You broke the exhibit?! I'm telling Mom! What are you doing? You broke the exhibit?! I'm telling Mom! Cool. Hi, guys. Whatcha doin'? We're fixing this time machine. Isn't that kinda impossible? That's a possibility. Well, good luck. My troop and I are going to the local fossils exhibit. Catch up with you later! Bye.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incoporated!  Oh! Take that! And that! Perry the Platypus! I, uh I, uh Uh There's no one else here. I mean W-What are you doing here, Perry the Platypus? Heh. I have mice? I- I wouldn't go in there if I were you! Perry the Platypus, I swear, I've never seen this, uh, secret agent looking panda before. Well, there's a panda in my closet and a panda paw print on my cheek. B-But it's not what you think. We're not enemies. We're- We're  just bad friends. Mom! Mom! Evidence! Whoa, whoa, whoa, there, little missy. There's no yelling. Didn't you see the sign? Oh, that's right. It's a museum. I wouldn't want to WAKE anyone up! You got tossed out too, huh? Yeah. For yelling. You yelled in the museum? That is hardcore. Why'd you get thrown out? Stole a pterodactyl. It's not like I yelled. You gotta help me sneak back in! Please, please, please! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay. I've got a plan so ingenious it involves military-like stealth, precision and timing. We got us a yeller at Quadrant 6! Hi- Hi, Jeremy. Oh, hey, Candace. They have a Slushy Dawg here. Yeah. It's new. I'm so bored. Feels like by the time my shift is over, I'll be a part of the fossil exhibit. Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! Oops, gotta go. That was close. Okay, Ferb. We're ready to test the circuit quanta stabilizers. Testing. Mom! Did you hear something? Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! Yeah. Um Where did you run off to? What do you mean? I didn't go anywhere. Right. Testing #2. So, can I get you something? Part of the fossil exhibit, that's a good one! We are a go on #3. Hi, Jeremy. Candace, you're really kind of freaking me out. Say, aren't you a little young to be working in a museum? Yes. Yes, I am. Well, it's nice to see young people taking an interest in history. Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all? Actually, there seems to be a piece missing. It looks sorta like this. Have you seen it? Hmm. Looks familiar. I'll keep my eye out for it. Sorry, Perry the Platypus, I didn't want you to find out this way. Okay, here it is. Peter the Panda is my new nemesis. We met at an evil genius expo in Seattle, and, well me and Peter, we just instantly disliked each other. And then, he foiled a little evil scheme of mine. And, I didn't plan it that way, it just happened. Peter the Panda, be a dear and go get us a soda. It's not that I don't hate you anymore. I do, but look. I- I just think it's time for us to, you know, take a break and start fighting other people. Thank you, Peter the Panda. I'd offer you one, Perry the Platypus, but I- I think it's better if we just have a clean break. Don't you? So, where was I? Oh, yes. So, Peter the Panda, you think you have outwitted me! Perry the Platypus, you're- you're making this harder than it needs to be. Go on, it's over now. Oh, that? That's a Freeze-Inator ray but, uh, I- I don't want to explain it again. I just gave the whole spiel to Peter. But, don't worry. He's stopping me. He's- He's got it well in hand. Goodbye. Curse you, Peter the Panda! You? I thought I tossed you out! Hey, what's this? Stealing part of a display is very serious. Almost yelling serious. And last, but curcuitly not least. Huh? Mom! Can I get you boys anything? Anything at all? Well, uh Yeah. Like I said before, we seem to be missing this piece. Hmm. Looks familiar. I'll keep my eye out for it. Ah! Here it is! Cool. Thanks. (Song: When We Didn't Get Along)  Without your schemes, my life it seems, is empty   I spent all my time keeping you from doing wrong   You were my only nemesis, I foiled your plans, but still I miss   The moments when we didn't get along   So search your heart, please Dr. D,   and I am sure that you will see   That you were always meant to be my only lifelong enemy   But now you're doing battle   with a panda from Seattle   I'll miss the moments when we didn't get along   Ooh  Darling, can I have $5 for the audio tour? Sure. Amateurs. Mom! Phineas and Ferb are in the ""Gadgets Through the Ages"" exhibit, and they're doing something to this chair thing, and Ferb is using this hose thingy that makes sparks, and he's wearing this mask that goes like this! And you have to come with me right now! Please, please, please! Well, if it's that important to you. Really? Did I ever tell you how much I love you? They're this way! Hurry, hurry! They're in here! Ferb, you got that thing working yet? Gotcha! You guys are so-o-o-o-o bust- Candace, how am I supposed to keep up? Candace? Well, it's working now. What? What's working? Take me home, take me home, take me home! Sure, Candace. No problem. This could be a problem. Whatever you do, keep your voices low, and no sudden movements. Wow, it worked. Let's go save Candace! Follow that T-Rex! Wait. We don't have helmets. We hope you enjoyed your audio tour of Fossils. If you'd like to take the tour again, just flip the tape. I can do that? Hey, I don't remember seeing this part. Hm Well, it looks just like Candace. Hey, honey, you've gotta see this! Look, I'm telling you, it's the most peculiar thing I've ever seen. It looks just like Candace. Hmm. That's not very nice, dear. I'll hide in the bush! Hey, Candace. What are you doing? I'm running for my life! What does it look like?! Well, hop on! Hit it, Ferb! Fantastic motoring, Ferb! Why am I wearing a turtle on my head? Hey, what a stroke of luck! Look! And how is this better? This one's a vegetarian. So it's not gonna eat us? Nope. Woo-hoo. Uh, excuse me? Yoo-hoo. Down here. Hi. We're made of meat, ma'am. Thanks. Wow. Isn't this amazing? You guys better figure out a way to get us home. 'Cause if we don't get home, I can't bust you for this! Hey. That looks familiar. You guys. Come here. Anyone recognize that bad boy? Uh That looks like a footprint from the beast that tried to eat me alive. And, it happens to be the very same footprint that's fossilized in the museum. Great. But how does that help us get out of prehistoric times? Watch and learn. It looks like a T-Rex footprint to me. Hey, look! A message! ""Time machine destroyed! Stuck in 300 million BC. Please help! Signed Phineas, Ferb, and Candaaaaace."" Our friends need our help. Please turn to the ""Time Travel"" section of your Fireside Girls handbook. Hey, has anyone seen Perry?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ow! Easy, easy, you're tearing it! Eh Oh. I remember when this picture was taken. It was the happiest day of my life. It was the day I decided get my picture taken. But, it wasn't till I got outside the photo store, that my life changed forever. I had a feeling that there was someone hiding behind the mailbox. I had a nemesis! (Song: My Nemesis)  (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   I used to sit alone doing evil all day   But now I think that someone's gonna get in my way   Yeah, there's someone in my life   That doesn't want me to exist   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   And I feel fine, 'cause I got a nemesis   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   Now I hate him, and he hates me   What a wonderful animosity   Besides his hat, he wears no clothes   Now I have someone to oppose   'Cause I have a nemesis   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   (My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme)   My neme neme, ooh, my neme neme neme  Wait, I-I I forgot what comes after the bridge. Peter the Panda, what are you doing? You're disassembling my Freeze-Inator ray? While- While I was singing about my feelings? You! You're dead to me! You're dead to me! All right, team, that should do it. Pile in. Okay, let 'er rip! Hold it. I think I know what the problem is. It says ""Tie Machine"". He left off the ""M"". Ohh. Today on Dr. Feelbetter, I want to be your nemesis again. And now, Dr. Feelbetter! You ever wonder what would happen if you lost your nemesis? Well, that's precisely what happened to our first guest, Perry the Platypus. Perry the Platypus, share with us your thoughts. Uh I-I'm sorry, he does- He doesn't actually talk. Ah, I see. And this communication issue is what led you to replace Perry the Platypus? No, o- Of course not! Uh Peter the Panda doesn't take either, he's a- He's a panda bear! I see. Because he's an animal, he doesn't talk. Of course not! What kind of an evil scientist are you? Right. Doctor, what if I were to tell you, Peter the Panda is backstage right now. What? Peter the Panda is here? Ooh. Perry the Platypus, I- I had no idea. I- Ladies and gentlemen, Peter the Panda! Ugh! I can't believe I am just stuck here! I-I can't believe I'llâI'll never to get my driver's license, or- or-or wear my dream dress to the prom! And most of all, I can't believe I'll never see Jeremy again. How long are we supposed to just sit here?! I don't know. Ferb and I have decided to use this time as an opportunity to practice patience. Lovely. Well, I suppose things can't get any worse. Oh, look. The world's first bad hair day. So, Phineas, where's the rescue party you sent for? Hmm. It just occurred to me that I may have misspelled ""Time Machine"" on the plans. Well, I hope that's not going to be an issue. Apparently not. Hi, guys. What'cha doin'? Just waiting for you. Hop in, guys. We're saved! You know, there's an ""M"" in ""Time Machine"". Yeah. Sorry. Take it away, Ferb. You mean to tell me you built a time machine that has to be plugged in?! Oh, put a sock in it! Candace, no sudden movements. What does it matter? We're all doomed anyway. I mean, where are we supposed to find electricity in DINOSAUR LAND?! The museum will be closing in 10 minutes. Yeah! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah! Woo-hoo! That was awesome! Boy, that was a close one. Lucky for them I was there or we'd still be trying to escape that- T-REX! Thank you, Peter. I've been meaning to stack those chairs. Dr. Doofenshmirtz, tell Perry the Platypus how you feel. Perry the Platypus, I- I'm so sorry I hurt you. When I wasn't actually trying to hurt you. If you give me another chance, I promise to hurt you in the right way. With cartoonish physical violence, and elaborate traps constructed out of strange thing I purchased over the internet. What do you say? Aw. That is sweet. Well What do you say, Perry the Platypus? Aw. Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Now! I can't believe that worked! You don't know, Peter the Panda thought that he disassembled my Freeze-Inator ray, but that was just a decoy! Bring in the real one, boys! You see, my plan was simple. Assemble all the best secret agents in one room, and then turn them all into statues for my giant chess board! Hit it! Mom, Dad, don't go in there! There's a live tyrannosaur Ha! she's got your imagination, hon. Uh, Perry the Platypus, you don't mind if I say goodbye to Peter the Panda, do you? I- I-I just feel weird how everything happened. Hey, uh Peter the Panda. I just wanted to let you know that uh I feel- Ow! Well, how about we go check out that scary dinosaur? No, no! Don't go in there! He's going to eat you, I'm telling you! Well, you're right, Candace. It's very lifelike. Mwah! Wait! Where's my remote? Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad. There you are, Candace. History is so exciting. We actually went back in time. I know exactly what you mean, Phin. These exhibits make the past seem so real. Hey, there you are, Perry. All right, historians. Let's head home. Hey, Candace. This fossil is my favorite in the museum. Huh. That's funny. I never knew cavemen wore safety helmets. Fossils, da da da. Fossils, da da da. Fossils, da da da. Fossils, da da da. Fossils, da da da. Fossils"
"So, you really don't know what day it is? I told you, it's Thursday. It is more than just another Thursday, Lawrence. Then it must be The day I realized how cute you are when you're angry? I'm going to get my hair done. I'll be back at 2. Maybe you can figure it out before I get home. Oh, I wonder what all the fuss is about. Ahem. Huh? June 15th. It's your wedding anniversary! Ooh! Egads! Wait, wait! I can fix this! Gee, Candace. Isn't this a lot of fuss to make over a date? Are you kidding? Anniversaries are very important. Take June, for example. On the 3rd, Jeremy spoke to me for the first time back in the 7th grade. May 6th, he brushed up against me in the hall. Oh, and April 3rd, that's the day he laughed so hard, milk came out of his nose! He looked so cute. Hey, Dad. Can we help? Well, I'm afraid not, unless you can perform miracles. What's your budget? Tell, me boys. What would you get a special woman on her anniversary? Oh, please! Asking two boys for a romantic advice? Now that's just pathetic. Don't you and Mom have any cherished memories? Oh! Yes. I've got just the thing in here. He keeps his treasured memories in a toolbox. Your mother's favorite band. Love HÃ¤ndel. I bought us tickets to their farewell concert. Oh, we were a handsome, stylish couple back in those days. So which lucky couple out there will be caught in our flamin' hot spotlight of love? I'd never so much as held your mother's hand, but that night, I made my move. Well, don't just stand there, man. Kiss her.  You snuck your way right into my heart  Truly that was an evening I will never, ever forget. But you did forget, didn't ya? But Love HÃ¤ndel broke up years ago. Some things can never be recaptured. That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make it their best anniversary ever. Hey, where's Perry? Ah, there you are, Agent P. We've learned some alarming information. Several suspicious items have been purchased by the Doofenshmirtz Corporation. They include, an industrial-grade air compressor, Get right on it.  Perry!  For a moment, their ballad, Snuck Your Way Into My Heart, snuck its way to number one and stayed there for 11 consecutive minutes. But whatever happened to Love HÃ¤ndel? The band was riding high, but tastes were changing, and Love HÃ¤ndel found itself playing smaller and smaller venues. Pressures from a dwindling fan base caused in-fighting among the band members. Lines were drawn. Then lines were crossed. Eventually the lines were erased, and the piece of paper crumpled up and thrown away, and Love HÃ¤ndel was no more. Years later, Love HÃ¤ndel's music continues to warm the hearts of an appreciative public. Bass player Bobbi Fabulous now runs a trendy hair salon, drummer Swampy works quietly at the public library, and only lead singer Danny is still a player in the music industry. I've seen that sign. It-It's down on Main Street. We'll get him to sing for Mom! Ready, team? Team? Oh, no. I am not getting involved in one of your crazy schemes. Come on, Candace. For true love? Ugh! Candace, you keep Mom away from the house. We'll go get Danny. Ooh. ""Love on the Run. Romantic solutions for every occasion."" Hey, Dad. We're gonna throw a rock concert in the backyard, okay? Yes. Well, be careful. Come on, Ferb. Oh, hey, Stacy. I can't talk right now. My brothers and I are reforming Love HÃ¤ndel for a concert in our backyard. Love HÃ¤ndel? That's my mother's favorite band! Hey, Mom. Did you know Love HÃ¤ndel is reforming? Love HÃ¤ndel? Love HÃ¤ndel? Love HÃ¤ndel? Love HÃ¤ndel?  Doofenshmirtz Abandoned Self Storage!  Oh, Perry the Platypus. Q-Quick! Could you hand me that staple gun right over there? Thank you. Ahh So, what do you think? It's for my daughter Vanessa's birthday. I try to throw her a party every year. I know we usually go about our daily battle of good versus evil, but instead, could you maybe help me set up the party for my little girl? Please? Danny's Music Shop. Ferb, this looks like the place. No. No. No. No. No! This is a rock 'n roll guitar. For rock 'n roll music. Whatever. Okay, run. The power of rock too scary for you, I see. Uh, you must be Danny of Love HÃ¤ndel, right? Always an honor to be recognized by my fans. Hey, aren't you a little young to be fans of Love HÃ¤ndel? Yes, we are. But our parents aren't. Don't you think you were a little tough on that guy? Oh, he'll be back When the spirit calls him! Wow. You sure are passionate about rock 'n roll. Well, it's only my life. Sit down. I'll tell you a little story. (Song: History of Rock)  When I was a boy, down in South Illinois,   I heard a man playing blues, oh, what a wonderful noise,   He had an old guitar, but not a dollar to his name,   Making music so sad, but he was happy just the same,   He gave me a wink, and said: ""Son, let me share the news,   If you want a happy life, you gotta learn to sing the blues!""  I asked my daddy for a guitar,   Oh, I begged and I plead,   I said I wanted to play the blues, and he just nodded his head,   But daddy said when he was my age,   ""Boogie-Woogie"" was the thing,   Just take the blues, throw out your hip, and add a little swing!   Ah, music has the power, that without it, he'd a-sworn   That he'd a never met my mom and I'd a-never been born  So what's this? This is Psychedelia. It's where the guitar solo came from. No, I mean what's with all the colors? I have no idea.  Ha!   I kept learning   All the powers my guitar had   I made it go ""walka-walka""   'Till it was so good it was bad   Just make a face, and stomp that bass,   You can make that rhythm bump   But this is just the blues, but in a way that makes you wanna shake your rump!   I can make you clap your hands   I can make you get up and dance   If you wanna shake your booty, my friend,   You gotta give the funk a chance!   Metal!   Pound your fist in the air!   Metal!   Bang your head full of hair!   It's crunchy, and it's nasty, full of bad attitude,   Your parents will think you're crazy, your neighbors will think you're rude   Believe it or not, it's all the blues again   You just add a little fuzz and turn your amp up to 10!   Music has the power to change your life,   Forever!   Wow!   Shuh!  Thank you. Thank you. You know, our parents fell in love at one of your concerts. See? Music does change lives. Well, how'd you like to sing for our parents' wedding anniversary? That'd be righteous, dude. But good luck getting the other guys. Who can resist the power of rock 'n roll? ""Love HÃ¤ndel reunion."" Rock on, little dudes. The spirit of rock 'n roll has called out to me! I knew it. That'll be $1,800. Oh, thank goodness you're here. Love On the Run at your service, my friend. So, what did you forget today? Anniversary. Ooh, the big one.  It's your anniversary  That's your Love-O-Gram. Oh, yeah, your anniversary  I'll get the rest of your stuff out of the truck. Ooh, that was exhausting. Oh. I have one last surprise for our lovely guest. This will be the grand finale of Vanessa's party The world's largest firecracker! All we need now is a victim to be tied to the rocket so they'll explode up in the sky in a grand display! So Here's the awkward part. Uh And when I say ""awkward,"" I mean for you. Not so much for me. So, I wonder what new look Bobbi has envisioned for me this time. You know, he was in my favorite band. Love HÃ¤ndel. Love HÃ¤ndel? He doesn't like anyone to talk about it, though So, don't bring it up. Uh, I gotta take this. How's it going? We got Danny. Now we're gonna convince Bobbi Fabulous. And if we can't Well, Ferb's got a backup plan. Wait. Bobbi Fabulous is Mom's hairdresser. Where are you right now? Walking in the front door of Bobbi's salon- Oh. You doofuses! Mom's gonna see you and wonder what you're up to! You gotta keep Mom distracted while we talk to Bobbi. Say, Mom. Maybe we should get you ready for Bobbi while Candace, what are you doing? Uh You look like you need some conditioner! Candace! Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up! Do you have an appointment? Uh, no. We're here to see Bobbi. You know, the bass player from the band Love HÃ¤ndel.  I'm fabulous  Fabiana, who are these little people? I don't know, sir. You're a mess. And you Feudal Europe is so last month. We're trying to get Love HÃ¤ndel back together. Oh, for heaven's sake, talk to the hand. Secretly I'm very lonely. You see, the first time my dad kissed my mom was at a Love HÃ¤ndel concert. And it's their anniversary- B to the O-R-I-N-G. Not yet, Ferb. Anyway, you don't need me. I just play bass in the background. Nobody even remembers me. Are you kidding?  I don't need to tell you what you already know,  (Song: Fabulous)  You're the one with style, you're the whole darn show.   The other guys play their instruments fine,   But next to you, their looks are a crime.  Candace! Hot towel!  Well, they say true beauty, it comes from within,   But you have to be comfortable in your own skin.   So I exfoliate with this exotic cream,   Just look at me, I look like a dream!  You have to admit, he looks pretty darn good. Candace, what is going on? Dry cycle!  You're the one, yes, you're the star   We need you back on bass guitar   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)   You're the one we all can see,   It's all about you   (It's all about me!)   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)   You're fabulous  (I'm fabulous!)   You know, no two people are like each other,   So don't be a lookalike copying another,   Unless, of course, you're copying me,   'Cause that gives you individuality!   Nice 'do! But back to the matter at hand.   So what do you say, are you back in the band?   Well, maybe if I can find my old leather.   Dude, we're getting the band back together!   You're the one who sets the bar,   The Hairdo King, the Fashion Czar,   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)   You're fabulous   (Oh, I'm fabulous.)   You're the one we all can see   It's all about you   (It's all about me!)   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)   You're fabulous   (I'm fabulous!)  May we take that as a yes? Hello? Isabella? Hey, Phineas. What's up? Guess what band's getting back together. Love HÃ¤ndel? Uh Yeah. How'd you know? It was the lead story on the 5 o'clock news. Let me guess. You guys need a stage, right? Yeah. Can you help us out? We're already on it. Who would have thought that a drummer from a rock 'n roll band would end up in a place so quiet? Say Could it be? Pardon me. Would your name be Swampy, ex-drummer for the band Love HÃ¤ndel? That, my friend, was a past life. The name's Sherman. Why you asking? Because they're reforming for one night only. It's a celebration of our parents' anniversary. Well, that sounds charming, boys, but I haven't played drums since the accident. Fell asleep in a metronome factory. When I awoke, I had completely lost my sense of rhythm. I've been hanging out here ever since. (Song: Ain't Got Rhythm)  So you're saying that you don't have rhythm   But listen what you're doing right there   With that stamp and a book   You've got a real nice hook   Sounds to me like you've got rhythm to spare   I have no idea what you're talking about   I've got as much rhythm as that chair   What happened to me was a tragedy   But I don't have to be a millionaire   Look, I got a sweet deal going on here   I got all the books that I can read   All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80's   What more could a librarian need?  Shh!  Besides, I ain't got rhythm   No, I ain't got rhythm   Said I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   You're kidding me right   Y-You're kidding me   Don't you see what you were doing right then?   That's a wicked groove you were starting to move   Mister, you've got rhythm times ten   I think perhaps that you're not listening   I find it tedious to repeat   It's no big crime   I just can't keep time   I'm telling you I lost the beat   I don't need my face on t-shirts   Or hit a power-chord guitar   They were screaming my name   I guess it's a shame   But I don't need to be a rock star   Besides, I ain't got rhythm   No, I ain't got rhythm   Said I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   Sounds like rhythm to me   No, I ain't got rhythm   Seems like they all agree   Said I ain't got rhythm   But you're laying down some funky syncopation!   I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   But you got that beat   No, I ain't got rhythm   Look at them, they're stomping their feet   Said I ain't got rhythm   It's time for you to rock a brand new generation   A brand new generation   (Brand new generation)   Gonna rock a brand new generation   Because I ain't got rhythm!  Ugh! Would you just go join the band?  (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)  Hey, I got rhythm! Nope. That's not it. I don't know why you're making me do this, Candace. I mean, when do I ever dress this fancy anyways? So, how you ladies doing in here? Great. But we need to keep looking. Oh! Well, we certainly have plenty of dresses for you to try on. And we have plenty of time. Oh. Candace! Okay, now let's see. ""Lead the way for the lovely lady with an elegant wave of your hand. ""For you and only you, insert your name here"" Oh, thanks for the light. Hey! No, no, wait! No, no, help me put it out! Do something! Well, that hardly ever happens. Oh, well, so much for that. I guess it's not a total loss. I mean This is still presentable, right? Eh. Hey, Dad. We're back.  So I hear it's your anni-  Oh, please, please. Stop. Nobody ever lets me finish my number. That's it. Call me when my ride's here. There's lasagna in the fridge. Thank you. Oh, boys, it's really hopeless. Fear not, Daddy-O. We got you covered. Hit it, Ferb. Love HÃ¤ndel?! Surprise, baby girl! Happy sweet 16th birthday, my little Vanessa! Oh! Not again! Well, come on in, come on in. Check the place out. I- I decorated it all myself. Well Mostly. Wait till you see this. Wait-Wait right there. Please stop. And now, without further ado The grand finale! What? A big firecracker? Oh, no. Perry the Platypus tied to a big firecracker. Together we will launch our nemesis into the sky! Y-You mean your nemesis! I took the liberty of going through your address book and inviting all your little friends. Including a nice fella named Johnny. He had hearts by his name. I think I know what that means. You did what? I don't want them to see this! I'm a teenager. This This is for a little girl. Don't you know me at all? I have to admit, I never thought I'd wear this stuff again. Ooh. Look. Hey, sorry, folks. Not gonna happen. Dude, is that the cake from the trash? What? You can't let good cake go to waste. Looks like it all went to waste to me. Watch it, Mr. Tease and Curl. This is exactly the kind of slovenly behavior that ruined Love HÃ¤ndel. No, it was in-fighting due to pressure from a dwindling fan base. What are you talking about? It was in that special. You saw that too? Did I look fat? I thought I looked fat. That's it. This is ridiculous. I'm out of here. No, wait. You can't go. Mom's not back. What about your fans? Phineas. I admire your optimism. But besides your dad, be honest. What fans? Whoa. She doesn't like the party. I can't believe I failed again. Well At least I can watch you explode. Hey, that's not fair! Well, then have a taste of my ray gun, Perry the Platypus! Take that! And that! Help me, Vanessa! Stay still, you obnox- Aah! Perry the Platypus, wait- My hand is stuck in here. H-Hold on. Hold on. Wait, wait. D-Don't go anywhere. Sorry, Phineas, my friend. But we gotta go on now, or we're gonna have a serious fashion metal riot on our hands. No, no, you can't start without Linda. Oh, what? Look, it's Mom! What are all these people doing on our street? Hey! Candace. Honey, what's going on here? Come on, Dad. All right, boys. Let's blow the roof off this place. No! It's going to blow the roof off this place! One, two, three, four! (Song: You Snuck Your Way Right Into My Heart) Aah! Linda! Linda, darling.  I should have known   From how I felt when we were together  Linda, where are you?  And even more when we were apart  Is that Love HÃ¤ndel?!  You tiptoed in   And you got under my skin   You snuck your way right into my heart  Wow. Whoa. This is, like, the coolest-looking party ever. Hey, Vanessa. Did you do all this yourself? Well, actually, my dad put it together With some help from Perry the Platypus. Thank you, Perry the Platypus! Did you do all this for me? Well, I had a little help. Prepare for live feed to screen, and wipe to source.  I've put up barriers   To shield my emotions   A wall that you could never break apart   But like a ninja of love   Rappelling down from above   You snuck your way right into my heart!  into my heart! That's my ma.  Oh, yeah  Well, don't just stand there. Kiss her! Happy anniversary, darling.  Come on, everybody, let me hear ya!   (Nah Na)   (Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Na-Nah)  Hey, Vanessa. Is that your dad up on the rocket? He'll be okay. He blows up all the time. Well, he sure did a cool job with this party. Yeah. Yeah, I guess he did. Thanks, Dad. You finally got one right. Curse you, Perry the Plat- Wait, is that Love HÃ¤ndel? Aaah! Goodnight, Tri-State Area!  If you're feeling lost down in your soul  (Song: Music Makes Us Better)  If you need a little something to make you feel whole   Just remember who you were when you were in control   Just get together with some friends, and play some Rock 'n Roll!   Music makes us better   Brings us together   And it helps me get back that spirit they stole!   Music makes us better   Brings us together   And I owe my life to Rock 'n Roll!"
"Get ready! Round 1! Fight! Oho-ho. You're mine, meat! What? You want a piece of me? Uh uh. I want the whole thing, baby. So, what are you young ladies doing? Wrestling, Mom. Favorite game. Well, I'll just be running a few errands. First, I'll get the groceries, then to the florist, and then to the car wash. Okay, whatever. Kinda busy right now. Call if there's any trouble. With my brothers, I'd might as well call now. Huh. You're right, Ferb. I guess it would make a sound. Say, where's Perry? There you are, Agent P. It has come to our attention that all pigeons have left the Downtown area. Of course, on the upside, I haven't washed my car in weeks. Ahem. We can uh only assume that Dr. Doofenshmirtz is involved. You know your mission.  Perry!  That about does it. Hey, guys! Whatcha doin'? We remodeled our old tree house. What do you think? Oh my gosh! Wow. Come on! Check it out! This is the main crib. Sweet! Let's take the tube to the top. Tube? Sure. It's the fastest way up. Are you sure about this? Relax. We haven't missed yet. Really? Yeah. You're our first passenger. What? Woo-hoo! Ah! Awesome. Let 'er rip. Ah! Check out the view. Pretty sweet, huh? No doubt. What's that? Oh, that's just Candace's old tree-house. She doesn't use it anymore. Well, that's just sad. Hey. What if we gave it a makeover? Sure! Something more Well, I don't know Candace! Yes.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Very effective, don't you think, Perry the Platypus? Perry the Platypus?! Get him! Stop him! He's headed for that clearly marked exit! Winner! Winner! Ugh! Attention, Candace! Come out to the backyard! We have a surprise for you. What's going on now? Hey, Candace. Check out your old tree house. I think you're gonna like it. No way! I better call Mom. Oh, don't be such a fuddy-duddy, Candy. Come on, let's check it out! I don't know, Stacy. I think they're up to some- Whoa! This is so weird. I can't believe it's my old tree house. Carpets, furniture, entertainment center. I mean, look at all the bells and whistles. Maybe my brothers have been replaced by aliens. Ah! Yeah, and now they're gonna fatten you up so they can eat ya! I can't believe they did this all for me. You may begin bouncing. Bounce? Come on! Bounce! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Hello? What do you think of your new tree house? I love it! You thought of everything. It gets better. Try pressing the THF button. THF? What's that? Some sort of sound system? Uh Phineas? What does THF stand for? TREE HOUSE FIGHT! This is so rad! Oh snap! I'm takin' you down! Aaah! You see, Perry the Platypus, you are no match for my pigeons. I have conditioned their tiny, little bird brains to do exactly what I say, by using my brand new very evil invention called The Poop-Inator. Vanessa, please. Thank you. You- Y-You two have met, right? Vanessa, Perry the Platypus. Perry the Platypus, Vanessa. Yeah. Hey. How's it goin'? Observe! With this, I can implant the target image on their tiny, little brains in a flash! It- It works better from a distance. Anyway, today at Town Hall, they will award the key to the city to my goody two-shoes brother, Roger. Oh, how I loathe him. I like Uncle Roger. Thank you, Vanessa, but I don't believe I was talking to you. Is your name Perry the Platypus? No, I don't think so. I so should have gone to summer school. I will not be attending the ceremony, but my pigeons will be there to rain on his parade! You see, Perry the Platypus, my brother Roger is at the top of a very long list of people I despise. Vanessa, music please. (Song: My Goody Two-Shoes Brother)  I bear lots of animosity to bellhops   They never bring my luggage up on time   And taxi drivers really tax my patience   If they vanished,   would it really be a crime?   I don't like meter maids or underwater welders   Health fanatic cooks or camera crews   Not fond of monks or yoga teachers   Or sports fans in the bleachers   And I'm not sure how I'm feeling about you   There are lots of horrid people on this planet   That I would love to give a lashing to   But my goody two-shoes brother   The favorite of my mother   Is the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo   Yes, my goody two-shoes brother   The favorite of my mother   Is the one I want to smother   Thank you sir, I'll have another!   He's the one I want to smother   In a ton   Of   Pigeon   Goo!  You see, you see how I held that last note, good, huh? Tree house fight! Bring it on, maggots! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Awesome! Yeah! Now what? Look! The controls are just like the video game! Let's show 'em our mad skills. Woo-hoo! Let's dance, dweebs! Hey! Stop leading! You stop leading. Give him the twister! Fight! Score! Hit the crash button! YES! Woo-hoo! Well done, Candirocks. Let's nail 'em! Come on, Ferb. The enemy is upon us! Man the cannons! FIRE! Uh oh. Yow! What now? Try pulling some levers! Yipe! Incoming! Yeah! Ew! Egad, man! It's an end run around the middle! Summon retreat! Hmm. That's funny. I haven't gotten the usual call from Candace. Come and get me! Candace, honey. I'm at the carwash, and I'll be heading home very soon. Bye bye. Oh no! Phineas and Ferb to Robo-Girls; Last one home is a big old purple pickled egg! Ah, the award ceremony. And there's my insipid brother, Roger. What? Oh, let's see if I've got another coin. Now, what was I saying Oh! I despise him so much. You are about to witness a truly petty act of vengeance, Perry the Platypus, brought on by my own mindless jealously. Vanessa, fire the harpoon! Perfect. The time has come! Do not fail me, my pigeons! Ladies and gentlemen, as the most handsome and charming man in all the Tri-State Area, I hereby promise to keep our city clean. Pay attention and learn something, Perry the Platypu- Wait, wait! Where's Perry the Platypus? He's escaping. WITH THE POOP-INATOR! Whoa! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Uh oh. Well, this is not going to end well for me, I'm afraid. That's what you get for using a bunch of stupid pigeons. Wait for me! Hold the door, please. Come on, come on, come on, come on! Woo-hoo! Way to go! Awesome! Yeah! We beat ya. You're both big old purple pickled eggs! You were out of your tree. Yeah, we were first. Nuh-uh. We were. Oh! We were. We were! Looks like you're having fun. Well, Mom. You know what they say. Fun never falls too far from the tree house.  Yes, my goody two-shoes brother   The favorite of my mother   Is the one I want to smother   Thank you sir, I'll have another!   He's the one I want to smother   In a ton   Of   Pigeon   Goo!  Ah! You see, you see how I held that last note, good, huh?"
"It sounds like somebody strangling a cat! It must be Grandpa! Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey! I cannot believe we ate the same food. Believe it. Grandma, would you show me where the shower is? Shower? Why, sure honey. Would you like a massage and a fruity drink too? How about a manicure and a mud facial while you lay by the pool eating crab cakes? I can do without the sarcasm. Chow time's over, campers. Time for our nature walk to Badbeard Lake. Why do they call it Badbeard Lake? Well, it's a body of fresh water surrounded by land- No, the Badbeard part. Oh, right. It was named after Badbeard, the most ruthless freshwater pirate ever to plunder a lakeside community. Cool! Wow! And in the middle of Badbeard Lake lies Spleen Island, where legend has it Badbeard buried his bountiful booty. Heh! Booty? You know, treasure. Treasure? Treasure? Aye, mateys- Oh, just a sec. Arrrgh! Why are you talking like a pirate, Grandpa? Arrrgh! I'm trying to tell the story of Badbeard the Pirate. There's a song about it. Say, does anyone have a concertina? Buford? Me? Yes.  Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard   Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard  That's it? Well, I didn't say it was much of a song. So, meet me at the trail head in 5 minutes. Aye, aye, Captain Grandpa! That's the spirit! Oh, dear. I seem to be missing my underpants. Now you see kids, wherever you go, the forest is teeming with life for us to step on. Remember, always stick to the trail so you won't get lost. And whatever you do, never touch the orange moss that grows on the right side of a Jum-Jum tree. Boring. I'm calling Stacy. Left is right. Right is wrong. I can't get any reception up here. So stay clear of the moss. The slightest touch, and the orange moss will absorb through the skin, causing wild hallucinations. Huh? Oh no! Was that the right side or the wrong side? No, wait. The left side was the right side. Moss! Orange! Aah! Aah! Thar she blows mateys. Aah! Badbeard Lake. Ooh! And thar be Spleen Island. The bones of them that hunted the treasure all be lyin' below in Davy Jones's locker. Cool! Let's go!  Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard!   Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!  Candace? Where's Candace?  This is the ballad of Badbeard!  Good morning, Agent P. And thank you for your help, Agent E. Sorry to alarm you, Agent P, but we're remodeling our regular base here. Actually, my wife's doing it Mexican-country style. Distressed wood, wrought iron. It should all be very- Wait! Woah! Hey! Hey, Agent E! Back off! Heh. Anyway, Agent E spotted Dr. Doofenshmirtz on Spleen Island. He's moving boxes and equipment into what's known as the haunted cave of the old sea hag. Honestly, I'm not making this stuff up. But anyway, we believe he's creating a new hideout there, and we want you to foil his plans. Good luck, Agent P. No way. This is so weird. I see Perry with an eagle, and their both dressed up like secret agents and they're talking to man inside an egg. That is so messed up. It must be the moss. Hey, wait a minute. How did I get way up here? Whoa! Aah! Now Perry has a wetski? How strange can this get? Ooh. It gets much stranger, Kevin. Aah! En garde, you scurvy dog! Ha! I don't even know what scurvy is! Hey! I know what we should do today! Let's be real pirates, and go find Badbeard's treasure. Sure. Knock yourselves out. I was just about your age when I first heard about Badbeard's treasure. I'd come up here every summer and search for it. But I felt drawn by the excitement and adventure. Of course, then I discovered girls and the rest is a blur. I never found the treasure, but I did find a treasure map. Treasure map? Hey! Woah But be warned, mateys. They say Badbeard's treasure comes with a curse! A curse? Aye! Them who disturb the treasure of Badbeard shall be cursed with bad beards for the rest of their days. You mean we'll be stuck with a big ugly beard on our face for the rest of our lives? That's gnarly. Well, while you kids search for treasure, I better go search for Grandma. Wish there was a map for that. Okay, troops. We set sail from Point Plots, sail through the Stones of Gall, and into the Cove of Incontinence, and then continue on foot into the Dark Tunnel of Doom. Well, that sounds delightful. And ""X"" marks the spot. Easy-peasy. First thing we gotta do is, we make Grandpa's secondhand dingy into a first-rate pirate ship. Ferb, any ideas? Whoa. Impressive. Is that the cable company? So, Mr. Cable Man, you don't carry the Evil Science Channel? What's up withâ Perry the Platypus? Oh, give me a break! I-I'm moving, legally. I bought this place. And cheap too. It's supposed to be haunted by a terrifying old sea hag. Look, Perry the Platypus. Just because I'm evil doesn't mean everything I do is evil. Fine! Y-You want evil, Perry the Platypus? I'll give you evil! (Song: The Ballad of Badbeard) Avast, me 'arties!  We're sailing for the Island of Spleen to search for the treasure of Badbeard   I'm feeling sick   You're looking green   We search for the treasure of Badbeard   We'll plunder and pillage   And do some math   And all refuse to take a bath   We seek adventure and romance   I'm running out of underpants   There's ghosts who haunt the cave and worse   It's guarded by a pirate's curse   Why do my nostrils whisper to me?   Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard   Arg! Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard  This is it. The Tunnel of Doom. Just like on the map. Are you sure we're going the right way? Sure I'm sure. We just follow Ferb. He's got the map. Uh oh. Oh well. I'm sure it's pretty straight forward from here. Heh heh. It doesn't look very safe. I think you better test it. No problem. It'll hold us. No, wait! Not all at once! Run for it! Oh my gosh! Buford, what are you doing? Look! I found these nifty hand puppets! Well stop fooling around and let's go. Oh, all right. This place is creeping me out. If I had any underpants left, I am sure they would have been soiled. Phineas, we're not getting lost, are we? Yeah, Dinner Bell. What if there is no treasure? Perhaps the real treasure is true friendship and the spirit of adventure. Nah. There it is over there. ""X"" marks the spot. Look. There's the chest. But who would dare open it? I'll open it. But Phineas, what about the curse? Bad beards forever, dude. And you don't even have a chin. That's a chance I'll have to take. Shiver me timbers! The curse is true! We will have bad beards forever! Oh, no! It's full of bad fake beards. Now, Perry the Platypus, why don't you say hello to my new pet crocodiles? Susan and Susan. I named them after each other. Now, prepare to be delicious! The sea hag! The pharmacist! Hey Perry, I'm gonna get a snack from the vending machine. You want something? Suit yourself. I'm gonna have me some beef jerky! Island Self Destruct Sequence activated. Wait, my beef jerky! Aah! Someone always finds my self-destruct button! Oh. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Blah blah blah. These are the best bad beards ever! Quick! Grab as many beards as you can carry and let's get out of here! Cast off. Put your backs into it, mateys. Wee! Hey. By the way, where's Per- Oh, never mind. Hey, Perry. What happened to your cute little secret agent hat? Well Ferb, me ol' matey, our first time out as pirates, and we come home with a bounty of beards. And perhaps the greatest pirate story ever told. Wow, that's the greatest pirate story ever told! Oh. How are you feeling, honey? Oh, better. Thanks, Grandma. Can you believe I actually thought Perry was a secret agent? Well, I learned my lesson. Stay away from the orange moss. The orange moss? Is that what your Grandpa said? Oh, he always gets that wrong. It's the blue moss you gotta watch out for. W-what? I guess it was all in your head. Well, that's the power of suggestion for ya. You get some rest now, sweetie. The blue moss. What? Ohh. Love the beard, Kevin. Avast, me 'arties!  We're sailing for the Island of Spleen to search for the treasure of Badbeard   I'm feeling sick   You're looking green   We search for the treasure of Badbeard   We'll plunder and pillage   And do some math   And all refuse to take a bath   We seek adventure and romance   I'm running out of underpants   There's ghosts who haunt the cave and worse   It's guarded by a pirate's curse   Arg Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard   Arg Arg! Arg! Arg!   This is the ballad of Badbeard  Bad beards forever, dude."
"I can't believe you guys dragged me all the way over here for this. Well, at least there's hunky guys in skirts. Guys. Come on, look at this. This is an actual replica of an artist's interpretation of what some random guy of no significance believed that the chariot of Asparagus might have looked like. And this is Asparagus, the greatest warrior in all of Greece. With this golden chariot, he would win every race. And here he is defeating the Minotaur, a creature that's half-man, half-bull. Asparagus defeated him using the head of Medusa, a creature so ugly she could turn people to stone with just one look. Kind of reminds me of Candace. It does not look like me! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna have our own chariot race like Hey, where's Perry? Psst. Psst! Agent P, over here. Sorry to disturb you at the museum. We've just been informed that Doofenshmirtz has created a machine to rid the world of platypuses. Uh, platypi? Platypeople? Whatever. We've tracked Doofenshmirtz to the old abandoned movie house. So get going, and don't look up my skirt. Okay. The race will start here at home, and through the streets of Danville, and over to the park. From there we make our way past Paul Bunyan's Pancake Haus  Paul Bunyan's, where food is good  But not too good, eh? and finish at the steps of the museum. Hey, boys, whatcha doin'? Just mapping out our route for the big chariot race we're gonna have. Oh, excellent. But, it's good to see you boys taking an interest in Greek mythology. I'm doing the same. I've got over 12 hours of gladiator movies here I wanna watch. Nice hat, Mr. Flynn. Thank you, Isabella. It's my movie watching hat. Isabella, we're gonna have the greatest race in history, complete with helmets and armor and super-cool chariots with horses. Spread the word! Spread the word! Wait! At what time? In about an hour or so. Where's it gonna be? Here! Who am I telling again? Just spread the word! Oh, and tell them to bring gladiator gear.  Doofenshmirtz Abandoned Theater!  Comfy, Perry the Platypus? I've prepared something special just for you. You see, until now, every attempt to eradicate you has been foiled. Then I came across a Excuse me. Who are you and what are you doing here? I bought a ticket to see this movie. Ugh! Okay, just roll the film. Who is the enemy of the platypuses? Or platypi, or platypeople? Or Well, you know what I mean. The platypus is one of our greatest friends in nature, a humble but key component in Mother Nature's delicate cycle of life. But as of late, worldwide populations have been declining to near endangerment. But why? Who is the enemy of the platypuses? Or Well, you know what I mean. This is the best platypus movie I have ever seen. Historically, the enemies of the platypus were well known. The poisonous swamp viper, the snaggle-tooth badger, and duplicating imitable stunts seen on television. But there is a new enemy of the platypus. One whose tireless development paves over the platypus's woodland homes. The greatest enemy of the platypus is man. Hi, there. Ah, you see, Perry the Platypus? For years I've been trying to rid myself of you with traps and bombs and poisonous gas and automatic tennis ball machines. I- I don't even know what I was thinking back then, but Now I have the ultimate platypus elimination weapon. Perry the Platypus, recoil in horror at my new creation! A giant killer robot man. My name is Norm. The enemy of the platypus is man. This is awesome! I did not know this movie was in 3-D. Please. Stop running. Perhaps we could discuss our differences over coffee. Okay, we're all set! Let's meet our racers. In the first chariot is us. Then we got Isabella and the Fireside Girls, Buford and Baljeet, and we have one for Candace, too, if she ever shows up. Here are the maps for everyone. The first chariot to reach the museum wins. Any questions? Um, yes. Uh Should we not establish the rules first? This is a chariot race. There are no rules. No rules? Well, if those are the rules! Hey, you! You're goin' down! But we're on the same team. Then you're goin' down with me! Each chariot will be pulled by a rocking horse Ferb souped up with a lawn mower engine! Phineas! Just what do you think you're doing? Candace, great! You're right on time! Check out this cool-lookin' helmet we made for you! And we built you your own chariot that looks just like you! Oh, that's ridiculous. I do not have wheels! To the winner of this race, I offer the spoils of the empireâ¦ Dad, they're racing chariots. Yes, that scene's just starting. Come in and sit down. Come on, Candace! Dad! Oh, I'm sorry. Do you want some? Ugh! That's it! I'll stop this myself. Are you ready? Get set Go! Okay, you two. I've had enough of this- Ow! Hey! Aah! Daddy! Oh, now where'd she go? She's gonna miss all the action. (Song: My Chariot) Looks like Candace made it after all. Lookin' good, Candace!  I got a motorized nag takin' me for a drag   Leave the others far behind   Baby, I ain't braggin', my anachronistic wagon's   Two millennia ahead of its time   Talkin' 'bout my chariot   No, it's not street legal, but it gets me where I wanna go   Climb aboard my chariot   When they hear me come a-rumblin', then everybody wants to know   ""Where'd you get that chariot?""   I don't need no oracle to tell me how good it feels   To throw a full-tilt coliseum killer toga party on wheels   Yeah, yeah  Remind me, why did we put spikes on Buford's chariot? Reckless endangerment, disrupting traffic Ew, they are so busted. And a bowling ball catapult? I mean, what were we thinking? Ah! My phone! Why'd we give them all the cool stuff? What do we have? Cup holders? Sweet. Now we're cookin'. The girls are still gaining! Failure is not an option for me, my husky friend. Well, use your head and think of something, genius! Exactly! Use my head! That is right! Eat sparks, my opponents! Ferb, do you smell something burning? An unconventional way to use my head, yes, but an effective one! We should do this more often! Okay, girls! Star formation!  Yeah, yeah  Sorry. No rules. Now what? Have to use your head again. Hey! Get back on your own chariot!  Yeah, talking 'bout my chariot   Got all my horse power   In two big wheels of fun   Climb aboard my chariot   You can be my second   'Cause I'm gladiator number one   Get a load of my chariot   Always going full-throttle   Ask anybody and they'll say   If you see me coming   Then you better get out of my way!  We should be coming up on Paul Bunyanâs!  Paul Bunyan's, where food is good  But not too good, eh? Oh, there it is! Are those slacks new? They make you look slimmer. Honey, have you seen my keys?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  Hey, look! It's Perry. I gotcha! Where you been? What is that? It's half-man, half-bull. It's the Minotaur! My name is Norm! It's Norm the Minotaur! Hit it, Ferb! Wait! Come back! You can borrow my rake. Candace has the lead! Go Candace! Somebody help me! See? I knew she'd love it. Let's invite our wives next time. Candace wins! That was the coolest rocking-horse, mower-pulled chariot Minotaur chase ever! Oh! Oh! Ah! Gross. Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! Oh, no! Phineas and Ferb! No, no, no, no, no! You can't just tear up the town with your chariots and expect to get away with it! When Mom and Dad find out about this Candace The enemy of the platypus is man. Listen, pal, you stay out of this! She turned him to stone! I did what? Don't look at me! Wait! It's Medusa! D'oh, that's it! I'm outta here! Wait, Candace! Norm! Oh, no, Norm! What did he do to you? Did- Did the bad little platypus switch you off? I'll fix that. My name is Norm. See? All you needed was a reboot. Wait! Wait! W-What is this? What happened to all the lights? Wait, wait, it-it's coming loose. I think I can get it off. The enemy of the platypus is man. Ooh. Oh, well, now it's stuck. Somebody help me! Secretly, I'm very lonely. Just wait until Mom finds out about this. Candace, looks like we owe you a big thanks for defeating the Minotaur. Who knew you had the power to turn men to stone? That is so not true. Who ever heard of something as silly as turning someone to stone? No, no, it can't be. I did it again. Don't look at me! I'm a monster! Make it stop! It's okay, Ferb. She's gone. You can look now. No. Not taking any chances. Hey, look. There's Perry. Still not looking."
"MOOOOOOOOOOOM! Look! Look, look! In the backyard! Look! They've done it again! Just let me drop off the groceries. This was the best ride ever, guys. Ohh, that was very fabulous ride. Now can you send us back to space station perhaps? Erimnevop Yelsgnik Nad. Look, look, look! Okay, tell me, you don't see a giant, enormous Ferris wheel in the backyard! All right. I don't see a giant, enormous Ferris wheel in the backyard. Hi, Mom. Hi, kids. ""Why don't you come in for snacks?"" Why don't you come in for some snacks? ""Oh, there you are, Perry."" Oh, there you are, Perry. And Ferb says You know, gladiators were Roman, not Greek. It's always the same thing every day. The same insane routine. My life is like a bad sitcom. Do you live in the Danville area and want to bust your brothers? Then call now and you can be on the next episode of Bust 'Em! Yes, yes! (Song: Leave the Busting to Us!)  When you're bothered by your brothers and you can't convince your mother   And you don't think you can take another day   Don't swear or cuss   'Cause they got your back against the wall   And you think you've tried it all,   There's a number you should call   To throw them underneath a bus   Just leave the busting to us  Bust 'em! Bust 'em! Bust 'em! Operators are standing by. Hello, Bust 'Em? Do I have a show for you. Bright, sunny and clear. Yep, it's gonna be a hot one. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Well, I'm off to my cooking class. You kids keep cool today. Oh, good. Our stuff is here. Already? Yeah, well Okay, okay. You guys keep doing whatever it is you guys do. That seemed oddly out of character. Hey, where's Perry?  Perry!  Good morning, Agent P. It's a beautiful day in the Tri-State area, just the kind of day that makes Dr. Doofenshmirtz a little verklempt. That's why your mission is Sky Weather Rain Doofenshmirtz. Uh We're breaking up. Let me call you on a land line. So, just to recap. Sky, weather, rain, Doofenshmirtz. Are you Candace? Yes. Get in. We're from the TV show. My name is Lulu Jones, and this is my assistant, Fifi. Hi there. So you really think you can bust my brothers? Ha-ha-ha. You're so cute. Isn't she cute, Fifi? Oh, yes, she is. Ha-ha-ha! You see, Candace, ""Busting"" is my middle name. It's my actual name. Lulu ""Busting"" Jones. I was born for this job. But you have no idea what my brothers are capable of. Believe me, I know. That's why I created this show. My brothers used to drive me crazy. Let me tell you a story. The story of ""bust"" and ""them."" ""Bust"" fights ""them"", but ""them"" fights right back. It's the age-old struggle, but in the end ""them"" wins. Always wins. No, I'm sorry. Wait, uh. ""bust""- ha-ha. ""Bust"" always wins. That's it. Yes, bust them. Ha-ha! The point is, I feel your pain. Mom never believed they were the ones breaking the plates or scratching the records. Um Uh My brothers don't break plates or scratch records. Well, whatever they're doing, we'll get them. Our crew has planted cameras covering every square inch of your backyard. Basically, if a squirrel breaks wind, we'll have it on tape. Fifi, none of these cameras seem to be working. A-Actually, I think camera number eight is working fine. So Your show must be pretty popular, huh? Well, you know, not really. I mean, we're having some problems with our ratings right now. Our station manager is threatening to pull the plug, you know. But with an episode like this one, it'll never happen! Come on, gimme one! One what? A ""Bust 'em!"" Gimme a ""Bust 'em."" Come on!  Bust 'em! Bust 'em! Bust 'em!  Well, you know, they must be done by now anyway. Done with what? I don't know. It's different every day. Come on, I'll show you. So where is this thing I'm supposed to film? So What do you think? I think we finally have our very special episode! Hey, Candace. What do you think of the water slide?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Oh-ho, Perry the Platypus. I can't believe you fell for that old fake window trick. Whoo! Wait a second, how did you? Oh, I can't believe I fell for the old fake Perry the Platypus bit. That was pretty good, Perry the Platypus. I gotta give you props on that one. I know, I know. You're wondering about the hat, right? It-It's part of my new magic kit. Ever since the seventh grade, I have wanted to be a magician. But it was a pretty tough road. Hey, wait! Where- Where's Bobo the rabbit? Can somebody please get me out of this? Anyone? Hello? But I guess my dreams faded into sepia tone somewhere along the way. Oh, Perry the Platypus, your shoes are untied. Psyche! Before you go, I'd like to introduce you to the Gloominator 3000 inator! Hmm? What's that? Could it be Morse code for ""That evil gadget looks so manly and threatening. What on Earth does it do?"" All right, I'll tell you. Sheesh! Stop bugging me! With this, I will launch thousands of weather pellets into the atmosphere, thereby plunging the Tri-State Area into a new ice age! But before I do that, I shall finally make Perry the Platypus disappear! Voila! Oh, it really worked! Maybe I should have stuck with the magic business, hmm? Hey, Candace. Wanna join our maiden voyage? I'm not gonna be a guinea pig for one of your harebrained Candace, wait! We need you to get on that ride with this secret hidden camera. Now go get that footage and leave the busting to us! Everybody ready? Make sure your life vests are securely fastened. And in case we capsize, your seat cushions can function as a headstone. Oh, you don't want to get this wet. But-but-but-but Come on, Candace. That wasn't too bad, was it? Actually, that was kinda Aah! That's it. It's over, right?  Aahh  (Song: Gotta Make Summer Last)  Summer, I love summer   Give me that summer time    Summer, every 86,400 seconds that pass  Whew!  Gotta make summer last!  You wanna go again? Are you crazy?! Oh, she'd love to! We need that footage if you wanna bust 'em. We disguised the camera this time. Don't lose it. Now let's test my Gloominator 3000-inator! A couple of these ought to be enough. Let's see. Whoo-hoo! Look at them go! Perfect! Now for the real thing. Hmm. Maybe I can squeeze a few more in there. Lemme see. Perry the Platypus? Bobo the rabbit! Do you know that I've been looking for you since the seventh grade? I can't believe you spent our entire life savings on a bunny farm and forgot to buy any bunnies! But, dear, I I mean, what did ya think Rabbits were just gonna fall outta the sky? Looks like somebody owes me an apology. TouchÃ©. So Lulu, did we get enough footage? Did we ever! Now we need you to call your mom for the big confrontation scene, and I'll call the station manager. Hi, Mom. Hi, Candace. What took you so long? Just get over here as soon as you can. This time, it's gonna be different. Sir, you should- you should come over here right away. This will be our best show ever, I guarantee it! Hey! That evil scientist just stole my bike! Hey, that nice duck just gave me 20 bucks for my skateboard. Ooh! This is great! I can smell that second season pickup. What was that? My mom is here. My station manager is here. Candace, what's going on? Who are these people? Could you please Mom! Mom, we're gonna be on TV. I can finally prove everything. I'm talking about ratings dynamite here, sir. Tell me that's not ratings dynamite! That's not ratings dynamite. That's a suburban backyard. But I had no What? I-I don't understand What?! Where is everything?!! Welcome to my world. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! The video tapes! All the proof is still in the van! Come on! Gimme a ""bust 'em""!  Bust 'em! Bust 'em! Bust 'em!  You get that a lot? Pretty much every day around here. Itâs in the van, itâs in the van, itâs in the van, it's in the van! Well, I donât think I can take this everyday. You get used to it. The van Where is the vaaaaaan?! So nice of them to leave the keys inside. That's what you get for being the good guy. You have to stop at all the traffic signals. Uh Oh, no! Wait! W-What is this? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! So, kids. Keeping cool today? ""Hi, Mom."" Hi, Mom! ""Oh, there you are, Perry."" Oh! There you, Perry. And Ferb says And that is why I will never wear suspenders in public. ""Now for some snacks."" Why do you kids come inside for some pie? Yeah. I'll take some pie. Now, you understand my pain. Want some pie? I'm getting dizzy! Oh! Hey, maybe I'm supposed to turn into a skid. Whoa! I can't believe you sold our lucrative bunny farm and bought a van rental place! And you didn't buy a single van! Not one word."
"And that is why the 18th century sewing thimble was not only a slice of history, but a compelling example of American grit and perseverance. Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Yes? Great, Dad. Oh That was wonderf Mom! Oh, I'm kidding! Hon, your speech is gonna be a big hit at the antique thimble symposium. It's gonna knock 'em dead. Uh, which we're gonna be late for if we don't get on the road! Thanks again for looking after the kids today. Candace is skating at the park. All numbers are on the fridge. Be good for your grandparents, boys! Bye! You wanna go down and embarrass your sister at the park? Yeah. You got it, Candace! You may be rusty, but you got it! Uh I-I can't turn around or stop, but I got it! I wonder if Jeremy's skating here today. Does this helmet make my butt look big? See? I told you Ferb was a good skater. Ooh, that's my boy! Hey! Isn't that your family? Yoo-hoo! Hello! Hey, Candace! Jump in! I am so not with them! Turn me around, Stacy! So, Grandma, where did you get the moves? Well, boys, I was quite the skater in myâ Oof! Watch where you're- Betty Jo? Of the Tri-State Bombers? Hildegard? Of the Saskatoon Slashers? I thought I smelled the last of you back in '57, when I whipped your sorry behind, took the trophy and became the rightful Queen of the Derby! Whoa, Grandma, you were in the rollerskating derby? Not only was I in it, I was champ! It was years ago. The night of the final match between the Bombers and the Slashers. We were on our final lap. What was left of my team used our signature move ""The Whip"" to send me to the finish line. Hildegard's team had the same idea. The trophy was mine until You only won because you cheated! ""Anything goes"", remember? Well, what do you say we try it again, cheater? Anytime, anywhere. You skate like a water buffalo! Hi, Jeremy. Uh, Candace? Why is my grandma yelling at your grandma? That's your grandmother? Come on, Jeremy. You and your little sister are on my team. Suzy! Yes, Grandma? Me, you and Jeremy are a team. Got it? So I need two of you kids on my team, okay? Well, you can have Phineas and Ferb, Grandma. I'm not- But that's not fair, Candace. Our team has two girls and one boy, so you need to be on your grandma's team so it's fair. Cause it's not fair if it's two boys and one girl against two girls and one boy, so you have to skate, Candace, or else it won't be fair. Then it's you, Ferb, and Grandma! You'll make a great team! B-But- I guess it's set, then. We gotta do it for our grandmas. Right, Candace? Yeah, right. Psst. See ya on the track, chump! Yeah, great. Hey, wait! There's nowhere to have a rollerskating derby, remember? The old derby track got torn down and turned into a tattoo parlor! Leave the rink to us! Hmm. Uh Nice entrance, Agent P. But you do realize there's an elevator right over there, right? Okay, just pointing it out. Doofenshmirtz is up to something. I want you to get out there and put a stop to it.  Perry!  I can't be a part of this race. I mean, what if we win? Would Jeremy still like me? All I know for sure is boys hate to be beaten by girls. There you are, hon. You know where your dad keeps his glue gun? Glue gun? What are they up to? Later, Stace. I knew it! I just knew you would be up to something by now. Et tu, Grandpa? No, I just had one. There's more if you want. Oh, just wait until Mom hears about this! Heads up! Oof! Lace 'em up tight, dearie! We've got a score to settle. Win! Win! Win! Yeah. Ooh, yeah. Will you cool it with the noise, Perry the Platypus? I've got a splitting headache. I was at this evil mixer until late last night, it was crazy. Can you hang out for just one moment? I-I'm almost there. Hold on. Ow! Oh, I've got to get a quieter trap. Now that you're trapped, I will tell you my evil plan. I'm miserable because I can't grow facial hair. It all started when I was about 15. Oh! Oh, you know what, my head hurts too much for a flashback. Anyway, I've tried everything to grow facial hair. It's all so painful. I hate people with beards, et cetera, et cetera. So, who do they erect a statue of right next door? Rutherford B. Hayes, our 19th president! Only the president with the best facial hair of all! Just look at that thing. There's no beard like 19th century beard, Perry the Platypus. Anyway, that horrible statue must be destroyed, as it is a constant reminder of my follicular failure! Oh. Give me just a moment, Perry. This hurts me more that it hurts you. Literally. and then on the final lap, we'll use The Whip to launch the weak skater. No offense, honey, but that's you. Over to the finish line To victory! All I know for sure is boys hate to be beaten by girls. Candace! Have you no mercy?! Come on, Grandma. Let's go home. And remember, honey. Show 'em no mercy! What am I going to do? I can't beat Jeremy's grandmother. And I can't let my grandmother lose. Skaters to their marks! Oh, great. Maybe I'll get lucky and get hit by a bus. Hello, everyone, and welcome to today's main event. The ""anything goes"" grudge race of the century between Grandma Betty Jo and Grandma Hildegard. I'm Phineas Flynn, and I'll be your announcer for today's action, along with our color commentator, Grandpa Clyde! Yellow, green, blue! Excellent color, Grandpa. Glad to oblige. And now, let's rock and roll-erskate derby! Remember kids, two words Oof! road kill! Come on, honey! We've got butt to kick! And they're off! (Song: Ring of Fun)  When granny gets loose, everybody get out of the way   (Round and round that ring of fun!)   'Cause she's lacing her boots up at 4 A.M. everyday   (Round and round that ring of fun!)   Grudge match grannies who got nothing to lose   Gray-haired lightning wearing knee pads and rouge   Crusin' for a brusin', cause you know they got a real short fuse!   That ring of fun!   Round and round that ring of fun!   That ring of fun!   Round and round that ring of fun!   Grudge Match Grannies in the midday sun   Goin' round and round in that ring of fun!  Yeah! And we're back! Grandpa? Orange, purple, chartreuse! So, Perry the Platypus, in order to rid myself of that horrid, bearded statue, I've invented the Ugh. Ugh. Perry the Platypus, this is so heavy. Can you just step out for a sec? I've invented the Bread-inator! Not only will this machine emit a ray that will turn Mr. President into whole-grain bread, it will also release a flock of hungry magpies that will devour the doughy statue! Beard go bye-bye! Ow, ow. Aw, my evil head. We're coming to the end of the race. The crowd is going nuts! Come on, Candace! Time for The Whip! Okay, one, two, three! Go catch her, Jeremy! It's Candace and Jeremy neck and neck as they come down the strait. I don't think so. Wow! Candace, you've got to teach me how to skate like that. Oh, wait! Candace and Jeremy are back in the race, but they're going the wrong way! And now, Suzy is going the wrong way too! At least Ferb's still going the right way! Oops, spoke too soon. And don't even think about any rough up this time, sister, or I'll kick your fat- And it's Betty Jo pulling away! It's Grandma Hildegard coming up on the shoulder! And by ""shoulder"" I mean Betty Jo's shoulders! Get off of me! I can't see! It's Grandma Betty! It's Hildegard! It's Betty! It's Hildegard! It's a tie! A tie? Ooh. Betty Jo ain't gonna like that. Well, at least I won this race. You won? You're crazy! I obviously crossed the finish line first! Wrong! And, get off, cheater! Hey, Grandma, that was really fun! I thought it'd be lame and I'd hate it, but, I had fun. How about you, Hilda? Did you have fun? Yeah, I did. Maybe it ain't so important who won but that we had fun with the kids. Yeah. Maybe it ain't important. But just for the record, I won. You mean, even though you lost, it's having fun that's important. Who are you calling a loser, cheater? Who you calling a cheater, loser? That's it! Race ya to the Rutherford B. Hayes statue! Go! Perry the Platypus, my head is killing me. This- This is all a wash anyway. I'll turn on the ray and you'll turn off the ray, thwarting my plan. Let's just get it over with, all right? Ray on. And Ray off.  Perry!  Good. I'm just going to lie down for a bit. I promise I'll be more evil next time, alright? All right, all right, we've had our kicks. But Mom's still gonna flip when she sees this. Oh, that's her car! You are so busted! Mom, come on, come on! The boys built a giant roller rink in the backyardâ Uh Giant loaf of bread? Ah 'unno. Mom! Mom! The boys built a giant loaf of bread in the backyard! What? I thought you said it was a roller rink. It was, but now it's a loaf of bread! Come on, come on! See?! Candace, what are you talking about?! B-b-b bread Boys, I think she's finally lost it. Hey, Dad. How'd your speech go? Well, I have to say it was ""thimbly"" wonderful. Hey, what's this thing do? Whaâ? Hey, guys. Candace around? Good catch, Jeremy. He sure is."
"Beat you to it again, slow poke. Hey, Ferb. Ready to build the fastest, safest, most on-time backyard railroad ever? All right! You man the boiler. I'll handle the brakes. Perry can be the station's mascot. Wow. It's really nice out today. It's almost like everything in nature is simultaneously saying Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh. You know, Ferb. Everyday we do something really big. But you know the one thing we haven't done? Relax. I say we take advantage of this perfect day and have the best do-nothing day ever. Hey, Stacy. Yes, yes. I'm ready for Jeremy's band's outdoor concert at the summer festival! Today's gonna be amazing! All right. What gives? It's already 9 o'clock, and there's no construction noise, no delivery trucks, no- No nothing? They're just standing there. Like statues. Statues Good thinking, Ferb. We'll put these decoys up so Candace thinks we're doing nothing. And then when Candace isn't looking, we'll do something! Not today, they don't! Hi, boys. Whatcha doin'? We're doing nothing today. Well, I'm off to the festival to set up my tea cozy stand. Bye! Bye, Mom! Hey, where's Perry? Oh, hey, Agent P. Carl, give me a close up. So, uh Anyway Stop Doofenshmirtz. Hit it, Carl. Hi, Candace. I'm not here for ""hi's"". Today is a pivotal moment in my life. You see, Jeremy's band is gonna play at the festival. Jeremy's gonna see me in the crowd. Not just because I have front row seats, but because I'm gonna be cheering harder that anyone else. Like this ""WOO! YEAH! WOO! BABY! OH YEAH, SING IT!"" Then we're gonna date through high school and college, marry and have two kids. Xavier and Amanda. So don't you dare ruin it with one of your little project thingies! No problem, Candace. 'Cause today we're doing nothing anyway. And don't try to give me- Did you say ""nothing""? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing. Standing is something. Hmm. Well, you can't do nothing forever. And when you stop doing nothing, I'll start doing something, and that something will be busting you! Look at them plotting my downfall. Hello? Mom! Phineas and Ferb are doing nothing! Nothing, in a relentless effort to ruin my day! Candace, honey, why can't you just relax, and let your brothers enjoy their do-nothing day? Could it really be possible? Could Phineas and Ferb actually be doing nothing? You're right, Mom. I should just try and relax until Stacy picks me up for the concert. Exactly. Love ya. Well, if they really are doing nothing, I guess I've got some time to go about my personal business. Let's see What do I usually do? I know! I'll call Stacy and tell her how I'm busting Phineas and Ferb for- Oh, yeah. Can't do that 'cause they're not doing anything. Wait a minute! I know! I'll put this camera in just the right spot so when Phineas and Ferb are- Ugh! And then when Phineas and Ferb walk by I'll- Ugh! Well, if there's one thing I know, I'm gonna look sooo good when I bust them for- Ugh! Face it! You cant do anything unless you're trying to bust them for doing something. And if they're doing nothing, then Who is Candace? Ah Hey, Phineas. Is it the perfect day to build one of these or what? Sorry, Candace. It's like we said. We're pursuing the best do nothing day ever. But if you put it in our inbox, we'll try to build it tomorrow. Ugh! Huh, huh? Time traveling submarine? Come on! Candace, now you're just taking pages from our project book. How can I inspire them to build something? Argh! Are you a boy, doing nothing with your stepbrother today? Do you like high adventure? Yeah! Then we have the product for you! It's the Amazing Man-Eating Dinosaur-Themed Totally Sick Waterslide of Doom! That's right, kids. The Amazing Man-Eating Dinosaur-Themed Totally Sick Waterslide of Doom! Can be delivered in just minutes! And it's so easy to assemble, even a 5-year-old can build it! I did it! Call now! Well, that's the last of it. By the way, aren't you a little too old to be building one of these? Why, yes. Yes, I am. Okay, I'll get this thing started. And then because they're men, they'll want to take over and show me how to do it. Then I'll call Mom and bust them!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. I'd like to introduce you to something.  Perry  My Slow Motion-inator! This way, you're too slow to foil my evil scheme and I don't have to worry about capturing you. Problem solved. Anyway, let's get down to business. I don't know if you've ever noticed, but I'm not exactly very Mmm, what do the kids call it these days? Handsome. My doctor says it's genetic, but I don't blame my parents. I blame everyone else in the entire Tri-State Area for being better-looking that me. So, I invented this. My Ugly-Inator! It harnesses the horned frog's unpleasant appearance to render it's target ugly! Let me give you a demonstration on handsome movie actor, Vance Ward. Hi, I'm Vance Ward. If it can turn him ugly, it can turn anything ugly. Are you ready, Vance? I guess, but I didn't get a script. I mean, what's my motivation in this scene? Motivation? Oh, I think it will be clear to you in a second. Now onto the rest of the Tri-State Area! Oh, and Perry the Platypus You know what the best part of my plan is? I can do it from the comfort of my own living room! With my favorite flat-screen TV and recliner. Ah Oh, hey, boys. I see you're still doing nothing. Oh, don't mind me. I'm just carrying a few construction supplies for a really huge super cool contraption. You know, like the ones you used to build. Well, I figured I'd get in on the fun today. Oh! Pardon my reach! Just trying to get into the most convenient position to drive this stake into the ground. Oh, yeah! I'm really having fun now! Uh, Candace? Oh, I know what you're gonna say. Of course you can take over the whole operation. Uh Actually, I was gonna ask if you could keep the noise down. Uh Well, back onto the important things in life, like having fun! Remember when you used to have this much fun? All this fun could be yours too. All you have to do is join me! Okay, okay, I-I don't want to brag, but Fun loves me more than it loves you right now. Whoop! Yoo-hoo! Perry the Platypus! Come and get it! Oh, I forgot! You're too slow to catch me now! Oh! Duh! Of course! You were going for the Slow Motion-inato- Wait! Wait, no! Don't touch the reverse switch! You- You should see yourself! You're so ugly! Candace, where are you? It's time to go! Candace? Who's having fun now?! It's like boredom's a bad rash, and I'm a shot of cortisone! Candace, what are you doing? I've been trying to call you all afternoon! What does it look like?! I'm busting my brothers! But the concert's starting right now. Jeremy! Oh, my gosh! I spent so much time busting my brothers, I forgot about the concert! Candace, what's happening? It didn't say anything in the instructions about being lifted up in the air! (Song: Do Nothing Day)  Beautiful, kind and gentle   And loving and softness and sweetness and candy and gum   Peppermint and pink-  (Song: Ugly)  We're dead ugly   We're so ugly   We're ugly, yes, ugly   We're so ugly   I can't breathe   It's hard to breathe  Who are these guys?  My lungs explode  They must be the opening act!  When I'm with-  Oh no! Now I'm ugly! Oh. Oh, I get it. Hardy-har-har. My autographed picture of Vance Ward! Oh, you've perverted my ugly invention with something beautiful! Thanks, whoever you are. Now, get me out of here!  -ly, I know-   -s and bunnies and happy songs we can all hum  What about my TV and chair? Get me off this thing! My balloon! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Hey, boys, I'm home. Oh, I see you're still enjoying your do nothing day. Yeah, Mom. It was the best lazy day ever. Oh, there you are, Perry. Where am I? And with handsome movie actor Vance Ward. He seems much faster on TV. Come on! (Song: Do Nothing Day)  Slow down and look around you   All around   Throw your To-Do list away   The clouds look like sheep and vice versa   On a do nothing day   On a do nothing day   Our do nothing day  This is the best day ever!"
"And now, back to ""Neanderthal: The Pride of the Paleolithic"". The Neanderthals were great makers of tools, as well as skilled hunters. It's also believed that they had a highly advanced language. For example is how they may have said ""I love you"" or ""Please take out the trash"". But one day, the fateful ice storms came. The Neanderthals blamed each other for being ill-equipped to survive the harsh cold. Many were frozen in glaciers and may be preserved to this very day. We will return to our program after a brief word from our sponsor. (Song: Sandwich Town jingle)  Turkey on rye or plain bologna meat   Our sandwich guy will make you want to eat  Hmm I wonder if there's a caveman in the Danville Glacier. Come on down to Sandwich Town. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! You know what else we should do today? Go search for a caveman at the Danville Glacier! Oh, I've got to find the perfect outfit to wear to Stacy's costume party. That's it! A disco diva! Nah. A corn dog! Nah. I know! I'll ask Jeremy! What do you think about my costumes, Jeremy? ""Gee, Candace. I think you look beautiful and everything. Will you be my girlfriend?"" Oh, yes, Jeremy! I'll be your girlfriend! What? The prom? What?! Uh Candace? No- Uh Just a minute, please. Hi, Jeremy! Hey, Candace. Are you going to Stacy's party? Yes. Cool. It's gonna be wicked. I'm going as a caveman. I'll see you there. Bye, Jeremy! Ghee! It's perfect! I'll dress up like a cavewoman, and Jeremy and I will be all matchy, and it'll be like we're on a date! Okay. Let's go over our checklist. Well, boys, we're off to the Center for Historically Relevant Botanical Gardens, a virtual treasure trove of topical topiaries. I'm sure it'll be riveting. What are you boys doing today? Archaeological dig! Okay. Don't touch the flower beds. Wouldn't think of it! Hey, where's Perry? Oh, there you are, Agent P. Carl, he fell for it! We were just kidding about the whole magpie costume. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz is up to something. Seek out that wild-eyed miscreant and found out what he's up to. Ooh! Tell him to do it dressed as a rabbit! Ooh, and Agent P, could- could you do it dressed as a bunny? Good one, sir. A big pink bunny.  Perry!  Wait till Jeremy sees how hot I am in my smokin' cave girl outfit. Ooga-booga! Hi, it's Stace. Do you think you could bring a sandwich platter to the party? Sure! Ooh, I'll bring roast beef! Jeremy eats roast beef on Phinedays and Saturferbs. Phineas and Ferb, you're lustin' for a bustin'! Candace! Forget your brothers! Remember? Jeremy. Right. Jeremy. Sandwiches. True love. Your house. Bye! Well, Ferb, let's scout around and see what's what. All right, let's see Jurassic, Cretaceous, Plasticine Oh, here's Paleolithic, down here on the end. Perry the Platypus! Oh, your persistence is insufferable. And by that, I mean completely sufferable. You're just in time, though, to watch me rid the Tri-State Area of one of my biggest pet peeves People who dress as sandwiches to promote restaurants. You see? You see what I mean? What is this? Are- Are you a person or are you a food? For some reason, I don't mind the taco guy so much. Look at his cute little hat. Anyway, the whole thing sickens me to no end, which is why I created the Sandwich Suit Remove-Inator! It sucks all sandwich suits up into the air and then shreds them to teensy, weensy pieces. Today I will fly all over the city and strip anyone dressed as a sandwich, right down to their skivvies! Ugh I've become my mother.  Ooh!   Oh, yeah   After Jeremy sees me lookin' so fly   He's gonna wanna be my guy   Uh-huh, uh-huh  Oh, hi, Stacy! Yes, sandwiches. I'm on it! This will be fantastic! Think of all the practical applications a caveman can have in the modern world. Actually, you know, besides politics, I can't think of anything. But wait till he says what we've done with the wheel, and fire, and shiny objects. We did it! Me Conk. Me Phineas. He Ferb. Conk hungry. Food! Oh no, Conk! That's a carburet or. Uh, seriously, Conk, me go to kitchen for food, while you wait here with Ferb. Wow. Not a very sophisticated palate. Ahh  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm   Uh-huh, uh-huh  Hey, Candace. You think you could spare a sandwich? Well, I'm sure I can spare one. I know how men are about their meat. ""Argh! Me manly man! Me like meat!"" Gee, uh Thanks, sis. Cool outfit, by the way. You should meet our new friend. He's a real Neanderthal. I don't care how buff he is. Me, hang out with one of your friends? Puh-leese. Now run along before I take my sandwich back. And if you even think about trying something funny today, you're gonna get it! Get what? It! Well, if ""it"" is another sandwich, I'll take it now, please. At last, my efforts have come to fruition! And nothing can stop me! Hmm. I told Vanessa if she takes out the big head, she has to fill it up. Ah, yes. All zeroes make it so much easier to balance my check- Perry the Platypus, are you asleep? Oh Sometimes I wonder why I even bother to soliloquize. Where was I? At last- Well, you remember the rest.  Agent P!  Hey, guys! Good news. I've got refreshments! A little something to wash it down? I guess we'd be hungry, too, if we hadn't eaten in 28,000 years. Come on, Ferb. Let's go wrangle up some snacks for our new pal. You stay put, and we'll be back.  Happy, happy sandwich man   Mm-hmm, mm-hmm  Sandwiches! Good news! We got a plethora of sandwiches for ya! Um Conk? Uh oh. Jeremy? Is that you? Wow. Great costume! I hardly recognize you. Yay! It's Candace, and And Jeremy! And you guys are all matchy! Yeah. Hey, everybody. Candace and Jeremy are here! Jeremy, dude! Sweet costume, bro! Okay! You're not my bro! Come on! Let's dance! Ooh! I love this song! Dance with me, Jeremy! Yeah, he really hates techno. Food! Hey, Jeremy. Isn't this a great party? Jeremy, you're so primitive. Woo! Candace Hold that thought. Hello? Hey, Candace. Sorry I'm running late, but I just finished getting ready. Yeah! You look amazing! Wait, what? See ya soon. Who was that? J-J-J-J- Huh? I don't know a J-J-J-J. But if that was Then whoâ You should meet our new friend. He's a real Neanderthal. Neanderthal. Neanderthal. Ooh! Phineas and Ferb are behind this! Mom! Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So, what is it this time? Okay. She says they have a real caveman. Well, you can say what you like about Candace, but there's nothing primitive about her imagination. Well, well, well, what do you know? A hapless sandwich man. Prepare to be eaten by the Remove-Inator! Mother of mayonnaise! Yes! It is functioning properly! Oh no! Perry the Platy- Oof! I demand you let me go! You- You- Friend of Phineas and Ferb! When my Mom gets here, you're gonna be in big trouble. There you are, Conk. Looky looky! Oof! I got you know, Perry the Platyâ Oof! Curse you, Perry the Platyâ Oof! There you go, Conky. There you go.  Agent P!  Ugh What smells like mustard? Huh? That big sandwich! Well, I guess we can't compete with a sandwich like that. They say if you love something, let it go. Especially if it's a caveman. Yeah. Especially if it's a caveman."
"How's the view up there, Ferb? This is the life. The sand, the sea, the sun. The crying? Hey. What's wrong, Buford? Why are you crying? First, let's get one thing straight. I'm not crying. I'm just sweating through my eyes. And second I lost Biff! You mean your goldfish? Yes! He changed my life, you know. I used to be a wimp, like you. But then, one day, at the carnival, I was somehow drawn to this game. And that's how I won my goldfish. I named it Biff, after my mother. It was the happiest day of my life. I finally had a friend. But then I met the local bully. Hello, nerd! Well, well, what have we'd here? Looks like you brought me lunch! I knew I had to defend my friend, so I did what I had to do. After that, I became the bully. And I wasn't afraid of anything or anybody. Except, you know Maybe a giant squid, cause- Come on, those are freaky, right? All suction cuppy and beaky. But then, today Biff and I decided to go for a swim. After a while, I couldn't hear him anymore. I got worried. No! NO! Wow. This is more annoying than when he was bullying us. We gotta do something to get the old Buford back. Maybe we should help him find his fish. Really? You guys would do that? How about a hug? Maybe later. Let Buford hug you. Hey, where's Perry? Come here! Good morning, Agent P. We've intercepted some very surprising footage from a local TV station. Breaking news. A kitten in peril! Up a tree! Oh, no! Wow, a good Samaritan saved her! You see that? Dr. Doofenshmirtz saving a kitten. Looks like he's defecting to the good side! Make contact and present him with our standard welcome package. Monogram out. How about these? Do you think Jeremy would like them? Ooh, these are even better! Hey, Candace, look. Is that a submarine? And aren't those your brothers? I can't believe how fast we put this together. Yes. Usually takes us at least a montage. They're not getting away with this. I know what I'm getting. I'm gonna get this disposable camera, and then I'll finally have proof, and I can bust them! Hey, you gotta pay for that! Right after I pay for this.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Hello? Oh, Perry the Platypus. What do you want? Oh, a gift for me? Oh, how sweet of you! Oh, what's this note attached? ""Congratulations, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, on defecting to the good side""? Oh, no! Not you, too! The- The TV's been repeating that news footage all day! First of all, I'm not going to the good side. Second, I'm going to keep this basket. There's a lot of goodies here. Third, let me tell you what really happened. I was out picking up a few things, and as I was walking out of the store, I tripped on something. And as I fell, out of nowhere this kitten landed in my bag! Ugh! After all my evil attempts to dominate the Tri-State Area, this one little accident has ruined my reputation. Worst of all, it happened on the eve of the Evil Scientists' Fraternity Reunion. If they see that broadcast, I'll be a laughingstock. They might even take away my membership, and then I'll lose all my benefits. Uh, hello? I wasn't done talking yet. T-That was sort of rude. All right, Isabella. Now it's your turn, Baljeet. Why is Buford crying? I'm not cryin'! I'm sweatin' through my eyes! All right, Buford. You're next. That doesn't look very safe. You're doing fine. Hey! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Hey, Buford. Are you sweating out of your eyes? No, I'm just crying! Thanks. I needed that. Ready when you are, Captain. We're ready to go. How's Buford? Buford is doing great! I just hope we'll be able to find my friend Biff. Don't worry. Ferb can communicate with dolphins. They'll help us find your goldfish. Biff! He looked so sweet! How about a hug? Come on! All right, everyone. The dolphins are leading the way. Let's follow those aquatic mammals. Aye aye, Captain! Should me hug you? Uh, Buford, you just stay put. (Song: Fish Out of Water)  When I'm soaking in my bath   I dump you in the tub   There's no need to say another word   You had me at ""glub""   Your bowl became my world   So my world is empty now   All my love's caught in your filter   It needs to get to you somehow   They say that there's plenty of fish in the sea   But you're the only one for me   Without you, I'm a fish out of water   I'm hooked, please throw a line to me  We've got to find that fish. Soon. I've got something on the radar! All right. It's time for a swim! You found my friend? How about a hug? Hug! Biff! Biff! Biff! Buford love Biff! So, Perry the Platypus. Allow me to introduce The Media Erase-inator! Patent pending, Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. It will erase all video signals, print ads, photographs, basically it will erase any image in the entire Tri-State Area! And I will be able to attend my reunion without any embarrassment. Huh? But I- Oof! Hey, guys, look! He missed me. It sure looks like it. There you go, little buddy. You're all safe now. Let's get out of here. I got my Biff back. Thank you, guys! How about a hug? Maybe later. I'm so happy, I could cry! I wish we'd get our Buford back. Uh, Buford? A little help here? Oh, good, you found Biff! Hey. Where are Phineas and Ferb? It's all suction cuppy and beaky! NO! BIFF! Hmm. A giant squid. What are the odds? My money is on the squid. Cut me off a slice of that action. Hey, squid! Drop the goldfish! You and me are gonna dance! So I guess that's that. I do not know how he does it. Always go for the long shots, kid. Good day for Buford, huh? He got Biff back, and I don't think he's afraid of squids anymore. Alright, there's nothing to see here. Everybody back inside. That was amazing! I can't believe I got all of this on film. Hey, Buford. You were really brave out there. What's that supposed to mean? You think I was a wimp before? N-no, not really. But you were a lot more sensitive. What did you say? Yeah. Buford is back! What? I've got to save the camera! Save the camera. Save the camera. Save the camera! Yay! We are back! We made it! I told ya I was comin' out first! Biff and I have some catchin' up to do. Save the camera. Save- Save the cam- Save the camera. Save the camera. Save the camera. Save the camera. Save the camera! Save the camera! Hey, you gotta pay for that. Save the camera! Right after I pay for this. It's going crazy! It's shooting all over willy-nilly, but but really half-nilly! I can't wait to show this to Mom! Finally! I got those boys! Wait! Where are you going? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Oh, come on! Candace, honey. You're all wet. Are you okay? Phineas and Ferb Submarine Dolphins Giant octopus I don't have time for these games. Dry yourself off before you come in. Hey, sis. Have a good swim?  They say that there's plenty of fish in the sea   But you're the only one for me   Without you, I'm a fish out of water   I'm hooked, please throw a line to me"
"Ooh! Merry old England. How I love our yearly holiday to my parents' home. Big Ben. Buckingham Palace. Oh, the White Cliffs of Dover. Stonehenge. Either Iâve grown a lot in the last year, or England's gotten smaller. Here we are. The old homestead. Look! There's Grandma and Grandpa Fletcher. Grandpa! Grandma! Ahh! Phineas, Ferb! My boys! Oh, Ferb. You're looking more like your grandfather. Just look at that resemblance. What do you think, dear? He's a right handsome lad, he is. You can keep these. I've got loads of them. Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Grandma. Candace? Can that be you? You look like a right beauteous princess. Thanks! Ta-ta. We're off to the antique convention. See you tonight. Hey, Gramps. What's that cool castle next door? Oh, aye, that's our neighbors, Lord and Lady Pipping. It used to belong to the Black Knight. The Black Knight? Such a wonderful tale of valor. (Song: Ballad of the Black Knight)  The Black Knight of Worcestershire   Some say it's ""Worcester-sheer""   Went out to fight the dragon   No one else would volunteer   The Hounds of Heck chased after him   Through all the moors and lands   Because his suit of armor   Was recycled dog food cans   The Black Knight of ""Worcester-sheer""   Some say it's ""Worcestershire""   He rode off with his Hounds of Heck   To face the dragon's fire!  Here, immortalized in bronze, is the Black Knight himself and his Hounds of Heck on their final charge to vanquish the dragon. And here is the disastrous results. Legend says that the Black Knight's ghost still haunts these foggy moors, riding in search of the dragon, followed by his pack of fierce hounds. Hey, I know what we should do today. Grandpa Fletcher, let's have a medieval tournament. Just like the knights did in the days of yore. We can have jousting and catapults and not bathe. Way ahead of you on the not bathing. Man, Stacy, everything here is so old, wet and small, and En garde, Stubbings! and Come on, man! Parry and riposte. I've run you through, Stubbings. Yes. Delightful, Master Charles. Clearly, you have mastered the rules of tennis. Uh, Stacy, I'll call you back. I believe it's my serve. Oh, dear. I have punned. Back it up! Back it up! Good. Right there. Lumber over here, suckling pigs over there. Hold it! That pig's barely suckling. What do I look like, a fool? That's what I'm talking about. Carry on. So, you ready to chop some lumber, Ferb? Hey, where's Perry? Ahh, Agent P. Sorry about the tight squeeze, but they're on the metric system. Doofenshmirtz is attending an evil scientists' convention in London. We're sending you in undercover, disguised as evil scientist Dr. Lloyd Wexler, who, incidentally, is the man sitting next to you. Good luck, Agent P. Phineas? Oh. Hi, Candace. What do you think you're doing? I think I'm building a horse. There's a cute boy next door, and I don't want you guys scaring him off by acting like complete freaks. Beg pardon? Hello. I'm Charles Pipping, the fourth. I'm Candace Flynn the first. So, what's all this? This? Uh This is just a- We're putting on a medieval tournament. Medieval tournament? That has to be, without a doubt, the most- Brilliant idea I've heard in years! Exactly. Because who doesn't love whatever happens at one of those Those Things? Wanna join us? Absolutely. We could use my family's castle as a backdrop. And you can be the fair princess in the tower, waiting to be rescued by a handsome knight. Okay! Welcome to Evil-Con, Dr. Lloyd Wexler. Hey! Wait a second. You didn't get your evil button. Enjoy the convention, Dr. Wexler. As the fair princess in the tower, I declare Sir Charles the winner of the tournament Wait a second. Could this be one of those things that backfires horribly on me? Nah. Looks like that armor is big enough for the two of you. That's a great idea. Ferb, I'll take the top half because I tend to do more of the talking, and you take the bottom half because of your incredibly long, willowy legs. Yoo-hoo! Sir Charles! They can't even hear me up here. Yo, Chuck! Ugh! What is going on down there? Ugh! Oh, come on! Hey, guys! I am locked in the tower! That's the spirit, Candace! You sound like a real damsel in distress! Ugh! I have got to get out of here. Let go! Come on, let go! Fine! Have it your way. Well, then, since you chaps are just about put together, I think it's time I popped next door to fetch my own armor. There's something almost disturbing about this. Hey, look. He's back. Okay, Charles. We'll help you get on your horse and do a practice run. You didn't think I'd recognize you, did you? But I do! Youâre Dr. Lloyd Wexler, my greatest hero in all of evil science. Oh, I can't believe I'm actually talking to you! You know, I wrote my thesis on one of your early ransom notes. Gee, you wouldn't mind if I just hung around with you today, would you? Lords and ladies of the court, I declare that this contest is to begin! Are you boys ready over there? Ready, Ferb? We're ready, Grandpa! How about you, Charles? That's the spirit. Look. Our catapult works. Way to hang in there, Charles. Guess we won, Ferb. Yeah! What ho, chaps. Still up for a bit of a joust? Your lance, sir. Charles? Then who's that? Perhaps it was the ghost of the Black Knight. But I wonder where his Hounds of Heck are. It's the ghost of the Black Knight and his hounds of Heck! It makes me so happy to be surrounded by so much evil. Oh, look! It's your autobiography. Itâs always been a dream of mine to have you read it to me. Oh, wait! Wait, wait, wait! Okay, now I'm ready. Come on! Don't be shy. Paragraph 4. ""Upon an evil winterâs heart."" Go ahead. ""Upon an evil winter's heart, the heavy hand of regret infrequently alights.

That's funny. I don't remember you saying ""spec"" so many times. Dr. Wexler, you're a platypus. Perry the Platypus! I want to say that I knew it was you all along, but I can't because I didn't. So now, I guess I'm supposed to surrender, which I might do if we weren't standing in the middle of an evil weapons expo! Ah-ha! Perry the Platypus! Your giant robot dragon is no match for my giant robot Queen Elizabeth I. Hmm. W-Would you mind switching robots with me? Would you mind too terribly? Please? Thanks. Thank you very much. I just prefer this one. Thanks. Now, Perry the Platypus. Your silly, girly Queen Elizabeth I robot is no match for my giant, fire-breathing Ow! Ow! Ow! Wait! Wait! I didn't know she had laser eyes. I-I want to trade back. Well, yours may have laser eyes, but mine breathes fi- That was a stupid design. Commence with round two! Uh, oh! Ferb, I think we put it on sideways this time. It's a draw! This just in. A giant mechanical Queen Elizabeth I and a dragon are rampaging through the country engaged in an apparent duel to the death. And in other news, a new version of Jane Eyre is in the offing. Good heavens, look at that! They're making a new version of Jane Eyre. Obviously, your Queen Elizabeth I is no match for my dragon! That Queen Elizabeth is a tough old bird. Thank you for pressing the self-destruct button. Oh, that's just great! Thank you for pressing the ejection button. Remember to take a parachute with you. Now you tell me! Look, everyone. It's the ghost of the Black Knight. I guess he's still in search of the dragon. To order a parachute, please call our help desk. Self-destruct in 3, 2, 1. Hi, Charles. Jolly good, old bean. Ah! There you are, Perry. Hello. We had the most amazing time. Look! I found this 19th century barometer. Anything interesting happen' round here? I hear there's a new version of Jane Eyre in the offing."
"But, Mom, it's true. The boys built an elevator to the moon in the backyard today. Last time I checked, the yard was noticeably moon-elevator free. It's true. But We were up there! Ferb did the whole ""one giant step"" thing. Check out this moon stuff we brought back! Hmm? Oh. You boys are so adorable. Ah! You don't believe it. I'm so over this. Oh Candace, revel in your brothers' imagination. Makes life so much more fun. Pushing the boundaries of time and space sure makes a guy tired. See? How fun is that? Night, boys. Night, mopey. ""See? How fun is that?"" If only they'd believe me Look at this. I got a traffic ticket from that camera they installed across the street. Oh, that blasted device picks up everything on the block 24 hours a day. Doesn't it run out of tape? Oh, no. It's on a compressed CD thingamabob. It can store months of digital video. Video. Hon, you know we drive on the right. Yes, yes, so you keep telling me. Gotcha! Excellent trick, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but we are about to give you the most important mission of your career. Our computer indicates that a city security camera located near your civilian hideout has recorded your comings and goings as a secret agent. It's crucial to the agency's security that you get those recordings and bring them back to HQ for special disposal. I'm just borrowing this!  La-la-la-la-la  There it is! The elevator to the moon. Ha! And the time they built the rollercoaster. And the beach. And the roller rink! Ooh! Can it be? Actual proof? Everything they've done over the summer? Oh, Perry. It's so beautiful! Candace, you okay? Your muffled emotion woke us up. What'cha watchin'? Oh, just a little summer mini-series called ""evidence""! Oh, cool, our moon elevator! Mom would love this! I wonder if she's still up. Let's show her! Yes! Let's show Mom. Oh, Perry, Perry, Perry. I will remember this night always. Just think. On this very computer are the deliciously incriminating images from that CD I borrowed that will finally bust my brothers! All right, Candace. What's going on in there? Mom, I finally got the evidence that'll prove that Oh! Not this again! Show me in the morning. How's 7 o'clock sound? And you two! Outta here! We're gonna pencil her in for 7:30. Nine! Make that 9 o'clock.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   After hours  What is it? Oh-Oh, Perry the Platypus. Wait. Uh, hold on one second. What? The pressures of an evil life! I need a grind guard. Wait a minute. Why are you here? You're not due to shatter my plans till tomorrow. Oh. Come on in. Hi. I'm Norm. That's it? You- You just want to borrow Norm? My giant robot man? Fine. Knock yourself out. I'm going back to bed. Just so you know, he's a little low on oil. Oh, and-and, Perry the Platypus- I don't want to see one scratch on that machine. Hi. I'm Norm. Hey, Candace. Ferb wants to get started on the multimedia presentation for Mom. Can we borrow the CD? No way, Phineas. There's no way I'm lettin' this baby out of my sight. This is the single greatest moment in my life, and there is nothing you little creeps can do to take it away from me. Hello, children. I'll take that. My name is Norm. What was that? I don't know, but it was cool. Keep it down! So you guys didn't make that? No, but I want one. But that thing ran off with my disk! My evidence! Don't worry, Candace. We'll help you get it back. You guys would help me bust you? Sure. If it'll make ya happy. Plus, battling a giant robot how cool is that? Excellent! Let's go kick some robot heinie! What a lovely evening. There he is! Uh-oh. We need to get the lead out. Switching to hyper-transportation mode. We're gonna need a faster bike. Any word from Agent P? No, sir. So I guess all we can do is wait. And hope, sir. And hope. And also wait. I already did ""wait,"" Carl. Did we do ""hope""? Ugh! I didn't become a major so I could sweat out a vaudeville routine with an intern. Of course not, sir. So, anyone know any good songs? How about you, Agent D? Agent C? Carl, remind me again why all the agents are animals. Estimated time to destination, We'll be there in no time! Warning. Oil level low. I could sure use an oily beverage.  And the kitty goes   And the owl goes   And the doggy goes   And the turkey goes   And the turkey goes?  Ahem. Sir, we lost Agent T last November. Ooh! Right. Ahem.  And that's how the animals go, go, go,   And that's how the animals go  Okay, everyone. One more time with feeling. Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh? Whoop. Here we go again. Uh-oh. Someone forgot to replace the oil cap. I guess I'm walking. Go get him, Ferb! Hey, kids. This is not a gymnasium! Boy. I'm sure in a pickle. Whoo-hoo! Perhaps I should've worn cleats. Candace! Help! The oil! I-I'm slipping! I'm coming! Hold on, Phineas! Candace! But, Candace, the disk. You didn't save it. What? And let you fall? You may be a pain, but you are my brother. Besides, I still have that big rocket for evidence. What happened to the rocket? Hmm. Good thing we got off of that, huh? All right, Ferb! You got the disk! Cool! All right! Ferb? Ferb, where are you going? Ferb? What did I miss? Huh? Well, that was almost weirder than the giant robot.  Perry!  Ah! Agent P, I trusted that your mission was a complete success. Good work! Now, hand it over for the special disposal procedure. Careful, now. Careful. Got it. Agent P, you've saved this organization. If there's anything we can do for you in return, don't hesitate. Oh, I can't believe it! It seems my video traffic ticket's been cleared. I guess there is someone up there looking out for me.  Oh, the chicken goes   And the dog goes   And the worm goes  Outstanding, Agent W! Agent C, don't do that.  And the new guy goes  I'm Norm. You know, Carl, it's weird that he is not an animal. We should fire him. I'm already on it, sir."
"Oh, my gosh, Stacy! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! Jeremy asked me if I could meet him at the fair later today next to the Ferris wheel. Oh, no! I almost forgot I'm scared of heights! Oh, what am I going to do? Candace! We're leaving now! Mom! I'm having a teenage crisis! Don't forget we're going bowling. We need you to keep an eye on the boys. Preferably two. Bowling? That sounds fun. Hey, Dad. Is it alright if we use that old lawn-bowling set? Sure thing, boys! Knock yourselves out. Toodles! You know, Ferb, with a few modifications, we could really zip up this old lawn-bowling set. Hello, Phineas. What'you doing? Ooh! I just sounded like Isabella. We're gonna build the world's biggest and best bowling-ball game! Well, according to The Most Pointless Book of World Records the world's largest bowling ball is four feet in diameter. Four feet? Ferb, we can beat that record in our sleep. You know, the officials from The Most Pointless Book of World Records will be at the fair today, at 3 o'clock, handing out awards. Ferb, get the tools. We've got a record to shatter. And then you will be in the next volume! Is that absolutely necessary? Why? Does it bug ya? Well, yes, a little. Then, yeah, it's necessary. All right. Fair enough. Hey, where is Perry?  Perry the Platypus!  Ooh. Sorry about that, Agent P.  Herman the Hedgehog!  Good morning, Agent P. We've tracked Doofenshmirtz to an old abandoned warehouse, and he's made some suspicious purchases. a hotdog vendor's cart, a medium-sized parka, and a pair of red flannel long johns with a flap in the back. Don't ask us how we know. Get out there and kick some Doofen-butt. Wow! That is one big bowling ball. Hey, look at that, Ferb! Told you we could do it in our sleep. So, what do you think I should wear to the fair tonight? I'm thinking my favorite red blouse with my white skirt and red matching socks. Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back. Yeah! Nice job! That was amazing! Wow, Phineas! Another strike! That makes four in a row! In your face, Buford! Yes! What he said! In the face! Uh-uh, I mean You will get him next time. Clearly. Ferb, did you get that strike? Who's next? Phineas, just what do you think you're doing out here? Candace, you're just in time. It's your turn. Just wait until Mom hears about But then again, you guys always seem to make everything disappear before Mom gets home. But if I take the evidence to her at the Bowl-A-Rama, then she'll have to believe me! Oh, Candace. You were right about Phineas and Ferb this whole time. We should've believed you. And just to express how sorry we are, here's my credit card. You have our permission to ruin us financially. Candace, that is so cool how you busted your brothers like that! Will you marry me? So, you wanna give it a try? I do, Jeremy. I mean Uh I'd love to give it a try! All right. I'll show you how it works. Well, first of all, the cockpit's on a gyroscope so it stays level. Here's your monitor, and this is the trackball you use to steer. Now, no matter what, never hit the gyro stabilizer lock button! It'll disable the gyroscope, and you'll spin around like a greased pig on roller skates. Yeah, yeah, use the trackball. Don't hit the button. I got it! All right. You seem to know what you're doing. Do I ever? This is a piece of cake. Bowl-R-Ama, here I come! Okay, Candace. Try to take it slow at first! Way to go, Candace! Where's she going? She's freestylin'! We've gotta follow her and see what she does! Let's go, team!  Doofenshmirtz Abandoned Self Storage!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. Right on time. It seems like you've got quite a chill there! I want you to meet my latest creation The Giant Robotic Penguin Icy-Freeze-Your-Socks-Off Breath-inator ..thingy! First, I will unleash my giant penguins at the fair today, so they may begin freezing the entire city! Then, I will sell all the citizens of Danville my organic, yet highly addictive Doof brand hot chocolate. Because, you know, who doesn't enjoy a nice cup of hot chocolate when it's so cold out? The first cup will be free, of course. But then the second will also be free. But then the third will cost a million dollars! That way, I only have to sell three, and I will already be a millionaire. So, Perry the Platypus, as they say in Mexico do svidaniya! Down there, that's two vidaniyas. She's headed for the Bowl-A-Rama! You know, dear, Candace hasn't called. Oh, don't worry. I'm sure the kids are having a ball. Ooh! That's gotta hurt. Oh, no! So where does this lead? Huh. Heck if I know. Ferb, the map of Danville's underground. Looks like she's headed downtown. Stop, Stop, stop, Stop, stop, stop, Stop, stop, stop, stop, Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Oh, good, it stopped! Wait! Go, Go, go, Go, go, go, Go, go, go, go, Go, go, go, go, go! That's one big bowling ball, Bob. You betcha, Barry. Here she comes! Go, Candace! And there she goes. All right, guys! To Seventh Street! Go Candace! Go! Go Candace! Hey. Baljeet, what's the world record for the largest pinball machine? I am not sure, but I know we can beat it. Okay, everybody. Split up and let's keep her in play until we get to the fair. (Song: Pin-bowlin')  Pin, pin, pin, pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo   Yeah!   Pin, pin, pin, pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo   Better put your quarter in and take me for a spin   But you gotta pull the lever back before we begin   We'll take the trip for two around the table   Before we drop  I'm out of control!  Keep your fingers on the flippers and your eye on the ball   We'll be bouncing off the bumpers   And bangin' off the walls   Gonna run the score up so high   You'd think your ears are gonna pop   And we ain't never gonna tilt   'Cause, baby, that's not the way we will  Woo-hoo!  We're gonna pin, pin, pin, pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo   Pin, pin, pin, pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo   Pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo   Pin-bowlin' along   Doo doo doo doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo   Pin-bowlin'   Yeah!  Way to keep it goin', Ferb. Oop, better luck next time, little man. Isabella, darlin'! Set me up, Shady Joe. I'm feelin' lucky. Oh! That's my girl! You give it your best shot. Help yourself. Anything from the top shelf. Welcome, Danvillians, to the World's Most Pointless Records Awards! Let's meet some of our record holders. Here we have Cletus with the world's hairiest pig. Next to him is Margaret with the world's stinkiest cheese. And finally, we got little Timmy holding the world's fattest gerbil. Let's have a big round of applause for the most pointless world-record winners! Wait! We've got two more World's Most Pointless Records of our own! Well, then. Atep right up, sonny, and tell everybody what they are. Our first entry is for the world's largest bowling ball. And the other is for the world's largest game of pinball! Wow! Well, let's see 'em! Wait for it. Looks like we have two more World's Most Pointless Records! Wait. Two records in one day? That's another world record! To the fair, my pets, where the freezing of the Tri-State Area will begin! Wait. Wait, what is that? A giant bowling ball? NO! Oh, Candace, you made it. I was thinking you weren't gonna show. Although, you know, usually we get on at the bottom. We'd especially like to thank our sister, Candace. We couldn't have done it without you, sis! You know, your brothers are all right. Hey, are- are you okay? Oh, afraid of heights. Don't worry. I got ya. How about you, Perry? Is there anything you'd like to add? Step right up, ladies and gentlemen. Step right up! It's only a dollar to see the mysterious Penguin-Man. Is he man? Is he penguin? Or perhaps some logic-defying amalgam of man and penguin? A manguin, if you will. I used to have goals. They were evil goals, but they were goals."
"Prepare to feel the wrath of Buford. Don't bring that smack-talk around here. This is my house! Technically, it's our garage. She's on a roll. No girl has ever beaten Buford. Watch and learn. It takes a highly trained eye and a quick wrist to To score like that, Buford? Hey! I wasn't ready. Stacy, what am I going to do? Jeremy's coming over to take my picture for his photo class. So, what's the? Oh! Yeah. You think he'll notice? This is the worst bad hair day ever! I'm officially freaking out! I'll call and cancel. No, wait! Just wear a hat. Yeah! A hat! How's this? Well, your hair looks better. Yeah, but the strap is cutting off my I'm gonna need something stronger. Alright! This is the tie-breaker. I thought the last two were. Nah. It's this one. Tell you what I'm going to do, Buford. I'm going take this ball and I'm going hit into your goal in one shot. Oh, is that right? Absolutely. And you want to know the funny part? There's nothing you can do about it! Bring it! You missed. Wait for it. What about this? Ain't that how it works, Buford? Wow. Nice foosing, Isabella. Thanks. You guys are making such a racket that I can't focus. And I need time to fix my hair. 'Cause when Jeremy gets here, I don't wanna be wearing this stupid- Hey, Candace. Hello, Jeremy. Ha! You look sporty. Oh, you like it? Well, that's perfect. The sport shoot. Well, that didn't really count, 'cause it's just a dainty little girls' game. It could be the biggest game in the world, and girls could still beat boys. Biggest game in the world. Did you get that, Phineas? Yeah, we're on it. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Great. It's boys against girls. And to give ya a fair shot, I'll even take Shrimpy here. I am honored. So, who's on your team? Candace, can you be on the girls' team with me? Isabella, I'm a little busy right- Well, perfect. Real action shots. Oh, you'll look great. Really? Okay, I'm in. Hey, where's Perry?  Doobie doobie doo-wah  There you are, Agent P. Sorry about the stairs. Our elevator maintenance guy is on a corporate retreat with our slide-waxing guy. Anyway, our intelligence tells us that Doofenshmirtz has been shopping around for a show dog. We need you to infiltrate the pet store and uncover his evil plan. Me? I'm goin' home early. It's taco night.  Agent P!  So those are the official rules for the F-Games. Any questions? Yeah. Why are they called the F-Games? Yeah! Yeah! Why is that? ""F"". For Ferb. Ohh. I, too, have a question. If I miss the third shuttlecock with my rubber chicken, does Buford have to jump over the chokecherry bush before or after the girls finish peeling their tangerines? After! Aw, man, pay attention. You're embarrassing me. All right. Then let's get out there. (Song: F-Games) Wow. Definitely big.  Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na na na na-na na   Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na na na na-na na   Don't wanna hear no smack talk   You wanna call your mama, here's a dime   It's time to walk the walk-walk   You gotta rapid skate, get on the line   So get your game on   Or else it's shame on you   Gimme an ""F""   F!   Gimme an ""F   F-Games   Are you a contender?   Gimme an ""F""   F!   Gimme an ""F""   F-Games   In the battle of the genders!   Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na   Yeah   Na-na na-na na na na na-na na   Yeah!   Na-na na-na na   Na-na na-na na   F-Games   Na-na na-na na na na na-na na  Ooh. Extra points for recycling. The girls' score is now the square root of pi, while the boys still have a crudely drawn picture of a duck. Clearly, it's still anyone's game. Yes, I-I'm looking for a purebred show dog. Well, we have various award-winning breeds to choose from. Ooh, what about him? He's perfect. Oh, yes. Coochie-coochie-coo. You are Doctor D's precious little puppy, aren't you? Sir, I'm not even sure if that's a dog. Don't try to wheel and deal with me. I get a big alimony check every month, so money's no object. Oh. Well, in that case, he's ten thousand dollars. Oh, coochie-coochie. You are my little coochie-coochie. You are my ticket into the Danville Dog Show. And together, we will make them pay for all I have suffered. Back when I was just a little schtumpel, my father came home with a brand-new spitzenhound puppy that he won in a game of ""Poke the Goozim With a Stick"". My father said the dog was like the son he never had, and named him Only Son. Only Son became an award-winning show dog, bringing my father fame and fortune, while I was forced to be the lawn gnome. Y-You remember that story, right? With my neighbor, Kenny? I-I don't have to go through- O-Okay. So, to recap, my entire fragile self-esteem is totally dependent on your performance today at the dog show. But, y-you know No pressure. And don't worry about your lack of training and experience, because I have an ace in the hole. This! The Misbehavinator. It, uh Well It-It does what the name implies. Watch this. Bad dog! Ah, nothing can stop us now. Hey- Hey, what was all that about?  Perry!  Perry the Platypus? Uh.. Now I'm very embarrassed about all that ""coochie-coochie-coo"" stuff. Wait, wait. Where- Where are you going? Bring back my Misbehavinator! And now for the tiebreaker event. Giant foosball. Get ready to foos. This is so my game. But didn't Isabella beat you at this earlier? Quiet, you! Ready, Candace? I feel like a kebab. I, too, feel a certain element of kebabism. I said quiet, you. Let's play. There's the first ball. I feel this may not be the best way to block a shot. Clearly I was- Clearly I was wrong about that. That was most effective. What? Candace blocks. The ball is up Candace. It's going It's going It's going Oh, my. Oh! Isabella, I have feet too, you know. Sorry, Candace. Suddenly I am not feeling so fresh. Looks like we've reached the all-important fruit level! The what? And it looks like the final ball is drifting lazily into neutral territory. Folks, we may be looking at a draw. Oh, no, we're not. Buford, no! That would be cheating. Boys rule! Ah, my hair! Jeremy's gonna see my hair! Uh-oh. Oof! They've done it! The girls have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat!  She's Candace!  Wow, Candace, your hair looks great. Really? Well, Buford, that was a great game. Come on, be a good sport. Like I said before, losing to a girl doesn't count. What I meant to say was I had a wonderful time. I guess you were right. Girls are just as good as boys. Thanks again. Woo-hoo! The F-Games rock. That was completely out of character. T minus three two one Thanks, guys. It was a lot of fun. The next F-Games will be even better. Yeah, but much better is when Mom sees this. Look at that thing. I'd just like to see you try to get rid of that before Mom- Hey, kids! What's new? Nothing, Mom. Absolutely nothing is new. Well, your hair sure looks new. I like it. Thanks. It took a lot to get it this way. Oh, there you are, Perry."
"Isn't today great? Today is such a great day! Everything is so great! My, Candace. What's got you in such a good mood? Jeremy just asked me to go play croquet with him in the park! Okay, well, be sure to be home in time for the barbecue. We're gonna be watching Kermillian's Comet fly past the Earth. A comet? Cool! It only comes around every seventy three and a half years. We'll be barbecuing steaks for the whole neighborhood! Why don't you bring Jeremy? You had me at ""steaks""! Why is it called Kermillian's Comet, Dad? Kermillian's Comet was named after an ancient Danville astronomer, Augustus Kermillian, who discovered the comet. It's also been said that if you wish on a comet, your wish will come true. Wow! Come on, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do today! By the way, where is Perry? Agent P. Sorry to disturb you, but we have an emergency. We've just been informed that all steaks in the Tri-State area have disappeared. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it. Go lay your smack-down on him, Agent P. The fate of the world rests entirely in your hands. What? The fate of the world? Uh Welcome to our telethon. If you're just joining us, your dollars are helping us to find a cure for, um Antidisestablishmentarianism. Goodness me, that sounds dreadful! Oh, it is. It Um Makes you look pale and weak, like this young lad. Oh, dear. The poor thing. Look at that. Wait a minute. Antidisestablishmentarianism? That's more of an ideological stance than a disease. Isn't it? Uh! Well Look at that. Seems they just found a cure. Thanks to all the viewers who donated. Bye now. Honey, you ready to go? Yeah, sure. Hey, did you know they've just found a cure for antidisestablishmentarianism? Great. I can finally take off this puce ribbon. (Song: Candace (Who's That Girl))  La-la-la-la-la-la   La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la   La-la-la-la  Hey, Candace. Hi, Jeremy! You remember my little sister Suzy. But I thought it was just going to be us. Well, my folks asked me to keep an eye on Suzy for the afternoon. Who's my favorite girl? I am! I am! Would you show me how to play croquet? Well, sure thing, kiddo. Is this pie homemade? Yeah, my Mom made it. I'll go get some plates out of the picnic basket. Well, tell her that it's justâ Candace, what happened? I don't know. Wait here. I'll go get a towel. So we meet again, Candace Flynn. There's only room for one girl in Jeremy's life. And that is me. And here he comes now. Jeremy! Here's the towel. Sorry about the pie, Jeremy. IâI don't know what happened. Oh, that's okay. You want a soda? Yeah, that'd be great. Here, take mine. Oh, thank you. That was reallyâ Candace, there's some street performers over there thatâ I'll go get another towel. These are the blueprints for our giant observatory, Ferb. First thing we need is a lens. Cool. Hey, Ferb. New hairdo. Check it out. Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'? Ferb and I are building a giant observatory to watch Kermillian's Comet tonight. Ooh, that sounds like fun. We're gonna put on a laser light show. And, as a grand finale, we're gonna laser our faces into the comet. That way, when it comes back in seventy-three and a half years, we can all show our grandchildren. Oh, yeah. My parents are cooking steaks for everyone. You had me at ""our grandchildren."" What?! Steaks! Youâ You had me at ""steaks."" Okay. We need to get ten T-bones No steaks? Oh, dear. Let's try uptown. So, you wanna see those street performers? Sure. I'm gonna go grab some snacks. I'll meet you over there. Okay. Come on, Suzy. Let's go Suzy? Suzy? Here you go. Well, there's plenty for everyone. Well, hello there, little girl. Hello. Could I have some nuts to feed the squirrels? I'd love to, but I only have one left. Gimme the nut! Thank you. Suzy? Suzy? Where are you?  Now somebody, anybody, everybody scream  (Song: S.I.M.P.

She had actual squirrels in her pants. We just got served.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  One moment, please. Perry the Platypus? What are you looking at? Oh, these. Yes, these are my latest invention. Steak specs. I came up with the idea after your last little visit. With these on, you don't have to constantly hold a piece of steak to your black eye. See? See? I plan on mass-producing these. I'll make millions. Let me show you. I've stolen all the steaks in the Tri-State Area, and I keep them here in my steak containment unit or SCU (skÊ), for short, or maybe it should be SCU (sku). I'm a little on the fence about- Wait a minute. What are you doing? Oh, that? That's just a giant heat ray in case I want to do something evil later. Why don't you stay here with Suzy, and I'll go buy you some ice cream? No, no, no. You stay here. I'll go buy the ice cream. Oh, man. We got served again. I'm goin' back to culinary school. Candace? Here you go. All they had was fudgie bars. Candace, what happened? There were so many of 'em. The horror. The horror. Maybe you should sit down. So what happened again? Are you okay? I have something that will make you smile. I want you to meet Mr. Chippy. Get that sick creature away from me! Candace, it's okay. It's just a squirrel. That's not the one I'm talking about. What happened to her? I don't know. But these violent mood swings are probably a sign of deeper emotional imbalance. What? Bubbles. Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Observa-Ferb-atory. Step this way, please. Single-file line. The laser show will begin momentarily. Please, no flash photography or cell phones. Thank you. All right, Ferb. That's everyone. Kill the lights. Space - it's really big. It's filled with planets of all shapes and sizes and millions of shiny stars. Space has also got huge comets soaring through it, including one named after the ancient Danville astronomer, Kermillian. What's going on? Phineas. And now, behold Kermillian's Comet. Commence laser-engraving sequence. Phineas! You guys put your face on a comet? Ooh, I'm telling Mom. Good idea, Candace. She's gonna love it. Wait. You- You're not trying to hack into the ray-gun system, are you? Wait, what am I worried about? You'll never guess my super-secret password. ""Doofalicious"". Access granted. Okay, that's enough. System overload. Ugh! This should be fun. Ooh. Ooh. Wow. Ferb, take it easy with the lasers. Remember, we still got an 8:30 show. Can I have everyone's attention? Please don't panic. We're experiencing technical difficulties. Calmly head towards the exits in a calm, orderlyâ Okay, now you can panic. Ferb, what's happening? That was so cool. Not the SCU! (skÊ) Not theâ You know, now that I'm looking at the sign, I think it really does look more like SCU (sku). Not the SCU (sku)! Come back here! Perry the Platypus, come back. Ooh. Something smells delicious. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I can't believe we drove around the whole city and couldn't find one steak. Mom! They used a laser to carve their faces in the comet. Candace, I don't see anything. No, no, no. You could only see it from their observatory. Come on, come on. See? Well, I don't see an observatory. Sorry, everyone! We looked all over town, and we couldn't find any steaks. Ohh! Oh, man! Oh man! No! I even brought my own plate! At least we can all enjoy Kermillian's Comet together. Yeah, before it disappears for another seventy three and a half years. Just wait! When I'm eighty-eight, you will be so busted! Actually, you'd be eighty-eight and a half. Whatever! So, honey, make a wish. I wish we had steaks. Yeah. Me too. I'll be honest. I didn't think that would work. I did not bring a plate. I thought they would be provided. Dude, we keep getting served. Yeah, I'm gettin' used to it. Candace? Are you okay? You mean you came over to check on me? Of course. Oh! There you are, Perry. So, that's Kermillian's Comet. Did you make a wish? Yes. And did it come true? It just did.  Who ya' got back home watering your plants?   S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants   How can I qualify for government grants?   S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants   Yeah   Hypnotize me, put me in a trance   S-I-M-P, squirrels in my pants   Get an Aunt Florence living in France   She can't see theâ  Squirrels in my pants!  Step right over and watch me put it down   S. to the I. to the M. to the P.  Squirrels! Squirrels!  Step right over and watch me put it   S. to the I. to the M. to the P.  Wow. She had actual squirrels in her pants."
"Hey, Candace. When I heard you were sick, I came right over. Today, I am your servant. Gosh. What a good friend. I brought you a get-well package. Miso soup- heats itself, don't ask- Who Wants to Be a Total Idiot 3, and rocky road ice cream! You wouldn't want everything to be good for you. And you don't have to worry about your brothers. Your mom says they're off playing miniature golf. How lame is that? Hey, guys. What gives? Little Duffers has closed its doors forever. And I was all set to destroy you on the mini links. I was gonna bury you on the fairway. Metaphorically, right? Oh, yeah, right. But how can they close Little Duffers? I've been coming here since I was little. Littler, anyway. Huh? Sorry, lads. But Little Duffers is officially out of business. But this is the only miniature golf course in Danville. Aye. People just don't respect the game anymore. They think it's just golf in miniature. But it's not! It's miniature golf. Gosh. It's a sad thing when a town loses a major sports franchise. But kids today only go for the stuff that's all shiny and new and high-tech. Ah, the Scotsman in me tells me to hold on stubbornly to the bitter end! But then again, I'm half Irish. That's too bad. This was the perfect day for miniature golf. Hey, everyone. I know what we're gonna do today. Hi, Mom. We'll be out back building a miniature golf course. That's fine, dear. After all, it's only golf in miniature. What's that? Your brothers own a giant crane? No way! They are so bu bu bu What's this? Dancing weasels? Oh, ""busted."" Oh, you want me to bust your brothers. You know, you really gotta work on your penmanship. Find out what they're up to, and report back to me. No problemo. I'll handle it. Ah-ah Achoo! Awesome plan. We should be finished before lunch. Listen up, twerps. Just because Candace is sick doesn't mean you can get away with anything. I am now her eyes, ears and mouth. Basically I'm her whole face. What a good friend. Yeah, right? She wrote you this message. Hm Weasels. I think she means it. I knew they were weasels! So anyway, what's all this? We're only making the greatest miniature golf course in the whole world! Or at least in Danville. Isn't it kind of big? Well, you know, it isn't golf in miniature. It's miniature golf! And it's so unbelievably cool! With a windmill and a dinosaur, andâ You must not be seduced by the coolness! Focus! You're right. I can do this if I stay focused. Focus. Focus. Focus. Hey! Where's Perry?  Dooby, dooby, doo, ba   Dooby, dooby, doo  Just looking over your request for vacation time. We're ready to approve it, but there's one small problem. And by ""small problem,"" I mean ""big problem."" And by ""approve it,"" I mean ""deny it."" Sorry, Agent P. I know you've been putting in a lot of extra hours, but we've got word that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has bought a new house in the suburbs. Three bedroom, two and a half baths, central air. Nice place. We need you to find out what he's up to. Here's his new address. Good luck, Agent P.  Perry!   Doofenshmirtz's house in the suburbs!  Okay. Focus, focus, focus. You can do this, Stacy. Don't get seduced by the coolness. Wuh-oh. ""Elevator to the coolness""? This is so cool! Okay, Ferb. You're up. Phineas. Oh. Hey, Stacy. What do you think of our miniature golf course? It's so I mean, I've come to deliver a message with an unimpressed demeanor. Cool! We're on our way to the next hole. Why don't you come along? Well Okay. But- Great! So, Stacy, what was it you were gonna tell us? Oh! Right. Well, Candace is gonna- call! What kind of hole is this, anyway? It's the air hockey hole. Check it out. Wicked! Hey! Look at us. We're glidin' on air. Hole in one! I mean, goal! I mean Yeah! We all, like, freaked out! Can you believe it? No! No, I can't. Did you, by any chance, tell them I was going to call Mom? Uh, I-I was gonna, but the elevator and the slide, and Hush! Focus! We need evidence! Two words Video phone. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain. Translated into evil. Chapter one. ""Tom Sawyer's dislike of Aunt Polly was rivaled only by his hatred of puppies."" Waah! Oof! Ugh! Perry the Platypus! You scared the dunkelschtump out of me! Don't you know it's rude to bust in on someone's new home unannounced and A housewarming gift? Oh, how thoughtful! How thoughtful. Thank you. Look, Perry the Platypus, as much as I hate to admit it, I'm not really up to anything terribly nasty today. So, you-you're welcome to chill out here for the day. It's nice, huh? Huh? What do you think? If you need, I-I'll even sign something that says I was up to no good. Are you catching this? Yes! Yes! This time we've got them. But you need to get the boys in the picture. There you are. We've been looking all over for you. Me? You gotta play through. Hold this. Stacy, what are you doing? Focus! Nice focus. Aahh! What was that? Sounds like the crowd's going wild. That is so cool! Aah! Whoo-hoo! Ya-hoo! Yes! Yes! Yes! No, no, no, no! Aah! Well, here we are. (Song: Disco Miniature Golfing Queen) Weâve reached the final hole. You better put on your dancin' shoes.  Steppin' on the greens in her designer jeans   She's a Disco Miniature Golfing Queen   Wearin' plaid and sequins, she can make the scene   She's a Disco Miniature Golfing Queen   Like a vision from a disco golf magazine   With her putter, she's a hole-in-one machine   She can dance and sing and really shake her thing   She's a Disco Miniature Golfing Queen   She's a Disco Miniature Golfing Queen!  Poor Stacy. What was I thinking? Okay, Candace. Looks like it's up to you. Ah This is nice, eh? But, you know, I-I don't think suburban life is for me. I'm thinking of just adding a breakfast nook and flipping the property. The main problem is my neighbor, Phil. He is truly diabolical. His fruit falls into my yard. His dog poops on my lawn. He leaves his trash cans out too long, and Oh, I'm at my wit's end! And the worst, the absolute worst, is his leaf blower. Okay, that's it! Time to end this once and for all! And no one is stopping me! Behold, Perry the Platypus! The ultimate suburban weapon The Atomic Leaf Blower-inator! This will be the last time his stray leaves blow onto my lawn. Yah! Aahh! Turn it off! Turn it off! Good, just like I planned. Now, I'll blow every leaf onto his property! At least the golf course can't vanish if they're still in it. Come on, Mom. Curse you, Phil the neighbor! Candace, what are you doing out of bed? Wasn't Stacy taking care of you? She was seduced by the coolness. Follow that miniature golf course! What does that even mean? Look behind you! I don't see anything. You know you should've been setting aside a portion of your profits over the years with the understanding that that money would be used to upgrade your investment. What did you think? A shiny new miniature golf course would just fall out of the sky? You'd be surprised what falls out of the sky in Danville. Oh, isn't that great? They remodeled Little Duffers. I still don't know how we ended up at Little Duffers. I don't know why we didn't build it here in the first place. Oh. There you are, Perry. Candace! Did you hear? I won! I actually won in miniature golf! It just goes to show you that if you focus, you can accomplish anything. Sorry, I forgot to bust your brothers. It's okay. I'm sorry I got you sick."
"You know what we're going to do today, Talbo? It's time to test The teleport! Eureka! Now I can teleport myself, anywhere in the world! Wouldn't you have to take one of those teleport things there first? Oh-oh, but then you'd already be there. It kinda renders the whole thing redundant, doesn't it? Do you want me to remove your tongue again, Talbo? Cool! I know what we can do today, Ferb. No, not the tongue thing. The teleporter. Hey, boys. Hey, Mom. Ferb and I are gonna build a teleport device. Oh, great. I wish you could teleport to where my earrings are. I've lost them. The dangly smoky topaz or the hoops? Hoops. Oh She must be wearing the blue dress. We'll keep an eye out for 'em. Come on, Ferb. We're burnin' daylight. Teleports completed! Hey. Where's Perry? Ew! You're not supposed to be here. I told Phineas and Ferb to keep you outta my room. I'm gonna give them a piece of my mind. Mom! Do you know where Phineas and Ferb are? They're in the garage, honey. Oh, by the way, Jeremy's gonna be here soon. Please try not to embarrass me in front of him again. What do you mean, again? Remember my fifth-grade graduation with the inflatableâ Oh, that's right. My bad. This is a glorious day for mankind. Ready with the camera so we can document it? Cheese! How many times have I told you to keep Perry out of my room?! What are those? Teleports. Pretty cool, huh? You guys are so bustâ Cool. It worked. Candace? Are you okay? Wait a second. How did you guys get so big? And why is my hand green? I'm an ugly, smelly platypus ! I'm a platypus! I'm a platypus! Amazing. I'm a platypus! I'm a platypus! You and Perry going through the teleport at the same time must have switched your brains. Oh, you think? You guys better change me back now or I'll Wait. Jeremy's gonna be here soon! Not a problem, sis. We'll just put you both through the teleporter again. Hey. Where's Perry? Uh, I-I mean Candace. I mean Perry in Candace's body?  Dooby-dooby doo ba   Dooby-dooby doo ba   Dooby-dooby doo  I wonder where he scampered off to. Any ideas, Ferb? What'cha doin'? Hey, Isabella. We built a teleportation device, and accidentally switched Candace and Perry's brains. Really? That's so cool! You wouldn't think it was so cool if you smelled like this. We're looking for Perry so we can switch them back to normal. Wanna help? You betcha.  Dooby-dooby doo   Dooby-dooby doo   Dooby ba doo  Carl! How many times have I told you? Lift the seat when you're done. Sorry! Oh, there you Uh-oh. Carl, I think we have a breach of security. What do you mean, sir? There's a teenage girl in here. A teenage girl? Agent P? Brilliant disguise! Man! I thought it was a real girl. Now for your mission. Slushy the Clown statues have disappeared all over the Tri-State area. Without that clown, there's just nothing fun about lunch anymore. Carl and I have lunch at Mr. Slushy Burger every day.  Pickles so green and meat so brown   Lunchtime's fun with Slushy the Clown  We really miss that clown. So Ahem. Drop whatever you're doing and find out what happened to those statues. By lunchtime. Candace? Hey, Candace! Awesome scooter! Hey, you wanna come to Slushy Burger with my mom and me? Was that a yes or a no? I don't know. But I like the hat. Yeah. It's a good look for her. Come on, guys! Are you almost done? Jeremy's gonna be here soon. Ferb's printing up the last one now. Looks great, Ferb. ""Lost platypus. Looks like a girl""? Why did you use that picture? I don't want anyone to see me like that! That's the only picture we had. Good job, Isabella! Glad I could help! Now everyone will see that horrible picture! Okay, Candace. Just stay here while we post these around town. We'll find Perry in no time.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Pickles so green and meat so brown   Lunchtime-  Not anymore! A teenage girl? Perry the teenage girl?! Sorry about the tight fit, but, you know, if I knew you were going to disguise yourself as a teenage girl, I would've set a bigger trap. I suppose you're wondering why I have all these clowns, right? Well, you see, I've had that Slushy Burger jingle stuck in my head for, like, a week.  Pickles so green and meat so brown    Lunchtime's fun with Slushy the Clown!  Oh, I hate that song so much, I've stolen all the clowns, and I'm going to rip their tape boxes out. You know, like you do. And then I'm going to replace it with my own evil jingle. I just have to finish writing it. I-I'm having a hard time finding a good rhyme for ""evil,"" though, you know. Believe me, I've tried. Keevil, deevil, feevil, we- You know, none of these are words. You guys lost a platypus? Yep. Officer 3323. Tell Charlie we have a 1091P. Yeah, it's a platypus. Looks like a girl. MIA. And don't worry, boys. After a nice lunch at Mr. Slushy Burger, the Tri-State area's finest will be on the job. By the way, our mom's also missing her earrings. Which ones? The dangly topaz or the hoops? The hoops. Oh, that's a shame. We'll get right on it. Mom! You won't believe what Phineas and Ferb did! What did they do this time? All you have to do is look at me! If that's Jeremy, tell him I'm getting ready! I-I don't want him to see me like this. Okay, Candace, now what's so important? Hi, Jeremy. Hey, Mrs. Flynn. Is Candace here? Oh, she's still getting ready. You know girls. Have a seat. While you wait, I'll make you a snack. Oh, hey, Perry. Come up here. How's my favorite little platypus today? Ohh I mean Grrr ""Lost platypus. Looks like a girl."" You know, that's insulting to the platypus. How are we supposed to tell if it's a girl? Why don't you watch some TV while you wait? Oh, hey. I've got some great baby movies of Candace. Ohh! There she is in the bathtub. Oops! Little bubbles. Mom! Remember what we talked about? My fifth-grade graduation? Fifth-grade graduation? What is she talking about? Ugh! Just turn off the home movies! Meevil, steevil, cleevil, heevil As soon as I get this done, lunchtime will never again be fun. Oh, great! There's a rhyme! There's a rhyme, but sure, everything rhymes with ""fun."" Ha! You don't have a tail anymore. Now you are no match for me! But wait a minute. I-I-I can't hit a girl. Oof! Did you have that purse when you came in? Well, I'm out of here. What just happened? You're such a nice boy, Jeremy. I can see why Candace built a shrine to you in her room. Oopsy! I probably shouldn't have said that. Thanks for feeding Perry while I look for my earrings. Sure, no problem. What's in this platypus food, anyway? Mostly worms and insect larvae. Oh, Perry! Now I have to get the carpet cleaned again! Hey! Maybe I lost my earrings when I was folding Candace's laundry. Why don't you help me look while you wait, Jeremy? Am I sweating milk?! Being a platypus is so gross! Wait! Wait! I can't- I can't fight when you're dressed as a girl. It's so CÃ³mo se dice Awkward. Look! Shoes on sale! Curse you, Perry the teenager!  Agent P!  Hey! The girl missing her platypus found Slushy the Clown. Yay! This is horrible! Mom is inside, ruining my love life! Oh. There you are, Perry. Great. Change me back now! So this is how you went through the first time, right? You were holding Perry? Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Hurry! Oh He's a lot heavier now. I wonder if it worked. You guys are so busted! I'm telling Mom! You might consider bathing first. I gotta get out of this! Gah! Oh, my old Shrinkinator. I- I suppose I should've unplugged it before I turned it into a planter. Come on, Mom, hurry up! You're busted. See?! see?! It's right there!! Oh, my goodness! Did you make these? Uh Yeah. These are so much nicer than the ones I lost! Awesome. Thanks, boys. Close your mouth, honey. You'll catch flies.

"That, ladies and gents, is how I defeated the wild tigers in the Amazon. Awesome story, Grandpa Reg. Well, I'm sure you'll get to hear plenty more fantastical stories during Gran and Gramp's visit. You know, hon, I was thinking we could all head to the mall. What a splendid idea! I'd love to treat Candace to some new clothes. I'll be in the car. Hey, Mom. Could we just stay home and hear some more of Grandpa's cool stories? Sounds good to me. Wonderful. We'll see you boys later. My boy, what's this behind your ear? It's me scrapbook! How'd you do that? It's just a little bit of ""How's your father"". I may seem like a barmy ol' git now, but when I wasn't so long in the tooth, I had some grand larks and engaged in a fair amount of derring-do. Translate. When he was younger, he did a bunch of stuff. Here I am as a young lad. I made my livin' work at the family Fish and Chips shop. But I was destined for bigger things. I was known as The Great Flying Fishmonger. Here's my first jump over my dear mum's tea society. Me jumpin' a whale, a ton of crumpets, the Queen Mum. But there was one jump that haunts me to this day. McGregor's Gorge of Doom. People turned out by the thousands to witness me in my trusty motor bike, the Holy Mackerel, make our biggest jump yet. The event was so massive, I hired a local band to write me a theme song.  He is a Fishmonger, and he flies  But it wasn't exactly a toe-tapper. Then all of a sudden, it started to rain.  He is a Fishmonger, and he flies  I had to postpone my great feat. The second go at it weeks later,  He is a Fishmonger, and he-  had the same result! And yet another attempt, nothing but blasted rain again.  He is a Fishmonger, and he flies  Let's go! Yeah. I've got teeth not to brush. Over the years, my eyesight went. And with the lumbago Sciatica Bursitis and Wait for it Trick knee, jumpin' McGregor's Gorge is an intention lost to the past. Wow, Grandpa. So whatever happened to the Holy Mackerel? She's right over there. Although I see your mother turned her into a lamp. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Oh, Grandma. You're gonna love this mall! I'll show you my favorite store, and there's this little dress that- Hmm. Stacy, I have a strange feeling that ground was just broken in my backyard. I need you to get over there and tell me what's going on. Judging from this photo of McGregor's Gorge, we're right on track! Who's the tiger? Hey, Phineas! Whatcha doin'? Hey, Isabella. We're helping Grandpa Reg fulfill his crushed dreams. Where's Ferb? He's in the garage restoring the Mackerel. Cool. Well, I brought this cute little toy over for Perry. Where is he? Huh. I don't know. Oh. Hey, Agent P. Monogram's thrown his back out I'm on the floor, Agent P. So I will be giving you your assignment, okay? Okay. Do a closeup. Huh? Oh. Yeah. Huh. Doofenshmirtz has been purchasing some suspicious items. Bags of sand, and extra-long shoelace. We know he's up to no good. Get out there and see what he's up to. How was that? Just hand me my pills, Carl. What's all the kerfuffle, lads? You can open your eyes now. Blimey! It's McGregor's Gorge and, the Holy Mackerel! Ferb, you've restored my pride and joy! But, uh I can't operate a motorbike in my condition. Remember the- Not a  problem. Ferb's tricked out the entire bike. Lumbar support, padded seating, ergonomic controls, and the best part Side cars! See? As much as we wanna help you fulfill your dream, we also really want to jump a gorge. Well, then you'll come with me. The Flyin' Fishmongers shall jump again! Oh, my dear! You look like a queen. Brava! Uh Can we get out of here, like, now? Before anyone I know happens to see- Candace? I almost didn't recognize you. Jeremy! I- I, uh I gotta meet my Mom at the food court, but I'll see ya later? Oh Hello? Oh, hey, Stacy. Mom! Stacy just told me the boys built a huge gorge in our backyard! That hat might be a bit too tight.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, just come in! Into my trap! Yes! Sticky flypaper, Perry the Platypus! Quick story? Back in Druselstein in the days of my youth, there was a bully named Boris, who always wore big, black boots. They called him ""Big Black Boots Boris, The Bully"". He was always kicking sand in my face. When I was in the sandbox Sand! My first date Sand! Balancing my checkbook Sand! The beach Oddly enough, nothing. But I couldn't relax, because I kept waiting for it. Now, though, he will be the one doing the waiting. Behold! The Now Who'd Blinded By Sand-inator! Or maybe the, Who's Crying Now-inator or, something like Something with the ""-inator"" suffix. In any case, it's a giant sand kicking machine! You see, Perry the Platypus, Boris has moved to the Tri-State Area. So now, I am going to cover his entire house in sand! Come see The Flying Fishmonger jump McGregor's Gorge! Tell your friends!

He's a Fishmonger-  Stop. Start.  He's a Fishmonger, and he flies  Grandpa, the song's so dreary, it's causing it to rain. What if we pep it up a bit? Pep away, me boy. Hey, Isabella!

We have two scenarios to explain his disappearance. First, that magical elves have caused Dr. Doofenshmirtz to vanish to the land of angry corn people. The second, is that he may be on his secret, hideout-shaped island with the initial ""D"" carved into it, that satellites found in the exact spot, where he vanished Uh you know what? Uh Forget the magical elves thing. Way off base with that. Anyway, on your way, Agent P.

He's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action   (Doo be doo be doo ba)   (Doo be doo be doo ba)   He's a furry little flatfoot   He'll never flinch from a fray-ay-ay!   He's got more that just mad skill   He's got a beaver tail and a bill   And the women swoon   Whenever they hear him say   He's Perry!   Perry the Platypus!  But you can call him Agent P.  Perry!  I said you can call him Agent P.  Agent P!  Okay, Isabella. The best way to cure the hiccups is to scare them away. So what scares you? Hmm. Well, there was this haunted house at the state fair- that was pretty scary. That's it! Ferb and I are gonna make you the scariest haunted house ever! Zombies, werewolves, and ghosts, and vampires, and witches! Oh. Hey, Candace. Phineas! The only way you're building a haunted house in this backyard is over my dead body. That's the idea. Blah! That's it, you little psycho! I'm calling Mom! And I am not using the banana this time! You guys heard that, right? It wasn't just me? Build a haunted house, my foot! They're so busted. Yes. Hello. This is an emergency. I'd like to speak with Linda Flynn. To whom am I presently speaking? Uh, Jeremy. That's whom. J-J-Jeremy? J-J-J-J-J-J-J-J- Jeremy who? Jeremy Johnson. My mom's hosting a book club today. Who is this? We seem to be breaking up. I-I'm going into a tunnel Sunspots I- No habla espaÃ±ol!  Doofenshmirtz's hideout-shaped island!  Perry the Platypus? Here? How could this be? I'm shocked. I mean It would have taken a total evil mastermind to have guessed, that you'd track me to this point, find the secret hideout, glide in under the radar and infiltrate through this access vent, make your way over to this crate, activating my automatic arm and leg restraints. Oh. Right here? This is the part where I get all sarcastic and pretend you surprise me. ""Oh, Perry the Platypus?!"" ""How?!"" ""What the?!"" ""Who the?!"" ""Why the?!"" ""Oh!"" Finally ending here, where I finish showing you my brilliant plan. You see Perry the Platypus, this secret hideout doesn't actually belong to me. It belonged to my mentor, Professor Destructicon! Kevin, to his friends. Sadly, he was just captured in the midst of his latest plan To set fire to the sun! Redundant, perhaps. But, before they locked him away, Kevin asked a favor of me. To prevent them from discovering his hidden lair and all its secrets, would I please Set fire to the sun! I mean, I was like ""Dude, you really got to let that one go, it's- it's a ball of fire! It makes no sense."" So he asked me instead to simply destroy his hideout, which I will now do, using my new Disintevaporator. Ahem. And you, Perry the Platypus, will now be disintevaporated along with it! Okay. Just breathe and relax. Let's try this again. Hi. Uh Linda Flynn, please. But if she's too busy, uh then maybe there's someone else who can deliver her a message. Maybe someone in their teens! Uh Who is this? This is Candace. Candace Flynn. And who is this? I'm Suzy. Jeremy's little sister. Well, it is such a pleasure to meet you on the-- You called for Jeremy, didn't you? Jeremy? Oh. No, no, no, no, no. You say you want your Mom, but you really want Jeremy. Isn't that right? That's not true. I'm sorry. We seem to be breaking up. Stop crinkling paper! I know that trick! Bye bye. Wait, wait, wait! It's true. I want to speak to Jeremy. I thought so. Jeremy! Some girl's on the phone for you! But never, ever forget. I am, and always will be Jeremy's favorite girl. Got it? Mmm-hmm. Yes. I got it, my favorite girl. Jeremy here. Jeremy! Candace? Uh Yeah Yeah, it's me. Hey, you know, your mom's over here for the book club. Oh, yeah. Well, I just have this silly question to ask her. Well, they're breaking for coffee. Wanna come over? We can hang out. That was great, Ferb. But you should really save those screams for later, when the house is up and running. Uh I-I mean, sure! Cool. See you in about 20 minutes? Now I'll just load up a few things that Professor Destructicon let me store here. If there's one thing Kevin understood, it was closet space. Now, I'll just, uh grab my keys to the escape jet and, uh Hmm. I could've sworn I put them in my lab coat. Oh, they're probably over here on the computer console no. Ah, the kitchen. Hello? Keys? This is a little bit awkward, but have you seen my escape jet keys? What? You have? Well, that's great! Where are they? You won't tell me? Is this because you don't speak, or are you just being a jerk? Oh, I can't believe it. I'm finally going to Jeremy's house. Okay, now, what would the perfect look be? I know. Girl next door meets pop diva meets Hollywood bad girl crossed with an old school glamour goddess! Now I just gotta find the finishing touch. Hey, boys! I'm off to the Johnson's book club. Jeremy invited me over. Uh When you see Mom, could you tell her some snakes got lost in the house? Okay! You boys have fun. See ya! Okay, troops. Thanks for coming on such short notice. Buford, I know this is cutting into your canasta game. This better be good, pointy. Oh, it is. Isabella has been cursed with hiccups! Worse case I've ever seen. We're building this haunted house to scare the hiccups out of her. To do so, we must dig deep into those terrible places any sane man shoves into the darkest, twisted corners of his mind. Each of you must find out what scares you the most. As you can see, today we're building a haunted house, electronically controlled by this giant organ. Every room is monitored on these screens. And by playing the keys I can trigger all sorts of surprises. So with your help, my friends, we can build this house with enough horror to destroy the involuntary contraction of Isabella's diaphragm muscle once and for all! Oh. There you are, Ferb. Okay, people. Let's get our scare on.  Doofenshmirtz's mentor's hideout!  Am I getting warmer? Hmm? The sofa. My keys fell between the cushions, right? Uh No. Oh, come on! I defeated you fair and square, Perry the Platypus! Why can't you accept your death with dignity and maturity and play, ""You're getting hot and cold"" with me? Fine, be that way. I'll find my keys myself and teach you the meaning of grace under fire. Please! I'll do anything! Oh, for the love of Great Caesar's ghost, what would you have me do? (Song: Candace (Who's That Girl))  La, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   Yeah   La, la, la, la   Who's that girl going down the street?   It's Candace   (Candace)   She's the girl next door who's a pop diva by day and a Hollywood bad girl by night crossed with an old school glamour goddess I'd like to meet   It's Candace   (Candace)   La, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la  Oh! Help! Somebody! Oh, get it off me! These are designer jeans. Wait. What are you doing? No, no! My hair! Help! No- Huh? Why are you doing this to me? Suzy? What's going on out here? Candace? Oh. Uh Hi, Jeremy. Upsies! Wait, no! Don't pick her up! She's evil! Evil! Can't you see? She's out to get me! She did this to me! What are you talking about? Little Suzy wouldn't hurt a fly. Bubble! No! She's trying to get rid of me! Can't you see? I can't take it! Wait! Candace! No! If you can't see it, I should leave while I still have a shred of dignity left. Candace, come back! Bye bye. Hi, Phineas. Whatcha do Ph- Phineas? Darn. It didn't work, Phineas. What else you got? Oh, we've got plenty. If you're up for it. I- g-g-guess so. (Song: One Good Scare)  Come, let's tiptoe into the dark   One good scare ought to do ya!   You'll find our bite much worse than our bark   One good scare ought to do ya some good   If you should find the daily grind, a tad bit taxing on the mind   To help unwind, if so inclined   I have a small suggestion   That if you dare into my lair, you should prepare for quite a scare!   Well, will you share in this nightmare with me, my only question  Boo! Boo, I say! Baljeet? Oh. I am not Baljeet. I am the scariest thing known to man A failed math test. Yeah, right. We're just gonna move on now. You can run, but it won't be to the college of your choice, I tell you!  If your hair lies lifeless and limp   One good scare ought to do ya!   Come with me, now, don't be a wimp!   One little scare ought to do ya some good  Hello? Buford? Behold. The face of evil. Buford, are you supposed to be Jeremy's little sister? You said you were gonna be something scary! She is scary, man. She gives me the willies. Little Suzy Johnson gives you the willies? You don't know, man. You don't know. Um We'll catch up with you later, okay? Wash away the horror. Wash away the horror.  That is quite right, I would delight in taking flight into the night!   If I may give you such a fright, you know I surely would   But if I seem a bit extreme in my attempts to make you scream   Remember that this spooky scheme will cure   Your hiccups for good   One little   One little   One little   One little   One little scare ought to do you some good!  So, Isabella, did it work? I was afraid she would say that. Well, there's one more thing we could try. What the-? What the-? I don't believe this. Let me get this straight. If I set you free, you'll give me the keys, right? Oh, for Pete's sake. Why didn't you say that, like, an hour ago? Oh, look, they were under your cute little platypus foot the whole time. Hurry! Open! Open! Open! Now I grab my stuff. Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Must hurry! Seat belt, and ignition! Whew! That was close! Huh. Now, let's just make sure I didn't forget anything in my haste. I've got my old basketball, the lamp, Christmas lights, the umbrella, Perry the Platypus, the Disintevaporator, my golf- Perry the Platypus? The Disintevaporator?! My golf clubs?! I don't even play golf! Oof! How do you like it, huh? Agh! Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Time, time, time. I got a hair caught in my mouth. Blagh. Since you saved me the trouble of opening the hatch, let me show you out! Those two are in such big trouble! Okay, Ferb. Raise the antenna. Let's see if we can up the scariness factor. You see, our haunted house is powered by static electricity. Maybe we can get a lightning strike to fire things up. Um, hello? Phineas? Ferb? You two are in big trouble? Okay, you guys. Stop fooling around. You guys better come out now. I'm getting really mad. What was that? Yeah! Stay away from me! Good evening. It is evening, isn't it? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Too much, Ferb! Too much! Watch out! Candace? Phineas! When Mom sees that you've built a haunted house in the backyard with werewolves and vampires and a Giant Floating Baby Head? What's that even about? Not now! And then there was a giant Jack-in-the-Box with a suit of armor that nearly took my head off, and you- you just drive me crazy! When I tell Mom what you're doing, you are going down! Down, down, down! Isn't there any chance that that cured your hiccups? Would you get out of here?! Mom's home. Perfect! Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Wait till you see what Phineas and Ferb have done! What's happening? Uh, guys? A little help? Phineas! Quick, everyone! Sashes! Hup, Hup, hup, Hup, hup, hup, Hup, hup, hup, hup, Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Now that was scary. Hey! My hiccups are gone! See? Absolute terror! These little creeps have destroyed our backyard leaving this ugly mess in its place! Hi, Baljeet. That wasn't very nice, Candace. Here you go, Perry the Platypus. Enjoy your disintevaporation! It's back! Mom, it's back! It's back! I told you! It's returned. Oh, excuse me, I forgot my satchel. Goodbye, Candace. What's the matter? Phineas and Ferb are the matter. This day was ruined and I didn't get to hang out with Jeremy. Sorry, but you know, it was the best day for me! Due to my incurable case of the hiccups, I spent an entire day showered with undivided attention from Phineas! It was wonderful! Hiccups? Hey, Candace. You ran away so quickly, we didn't get a chance to- Sounds like you got a bad case of the hiccups. Here, come on. Let's see what we can do about that. I've got a glass of water with your name on it. What? What did I do? Heh, heh. Heh! Um Um I-I'll, just uh Go. That was a great day, Ferb. What did you think the scariest thing was? Definitely the Giant Floating Baby Head. Yeah. Yeah, where did that come from?! Hm.  That is quite right, I would delight in taking flight into the night!   If I may give you such a fright, you know I surely would   But if I seem a bit extreme in my attempts to make you scream   Remember that this spooky scheme will cure   Your hiccups for good   One little   One little   One little   One little   One little scare ought to do you some good  Darn."
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We thought it only fair to warn you that the show you're about to see may disturb you. It may shock you. It may even horrify you! You've been warned. Looks like a real summer storm! Well, our plan to stand alone in a field with a metal rod is out. This weather isn't fit for man nor platypus. Hey. Where's Perry?  Doo be doo be doo ba   Doo be doo be doo ba   Doo  Good morning, Agent P. The mission you're about to receive may shock you. It may even horrify you! But then again, probably not, I mean, heh. You have been doing this for awhile. Anyway, sorry about the tarp behind me. Storm caused some water damage, and-- Ooh! Cheese and crackers! Late for my cousin's wedding. Gotta run. Doofenshmirtz is up to something. You know what to do.  Perry!  Hmm. I wonder where Perry goes off to. Lost your platypus, eh? That reminds me of a really great monster story. Tell us, Grandpa! It's about Ferb's ancestor. He was his great-great- great-great-great-great- great-great-great- great uncle. Great. It was a long time ago, back in the old country, on a cold moonlit night. Your great uncle Ferbgor was assisting the famous Dr. Phineastein in the macabre task of collecting spare parts from semi-aquatic mammals. Hey, Ferbgor. The Monster's Ball Best Monster Contest. A big prize goes to the best monster! Sweet. I know what we're gonna do today! Back at Castle Phineastein, the boys began building a monster. Can you at least tell a story in color, Grandpa? Perhaps muted color would be better. Who's telling the story anyway? Did I mention that the boys had a conniving and disapproving governess named Constance? So, anyway, Jeremiah was, like, totally checking me out when-- Will you hold it down? I am trying to use the quill! Isn't it beautiful, Ferbgor? We're on the verge of bringing life to the best monster ever. Okay. Let her rip! It's alive! Alive! And it's really big. How big, Grandpa? Bigger than a refrigerator but smaller than a really big refrigerator.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Don't close the door! Oh, that's just great! The storms made my security system go all cuckoo, and you just locked us in. Well, you might as well make yourself comfy, 'cause we're stuck in here till the power comes back on. Ooh, quite a storm, huh? Reminds me of a story Papa Doofenshmirtz used to tell me to scare me into wetting the bed. That prankster! It began a long time ago, with my great-great grandfather, Dr. Jekyll Doofenshmirtz! He was obsessed with being the most evil scientist of his time. Back then, to be considered truly evil, you actually had to have an angry mob after you. Your 11 o'clock is here. The angry mob?! Ooh, they're early. Show them to the parlor. Top of the morning, angry mob. Let's hurry this along, Doctor. We've got a tar-and-feathering at noon. Yes, of course, of course. This time I know I've created something evil enough to warrant your full attention and anger. The Concoction Brew-Inator! A diabolical machine that produces a potion to turn a normal man, like myself, into a horrible monster! Now Tremble before me! What? You're not so much trembling. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Come back! So you're not an angry mob right now, but I bet you're slightly irritated, right? I should get points for that! I should get points for that. Uh, where was I? Oh, yes! Now, the boys had a real monster on their hands, and they had to get him ready for the big night. Come on! That-a-boy! Check it out, Ferbgor. To make sure we win that monster contest, I taught him a few tricks. Watch this. Play dead! Huh? Huh? So I said, ""Oh no, you di-in't!"" And she said-- What was that? What's going on down there? I will go straight to the angry mob and tell on you. Aha! Oh. Hi, Constance. We're gonna enter the Best Monster Contest. How are you gonna enter a monster contest? You don't even have a monster! He's right behind me, isn't he? Yeah! I'm. Telling. Mob. Angry mob! Come quick! Phineastein and Ferbgor have created a giant green monster! Didn't you tell us last week that they created a two-headed cow? We're wasting time! Now let's hurry before the monster gets away! Jameson, I think I found the problem. I had the Brew-Inator set to ""Fairy Princess"" by mistake. You know, in hindsight, I, question even including a ""Fairy Princess"" setting to begin with. But, you know, live and learn. Cheers! Hmm. Evil has an interesting flavor. I must tell my friend, Dr.-- Hmm. It actually worked. I know! I'm just as surprised as you are! Put her there, Jameson! Psych! At last! A whole new world of evil has opened up to me! You know what this calls for, don't you? A rampage, sir? Exactly! Oh, and clean your uniform. Evil! (Song: He's Eviler)  He's public enemy number one   He's an evil, evil man  That's me!  He's got a diabolical sense of fun   And an evil, evil plan  Well, not a plan so much.  Oh, yes, he's eviler  I'm winging it, actually.  More evil than he was before  That's right.  Yes, he's eviler  I don't think that's a word.  And he's taking it door to door  Oops, gotta go. Evil! Got your nose! I got your I I I really do have his nose. Oops. Heh. Okay, okay. Well, we'll just put this back. There you go. Good as new. Evil! Oh, great! We really have to stop losing our monsters. Blimey! Look what's coming! Run! Run! I'm finally cured of my irrational fear that a giant platypus will see me in my underpants. It's even worse than I imagined! Whatcha doin'? Hello? Are there any monsters in there? Shh. No, I guess not. It was right here! You have to believe me! A giant platypus! Wait! Mob, look! The Monster's Ball! This is where they must have gone. Follow me!  La la la la  Whatcha doin'? We're looking for a giant platypus monster. Have you seen one by any chance? Funny you should ask. We spent the entire afternoon together. We went swimming, had a little lunch. Did you know he eats raw snails? Ew! I stuck to PB and J on whole wheat. Where is he now? He went into town to enter the Best Monster Contest. Of course that's where he went! What were we thinking? Come on! Goodbye then! Tell him to save me a dance! Thanks for the lift, mister! Let's go! Best monster, indeed. Wait till they get a load of pure evil! We'll just adjust the dial, and-- You?! Monster fight! Really, really, I don't have your nose! Wait wait. Time out. Allow me one little drink before we continue. I'm-- I-I'm parched, okay? Here, boy! I hope he hasn't gotten into any trouble. Just wait till my potion kicks in, you big, dumb monst-- What? But I-- I thought I had it set to-- And, well, I forgot exactly what happens after that. Oh, hey. The lights! What do you know? Oh, I got no time for my diabolical plan now. I've got the chiropractor at 4. Could-- could we pick it up tomorrow at, say my evil scheme monologue? Good! But, you know, I wonder who actually did win the Best Monster Contest. Oh. There you are, platypus monster. And to think I worried you might get into some mischief. Ladies and gentlemen. We're ready to announce the winner of the Best Monster Contest. Hey, we're just in time. Mob! It's here! The monster's in here! We're coming! Don't get your knickers in a twist. They are so busted! Oh, refreshments! This monster hunting is thirsty work. That's a peculiar taste. Hey, Constance. Oh, Jeremiah! I can't remember a day when you looked more beautiful. Well, now I can. Ladies and gentlemen. The winner of the Best Monster Contest is That! Way to go, Constance! Good show! There it is! Wait! No, no, no! I'm not the monster! Oh well. Win some, lose some, boy. You'll always be the biggest, baddest monster to us. I see you found your giant platypus. That's right. And we'll never lose him again. And that is why there are pumpkins. Um Grandpa, you were telling us about a giant platypus monster. Ooh, that sounds very exciting! Tell me about that. But you were-- I mean-- I didn't-- I've got nothing. Ferb? Platypus monsters are the only monsters to lay eggs."
"Let's continue our tour! Over here, we have the work of the great environmental installation artist, Beppo Brown. That's my dad! As Django can tell you, his father Beppo is famous for his monumentalist recreations of everyday objects. Wow, Django. It's so cool that your dad makes such huge things! Look at that giant toothbrush! And that giant dental floss. It's even been used. Whoa! And how about that giant baby? My dad didn't make that. Django, isn't that your dad over there? Yeah! I'm gonna go say hi! You're taking it too literally. It's the juxtaposition of the doughnuts and the mountains that-- Hey, Dad! Hi, Django! How are your friends enjoying the tour? They love it! Wanna hang out with us? Uh Sorry, bud. But I- I gotta answer a few questions for these people and talk to them about my new project, but I promise I'll catch up with you just as soon as I can. Have fun! Okay, folks. Please take some time to look at Beppo's fabulous exhibit! Oh, and don't miss his newest addition, ""Doughnuts Over the Mountain"", which can be seen from the viewing platform. Cool! Let's check it out. I'd like to see the giant mascara brush again. What do you say, Candace? Where's the giant exit sign? I'd rather be at home with Perry. What do you suppose Perry does when we leave him at home? I love you, my darling. No. I love you much more than you love me. I hate you. Sorry to bother you on your day off, Agent P. I love you! I thought you hated me! Agent P, you've got to concentrate. It's Doofenshmirtz again. He's expecting a visit from his old, evil science professor, Dr. Gevaarlijk. You must get over there pronto. Those two together are a bad combination. Don't worry about your stories, we'll tape them for you.  Perry!  Wow! Your dad's exhibit is really amazing! I can see where you get your artistic talent from, Django. Oh. I don't know, Phineas. I made this for my dad, but it hardly compares to his stuff. Are you kidding? This is a great painting! Your dad would love this. But it's so small, and everything my dad makes is so big. Why don't you just paint something bigger? But where will we find a canvas big enough? Look out there, Django. Your father's display just happens to be right next to the Unpainted Desert. And that gives me an idea. Ferb, we're gonna need some really big art supplies. Hey! We can use my dad's old exhibit! He called it, ""Really Big Art Supplies"".  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Dr. Gevaarlijk already? Oh. Oh, it's you, Perry the Platypus. I don't have much time today. You see My old evil science professor is visiting, and we've always had a, rather strained relationship. I think it's best expressed through song. Tell me what you think. But no pressure. (Song: Impress My Professor)  Back in class, Evil 101   I always had so much fun   Though the one who advised me, openly despised me   Still, I always tried to be number one   Well, I wanted a mentor to share my world view   But I got a tormentor, I was hated, it's true   Now I have one more chance, and it could mean my advancement   So there's only one thing I must do   I must impress my professor   (He's got to be good)   I must impress my professor   (He's misunderstood)   (He needs validation for his evil creation)   Ooh, ooh   Like any good evil scientist would   (He)   I   must   (must)   impress my professor to be a success   (impress his professor to be a success)   (Or he will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey)   Or I will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey   In the eyes of this person   Whose opinion may worsen   If my evil invention's not great   I must impress my professor   (Impress his professor)   I must impress my professor  (Impress his professor)   I must impress my professor   Before it's too late!  So, now you know my plan. Can-- Can-- Can you hold on a second? I've got to go settle up with the dancers. Okay, so you guys are all union, right? All right, here you go. And Uh. Hey, you know, when I'm done with this thing, maybe you and I could, uh Uh Okay. Okay, I'll call you! I think I got a shot there. So this is the famous Unpainted Desert. Not for long! Thanks, guys! I think I can show it to my dad now. It's not finished until you sign it! You're right! We should all sign it. My professor is here! Now, Perry the Platypus, you will tremble before the mighty, Dr. Gevaarlijk! Hello, Heinz. My, look how big you've gotten. Of course you still have that slouch. Dr. Gevaarlijk, so good to see you. Oh, ja, I've come all the way from Gimmelshtump for chit-chat. So, show me what you're doing. I am sure you will be most impressed with my latest evil inventions. Here, we have the Deflate-Inator. Hmm Did it work? Uh, well No, not really, but I-- Here we have the Drill-Inator! Did anyone get hurt with that? Mmm No, just-- Just me. But, uh Did any of these actually work? Oh! No, not really. But follow me. I-I do have something even more impressive over There. My brand-new Blender-Inator! Spelling doom for even the toughest of apples! Bow down to me, Granny Smith! Ja, I'm sure if I was a pomaceous fruit, I would be trembling. Where is your Phone-Inator? I need to call a Cab-Inator. Well, uh, it's, uh Just, uh Wait, wait! Don't go. Let me show you this. My very own nemesis. Oh, Heinz. How can he be your nemesis? He's doesn't even have a hat. No, no! I-I made that mistake a couple of times, too, but that's him, I swear! In your letters, you said your nemesis was a suave, semi-aquatic personification of unstoppable dynamic fury. He is! No, you've just got to see him in action. H-Here. I'll let him go. Go ahead, Perry the Platypus. Thwart my plans. Come on. Let me have it! Thwart away, big guy! Heinz. Get thwartin'! He's just a platypus. They don't do much, you know? No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! He's just about to do something. Wait for it! Hmm. I guess it's just a platypus. I could have sworn that was him. Heinz, this is just sad. Okay, one more thing. This is going to blow your socks off. I know the boys must be around here somewhere. Wow. What a view! Well, may as well see what this doughnut nonsense is all about. Wow, it's actually pretty cool! So this over there must be the Unpainted Des-- Hey, that doesn't look unpainted to me! Phineas and Ferb?! Oooh! Busted!  Busted, busted, busted!  (Song: Busted Conga)  Busted, busted, busted!  Mom! Mom! Mom! Dad! Dad! Dad! Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! Oh. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shout. To honor your visit, I will blow up the moon! Blow up the moon? But that would mean-- Yes! No more stupid songs about moons. I do despise moon-related songs. Continue. It takes a lot of power, so I can only fire it once, but don't worry. I have it planned down to the last-- Oops! No more songs about dams? Oh. But I like a good toe-tapping dam song. Mom, you've gotta see this! Well, at least she's excited about art. Dad! You've gotta see this! Take a look at that! Wow! Doughnuts over the mountain. No, no. The other thing. Oh. I see what you mean, Candace. The natural beauty of the Unpainted Desert is like a work of art! Mom, there is nothing natural about the-- Huh? But But But Hey, Mom! Hey, Dad! There you boys are! Okay, Dad. This way! It's time for your big sur prise? But, um Whatcha got there, Django? Well, I made this for you, but It's kinda small, compared to what you do. It's not real art. It's beautiful, son. You are a real artist. Really? With your permission, there's a very special place I'd like to put this. Come on, bud. Wow. There's no higher place of honor than the fridge. Especially a giant fridge. Oh, Dr. Gevaarlijk, today was supposed to be the day that I impressed you with the enormity of my evil schemes, and finally earn your respect. Oh, Heinz. Evil doesn't always have to be on a big scale. You can spread evil in the little things you do everyday. You're right. But sadly, you can't even do that! You're a total failure! You sicken me, Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Gevaarlijk out! Wow. That could have gone better. Oh. There you are, Perry the Platypus. Oh, you You saw that, huh? Yes. Of course. You think I'm evil, right? Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Thank you.  (He)   I   must   (must)   impress my professor to be a success   (impress his professor to be a success)   (Or he will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey)   Or I will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey   In the eyes of this person   Whose opinion may worsen   If my evil invention's not great   I must impress my professor   (Impress his professor)   I must impress my professor   (Impress his professor)   I must impress my professor   Before it's too late!"
"Hey, Dad! What are you watching? Oh, it's my favorite kids show from when I were a lad. Oh, they don't make them like this anymore. (Song: Pinhead Pierre Theme)  Pinhead Pierre   Has the smallest head of which I'm aware   It's about the size and shape of a pear   Everywhere the children stare   Life's cruel and unfair   To Pinhead Pierre!  No more pointin' and laughin', kids! Because now it's time for another adventure of Captain Implausible! When we last saw our hero, the Earth was being threatened by evil space aliens. Bow-chicka-wow-wow. Chicka-chicka-choo-wop. Captain Implausible? That's right! He possesses virtually every super power there is. Ooh. Wasn't that great, kids? Ya can't beat Captain Implausible. It's impossible! It's super freaky! Pinhead was the best! And I happen to own the single greatest collection of Pinhead Pierre paraphernalia in all the world. Gosh. Oh, yeah. I'm not proud. Time for the question of the day. Thank you, Debbie. And the question of the day is, ""If you could have one superpower, what would it be?"" You see, right there. Modern cartoon shows never ask the really big questions, do they? That's it! We could have as many superpowers as we want if we were cartoons! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Oh, well. At least Perry will watch these with me. Won't you, Perry? Perry? Morning, Agent P. I apologize for using the emergency chute and, uh, for not telling you we had an emergency chute. But, there was an emergency. Shoot! Sorry. What I'm about to say is highly classified, Agent P. The last century, the forces of good and evil have been locked in a desperate race to harness and control the limitless power of dance. Dance! How was that, sir? You came in a little late there, Carl. Get back over there. We'll try it again. Blah, blah, blah, the power of dance. Dance! Better? Early. Anyhoo, much to our horror, it appears the side of evil has won. Have you seen the latest issue of Evil Beat! magazine? Dr. Doofenshmirtz has created a ray that causes people to dance uncontrollably. It's up to you to stop him, Agent P. But, be careful. It's a known fact that no one, no one, has ever defeated evil while dancing. Good luck, Agent P. Excellent. We'll be up and running in no time. Hey, sis. Hold it right there, busters. Before I squeal on you rats, and you know I must, will you please tell me what's going on here? We're building an animation studio so we can make our very own cartoon show. I thought cartoons were all made by computer. Yeah, that's right. This is just for show. This is where the magic happens. It's the PF-5000 Animatron. All you do is tell the machine what you want. I'd like my cartoon character to have the power to be everywhere at once. I'll be called Multi-Man! And Ferb would have a utility belt and use lots of crazy gadgets. He'll be called Um Ferb Guy. Well, I would have super mind control and use telepathy and telekinesis to keep you super-dweebs under control with your lame-o superpowers. We could call you Control Freak. Come on, let's watch. We start with a few crude drawings. We compile those into a storyboard, and it all gets fed into the computer. Then we add a little story and some pithy dialog. The Executron analyzes it and makes a few notes. Does not track. Whose story arc is this anyway? This is not one of my favorites. The Artbot addresses the notes. No more notes. No more notes. A few changes are made, then it goes to timing. The shreds get fed into here, and somehow it all comes together here in the Animatic. Check it out. We're super dudes. You guys are super busted as soon as I tell Mom. Hi, Phineas. Whatcha doâ Ugh! Whatcha doin'? Come into the Phineas and Ferb Studios, and we'll show you. Hey, Isabella. About that ""Whatcha doin'?"" back thereâ Up, up, up! We'll talk about it later. Over here is where we add sound effects. Did you know that for years, a balloon was used for the majority of sounds you hear in cartoons? Ferb will demonstrate. Ferb? May we be in the show, too? Absolutely. A very wise and small-headed man once asked, ""If you could have any superpower, what would it be?"" I would harness the power of rainbows, unicorns and sweetness to defend all that is good and just. I'd become The Rainbow. Wow, that's great. What about you, Buford? It's an interesting question you pose, as it reveals not only one's impulses and desires, but one's deepest fears as well. I'll go with Belchman.  Belchman!  You know, fights crimes with different burps. Cool. How 'bout you, Baljeet? Isabella took mine. Hmm. School seems to be very important to you. Books, being responsible and studious, getting good grades Oh! That's it! I will become Hanuman Man, a flying blue monkey that can grow as massive as he desires to crush all in his way! Fun choice. That was perfect, guys. Now let's record the voices for the scene where the heroes ask the villain for help. Phineas, Iâ Hi, Candace. You're just in time to help us record the voices. There is no way on Earth I'd ever help you. Cut and print. That's why we call her ""One-Take Flynn"".  Best thing you can do   You can do   Yeah   Better be ready Betty   Get ready for the Bettys    'Cause The Bettys are ready for    'Cause the Bettys are ready for you!    YOU!  Something tells me that you might have seen this month's Evil Beat! magazine, eh? Wait, wait, wait. Look. Look, it's like there's two of me. You see? Hmm? Huh? I suppose you're wondering how I harnessed the power of dance. Well, to be honest, it was not so much on purpose. What-What happened was my dryer broke, so I was trying to create a ray that would instantly dry my clothes. But instead Well, look. Still sopping wet, by the way. Turns out anything I hit with the ray starts dancing. For instance, a dryer repairman. He-elp! I can't stop getting down! Ohh! Quiet, you. Ah, sweet, horrible self-expression through movement! So I figured as long as I invented the thing, I might as well use it to whip up a little evil. I set it up right over there next to theâ Ow! Hey! You know, it cost me a lot to have that printed up! Oh! To add insult to injury, the platypus is leading. Well, it's all up to the Animatron 5000 now. Hiya, kids! You can stop laughing and pointing, because now it's time forâ Whoops. The new adventures of Team Improbable!  Rainbow  The Rainbow.  Hanuman Man  Hanuman Man.  Multi-Man  Multi-Man.  Ferb Guy  Ferb Guy.  Belchman  Belchman. Versus the Control Freak! You're going down! Down, down, down! Oh, this is just out of control. Mom! Mom! Hi, this is Mom. Leave your psychotic rant about the boys when you hear the beep. Uhh! Mom, come home quick! There's a giant mob, I'm a super fiend, I'm roasting them with laser vision, andâ Hey. What do you mean, ""psychotic rant""? Hey, look, everybody. It's the Control Freak. Has everyone gone crazy?! There you are, you worms! Isn't the show great? Are you joking? How could you make me the evil villain? Now everybody hates me! Au contraire, big sister. You're the star of the show. I am? The crowd loves you. But they're booing and hissing. Of course they're booing and hissing. You're the villain. Right, Ferb? A hero is a hero, but everybody loves a great villain. Really? Well, maybe I should go feel the love. Love feels a lot like tomatoes. Oh, you'll never get away with this! You are so busted! We made a killing! But we weren't charging admission. Well, what are ya gonna do? Come on, everybody, let's take a bow. They like me! They really like me! Feeling the love again. You know, I'm getting pretty good at getting down. What do you think, huh? After all, everyone knows dancing is evil! Perry the Platypus, what are you doing? Stop with the conga line. We're doing the Macarena. Perry the Platypus, where are you going? I don't believe it! You defeated evil while dancing! Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Suddenly, I feel like dancing. Well, I'm here. Now where's this ""giant, animation studio""? It got up, and it danced away. It what? It got up, and it danced away. It got up and danced away? See? It even sounds crazy when you say it. I'll be in my room."
"Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Look at this, Norm. My brother Roger has been elected mayor! Look at him. He's honest and reputable and Ugh, law-abiding! Oh! There isn't room for both of us in the Tri-State Area! Hmm. Norm, I know what we're going to do today. Hey, Phineas. What'cha eatin'? Fruity Rainbow Flakes. You want some? Oh, no, thanks. I already had breakfast. You know, I've never really seen one of these in real life. You haven't? No. But I'd sure like to. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Hi, boys. Hi, Mom. What's with the satellite dish? It's a protective collar. The vet says that Perry needs to wear it for the rest of the day. I still don't know how he scratched himself up so much. Aha! Well, I think it's cool. It's a bold fashion statement, all right. Speaking of bold fashion statements, have you seen Candace today? MOM! This is a total disaster! What? What?! The dry cleaner switched my clothes with some goth chick! I look like a total freak, like I'm all outsider-y. I wonder what happened to Candace's clothes. I can't believe it, Lacie. I look like a walking candy cane. I mean, how many evil scientists' daughters do you know whoâ Hold on, Lacie. I can't hear myself great. What'cha doin'? ""What'cha doin'?"" What does it look like to you? I'm building an evil empire. My very own Fortress of Eviltude. Aren't you a little old to be building a fort? No. No, I'm not. Shut up. Dad, I told you a hundred times, Iâ Don't forget. Friday is cake day. I have to call you back. What on Earth is going on here? Oh, Vanessa! Well, you're looking Uh Oh, no matter. Where we are going, you can dress up like a clown every day if you want. Whâ What do you mean, ""Where we're going""? We are moving. To a golden country on the sea, a country created by the greatest mastermind of our time. Me. Assisted by Norm. I'm drilling. I bring to you Doofania! Where there will be no brothers trying to make me look bad. No. I will be the ruler of my very own evil empire! You're building your own evil land? Yes, yes, an evil country. And you made a plush model? Well, yeah. You know, I, uh I had a lot of Felt. You do know what this means? That we'll finally have that special daddy-daughter bond you've always craved? No. It means I'm finally gonna have proof. Ha! You are busted.  Busted!  I'm gonna tell Mom. Great. Tell her what? Mom, Mom, you've got to come quick. There's proof that Dad is evil. Vanessa, honey. I'm having my meâ ee day, remember? Uh, butâ Look, hon, why don't you give your old dad a break? Just try to make the best of it, and I'll pick you up later. Oh! Time for my seaweed mud wrap. Gotta go. Is everything all set, Ferb? Great. Nowâ Hey, where's Perry? Agent P? Agent P? Hello, Agent P? Agent P! Carl, he does know this is scheduled for this morning, doesn't he? It's on his calendar, sir. I mean, we sent the e-mail, right? I think so. Let me check. Mommy-mi-moe-moo. Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah. Me-ma-moe-moo-my-pa. Ma-moe-mee-ma-moo. Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Well, you know how you said you'd never seen a rainbow in real life? Well, actually, Iâ Behold! The Rainbow-Inator! Well, that's nice, Phineas, but Iâ Made with real crystals and super-charged with Fruity Rainbow Flakes. You don't understand, Iâ Soon there will be a giant rainbow that will sprawl across the entire Tri-State area! Or at least, that's the plan anyway. Candace, honey. Could you hold the door for me? I have to return this novelty lawn mower your father got. Ugh! I just don't want anyone to see me in these clothes. You think you feel ridiculous? I'm carrying a jackalope into a lawn mower store. Okay, Mom. I'll wait for you in the car. Candace! When did you go goth? What? I didn't! And send. Wow. Fifty replies already. Hello? Candace, I heard you're goth now. Why didn't you tell me? Well, Norm, I've got to give it to you. Under my genius supervision, you turned out extremely adequate work. We're all very impressed with your numbers, sir. Although something seems to be missing. I know. It's Perry the Platypus! What's keeping him? Gee, I-I hope something horrible happened to him. Does someone need a hug? Of course not, you glorified waffle iron! Just launch it now. Mom, I'm at the docks. You gotta get down here right away. Okay, honey. I'll see you at FEH. You'll see me at five? No. FEH. Four? FEH. ""Feh""? Yeah. FEH. Okay I'll see you at ""feh"". Oh, hi, Vanessa! What do you think? My own country, eh? I love what you've done with the place. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's nice. This time, I am staying right here where no one can see me. All right. Suit yourself. Oh no! Mom's gonna get a ticket! That would have been embarrassing. Whoa. Candace, are you going goth now? Uh Uh-uh, I'm not wearing this. I-I mean, I'mâ I'm wearing it in that it's actually on my body right now, butâ I'm not attached to it. Iâ Iâ Not to say that I'm attached to my other clothes. I mean, I can actually take them off. No, no, no. Iâ But, I meanâ I didn't want to put theseâ Iâ Iâ I want to put clothes on, but Iâ Uh It was a mix-up, okay? The dry cleaners and aâ a jackalope lawn mower, andâ Do you like it? All right, Norm. The anthem, please! (Song: Hail Doofania!)  In the bay off the coast of the Tri-State area   Floats a country for me and me   It's new, it's bright   And it's founded on spite   And it's everything I dreamed it would be   Hail, Hail Doofania!  Dâ Doesâ Does it feel like it stops too quickly? Eh. We'll work on it. Oh, good, Mom's here! Mom, where have you been? I told you on the phone I would meet you at FEH. The Freight Emergency Harbor? Okay, never mind that, but, Dad and Norm built an entire country on the sea. Come on! Okay, Isabella. Ready to see your first rainbow? But, Phineas, I keep tellin' yaâ Oh no, don't thank us yet, Isabella. I only wish Perry was here to see this. Ferb, power it up! Isabella, pour! Pour! Ooh. Wow! Oh? Well, that can't be good See? You see? Look, look. I do see. What a cute little city! Oh, and it's soft! Heinz, you made a plush model? I had a lot of felt! Well, at least it holds together. Remember that dining set you tried to build for our apartment? It's hard to forget when you keep reminding me. But But But Oh, come on, Vanessa. I think we need to get you out of the sun. Who's up for a game of lawn darts? I'd prefer to play hide-and-seek because I don't want to see you. Ouch. You know, in retrospect, I question the inclusion of a self-destruct button in the first place. Bless you, Perry the Platypus!  Mow, mow, mow, and my heart starts pumpin'   Chicka-chicka-choo-wap   Never gonna stop   Gitchee-gitchee-goo means that I love you   Gitchee-gitchee-goo means that I love you  I work alone, Carl. Sorry, sir. It's a solo. So, Isabella, what'd you think of your first rainbow? Well, it was really pretty, but it's not my first rainbow. But you said you'd never seen one in real life. No, no, I've never seen a unicorn. Oh! That's completely different. Hey, Ferb. I know what we're doing tomorrow. Perry, I almost forgot. It's the end of the day. You don't need to wear that thing anymore. Enjoy your freedom! Eight, nine, ten! Ready or not, here I come! Huh? Oh! No, no, no! It's called hide-and-seek! Youâ You hide, and I seek. I cannot seek if you don't hide. So you go hide yourself. Ignoramus. Go, go, go. Let'sâ Let's try this again. One, two, three, ten! Now where is he? I'm right here, sir. Oh, there you are, Perry the Platypus. Hey, Norm. Look who decided to show up! Hey!  There's a bright, shiny place   With a flag that bears my face   And it's floating on an inner tube   Far away from city life, my stupid brother and ex-wife   And it's got an evil attitude   Hail, Hail Doofania!  Youâ You know, the stopping is still bothering me."
"It's another gorgeous summer day here in the Tri-State Area. Ladies, have you asked a date to the Night of the Falling Stars Girls Choice Dance yet? It seems Danville's gone star-crazy waiting for the meteor shower tonight! A meteor shower? How cool is that? Just think. Somewhere out in space there's a bunch of asteroids headed right for Earth! Hey, boys? Boys? Oh there you are! Hey, look what I got for you online! Oh, cool! You named a star after us! You're now the owners of a little piece of the universe! Did you get one for Candace too? Well, I did. Yes, of course I did, although she doesn't really care about this stuff. Anyway, they're practically giving 'em away online! D'you know, it's even more exciting than the Oklahoma land rush of 1889! Ah, those corny history references made me fall for him in the first place. Vivian and I are off to our mahjong tournament. Have fun today, boys. Okay, darling. Good luck. Good luck! Well, what am I doing standing here when I can be out buying more stars? Hey, Ferb. Now that we own a star, we should go check it out! And how cool is space travel? The g-forces, eating dinner out of a tube, going to the bathroom without going to the bathroom, not to mention the weightlessness. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Uh Jeremy, I-I was wondering, uh if you'd like to go the Night of the Falling Stars Girls Choice Dance with me. With you? You've got to be kidding me. And that, Stacy, is why I can't ask Jeremy to the dance. You realize that's kind of a worst-case scenario, right? That could very well happen. What if he says no? What if he laughs in my face? You can't let fear rule your life, Candace. Jeremy likes you. He's not gonna say no. Now, I'm gonna hang up, and when I do, I want you to call Jeremy. Don't man the phone, girl. Phone the man! Yeah, I am not gonna let fear rule my life. Hello? Stacy? Yeah, I can't do it. (Song: Let's Take a Rocket Ship to Space)  Let's take a rocket ship to space   I hear it's a real swinging place   There isn't much air   Or gravity there   The stars will make your heart ra-ace   Let's take a rocket ship   Let's take a rocket ship   Let's take a rocket ship to space!   Let's take a saucer to the stars   Look out moon, move over Mars   The Martians all rock, to Basie and Bach   So bring your maracas and jazz guitars   Let's take a saucer to the stars   Let's take a rocket ship   A crazy three-staged rocket ship   Let's take a rocket ship to space!  And this is Mission Control. Kinda small. Oh, it looks small on the outside. But Ferb really knows how to maximize space. Hey Phineas, can I ask you something? Will you go to the danceâ Excuse me Phineas. Can I get you to sign some liability waivers? Sure thing. Hold that thought, Isabella. Sure. No prob. Why are you guys walking so slow? Dramatic effect. You guys ready? The star coordinates are pre-programmed. Let's light this candle. All systems go. Commence countdown. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ahem. Ignition. Looks like we need a jump-start. Stacy, what if while I'm asking him, a satellite falls out of orbit and crashes into theâ Wait a minute, what is going on out there? I'll call you back, Stacy. Positive to positive, negative to ground, right? Brothers. Does every sister have to deal with this? No. Do I have to deal with this? Of course. You'd think I'd have better things to do and other things to worry about. Every single day, it's one thing after another. But do Mom and Dad see it? No. Do they get in trouble? No. And another thingâ Got the remote? Oops. Uh, guys? I think you should see this. Candace? How'd you get in there? I can't hear you! My cheeks are covering my ears! We should probably go help her. Good thing we built two rockets. Wow, it's pretty. It was for Candace to see her star. I don't know why she took ours. Uh, ready to park this puppy? Oh, it's bad enough this happens on earth. Now space?! We're coming to get you, Candace! Hey, she's coming in! Candace, don't worry. It's pre-programmed. As long as you don't start hitting buttons randomly, everything will be okay. I can't hear you! I'm too busy hitting buttons randomly! By the way, Candace, where's Perry? I don't know. He must've gotten off before we launched. Agent P, I'm afraid I have terrible news. It's Doofenshmirtz. He's built a space station, and due to budget cuts, we have no way of getting you into space. Now, I've contacted the president, andâ Agent P, areâ are you in space? Nice work. You are always one step ahead. Your mission is to find Doofenshmirtz and stop him, Agent P.  Perry!  Agent P? Agent P? Uh, guys. What are all these red flashing things heading toward my rocket? Yeah. Those are asteroids. Asteroids? Just like Beggar's Canyon back home. We're catching up to her! Oop, she lost her engines. Let's go get her. I can't believe it's Perry the Platypus. Perry the Platypus, what are you doing here? I thought you guys were having budget cuts. Well, it just shows to go ya. Hey, let's walk and talk. So, you're probably wondering why my space station has two enormous arms. Well, what you should be wondering is why it has two giant hands! See, during my teen years, I was very adept at hand shadows. It was great for entertaining at parties, and for meeting Frauleins. But then one day, there was a new puppeteer in town. His name was Hans, and his hands were huge. We called him ""Huge Hands Hans"". His puppetry was garbage, but unfortunately, it was good enough for my Fraulein. I lost her to a boy with bigger fingers, and I never did a shadow puppet again. Until tonight! And when the sun rises in one hourâ See, right over there. Then everyone in the Tri-State Area will see my enormous hand shadows, on the moon! There she is! Uh-oh. This isn't good. Candace, you're in a decaying orbit. What does that even mean? You just need to get to the spacesuit. It's on the hook behind you. Okay. Now put it on. Okay, I'm putting it on. Now walk over to the door. Okay, I'm at the door. Now just open it, and take a little spacewalk to our ship. What? Candace, there's nothing to be scared of. Nothing to be scared of? There's the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space! I hear negative! There is no way I'm going out there. We're just a few yards away. You can't let fear rule your life. Of course I can. That's my thing. Candace, just calm down and take Ferb's hand. Ferb's hand? Thanks, guys. Mission Control? Come in, Mission Control. Phineas, did you find Candace? Yes. We've got her, and we're on our way home. Excellent. So, Phineas, speaking of home, there's that dance tonight, andâ Hold that thought, Isabella. I think we're out of fuel. What? Well, find some fuel somewhere and let's go. That's gonna be hard. We're kinda nowhere. You mean we're stuck here in the empty void of space? Phineas What is that? I have no idea. Uh, will the owner of a red station wagon please move your vehicle? You are in a shuttle loading and unloading zone only. What is that? I have no idea. Milk shakes? Wow, that was so bright, I thought it was a star. Maybe we'll find some fuel here. Are you sure you don't wanna come with us? Ferb says the oxygen levels are just like Earth. Uh I'm sure. Just find some fuel, and let's get out of here! One sarsaparilla coming up. I love you, man. Hi. I'm Phineas, and this is Ferb. Wait a second. You're Phineas and Ferb? Yeah. Hey, everyone, it's the new owners! New owners? Those coordinates are right here. Ferb, this is our star. Wow. That sign really is bright. I told you they'd show up. So now that you own the joint, what do you think of it? I know, it's a little run-down. I have a few ideas for this place. You do realize that's a worst-case scenario, right, Candace? But I do feel for ya. I've been trying to ask Phineas to that same dance all day. Phineas. What's taking those boys so long? They were supposed to find fuel ages ago. Later, Isabella. Sure. No prob. Stop right there. Let me in, buster. Phineas and Ferb don't take kindly to gatecrashers. I'm no gatecrasher. I'm their sister! Ooh, sorry about that. Honest mistake. You won't mention this to them, eh? Uh I'm their sister.  Yeah  (Song: Shooting Star Milkshake Bar)  There's a jumpin' little rock in the outer spiral arm   May not be pretty, but it's got a lotta charm   It's a shooting star milkshake bar, yeah   It's not a nebula, it's not a quasar   It's a shooting star milkshake bar   At the speed of light, you know you're never too far   From the meatiest meteor that you'll ever find   In this big ol' galactic void   You got to   Shake, shake-shake, shake your asteroid   Shake, shake-shake, shake your asteroid  Hey, Candace. Guess what? This is our star! I thought we were getting out of here. Ferb and I thought we'd fix up the place. You know, pride of ownership? Take a load off. Have a shake. I can't do it. Uh Are you okay? No. The bicentennial Taming of the Yarks Dance is tonight, and I wanna ask the girl of my dreams, but what if she says no? What if she laughs in my face? What if her friends laugh at me? What if her friends' friends laugh at me? Aren't you being a little overly dramatic? I mean, really, what's the worst thing that could happen? Uh The entire planet could blow up? Please. I think you should just ask her to the dance. Really? You think so? I do. Really. Well Okay. Here goes nothin'. Sylvia will you go to the dance with me? Well, of course. I've been waiting for you to ask me. I mean, even if you asked someone else, I'd still have to go with you. See? That wasn't so hard. So Candace? Oh, I get it. Big lesson. Yeah, well, I guess I learned that it wouldn't be hard to ask Jeremy out if he was growing out of the back of my head. Now you find us some fuel, and let's get outta here. Wow. I just wanted to know if she liked the shake. You don't know where we could find some rocket fuel, do ya? Rocket fuel? It's all Ronaldo drinks. Only imported rocket fuel. Grazie. Let's go! Hey, Ferb. I'm sensing Candace wants to leave. Will you cut that out? Uh, okay, that's it. I'm not waiting anymore. Great. Let's park the shuttle. Oh, come on! Uh-oh. I think I should go inside now. Why are we stopping? I don't get it. We have plenty of fuel. The battery's worn down. Candace, were you using the videophone without the engine running? Yeah. Was that a bad thing? If by ""bad"", you mean we're stranded in the never-ending, icy-cold, soul-sucking darkness of space Then, yeah. Soon, Perry the Platypus, the sun will be at full strength, and my plan will come to fruition. Unless, of course, it's overcast Eh, but what are you going to do? Proximity alert? Why are there so many people in space? What's up with that? You need another jump-start? Candace, didn't you have the engine running when we were talking on the videophone? Am I the only person who doesn't know this? So, any suggestions, Isabella? Sensors are indicating a massive power source in your area. Where? I don't see it. Wait a minute. I see it. It's Mom's car! We're saved! Ferb, toss me the starter remote. Ooh That's right. We left it at home. What's a starter remote? Well, legally we're too young to start a car. We get away with it by using a starter remote. But you, Candace, have your learner's permit. Looks like you'll be doing the jump-starting. What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Can't you guys just find some old nuts and bolts lying around and jerry-rig up some kind of machiney-deely-bob and get us out of this situation? Candace, we are just kids. Ugh! Why am I arguing this? Hand me the suit. Let me turn on the oxygen. Does this suit make my butt look big? Yes. Yes, it does. Maybe I had the pressure up too high. Never mind. I'll fix it. Well, I guess this is preferable. You can do this, Candace. I can do this. I can do this. I can do this. I can't do this. I can't do this. What is this? Now, why would an astronaut wear such big gloves? Wait a second! Huge Hands Hans?! It's Huge Hands Hans! He found me out in space! Oh, you're not going to steal a job from me this time, Huge Hands Hans! Nor my Fraulein's! How did it go again, Phineas? It's positive to positive. Positive to positive. Negative to ground. What ground? We're in space! No, no. Ground just means any piece of metal. Any piece of metal? Well, then why do they call it ground? Why don't they just call it meâ What's wrong, Candace? Candace? Candace, what's wroâ Oh. Danville, we have a problem. Okay, girls. Turn to the giant robot section of your Fireside Girls manuals. Isabella, anything? Still looking. Isabella! Here it is. Okay. According to this, you should get the heck out of there! Great, but we've got no power. She didn't connect theâ Candace! Negative to ground! What? Negative to ground, Candace! Negative to ground! Oh. You mean negative to metal! I did it! I did it! She did it! No! Huge Hands Hans is getting away! Not this time, freak fingers! Just you wait, Huge Hands Hans! You can run, but you can't hide! Y-You know, he can run, but he can'tâ Ow! Wait a second. How did youâ? Oh, I see. That's itâ That's not fair! Oh, that's it. It's on now! Isabella, I hate to bother you again. Oh, no bother. You got anything else? The robot's gaining on us. It says they don't corner well. They don't corner well? Wait a sec. Candace, fasten your seat belt. We're taking a little detour. Now, how is she passing us? Phineas, what are you doing?! See? Corners like a dream. That's it! Run away, Perry the Scaredyâ Oof. Oh, I think I need to put on my spacesuit. Uh-oh. And now, my good man, you ready for this? Your tip. Your very own star. Uptown, they give quasars. Oh. Sweet land! Hey, Phineas, you guys were great. Thanks. You weren't too bad yourself. Oh. Thanks. So, would you like to go to the Night of the Falling Stars Girls' Choice Dance tonight? Sounds like fun. Really? Ferb, what's our schedule like? Okay. We'll be there. Both of you? Yeah. Why don't you come by, and we'll all walk over together? Sure. No prob. Thanks for the lift, Viv. Mom! Hey, sweetheart. Oh! Look at your outfit. Hey, guess what? We won! But the grand prize was a star. Ooh! Whoo! Mom, that's great, but you gotta see something in the yard. Come on, you gotta see it! Come on, come on! All right, I'm a-comin'. Hmm. Uh. I'll be right with you after I pull my car into the garage. Yes! It's still here! See, Mom? There! Mom? I'm just backing the car in! I'll be right with you! So what did you want to show me, Candace? Just go make some pie. Or, how about a healthy fruit salad? Oh, curse this tin can! Ugh. I'm going to need a jump-start! Iâ Uh No, I guess it won't help now. Hey, Candace? What? Ferb and I just wanted to say thank you. We were in a pretty precarious situation up there. If it wasn't for your bravery, who knows what would have happened? Really? You think I'm brave? Are you kidding? Ferb was goin' on and on about it. Yeah, I was brave! I was brave! I'm not gonna let fear rule my life anymore! Now I've gotta go. I've got a mission to accomplish. Hey, Perry. Where ya been? Jeremy, will you go to the dance with me? Candace? Yeah. I've been waiting for you to ask me. Really? Yeah. Only, uh Uh Candace, is that what you're gonna wear? Why? You like it? Hey, Candace, look. A shooting star. Just for us.  Let's take a rocket ship   A crazy three-stage rocket ship   Let's take a rocket ship to space!  Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And you too, Huge Hands Hans! It's the final frontier, baby."
"Hey, Ferb. Have you seen bolt #473? Okay, it's still here. Oh, come on, Mom! We're really coming down to the wire on this one. Mom! Oh, great and magical being who make all things magically vanish before Mom sees them. Knock it off! Thanks, Vivian. See you Tuesday for totem pole carving. Mom! Mom! Quick, Mom, look! Before it disappears! Well, if it isn't the welcoming committee fromâ No time for dry, witty remarks! Must move. Move, move, move, move, move! Move, move, move, move! Don't you get tired of this? What do you mean? The same old routine every day. Doesn't it ever getâ Hmm, I don't know boring? You know what? You're right. I guess it has gotten a little old. I just get so frustrated. I always come so close to busting Phineas and Ferb, but it ends the same way every single time. I look and say there's a massive ""thing"" Phineas and Ferb built right in front of me, but every time you look, you always say I see it. There it is. ""I see it."" Right on you. Wait, what? Come again? I see it! You mean you see my point? No, Candace. I see that! You do?! How could I miss it? But I don't understand. How theâ? Or-or who theâ? Butâ What theâ? Hi, Mom! Check it out! The Flying Car of the Future; Today! Is that my car?! She sees the car, too! The Flying Car of the Future; Today, is still pulling a bit to the right. Phineas! Ferb! Get down here this instant! Okay, Mom. Be right down. Oh, there you are, Perry. So, what do you think, Mom? Pretty cool, huh? Cool?! This is the most dangerous thing I've ever seen! Don't worry, we were safe. Ferb invented a new invisible helmet head system. ""When life's never dull, wear a hull for your skull."" How dare you do all this without permission! But all our building permits are in order. I mean, my permission. This morning I asked you if we could modify our car to make it fly. I was talking about your toy car! How could you possibly think I meant my station wagon?! You are in so much trouble, young man! But we do this sort of thing every day. What?! See, Mom? I told you. But you never listened. But I Mom. Phineas and Ferb built a rollercoaster! Phineas and Ferb are one-hit wonders? Phineas and Ferb carved my face into Mount Rushmore. Phineas and Ferb are driving cattle. Phineas and Ferb built a giant tree house robot. are promoting a boxing match built a beach in the backyard built a time machine built a ski resort are directing a movie built a haunted house built a giant sundae maker are getting the band back together Phineas and Ferb are in my large intestine! Oh, Candace. All the times I called you delusional and mocked you to my friends behind your back, all those journals I've filled with an eye towards stand-up comedy but you were telling the truth! I'm so sorry. You're the best daughter any mother could dream of having. Finally, you realize that! Well, what's all this yelling about? Oh, my word! That is impressive. Did you know about this? Well, I I Uh I-I Uh No. What are you gonna do to them? No TV for a month? Or they have to serve me for a year. How about confiscating their toolbox? I know! Take away their seats on the city council! You have seats on the city council? We rotate out with the Board of Selectmen. Well, some punishment may be in order. But, look. There's no harm done really. Hey, look, Ferb. Here's bolt #473. I hope that wasn't important. Well, at least the self-parking works. I'm sorry, but this is really for your own good. We need you both to understand that what you've been doing is way too dangerous. I'd never be able to live with myself if you got hurt. We were wearing helmets. Don't worry. Your boys will be in good hands. As you can see from our realistically illustrated brochure, the Smile Away Reformatory offers a serene, peaceful environment, in which safety, discipline and responsibility are encouraged. Your boys will be whipped into shape in no time. Well, I'll be honest, Ferb. I didn't see this coming. Baljeet? What are you doing here? Well, I got kicked out of summer school because my grades were too high. But then I heard about this place. Sure, they break you down and strip you of your identity, but, school is school. Bye, boys. See you at the end of summer! Yes! I actually busted Phineas and Ferb! This is the happiest moment of my life! Woo-hoo! I'm finally free! (Song: The Good Life)  The sun is up   The sky is blue   I can do whatever I want to   Cause there's nothing in my way   A new life starts today   I used to fret and worry so   But now I've never felt so free   'Cause I'm living the good life   ('Cause I'm living a good life)   It's the life for me   Yeah, I'm living the good life, the life's for me   Yeah, I'm living the good life, the life's for me  That doesn't look like the brochure. I was too excited to wait. I shaved last night. Just call me Bald-jeet. Get it? ""Bald-jeet""? Okay, listen up, maggots! You are here because your parents are worried about you. Now, the way I see it, the root of all children's problems is unacceptable levels of imagination, fun, creativity, and unbridled enthusiasm! Don't you eyeball me! Our goal at this school is to crush the dangerous elements inside you, and replace them with structure, order, discipline and conformity. Whatâ? What'cha doin'? Oh, a few simple modifications. We call it the ""Ferris Bed."" It makes trading off fair, simple and fun, as well as giving easy access to the top bunk. All at the push of a button. Pretty cool, huh? You know, this is a very inefficient way to clean a bathroom. That's the idea! Now, make it shine! And no funky rhythms! I thought it had more of a free-form jazz vibe. Huh. Well, you can't please everybody. Oh! Ow-ow! What did you do? I tripped over Ferb's old toolbox. Well, do you wanna go horseback riding? What's your hurry? Let's relax for a little while. You know, with Phineas and Ferb gone, I've had a blast doing things I wanted to do. But it's strange. I kind of miss the little guys. It's as if there was a whole other side to our relationship that I never noticed before. (Song: Little Brothers)  Little brother   I remember when you first came home   Then came another   Little brother of our own   Even when you break my toys   You will always be my   Little brothers   'Cause you're younger   We're related and you're boys   Even when you're making too much noise   You will always be my   Little brothers   'Cause you're younger   We're related and you're boys   Little brothers   Little brothers   Little brothers  Uh, Stace. You're kind of bumming me out with the song there. You know, you finally have everything you ever wanted. Call me when you get over it. Okay. Maybe a little TV will take my mind off things. Today on ""The Morty Williams Show,"" ""My Kid Is Bad, and I Want to Blame Others!"" We'll go inside the nation's toughest reformatory school, where free-thinking children undergo complete personality re-programming, and have all the creativity and imagination sucked right out of them. They are forced to think inside the box. Wait a second. They didn't belong in a place like that. I know what I have to do. Hey, Candace. Jeremy? How did you get in here? There's a huge gaping hole in the side of your house. Oh, yeah. Well, Phineas and Ferb would've usually fixed that by now. You wanna go horseback riding? Would you stop already with the horses? Jeremy! I know what I'm gonna do today! I'm gonna bust my brothers. Didn't you already do that? Out! Bust my brothers out! Cool. I always liked your brothers. I'm coming with you. You mean, like a date? Yeah. A weird sort of prison-break, kind of date. Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. Creative acts are inimitable and dangerous. Using your imagination is morally wrong. The book was so much better. Hmm. It's a letter from the Board of Selectmen. The city council is proposing a millage to cover the overage from last quarter, and they need Phineas and Ferb's input. Perhaps we were a bit hard on them. Yeah. They really did believe they had permission. I suppose it was all a big misunderstanding. Well, let's go get 'em, shall we? We can take the Flying Car of the Future; Today! Weren't you supposed to get that changed back to normal? Yes, yes, but you must admit. It's pretty cool! Yeah, it's pretty cool. Hey! Where's the Flying Car of the Future; Today? Sorry. The Flying Car of the Future; Today is pulling a bit to the right. Are you kidding? This is the best date ever. Maybe we should walk the rest of the way. (Song: Chains on Me)  I woke up this morning, and the world was gray   Hadn't seen the sun since they hauled me away   The boss man says there's no use in tryin'   He won't let me color outside of the lines   Got these chains on me   And they're draggin' me down   Got these chains on me   Hear that clankin' sound?   Got these chains on me   Mister, hear my song   Don't say imagination is morally wrong   Mm-hmm  Drink of water, boss?  As long as I've been here   I got nothin' to show   Try to make somethin', but the boss says no   Wanna be creative but the man won't hear it   That big boss man, he's tryin' to crush my spirit   Got these chains on me   They won't let me fly   Got these chains on me   Won't tell me why   Got these chains on me   Mister, hear my song   Don't say imagination is morally wrong   No, they won't let us dance or bang that gong   'Cause they say imagination is morally wrong  Hey, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do today. No. Hey, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do No. today. Hey No. Ferb No. I No. uh No. know No. what No! No. No. No. No! Hey, F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F-F Yes. I've finally broken them. You okay, Candace? No, I'm trudging. I never knew people actually trudged. Look, we're here. What do you want? Um Uh, hi. Yeah, I'm here for my brothers, Phineas and Ferb. They don't graduate till the end of the summer. Get lost. So much for the direct approach. It's time we tried it Phineas and Ferb style. Is this gonna work? It's just like the Trojan horse from history class. They'll accept this as a gift, then after everyone falls asleep, we'll jump out and rescue Phineas and Ferb. You two again? I thought I told you to get lost! Maybe we gotta think bigger. Wow, what a thoughtful gift. Too bad I don't have room for you, handsome. I'm gonna have to get a bigger yard. Now's our chance. Yes, we did itâ Oh, what is this? Hair? Gross! I bet you regret coming along with me now, huh? Actually, I'm kinda havin' fun. You know, crazy, prison-break kinda fun. And, ew! Look at this. ""Baljeet's summer wig. Store at room temperature""? Huh? The Morty Williams Show? Wait a second. Now I've got a plan. It's foolproof. Yes. Clearly I'm Morty Williams, and I'm back to do another segment. Hey, aren't you a little female to be Morty Williams? Uh Well, you know what they say. The camera adds masculinity. Great. Well, come on in, Morty. We're doing a follow-up show on Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher. My biggest success stories. Right this way. Ah, Phineas and Ferb. Such curious and self-reliant children. So fun-loving, imaginative and creative. Fortunately, we got to them just in time. See for yourself. Flynn, Fletcher, fall in! You see, here at the Smile Away Reformatory, our motto is, ""It's structure, order and discipline today, so tomorrow it's smile away."" Our methods have been proven 100% effective since Guys, it's me, Candace. We've come to bust you out of here. Now's our chance. Run! Just testing. Wow, you've done a great job of turning them into, uh that. Yes. Yes, we have. Uh Yeah, I-I think we should really get some more footage of you. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Y-You've got ""it,"" mister. So, uh, let's see. Uh Close your eyes. Uh, like this? Yes! Now stick your fingers in your ears. Perfect. Now go, ""La la la la la la la la la la la la la la!"" Well, okay.  La la la la, la la la la   La la la la, la la la la  The lights are all wrong. Go inside the janitor's closet. And action! Come on, guys, we can escape now. Escaping is wrong, and wrongness is bad. We don't have time for this. Grab 'em! Why is Morty Williams running off with our children? I don't know. Attention, all personnel. Two students have escaped with the help of Morty Williams, syndicated daytime talk show host. Weekday mornings. Check local listings for time and channel. Come on, this way! Yep, it's time to go back inside the Smile Away Reformatory School for more footage. Those zombified brats are making me one richâ Monty Williams! Get him! I've got to buy us some time. It's Morty Williams! Get him! Hey, wait a minute. Look. They tricked us. Hey, it's Morty Williams! Get him! Oh, we made it! Okay, guys. This is your department. Fix the car, quick! Age-inappropriate building is unsafe and irresponsible. Uh Candace? You don't have to build anything. Justâ figure out how to fix it! I'm getting your toolbox. See? Your tools. A bridge! You can build a bridge across the ravine! Good boys don't make anything but their sisters happy. Great, great. Make me happy. Put on your helmet head systems, use your tools, and do what you do best. Build a bridge and save us! Creative acts are inimitable and dangerous. Listen to me, guys. Forget everything they told you. Creativity isn't bad. It's the best thing about you. You two can do anything. And that's why I've always been secretly proud to be your older sister. What have I done? What have I done?! Hey, Ferb. I know what we're gonna do today. Yes! They're back! Too late. They're mine. And so are you. Look! Perry has a hat? Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  La la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la  Do you think he'll be  Corn dog, corn dog   Yummy, yummy, yummy  Okay. Where did you get thatâ? Mom, Dad! Thank goodness. The strangest thing just happened. Fear not. Your parents are here now. Huh? The real shock is you're just noticing this now. Whaâ? I'm just as confused as you are, Kevin. Candace, since I have no idea what will happen next, I need to tell you something. I love you, Candace Flynn. Will you marry me? Oh, Jeremy! I always dreamtâ Wait a minute. That's it! I'm dreaming! That would explain the talking zebra. Nah. I see him all the time. This. This is actually the freaky part. And it's all just been one, big dream! So none of that really happened. I never actually busted Phineas and Ferb. I am so happy. And suddenly, Mom and Dad were controlled by a giant puppet master! Cool. Yeah. So I'm standing there, and Jeremy comes over and says certain things. And Go grab my journal. This is comedy gold. Hey, Ferb. We should build a device that projects your dreams like a movie. I'd love to see what Perry dreams about. Ooh, I almost forgot. Perry was in the dream too. He was like a super-secret agent or something. Perhaps that's where he disappears to everyday. Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Hey, wait! What are you doing? Hey! Wait a minute. What's going on? I haven't even finished my cereal! Agent P, your cover's been blown. We're going to have to relocate you. Ah, hey, Perry. What's wrong, boy? You sounded like you were having a bad dream. It's okay now. Go back to sleep. I said no funky rhythms! No, Ferb. He's right. That was a little funky."
"What should we do today? Build an underwater skate park? Sounds pretty wicked! Fly with rocket-powered bat wings? Awesome! Teach Perry tricks. He's just a platypus. He doesn't do much. Oh, hi, Isabella. Hey, Phineas. You might wanna go check up on Baljeet. I was walking by his house and heard him scream ""Aiiieeee! I'm doomed to be an incompetent flunkee forever! Ever ever ever"" I added the echo part. Sounds pretty serious. Baljeet! It's Phineas and Ferb. Why are all the lights off? Darkness is a shroud that hides my shame. Hey, buddy. Why don't you tell us what's going on. Because of the 17 summer school classes I am taking, I qualified for the science fair. So I decided to design this. A portal to Mars? Cool! No! Not cool. When I showed my teacher, he said A portal to Mars? And what does it do? Well, without over-complicating things, it's a portal to Mars. You step through it and you're on Mars. Well, this is very creative. But, unless you can build a working model, the best I can give you is An A-minus?! That would be the worst grade of my life! Why don't you just build one? I am not mechanically inclined like the two of you. To truly understand my predicament, I feel it will be best expressed in a song. (Song: Baliwood)  From the mountains of the Himalayas   To the valleys of Kashmir   My forefathers and their four fathers   Knew one thing very clear   That to be a great success in life   You have to make the grade   But if I cannot build a prototype   My dreams will be purÃ©ed   PurÃ©ed!   PurÃ©ed!   I know what we're going to do today!   Ferb and I are on the case!   We'll help you build your prototype   You won't be a disgrace!   Good!   With your mechanical inclinations   And my scientific expertise   We are a team that can not be beaten   Wait!   Something just occurred to me!   Where's Perry?   Where's Perry?  Did you have him when you came over?  Do-be-do-be-do-ba-do  Oh. Uh. Agent P. It appears that Doofenshmirtz has made some rather unusual purchases. Chicken wire, three metric tons of baking soda and lederhosen. You know those leather bib-front shorts that make you look like a walking cuckoo clock? Man, he is one sick puppy. You're all set for the science fair tomorrow. Inside I am thanking you a thousand times, even though on the outside I remain quite frugal. Wow, Baljeet. You're already set up. I have been here since midnight waiting for everyone! I can't stop smiling! I have got cramps in my cheeks. Here. Let me help you. There you go, buddy. Ahh. Now I'll just hang out and ""be cool"" till my teacher gets here. Uh-oh. It is happening again! Oh, yeah, Jeremy. No one makes a corn dog like you. Oh. Hi, Candace. Nice binoculars. Yep. Yep, they definitely are working. I-I just bought these for my dad and was just, uh You know Making sure that they work, and they sure do. You can see really far away or really up close. ""Help wanted""? Yeah! You should apply. We could work together. You mean side by side? Hi, there. I'm really really motivated! Really really really positive! Really really high-energy! And would like to apply for the job. Excuse me. I-I would also like to apply for the job. Well, ladies, I'm afraid I only have one opening. How about a competition to see who gets the job? Sounds like a great idea to me. Good luck. Ooh Too slow. I think I'll call you, Molasses. Molasses. Well, I think I'll call you something Slower than molasses, that's for sure. This isn't part of the competition, is it? Oh, Perry the Platypus, welcome to my truck of doom. I suppose you're wondering why I'm wearing lederhosen. What? I've got the legs for it! Eh? Eh? Eh? Anyway, it will all become clear soon enough! Come on, Hansel! Move it! Hey, wise guy, I'm exp Oh! Oh-ho-ho! Sorry, madam. Sorry. Her voice was so masculine and growly. I thought it was a man. I mean, people must call her ""sir"" all the time on the phone. It must be so, em Uh Ha. She's standing right behind me now, isn't she? Not one word, Perry the Platypus. Oh, great! A line! Oh, brother! What is this, a model of Pluto? That planet doesn't even exist anymore, you moron! Thanks for holding my spot in line, little brother. What were you saying about Pluto? Nothing. I'mâ I'm sure it's I suppose you are wondering why I am putting myself through all of this. When I was young, I entered a science fair with my very first Inator. I wasâ I wasn't very clever with names yet. It was just, you know, Inator. Just as I was about to demonstrate my invention to the judges, a kid with a baking soda volcano stole the show! The next year, I tried again with my even bigger Inator. And again, my thunder was stolen by a baking soda volcano! I'd had enough of science. I decided to devote my life to poetry instead. The movies are gray, the TV is black, the horses are running, please bring me some food. Yet, curiously, I still lost to a baking soda volcano! But never again! Behold! The world's largest baking soda volcano! I mean, itâ it's got to be the biggest one here, right? It's gonna win. I feel confident. Next? Oh, we're next. Aren't you a little old to be entering this science fair? No! What makes you say that? Iâ I mean, look at me! I'm wearing lederhosen! Okay. Go ahead. See? I know what I'm doing. Hi, Mr. McGillicuddy. Well, I see you've built yourself a prototype. But the question still remains. Does it work? Well, I think Of course it works! Baljeet, fire it up. Okay. So I see the science fair. Take a closer look, Mr. McGillicuddy. Wow! A science fair on Mars! Baljeet, you have just validated my entire career as an educator! You get an A+++! I'm gonna go get the judges! Soon I will show them the havoc created when an acid and a base combine! But first I have to find an outlet 'cause there's a nice little laser show that goes along with it. Ah, there, we'll just take this out and put mine in. Evil. It's right over here. Baljeet, show our judges what Mr. McGillicuddy has taught you. Uh. Um Letâ Uh. Just a moment. It takes the skilled hand of a master professor. Hello? Mr. Martian! It's Mr. McGillicuddy. Uno momento. Who's up for corn dogs? I am. Aha! Turn it all the way up to high. Yes! That should do it. I wonder what's wrong with the portal? Ah, no matter. Personally, I never cared about winning. I just wanted a good grade. Ahh. Well, who's up for corn dogs? Me! Girls, your first task is to dress these dogs with ketchup and mustard. I'll be back in a little bit to check your work. Good luck! Hey, no fair! I ran out of ketchup. Oops. Now I'm out of ketchup. Oops. Now I'm out of mustard. Oh, look. I'm out of relish! Oh, it's gotta work. It's gotta work! Ah! Oh. Huh? Now just add some vinegar andâ It just wasn't plugged in. There's an outlet over there. It's working! It's working! Ew, gross! I smell like salad. Say goodbye to this pair of lederhosen. Hey! I'm unhurt! Yes! I am invincible! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, where are we going? All right. So what was it you wanted to show us? Nâ Nâ No! Itâ It-It was here! Wellâ Uh Come on, let's go find a real winner. But But it did But it did But it did Excuse me. Am I too late to enter? Are those mechanical arms? Why, yes. I used them to make this baking soda volcano. A baking soda volcano? Cool! First prize! Oh, come on! But it did Well, seeing as how you used most of my ketchup and mustard to dress yourselves, I'm afraid neither of you get the job. Snail! I'll call you Snail. Ha! Ooh. You're quick. I just can't believe you guys built a portal to Mars and didn't go through it yourselves! Oh, we did. But that's another story. Oh, look.  There's Perry!"
"To truly understand my predicament, I feel it will be best expressed in a song. Let's see. Who should I call first to hang out with? How about Jeremy! Hey. It's Jeremy. You know what to do after theâ Oh, hey, Jeremy. It's Candace. Uh Just seeing what's going on today. Call me back if you want to. Okay. Bye! Oh, man. That never gets easier. Oh, well. I'll just call Stacy. She's probably been waiting by the phone all morning. You've reached Stacy's mobile. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Hey, Stace! It's Candace. Where are you? Call me! Hmm. That's weird. Who else can I call? I know! Jenny! I haven't seen her since the boys built a beach in the backyard. Hello. Uh Jenny, hey, it's Candy. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Call me. Hmm. Who else do I know? Becky, this is Candace. I know we haven't talked since kindergarten, but Hey, Wendy. This is Candace. We shared a seat on the bus to planetarium. Hello? Clarissa, this is Candace. We played volleyball at camp. Jill? Nancy? Barbara? Olga? Chicago Joe! Information. See a movie with me. Where is everyone? Are they all out having fun without me? So, all my friends need some time to themselves, huh? Well, not without me, they're not. Yeah, I'm looking for Jeremy too. I need him to work tomorrow. Our fry guy just defected over to Taco Tepee. You win this one, Cooks with Grease! Am I that bad to hang out with? Ooh! A text message. And it's from Stacy! ""CYL, BFF, S."" What does that mean? Let's see. ""Candace, you loser. Bad friendships fail. Stacy."" Harsh. Feels like I don't exist anymore, like I'm a nobody. I wish I could go to some cool faraway place and start over. Wait a minute. Those are Phineas and Ferb's bikes! Inside I am thanking you a thousand times, even though on the outside I remain quite frugal. See you tomorrow. What are you guys up to? We just built a teleport to a cool, faraway place. Well, that's all I needed to hear! Candace Flynn is out. Peace! Welcome to Mars. Mars?! Oh, no! The portal is broken! Ooh, now I will not get a good grade at the science fair tomorrow, andâ Uh There's also the issue of your sister stranded on a distant, barren planet. Don't worry, we can fix it. Heh. Candace is probably laughing about it as we speak! Phineas!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus, what's up? Oh, are you here toâ? Oh, no, no, no. I-I'm running a little behind. I'm still in the middle of basic plotting and scheming. Plus, I-I can't give you my evil scheme monologue because I write that last. Sorry, that's just how I roll. Wait, wait! Why don't you help me? That way I can finish faster and you can defeat me faster. It's â It's win-win! Let-Let me grab my coupons. We'll start by shopping for some supplies. You guys are so busted! busted busted busted busted Now I truly am alone. Hey, it's one of those Mars Rovers. I'm saved! I can't take it anymore! I've been staring at red rocks for 20 years! That's all there is on that stupid planet! Red rocks! Face it, there's no life on Mars. That's it! I'm shutting this place down! Game over! Stupid Rover! You're not going to ignore me too. Take that, you ugly, unmanned exploratory vehicle! And that! Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought. Huh? What are you? What's going on? What are you doing? Put me down! There! I think we fixed it. No. That is Venus. And that is Earth in prehistoric time. Change it, change it, change it! Hey, look. It is us in the future fixing the portal. Hello, Baljeet of the past! Just watch us. That is how we learned to fix it. Gesundheit! Thanks. It worked. Cool! Okay. Give us 20 minutes to find Candace, then open up the portal. Ooh, please be careful. I still need your help at the science fair tomorrow. Hmm. Something tells me Candace was here. Good thing you brought your tools. I got an idea. Okay, what's going on? Ooh. You're making me your ruler? Cool! Let's get this party started! Crank the tunes. Uh You know, music. You guys don't know what music is? Well, it's like It's like this. (Song: Queen of Mars) That's it! You're getting it.  I was just a lonely girl   Lookin' for a little fun   Though without a friend in the world   I was forced to find a new one   Now I'm the queen of Mars, I was invisible on Earth   It only took a magic portal to Mars to give me some self-worth   You put a crown on my head   And you all seem to worship me   Well you don't understand a word I've said   Still you treat me like royalty   'Cause I'm the queen of Mars, I was invisible on Earth   It only took a magic portal to Mars to give me some self-worth  Whoo-hoo! Follow that music, Ferb! You are much more attentive than my friends on Earth, and better at building statues of me. Come on, let's walk and talk. Of course, I'll do most of the talking. To make things easier, I'll call you Good Stacy, and you, Good Jenny. Andâ Huh? Oh, okay, what the heck? Hey, Candace. Phineas? Ferb? We're here to rescue you. Why would I go back to being a nobody when I could be the queen of here? Well, there's a lot ofâ Uh Candace? What's up with your friends? Ah, ignore them. They're harmless. Hey, why don't you hang out a while so you can tell everyone how popular I've become. Okay, I've already got the chicken wire. Let's see. Oh, here! Youâ You take the list and cross things off as we go. Should we get something for later, like uh Like one of those big pickles or a three-bean salad? Well, that was awkward. Uh, I'm just gonna go for a walk. Uh-uh, guys, not now, okay? No, no, really. I would just like to go for a walk alone. Ugh! There you are! Where've you guys been? Ferb was just explaining to the Martians how we got here. Oh. Wait, what? Ferb speaks Martian. They're really excited about the idea of a science fair. Figures. I'm the queen of little green nerds. Can you tell them that I just want a little time to myself? They say fine, but not without them. Ugh! Okay, just because I need to do things without you sometimes, doesn't mean I don't like you or don't appreciate your friendship. But Candace, isn't thatâ Yeah, yeah, just like my friends with me. Whoop-de-doo! It appears the Martians are blaming us for their queen wanting to leave. Quick! Get in! Queen Candace is out! Peace! Did you know they could do that? No, but get this. Every part of their body is a musical instrument, and they never even discovered music before. Martians are so lame. Hey, Candace. You got your cell phone on you? Hello, Baljeet? How is it we have bars here? We kinda need you to open the portal now. They're gaining on us! Perry the Platypus, thanks for your help. I usually hate shopping, but, you know, you make it fun. What, that? Oh, that's my first Inator. Good story. I'll tell you all about it tomorrow. Well, I should probably get back to my latest evil scheme! So long sucker! Mom! Mom! Well, hello, Candace. Where've you been? I want you to see my telescope. A telescope? Perfect! You know, Iâ I don't even remember what this does. Oh, that's right, it just shoots a beam into space. No wonder I lost to a baking soda volcano. Phineas and Ferb built this portal to Mars and I went through it and was crowned queen of the Martians. Now I know it sounds crazy, but this time, I have proof. Who does that look like? Hmm. Well, it looks a little like a rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig. What? Let me see that. But-but-butâ But-but-but-butâ Hey, Candace. Oh, there you are, guys! Where have you been all day? I was at the dentist. I was taking my little sister to the movies. Didn't you get my text message? ""Call you later. Best friends forever. Stacy."" Oh. That's what I thought it said. It's funny. I kind of thought you guys were avoiding me. Actually, I was trying to avoid you. Do I know you? No. That's how great it's been working. Unknown guy is out. Peace! I am invincible! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait, where are we going? Where am I? O-Okay. Be cool, okay? Oh, you're going to make me your king? Well, okay, if you must. I'mâ What? Oh, come on!"
"We're here! Ah, Lake Nose. This is just what I needed. A nice, relaxing family getaway. Such beauty, such tranquility. A fisherman's paradise. Yes, of all the lakes in the world, I'm glad we picked the Nose. That's charming, dear. I still can't believe I get to be on the Lake Nose lifeguard squad with Jeremy. The lifeguards at Lake Nose are considered the coolest of the cool. All the other kids look up to them, and have to do whatever they say. Or they'll get eaten. Exactly. Iâ Wait, what? Well, it says here, ""Many believe these murky waters are home to Nosey, the ferocious Lake Nose Monster"". Nosey? Yeah, I'm so sure. There's no such thing as a Lake Nose Monster. Right, Dad? Well, Candace there's no such thing as lots of things, and there's such a thing as many other things. Is Nosey such a thing? Well, you see, that's the thing, isn't it? Dad, is this one of those cultural things again? Because I'm not sure they'd even know what the heck you're talking about in England. Ooh! It's possible Nosey has survived because Lake Nose is unusually rich in zinc, a common metal used in everything from sunblock to pennies. Cool. Oh, of course! Nosey the vicious zinc-eating dinosaur. Now it makes perfect sense! Thank you, crazy people I live with! It doesn't say ""eats it"". He probably just absorbs it through his skin. Ooh, look! They have pictures of him. Elephant, log, dolphin, driftwood, tire, driftwood, rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig, driftwood, driftwood, you aren't old enough to know what that is, driftwood, driftwood, it's usually driftwood. So don't go humiliating me byâ I don't know, building some boat to find the Lake Nose Monster or something. Huh. Some boat to find the Lake Nose Monster or something. Ferb, are you not saying what I'm thinking? Hey, where's Perry? Log in. (Song: Mission)  You're gonna get a mission   A mission, a mission   A brand-new mission   What's it gonna be?   Go and get your mission   Your mission, your mission   A brand-new mission   We can't wait to see!  Log out. Exit to your left, Agent P. Good morning, Agent P. I hope you enjoyed Lair Entrance; The Ride. The agency wanted to make coming into work more exciting. It was either that or a huge bonus check. Well, in focus group tests, Anyway, your mission. We've tracked Dr. Doofenshmirtz here to Lake Nose where we intercepted part of this phone call. I'm sorry, sir. We do not deliver our hot wings to the bottom of a lake. Aw come on! I'll tip fifteen percent! Our analysts agree, evil, chicken wings, underwater, fifteen percent. It's a recipe for disaster. It's up to you to stop him, Agent P. I think we're all set to get definitive proof that Nosey really exists. All right, what are you two up to? We've just built a boat to find the Lake Nose Monster. What? Didn't I specifically tell you not to do specifically, exactly just that? Actually, specifically, you said not to humiliate you by doing that. So we won't! Mom! Quick, I caught them red-handed! What is going on out here? All right, so where is it? Where is what? The giant Lake Nose Monster search boat you made! You mean Nosebud? She's right there. You boys made this? I'm very impressed! What? Well, look! They made a boat. It's actually waterproof and everything. That's pretty cool! Ugh! Okay, Candace. If you're so worried Honey! Yes, dear? Can you please go out on the lake with the boys to make sure they don't get into any trouble? Well If I must. Well, who knows? I might even be persuaded to tell you a few of my world-famous fishing stories. Well, I guess that's kind of a punishment. But come on, Mom, that's all you're gonna do? Right, what was I thinking? Here! Don't forget to use plenty of sunblock. Butâ Look! Zinc. Sweetie, aren't you gonna be late for your first lifeguard shift? All right, give me some zinc. Okay, be cool and confident. Cool and confident. Hey, Jeremy! So, what do you think? You look great! So, you're the famous Candace Flynn? Bob Webber. Thanks for the lifeguard job, Mr. Webber. ""Mr. Webber""? Pshaw! Mr. Webber's my father. Call me ""Captain Webber"". Uh Okay. Okay! You two take care of my beach now. Okay. Okay! And watch out for Nosey! Uh Uh Okay. Okay. Okay! okay! and so he said, ""Try ignoring it and hope it goes away."" And you know what? It did. After 17 weeks. Wow, Dad. Great story. Uh, we're gonna start our search for Nosey now, okay? Okay! Oh, did I ever tell you boys about the time I caught the infamous Big Mouth Ramon? Yes! Splendid! Then I'll set the scene. A chilly April morning, 1980. Disco was on the way out and it had just begun to dawn on everybody they looked absolutely ridiculous in every photo taken of them in Okay, Ferb. Okay! Let's find us a lake monster. She's in the drink. Do we have eyes? If anything's gonna get proof of Nosey, it's Marco Schnozolo. Don't worry, Candace. To be honest, not much happens around here. Aw, too bad. I guess we'll just be forced to kick back and have fun. Yeah! We could take turns saving each other. Ah, yeah. (Song: Save You Save Me)  I'll save you!   (I'll save you!)   You'll save me!   (You'll save me!)   We'll save everyone!   You're gonna need   Mouth-to-mouth   T-L-C   P-R-E   M-T-Venus   and Mars  Candace? Candace! Huh? Oh, sorry. As I was saying, being a lifeguard takes focus and concentration. Focus. Right. If you just keep a calm, cool head, you'll be fine. The Lake Nose Monster! Everybody, out of the water! HELP! RUN! Huh? Whaâ? What? Everyone, please. Calm down! Go, ma'am! Leave your child! There's no time! Save yourself! Hey, Candace! Everybody, calm down! We're safe, look! It-It's just some driftwood. Driftwood? Sorry, everyone. It's safe. You can come back, okay? That was not okay. Hmm? Perry the Platypus? Thank goodness. Iâ I thought you were the guy with my hot wings. In two more minutes, my order will be free! Yes! Oh, for crying out loud! Fine. All right, what was that? Fifteen bucks? Okay, here's ten, eleven, andâ I got more on here. Hold on. One, two, three, four, there! Fifteen! And don't forget your tip! Pretty good, huh? So, Perry the Platypus I bet you're wondering why I'm sitting down here at the bottom of a lake. Well, the answer is simple. Mmm- mmm! This is really good, man. You want some? Here. Here, take the blue cheese. Do you mind, Iâ I prefer the ranch. Take the blue cheese. Here's a napkin. Anyway, the answer to why I'm here is simple. Zinc. Lake Nose has a ton of zinc in it, and this machine goes around and filters all the zinc from the water. See, see? Zinc! So I figured I'd go around collecting all the zinc, and then use that zinc in some evil way to rule the world! You know, with zinc. Just think of the evil uses that off with zinc! I-I mean, seriously, can you think of some? Cause I got nothing. I mean, look at here with all the good uses for zinc. Huh? All this good stuff, and over here? Nothing. All I got is, ""Some evil ""Zinc Ray-Inator"" or something, and-and and look here! I-I wrote ""Big laundry"". I-I don't even remember what the reason was, so I just assumed I remembered like it was some big genius idea. Big laundry. Big laundry! I-Iâ It's crazy! I'm a crazy person. Okay! Candace, since it's your first day and you are understandably eager to impress old Captain Webber, I'll give you another chance. Thank you, Captain Webber. Don't worry. From now on, I'll be okay. Okay! Well, at least the beach is empty now. It makes our lives a lot easier. Hey, is this where they saw Nosey? Come on! Did you bring the camcorder? Where's Nosey? It's here! So many people! Don't worry, Candace. Just stick with me and I'll get you through this, okay? Okay! Jeremy, we're gonna have to move you down to Station 7 to cover this crowd, okay? Uh Okay. Okay! Candace, you stay here. What?! Wait! By myself?! Butâ Let's be unsafe! I'm gonna run with scissors! I brought some glass to the beach! Here, Nosey, Nosey, Nosey. Hey, look, Ferb. It's a red herring! I say we follow it and see where it leads us. What was that? Check the perimeter cameras! Without the cameras down here, we'reâ blind. Emergency power on. So much for getting proof. What was that? Did we find the Lake Nose Monster? No. It found us. Okay, Ferb. Fire it up! Cool! That's weird. All the cameras are still down. It's gonna be much harder to get proof that Nosey exists now. You man the starboard window, I'll go portside. We'll see who spots Nosey first. I win! Stay calm. No sudden movements. Okay. Try panicking and making a lot of sudden movements. I don't think Nosey was attacking us at all. He was just going after the cameras. He must not want the world to know he really exists. It was either back up the fire escape or lose the pants altogether. Then suddenly it hit me. Ow! Hey, watch it, brats! No! You're supposed to bury everything except the head! Hey, no! We do not drink the lake water! That goes for your children, too, sir! Excuse me. My daddy came to see Nosey, but I'm scared. Is he really coming back? Aw, I don't know, sweetie. I was being silly before and overreacted. Sometimes we see things that aren't really there, but don't worry. I promise I'll protect you, if I see the Lake Nose Monster! Quick, kid! Run as fast as your little legs can carry you! Follow the train tracks north! You should hit Ackerton by sundown! Blend in! It's a college town! Get a retail job and save up enough for a bus ticket to the Canadian border! Someone will get in touch with you when the coast is clear! Candace! Is this your Lake Nose Monster? Huh? Surprise? You're in big trouble, young man! Okay! Just a little prankster! We're safe! I thought you said this would be funny. It is! You got in trouble! Candace, what on earth are you doing? I'm sorry, Captain Webber. I thought I sawâ I know. Look, I'll let you in on a secret. There is no Lake Nose Monster. It's just a little tall tale, like Bigfoot or that face on Mars. See, they pretend that Nosey is real, so tourists from all over the world come here and buy Nosey T-shirts and snowglobes, but Ow! it's just pretend. Okay. Okay! So that's it. No matter what you see, I never again want to hear you sayâ The Lake Nose Monster! Run for your lives! Hurry! Hey, do you still have that little digital camera you got for Bastille Day? Bup-bup-bup! Check this out. See, boy? Your secret's safe with us. Hey! Where'd he go? Is it me, or is the Lake Nose Monster easier to find than Perry? Mmmm Ooh, wow! Time out, man, I need a breather. Oh! I wish I didn't eat the hot and spicy right after the honey glazed. Speaking of wishes, you know what I never understood? Genies. They tell you to wish for anything you want and then they add some terrible twist. Likeâ You-you wish to jump high, so he turns you into a frog. Whatâ? Why? Who gains from this? The genie? I-Iâ Where's the benefit? You should be fighting genies, man, not me. I'm not the problem. Genies. Genies are the problem. I got it! Zinc foil! Eh, not really evil, is it? Here. You want some corn dogs, boy? He likes it! (Song: My Wettest Friend)  I know a special someone   Who lives under the sea   He's my wettest friend!   (He's my wettest friend)   My wettest friend   He's not the shortest   He's not the orange-est   He's not the one who smells   Most like masking tape   Now, I will always love him   I hope it never slips away   Cause he's my wettest friend   (He's my wettest friend)   My wettest friend   (He's so sopping, yeah)   'Cause he's my wettest friend   (Don't let him plug anything in!)   My wettest friend  Hey! Someone's calling! Y'ello? Phineas, is your refrigerator running? Uh We don't have a refrigerator, Baljeet. Then you better go catch it? I thought you said that would be funny. It was! You look stupid! It works on so many levels. Oh, hey, Nosey. This is just our videophone. See, when we talk to people, we can see them on this screen. And this is what they see. What's wrong? Oh, wait, no! We weren't taking your picture! Come back. I can't believe he fired me. And this time I actually saw it! Candace, are you okay? Okay, I know it sounds crazy, Jeremy, but I saw it! I really did! I mean, not the times when I saw it and it wasn't it, but this last time, when I saw it and it was it! You believe me, don't you? Well Hmm It's okay. Earlier this morning, I wouldn't have believed me either. In fact, I was even mocking my brothers! That's it! They'll vindicate me! They're out there right now getting proof that Nosey is real! I can't believe it! We were probably the first people Nosey ever trusted and look what happened. Come on, Ferb! Let's suit up! Well, it looks like we got all of the zinc from this area. It's time to move on to the next quadrant! ""Quadrant."" ""Quad-rant."" Quadâ It-It'sâ It's a weird word when you think about it. ""Quadrant."" ""Quad-rant."" Quadâ See? See? Now it doesn't even sound like a word. Hey, look! It's Nosey! He doesn't look too good. What's the matter, boy? Oh, no. The zinc levels in the lake seem to be dropping. Nosey needs zinc in order to survive. Sunblock? With zinc! Good thinkin', Ferb! Here, Nosey. This'll make you feel better. Where do you suppose he's going? What's that? Hey, wait! W-What was that? Huh? You were trying to escape?! After I shared my wings with you! Well, granted, I did trap you like a monkeyâ Thanks, Nosey! We understand now. If we prove to the world that you really exist, they'd never just let you live here in peace, huh? It's too bad you don't exist, Nosey, 'cause if you did, I think we'd become great friends. I said, ""John, it's great, I love the tune but the words. 'All you need is a Phillips head screwdriver', it just doesn't really ring true, does it?"" I've got you now, Perry the Platypâ Oho! There was simply no way we could get through the entire petting zooâ Any day now. Hey, where are you going?! Oh Oh, I see. That'sâ That's the hot wings working there. Hey, how did youâ?! Oh, you got out through theâ Iâ I see.  Agent P!  So, anyway, there I was, four hours from the nearest dental supply store Oh, there you are, Perry! Oh, there you are, Perry! Mmm Delicious. Best hot wings in town. Okay! I think I'll go for a little swim. That whole ""waiting twenty minutes after you eat"" thing is all a big hoax. It's just so we can sell these cool ""Kid with a cramp"" snowglobes. Hm. That boat's moving pretty fast. I'd better get out of the waâ Oh! Cramp! Can't move! Nosebud. and that is how I caught Big Mouth Ramone. Cool story, Dad. How you feeling, Captain Webber? Okay! Thanks to you, Candace. How would you like to be reinstated as a Lake Nose lifeguard? Well Okay! Don't get it. Oh, hey, Candace! Did you get it? Did you get the proof that Nosey really exists? I can honestly tell you that a ferocious, man-eating lake monster does not exist in Lake Nose. Aw, man! Wait. So does a non-ferocious, friendly lake monster exist? Do you have proof of that? Hmm? Do we have proof? No. Well, if such a creature did exist, I believe its habitat and safety would be all of our responsibility to look after and protect. Hey, wait a minute. Everyone, that British kid is saying something really, really boring. Yeah, let's get out of here! I didn't think it was boring, Ferb. You know what I think? I think you two found Nosey, but you didn't bring back any proof, specifically just to make me look foolish, in front of all of theseâ Wait a minute. Look at this! Only one thing could've made a bite mark this big! Yes! I have proof! Now they'll have to believe me Or maybe you were specifically trying to protect Nosey. Oh. I'm gonna have to do the right thing here, aren't I? We're proud of you, sis. Yeah, yeah. Candace is crazy, but the monster is safe. Oh, great. Look who finally showed up! Fine. Well, looks like I'm stuck down here. Guess I'll have time to figure out what ""big laundry"" meaâ Oh. Oh, that's right. It's Tuesday. I know! I can get out the same way Perry the Platypus did! Oh! Oh! Oh, that didn't work at all! Oh, now I really gotta do the laundry!"
"What to do, what to do, what to do today. Any ideas, Ferb? How about you, Perry? Bursting with any plans? Ah. I'll never get tired of you doing that. Awesome. Come on, Ferb. Fire one off. I wonder what that means. Hey, Ferb! I know what we're gonna do today! Let's build a Perry translator. We can finally figure out whatâ means. Some say he's just a mindless platypus, but he might actually be thinking some profound thoughts. Just like another quiet animal I know. Stacy, it's been four days. I'm not expecting Prince Charming to bring me a glass slipper or anything, but-but a phone call would be nice. Hold on, I've got another call. It's him! Call you back! Bye! Hello? Hey, Candace. It's Jeremy. Well, good morrow to you, sir. Huh? I mean, what's up? I just got the new Destruction Mayhem 3 game. I thought maybe you'd like to come over and try it out. Oh, yeah. You, me, and little Suzy playing a video game, huh? Suzy? No. She's at her friend's house. Oh. Hold on, Candace. Someone's at the door. So, video games? All set over here! Okay. Now all we need is our subject. Where's Perry? Ah, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the lights. We're using an alternative energy source, and haven't quite got it working smoothly yet. I decided it was high time our operation went green. All right, assignment, assignment. Oh, let's see We're saving paper by printing on the same one over and over again, so Uh, sorry for the life on me. I can't make this out. Hmm. Well, I'm sure it says something about Doofenshmirtz. Go get him! For crying out loud, Carl. Pedal faster. I gotta check my e-mail. Perry! Oh, there you are. Come on, boy. Here, just take a seat. Stay. All set. Okay, Perry. It's time to hear what's on your mind. Hit me with yourâ shot. Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? Oh. Ferb and I invented a Perry translator so we can finally figure out what he's saying. That's great. But don't you need Perry to be here for it to work? That was weird. Perry was here a second ago. I sure love worms. Don't look at me. Big, fat, juicy worms! Gotta find 'em, gotta eat 'em! Whoa. Hello, birdie. Do you understand me? Aren't you a little young for inter-speciel communication? Yes. Yes, I am. How about you, squirrel? Do you understand me? Oh, I do. Do you have any nuts for me? That's so cute. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm cute. I'm cute. Now, nut me. Wow. This works on all animals. Hey, do you think it would work on my dog, Pinky? He barks at the door when a doorbell rings on TV. I'd love to explain the whole concept to him. Couldn't hurt to try. Great! I'll be right back. Wow! With a device like this, all animals can finally say what's on their minds. I'm really glad you wanted to come over, Candace. Most girls really aren't into stuff like this. Pssh. Most girls. I guess I'm just cool like that. Yup, love me my video games. Who's this? Yeah, that's Suzy's dog. Who's the good girl? Who's the good girl? Yeah. Yeah. Who's the good girl? Who's the good girl? Obviously, not me.  Doofenshmirtz out in the forest!  Perry the Platypus? Don'tâ Don't be shy, it's just me. Come here. You like my new cage? I got it from a second-hand shark supply store. It was half off, because you know, something bit half of it off. So, here's my evil plan. With this remote, I will open the Danville dam, flooding all the streets and creating beautiful waterways! Like the canals in Venice, Italy! Or to a lesser extent, Venice, California. But, how will people get around? They will have to buy my latest invention! It's like a car, but it can drive on the surface of water. Behold! You like it? I call it the Buoyancy Operated Aquatic Transport, or BO-AT for short. Everyone will want one. Yeah, I see what you're saying, but you don't really have an argument. They're giving you 12 cans a day. Technically, you're not underfed. All right, next! Oh, yeah. I've been getting a lot of complaints about the vacuum. Just let it out. Hey, look at this. I'm getting the hang of it. No, actually Candace, you just paused it. And now you've reset the game. Oh, no. These were brand new. Hey, bad dog! That's weird. Suzy trained her so well. I see. Suzy trained her. I can't believe this. Hey, that's my shoe! Uh Okay in there, Candace? Yeah, yeah. Don't even think about it! Where's my shoe? No, no, no! Hey, Candace. You ready for the third level? Candace? Phineas? What's up? Okay. We've got 78 complaints about food quantity, and we're still trying to explain TV to Pinky. Again, forget the idea of little people in there. So, what exactly are we supposed to do with this information? Hmm. Okay. The Jones' hamster says it's gonna lose it if someone doesn't oil the wheel in its cage. Well, what now? That's what we'll do. Let's tell all the owners what their pets want! Starting with this little fella right here. Sorry. Lady. Lady right here. Hey, Candace! What is going on here? We made an animal translator! We'll tell you about it later. Right now we're on a mission. Come on, guys. See ya, Candace! An animal translator? I have had it up to here with stupid animals today! Why would you wanna know what stupid animals are saying? Oh, I can tell you what they'll say. ""I'm an animal and I bite my own heinie!"" ""I've got a small cranial capacity!"" ""Look at me! I don't have opposable thumbs!"" ""I eat with my face!"" ""I sweat through my tongue!"" ""I'm a furry-flea bitten loser! Like any other animal on this planet!"" planet! planet! Get her! (Song: Perfect Day)  It's a perfect day  Get away from me!  It's in the mid '70s   Humidity at sixty percent   It's a perfect day   Not a cloud in the sky and I   Can say without fear and dissent   It's a picture postcard perfect kind of   A summer afternoon   It's a perfect day   (Ahh-ahh-ahh)   It's a perfect day   Yeah   It's a perfect day   The birds are singing   The bees are pollinating the flowers   It's a perfect day   The fauna is fawning   And frolicking away all the hours   It's a picture postcard perfect kind of   A summer afternoon   It's a perfect day   (Ahh-ahh-ahh)   It's a perfect day   It's a perfect day   It's a perfect day  Oof! Now, Perry the Platypus, with a push of this button, we will move out of the automobile age, and usher in the age of the BO-AT! I'm driving on water! Look at me! I'm BO-AT-ing! Woo-hoo! Living the dream! Perry the Platypus? How didâ I always forget you are a semi-aquatic mammal. Mom! Mom! Animals hate me! Oh, honey. That's just ridiculous. Perry likes you. Huh. Never mind. Ah! No! Don't open the Metropolitan Oval Aquatic Trench! No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, hey, look! It spells ""MOAT"". I never noticed that before. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Mom! You're here! Come on, come on! You gotta see this! Candace, will youâ Oh! Aha! I can't believe it. Everything is still here. There it is! They built an animal translator! Oh, that's adorable. Wait. No, it is not! Hey, Mom. We built an animal translator. Look! See? You're gonna see. It really works! Okay, Perry. We've been waiting all day for this. Oh, well. I guess it doesn't mean anything. Aw. You know he's saying, ""You guys are the best!"" Now, come on everyone. Inside for some lemonade. Bu-bu-bu-bu-bu- but-but Hey, Candace. Jeremy? Hey, where'd you go? Well, Iâ I brought you your shoe. Oh. Oh, don't worry. I washed it. Here. Allow me. Uh, Candace? You okay? Enchanted."
"Ah, yes. The Daily Crossword puzzle. Today's theme: Tip of the Day. The metal tip of an umbrella. Let's see Honey? The ferrule. Yes, of course. Uh The tip of the elbow. Honey? The olecranon. I thought so. Yes, easy-peasy, that one. Next, the tip of the shoelace. Yes, yes, that little hard tip at the end of the shoelace is Honey? I don't know. You don't know? Ugh! It's like living with a bunch of monkeys! Just look it up on the computer! But isn't it weird none of us know its name? No. That why they make smart word box for tell monkey hard brain hurty things. Removing prepositions makes it more condescending. Wow. Twenty people emailed me the same video. I gotta check this out. That is so humiliating. I have to send this to Jeremy, and Jenny, the track team, Chicago Joeâ So, uh, Candace? Smart word box find name shoelace tip? Ugh. Would you wait? I'm dealing with something that actually matters here. Ugh! The internet crashed! I know. Baljeet! This kinda stuff is right up his alley. Useless Shoelace Facts, Volume 8. ""The plastic or metal tip on the end of a shoelace is called an aglet. A-G-L-E-T. It is one of the most useful, yet tragically ignored inventions in all of history"". Gosh, Ferb. That seems like a great injustice, huh. Oh, well. Thanks Baljeet. Okay. A-G-L-E-T. Brilliant! Oh, hi, boys. Aglet, Mom. Aglet you too, Phineas. No. Mom, the shoelace tip, it's an aglet. How interesting! Yeah! Nobody seems to know the word. I wonder why? I'll tell you why! Because it doesn't matter! You can live a long, happy life without knowing the tip of the shoelace is called a Aglet. It doesn't matter! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Oh, look at this, honey. five letters; ""Where's blank?"" Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has crippled the entire worldwide internet by spreading a so-called viral video over the whole planet. Watch carefully, Agent P. What you're about to see may be the masterstroke of an evil genius which distracted us with smaller schemes while secretly moving us into checkmate. I am a superstar! It won't stop flushing! Agent P, this is no laughing matter. We need you to find out what he's up to and stop him. Behind you, rising dramatically from the floor, is a new, high-tech device. It's called a Universal Delete Button. It can delete any file on the internet from every computer on the planet. It won't stop flushing! ""It won't stop flushing!"" Carl, I told you. There's nothing funny about a man in his underwear skating into a toilet. Of course, sir. Now, limericks. Limericks are funny. The reason we've called you all here today is to raise awareness for the aglet. What's an aglet? Ferb, enlighten us. The aglet. Oh, that's what it's called! Our goal is to bring the plight of the aglet to the world's attention. First, we'll use these shoelaces to makeshift Aglet Awareness Ribbons. Never forget the aglet! You are going to waste the whole day promoting aglets? Who is going to care? If you diss aglets one more time, I'll fray your head so bad, it won't fit through your shirt hole! Aglets, yay. Hey, Candace. The more you know about aglets, the better your life's gonna be. No one's life will be made better knowing the whatever-you-call-it! Aglet. Excuse, what did you say? Aglet. It's that little plastic tip at the end of the shoelace. Aglet? Aglet?! Oh, Lewis, I will marry you! Aglet. The promotion is yours! Aglet. My hair's grown back! Hey, w-what's going on? The shoelace tip! It's an aglet! I can hear! Well, it seems to be working. Let's take it to the next level. Oh, oh! And the part when the guy rollerskated into the toilet! Oh, that was sort of the only part, but yeah, I was dying! I mean, everyone in the whole world saw that video. I wish there was a viral video of me singing going around the world. I bet you'd become an instant star. Yeah. An instant star. Yeah. You'd be bigger than aglets. Wait, what? Why do you know that word? Aglets are so in right now. Look. Hey, guys. I, uh just wanted to see you if you'd come with me. To the big aglet concert. Agent P, your halo jump is a go. Go, go, go! Jump, and fall! Keep falling, and keep being a platypus! Visualize it, you're a falling platâ Did you ever had an old box of junk that's just been sitting in the attic forever, and you think, ""I bet I could just get rid of this whole box, and my life would go on completely unaffected by the loss of whatever maybe inside, like, for instance, an old forgotten video tape made in high school"". Look in the box, Perry the Platypus. Always. Look. In. The box. Moooooooooooom! Candace? What's wrong? Phineas and Ferb are increasing public awareness of the shoelace tip thing! Who knew people would get so worked up over aglets? No! Hey, Candace! Aren't you gonna come and sing at the big aglet concert? You may have infected everyone else with shoelace tip madness, but not me! They don't matter! Bummer. It's gonna be broadcasted all over the world. You could become an instant star. Okay, but they still don't matter! Uh TouchÃ©? Oh, this video is ruining my life, Perry the Platypus. Iâ I can't even go outside my own evil lair. Hey, look! It's that idiot from the video! And that's just my kitchen. What's this? A Universal Delete Button? Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Sorry, but deleting the video from every computer in the world isn't good enough. I have to erase it from people's minds too. Behold! The Read My Mind-inator! You see, whatever I think of appears on this screen in front. See? See?

Now, Perry the Platypus, when I press this button, whatever I'm thinking about, whatever is on this screen right here, will be erased from every mind in the Tri-State Area.

This whole thing is a pointless and stupid celebration of the fact that shoelace tip is called you know! What it's! Who cares? Yeah, I wear loafers. What do you mean ""who cares?"" lame-o? That's what this is all about! The name of the shoelace is the Who cares? Yeah! Let's get out of here! Wait! Come back! I'm sorry, Candace.

Because nobody's perfect without using our cosmetics. Oh, I'd be so lost without Flawless Girl giving me some pointers on how to look. Hey, look! It says Flawless Girl founder, Blanca Dishon, will be at this year's Midsummer's Festival, in search of the next Flawless Girl spokesmodel. And maybe I should sign up. Just out of curiosity, when is the Midsummer's Festival? Probably in the middle of summer. Which is about now! Oh, what do you know. Must be the middle of summer. It's the Baljeet Signal! Phineas and Ferb, days ago, you helped me build a portal to Mars. Now, I beg you to help me win the Biggest Watermelon Contest at the festival. Help me, Phineas and Ferb. You're my only hope! Ferb, grab that Junior Chemistry Set you got for Bastille Day. We're going to the festival. Hey, where's Perry? Oh, for crying out loud! Who put a secret entrance at the bottom of the neighbors' koi pond? Okay, look-look-look. To avoid a lawsuit, give the fish hats, and we'll make them agents, and uh Ooh, right! Agent P, your mission. Um You know, Doofenshmirtz! Go!  Perry!  Hey, Baljeet. Where's your watermelon? Here. Look at it! It mocks me, bringing shame to my family. Ferb, time for a little chemistry. Hmm. Could I borrow Ferb sometime? The Flawless Girl booth. Where is it? Hey, you! Girl! Don't you ever look in the mirror and end up feeling bad about yourself? Well For just five dollars, you can feel good about yourself for no time! Oh, I don't need that. I've got Flawless Girl cosmetics to make me feel good. and bada bing bada boom, you've got your miracle growth elixir. What are you guys up to? Hey, Candace! We're gonna help Baljeet win the Biggest Watermelon Contest. What's that, a cantaloupe? Aww! Not for long. It worked! Your miracle growth elixir has turned you into giant nerds! I will call my family and tell them to start putting up the shame curtains. No way! It hasn't taken full effect yet. You'll see. Not through the shame curtains, I won't. Next! You're Blanca Dishon! I'm Candace. I'm here to become your next Flawless Girl. Stand over by that sign, please. Hmm. Aren't you a little short to be the next Flawless Girl? Uh Yes. Yes, you are. But I'm 5 foot 8! Look, it's right in our song. ""At the forefront of every trend. Never less than five-foot-ten."" I thought you were just looking for a rhyme. Nobody is perfect. But you can come close by buying our complete line of Flawless Girl skin care products. Next! So I can never be perfect! No matter what I do, I'll always be two inches too ugly! I need a sudden growth spurt in the next fifteen minutes. Oh, honey, it's not bad. I got it! Thanks, Mom! Uh You're welcome! All this waiting is maddening. Maybe we should put some more growth elixir on it? Actually, it only works once. Putting more on it won't make it grow anymore. But be patient. It's not done yet. Yes. It worked! I feel great! In fact, I feel flawless! It's amazing! Your height is now perfect! You're now in the running to be the next Flawless Girl. So Are there Fireside Boys, too? Run! I am going to need a crane! And a new pair of pants. There you are! So what happened? I'm in! Auditions start in two hours! Hey, is there something different about you? Who knows? Maybe I've grown out of my awkward phase. Looks like you're growing into another one. Oh, no! I have to find a mirror! Oh, thank goodness! I look totally normal. Ooh! Are you okay, Candace? Wait a second. If you look like that, whaâ whaâ whaâ I've turned into Bobblehead Candace! No one will forego the five dollars to see my pathetic oddballs anymore. I gotta find some new talent fast. I'm gonna have to call you back, Nana. Phineas and Ferb! They did this to me, they can undo it! Pssst! Phineas! Yes, strange talking tent? No, it's me, Candace! That's what happened to the growth elixir. Please tell me you have some sort of shrinking antidote! No. But don't worry. We'll get right on it. Someone's coming! Hello, boys. The name's P.P. Otter. I run the Oddball Show. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend in the tent? Oh. That's our sister. Our big sister. Ugh! Okay, sorry. Candace, this is P.P. Yeah, we've met. How would you like to make me rich beyond your wildest dreams? Sorry, I'm kinda going through something at the moment. Well, if ya change your mind, give me a call. Okay, guys, you gotta change me back! The Flawless Girl auditions are in a couple of hours!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  What theâ?! Oh, the festival is so loud I can't even hear my own evil jingle! Okay, guys. Take it from the top. Louder! A-one, two  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorâ  What theâ Oh, what now?! A banjo-playing platypus? Perry the Banjo-Playing Platypus?!?! Uh, take five, guys. Not you, Perry the Platypus, if-if I can just have a word with you. It's a cute little trap, isn't it? I got the idea at my cousin Gertrude's baby shower. Don't judge me, men go to baby showers these days! It was fun. Presents, blindfolded diapering I'm sorry. I-I'm off-topic, aren't I? I-It's this darn Midsummer's Festival! With the laughing and the music and the constant ringing on my bell to use my bathroom! Well, I'm going to put an end to it once and for all! You see, I have created a device that would cover the entire Midsummer's Festival with the worst smell in the history of mankind! Dirty diapers! And, yeah, I got all that from a baby shower. How do you like me now, Perry the Judgapus? Can't you you just make up some kind of reducing cream? Or an amazing shrink ray device? Well, we'll see what we can do, but we're not magicians. I'm a freak! I'll never be a Flawless Girl! There's only one place where a girl like me will fit in! The Oddball Show! It was nice knowing you boys! Tell Mom and Dad I love 'em! From now on, I'll be living amongst the carnies! Excellent! Now all we need is a big promotional stunt! Here's what I got in mind. In a reversal of a familiar theme, you can climb a skyscraper carrying me dressed in this gorilla suit. Um Okay How long have you been wearing that? All day! So, Perry the Platypus, I found a way to distill the smell of dirty diapers into a concentrated liquid form, which I will spread throughout the festival using my Smell-inator! And the next Flawless Girl is Oh, that is the most Flawless Girl I've ever seen! Is all this really necessary? C'mon, kid, you can't back out now! Candace, I've got some great news! I can't hear you! Oh, hold on! I said, ""I've got some great news!"" You are the next Flawless Girl! With your height, girls will never be able to live up to the expectations you'll set! They'll be forced to buy my product forever! Scram! She's my oddball! No! My Flawless Girl! She's a freak! She's freakishly beautiful! Wait a second! I just realized something! You both make money off the people's natural insecurities. You show people oddballs so that they'll feel better about themselves, and you make beauty totally unobtainable so they'll feel worse about themselves! Look at me! I'm 50 feet tall now and it's still out of reach! Well, I've had it! Making beauty the focus of my life has distracted me from the real focus of my life. Busting my brothers. Giant Candace is out, peace! Growth elixir? So this is what she used! Let me see that! It's my growth elixir! No, it's mine! Mine! Mine! Now watch as the smell of dirty diapers pollutes the very molecules that surround this building! I just snap it into place and set the range for, say, Hear that, Perry the Platypus? That is the sound of smell! Nothing can stop me now! Uh-oh. The whole universe? Not good. Mom! Mom! Look what Phineas and Ferb did to me! I'm 50 feet tall! I don't even fit in. the house. I'm back to normal! ""Normal"" being a relative term. Well, doesn't smell any different. I wonder what went wrong. Oh, here's my stinky poo-poo stuff! I thought I put this in the Smell-inator. Nooooo!  Agent P!  Oh, no! That isâ W-What was I thinking? So did you win the giant watermelon contest? I was about to when this happened! So the watermelon shrank? Well, either that or everything else in the universe just got bigger. C'est la vie. Shame curtains are not going to hang themselves."
"There's our new pet Goldie. I wonder if we're as cute to her as she is to us? Yeah. Yeah, we are. What can we do for Goldie since she's already done so much for us? A marine-life aquarium? Great idea, Ferb! Let's build the best ever of one of these and give Goldie that special home she deserves. Does that sound good to you, Perry? So it's unanimous. Hey, where's Candace? Candace? Where are you? What are you doing? Waiting for Jeremy to call. You see, last night, at the movies, he said he was going to call soon. So I calculate that ""soon"" must mean first thing in the morning, since ""soon"" can't refer to a period in excess of or equal to 24 hours, give or take a 59 minute cushion of time, on either side of the event in question. See? I had it all figured out right here on this notepad. I even showed my math! Uh Wait! Maybe I should have carried the one instead of dividing by Jeremy's face. Well, I'm off to my favorite author's book signing. Try not to freak out on your brothers while I'm gone. Mom! I don't freaâ Oh, my gosh! The square root of ""soon"" is ""never""! I got the filter done. How's the water coming? Herman! Are you taking a shower? No. Well, you need one! There you go, Goldie! Your new home! It's huge, it's amazing, it'sâ it's lonely. We need to get her some friends. Hey, say, aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel? Why, yes. Yes, we are. Oh, alright then. Hey, where's Perry? Oh, Agent P. Uh pardon the newspapers, but, uh We have a lot of new young recruits coming through here today, and, well They're not, uh trained yet. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased the Tri-State Area's entire supply of bratwurst. Get to the bottom of it. Oh, and, uh Watch your step on the way out. Goldie, how do you like your new friends? No! That was cool enough to be in one of those trained marine animal shows. Hmm. Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Yoo-hoo! Perry the Platypus! Say hello to the Platypus Secret Agent Arrival In Order To Foil My Evil Plot Capture-inator! Or as I like to call it, my P.S.A.A.I.O.T.F.M.E.P.C.-inator. I made it up myself. Enough chit-chat! Let me tell you my latest evil scheme. You see, back before I was evil, I was something a little less than evil. I was a bratwurst street vendor.  Doofenshmirtz Quality Bratwurst  What? They have those. See? Nobody remembers them. You know why? Because of the hot dog vendors! Oh, how I hated them! They had it all! They had chrome-plated carts and endorsement deals. Fancy blimps! And what did we have? Only superior workmanship, finer meats, and exotic spices. I was sure that it was just a matter of time before the public would recognize our superior quality. How do you know when you're really lame? When you sell bratwurst! Then and there, I swore I would get my revenge. Behold! the Hot-Dog-Vendor-Revenge-inator! Or my H.D.V.Râ i-inat Iâ I have to work on my acronyms. Here's how it works. The Revenge-inator sets off a freon blast to an unsuspecting hot dog vendor encasing their hot water boilers in a sheet of ice, and rendering their hot dogs cold and soggy. And once I've taken the hot out of the dog, they'll be forced to sell my bratwursts instead! Don't roll your eyes at me! It's a good plan! Sorry to go off on you like that, Perry the Platypus, but sometimes you just, oh, really push my buttons! Oh, I can't take anymore! I'm just gonna call him! (Song: When Will He Call Me?)  Hoo-hoo-hoo hoo hoo-hoo   When will he call me?   When will it ring?   Sometimes I think my sanity is hanging by a shoe string!   When will he call me?   How long is soon?   Should I check my watch, my calendar, or phases of the moon?   And he doesn't have to call me, he can e-mail me or text me,   But all this hanging by the phone has really vexed me   I checked my messages, you know how it affects me   'Cause finding nothing in my inbox really wrecks me   When will he call me?   (Ooh waa aah aah)   When will he call me?   When will he call me?   Should I check my watch, my calendar or phases of the moon?  Hey, what's with all these kids? That's what I thought! Phineas and Ferb! I've so got them this time! I can't send that to Mom! 'Scuse me! Comin' through! One side! Hey! No cuttin' in line! It's my backyard! I outrank you! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Goldie's Aqueous Extravaganza. Uh-oh! Ladies and gentlemen, our sister, Candace! Phineas! That's the spirit, Candace! Everybody! Make this fish put me down! It's a mammal, Candace! Meap. Way to go, Candace! How did I get in this fish show?! Mammal. Whatever! Wow! You're a natural, Candace! Hey-hey, look at that! Ferb, where did the octopus come from? Must. Take. Picture! Send! I've gotta tell you, I read your first book and I love it. Do you have a high-strung teen at home? Uh, you could say that. Ooh, this must be her. She sent you a picture? Let me see. Well Okay. How bad can it be? After all, I've been through with ownâ Oh. I think maybe you need the rest of the set. Uh and why don't you take a whack at that first book again? And now, Perry the Platypus, it is time for revenge! Goodbye, hot dog street venâ Oh, what theâ?! How did you get out of my trap? A decoy? That doesn't even make any sense! But, okay, I surrender, I'm a reasonable man. I know when it's time to fight back! Waa-ha! Woo-ho-ho. Your hot dog is no match for my bratwurst! No, no, no, just kidding! Iâ But I made you look, didn't I? Huh? Huh? Wait a minute, is that Jeremy? What's he doing here? Hey, Candace, did you get my messages? Messages? Eleven messages? He called me! Whoo! Go, Candace! Not so hotsy-totsy now! Are you, Perry the Platypus? Fire. He called me! I can't believe he really called me! What happened to all the fish? Oh-oh, my! Wow! You were great back there! Thanks! Great show, Ferb! I don't remember freezing the tank being part of the finale, but that rocked! Looks like it didn't freeze all the way through. Nice. Eh, so what? Big deal. So it missed it's initial target. A minor setback. No, wait! You'll disrupt the pile's equilibrium! Well, hot diggity doâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus!! I've been trying to call all day. Uh Do you wanna go do something? Oh, my gosh, yes! Really, you didn't even look at your messages? Yeah. I know. That's okay, Candace. You looked like you were pretty busy. Mom! Hi, Mrs. Flynn. Hi, Jeremy. You have to come to the backyard! Phineas and Ferb built a whole aquarium with whales and everything! I'll call ya in a little while. You'll see! Ta-da! Hi, Mom! Look, honey! I brought you a book. Did Jeremy just say he'll call me in a little while? How long is that supposed to be? Well, I guess Goldie and her friends are headed to the ocean. Well, you know what they say. If you love something, set it free. Yeah, we do that every day with Perry. Oh, there you are, Perry, we were just talkin' about you. Are you takin' a shower now? Yes."
"As president of the Healthy Dessert Club, I declare that nothing says low-calorie, non-fat more than gelatin. You wouldn't have started this club because gelatin is Jeremy's favorite dessert, would you? What? Nâ No. Ew! Gross! Phineas and Ferb! Your smelly rodent pet is germing up the cabinets! Where are those two? Right here, Candace. But how? How did you get there? Why are you so fast? Oh, we are just putting the finishing touches on our molecular transporter. Would you like to try? Do I look like someone who wants their moleculars transported? Now get that stinky pet out of our cabinets and go scramble your molecules somewhere else! Oh, there you are, Perry. Bye, Candace! Would you guys like to try some of our gelatin? Okay! No, wait! They'll just end up doing something weird and ruin the party! How is sharing gelatin with them gonna ruin the party? Some how? You want cherry or grape? Grape, please. No, wait. Thanks, guys. Well, I guess that wasn't too weird. It's as fun to eat as the crazy, fun things you can do with it. The cartilaginous fibers from the bovine patella structure, that gelatin's extracted from, gives it that fun, bouncy quality. What did I tell you? Weird. Now, let the professional handle this before it gets out of hand. Why don't you make your own gelatin and leave us alone? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Wait! Bye, Candace. I'm not finished! Stay away from me and my friends and my gelatin that I don't want ruined with your ruiny ruinness. Hm. What? Hey, Isabella. Thanks for letting us use your swimming pool as the largest gelatin mold ever. You bet. Ferb, release the gelatin mix. Ooh, ooh, ooh! May I add some of my favorite flavor? Sure, buddy. Hah-hah! Stirring team, commence mixing operations. Aye, aye! Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P, glad you're here. Professor Poofenplotz has replaced all the fine handbags in the Tri-State areaâ Good grief! Perry the Platypus, what are you doing here? Your lair is across the street. Good day to you, sir. Ah. Agent Pinky. Finally. Ah, there you are, Agent P. Iâ hear you took a wrong tube and ended up over in Wanda's division. Well, Doofenshmirtz has sent you a video message. Take a look. Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. I'm sure you're getting this. Iâ I was hoping you would stop by today for some tea. See, I've got all these little tea things set out and ready and, um And uh, please use the front entrance, Perry the Platypus, becauseâ Uh, because, uh, all the other entrances don't work today. So bye-bye. I'll see you later today! Coming in through the front entrance. So youâ You see, Doofenshmirtz has invited you to tea. We don't know what it could possibly mean. We, thinkâ But don't hold us to this. We think that maybe, just maybe, it could be A trap. We do, however, like to give people the benefit of the doubt, uh So try to have fun. Monogram out.  Doo be doo be doo ba doo be doo be doo ba   Doo be doo be doo ba   Perry!  How's it lookin', Phineas? Looks good. And judging by my chronometer here, it should be just about time. There's only one thing to do now. You mean test the resiliency of our cartilaginous collusion with vigorous application of weight and velocity? Exactly. Let's jump on it. And now for the themed gelatin sculpture part of our get-together. Stacy. I made a pair of shoes. You know, 'cause I like shoes. Nicely done. And how about yours, Jenny? Well, I fashioned this dove to symbolize my desire for world peace and a trueâ Yeah, yeah. Get a load of my entry. It's Jeremy's head. Look! He's dancing. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hey, what's that? Sounds like fun. What? That looks awesome. We should go over there and check it out. Totally. But that's just Phineas and Ferb and their friends. Don't be so uptight. Yeah, come on. Nah, it's okay. Go ahead. Well, if you're sure. That does look kinda fun. Maybe I should totally bust them for this.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  This is nice, huh? You know, I was thinking the other day about how much better you would be as an ally. So I created this. I call it my Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator. Now, you just sit still. Okay, great. You know, after I turn you evil, we can use it to create a whole army of evil minions. Won't that be fun? Hold still. Hey. Stop that! Hey! Now, I'm beginning to think you don't want to be allies at all. I'm trying not to make it personal! Evil! Who added the evil flavor? It's curry. It's not inherently evil. Maybe a little spicy. Okay, I'm going home. What theâ? Wait till Mom sees this! You guys are so busted! Well, I guess we better rescue Candace. But how do we fight a gelatin monster? We'll beat him the same way we created him. With water. (Song: Come On, Kids!) Well, I know what we should do today!  A-come on, kids!   Let's squirt that gelatin monster!   Yeah!   A-come on, kids!   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!   Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh   (Oohoo!)   (Oohoo!)   (Squirt that gelatin monster!)   (Oohoo!)   (Oohoo!)   (Squirt that gelatin monster!)   A-come on, kids!   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!   Yeah!   A-come on, kids!   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!   Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh   (Oohoo!)   (Oohoo!)   (Squirt that gelatin monster!)   (Oohoo!)   (Oohoo!)   (Squirt that gelatin monster!)   A-come on, kids!   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!   Yeah!   A-come on, kids!   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!   Huh-huh, huh-huh-huh   Come on, kids   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!  For Candace, our neighborhood and all the good gelatin left in the world!  kids   Let's a-squirt that gelatin monster!  Okay, okay, I missed you several times, and I probably won't hit you anytime soon. I get that. But I must have hit lots of other things and with a push of this button, those lots of other things will come to my side. And together we will defeat you! Master! It's working. He's melting down the drain. I have got to reexamine my life. Here they come, Perry the Platypus. Here they come! All of my minions! I couldâ Iâ I could've sworn I hit more threatening stuff than this. Really, really pathetic. Master. Master. Aha, a gelatin monster. I knew there was going to be something fun. Get him! Now you can kowtow before my cartilaginous creation. It's so corrupt and cantankerous and, carnivorous and, uh Uh low in calories and caâ Caâ Cowâ Couch. Hm. Ah, that's all I got. My Turn-Everything-Evil-Inator! My monster! No! My beautiful, fruit flavored monster! You come back here, Perry the Platyâ Whoa! Oof! Hmm-mm. This isn't the toothbrush I use to brush my teeth. Oh, there's everyone. Candace, I thought you were having your dessert party today? What are you doing at Isabella's? I got two words for you, Mom. Gel-a-tin. I am sick of it. Sick of it. Totally sick of it. Hey, Candace. I heard you were having a dessert party, so, I made you this, out of gelatin. Aw. Nah, I'm still sick of it."
"So kids, are you enjoying your visit to England? Oh, yes Grandpa. We even learned how to use real thatch. Well, thatch terrific! That was a good one. There's nothing to do. Nothing for us to do. What? Why don't you read my old collection of Sherlock Holmes? I've got the whole collection right here. Gee. Thanks, Mrs. Fletcher. Dinner's at 1900. That's 7 o'clock for you Yanks. Ah, yes, reading. That's what they did before they invented fun. I heard that. Well, it's better than nothing. Hm? Mmm-hmm Hmm Okay, is everybody ready? We're going to take you kids to see the London Eye. What's that? One of our largest Ferris wheels in the entire universe. Cool! Girls, are you ready? Wait, wait, almost finished. Candace, you stayed up all night just to finish that book? No, no. We finished the whole collection. Before they invented fun, indeed. Hey, where's Perry? Oh, there he is. See you later, old boy. Be good now.  Doo be doo be doo ba, doo be doo be doo ba   Doo be doo be doo ba   Perry!  Good morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good here, in the UK. And, uh After your last mission in London, we ran into some trouble with the British Spy Union. So joining you today is Agent Double 0-0. And joining me today is the lovely Inspector Initials. Double 0-0, you and Agent P will be assigned the same mission against Dr. Doofenshmirtz. You realize this man is a platypus? They're American, Double 0-0. Just be glad it's a mammal. Ooh. Rrreow. Well, go get him, Agent P. What? That's it? No files? No location? No contact? What kind of a mission is this? It was enough for the mammal. Ooh. Rrreow. All right, you lot. Have a splendid day in London. We'll be back tonight after the International Haggis Festival. There's 29 individual flavors! Cheerio. Here are your tickets for the London Eye. You might want to get in line now, 'cause it looks pretty crowded. We'll pick you up around 4:15. Bye, kids. Have fun! Bye! Candace, you know what? Ferb and I will meet you back here later. See ya! Bye, guys! Hey, let's go shopping! Did you hear that? Even in England, my brothers have some scheme planned. How can you tell? You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes toâ Ooh! Stacy, that's it! Who did we stay up all night learning about? Who is the total king of busting? Sherlock Holmes? Yes! Maybe I can finally bust the boys once and for all if I use Holmes' method of deduction. Come on! This will be fun! You could be Dr. Watson. That's it. We're taking my car. Now this is a motor car. It has pretty much everything. Radar, subatomic sonar, nuclear particle response system, and an MP3 player. Don't touch that, it's theâ And I suppose you think that's funny. By using Holmesian Deduction, we'll be one step ahead of the boys. We can get Mom and finally show herâ Ooh, shoes. Stacy? I need you to focus! Sorry, sorry. Got a little distracted there. You know, London, cool stores, shopping. There they are! Now why are they going into an auto parts store? All right, Watson. Here's where the deducing begins. They've acquired a fleet of automobiles. And they're in there buying a bunch of little air fresheners for them. Or They're buying motor oil for their giant robot! What do you think, Stace? Stace? What? Perry the Platypus? Oh, who's your little friend here? I'm Agent Double 0-0, from her majesty's secret service. Double 0-0? I-Isn't that just triple ""O""? No, that's not how you say it. It spells ""OOO"", does it? It's just Double 0-0. He's ""P"" and you're ""OO"", so together you spellâ No, they're not ""O""s, they're zeros. Alright? I was just going to say ""Oop"". Looks like I struck a nerve there! Hey! I must apologize, all of my traps are platypus-sized. What about this then? Oh, that. You see, as I get older, I find it's harder and harder to read my small, little wristwatch. So, I will launch Big Ben into space, and fly it all the way to the Tri-State Area. La-la-la, here I am. La-la-la, I just woke up and I want to know what time it isâ Yes! I am a genius! So thatâ That's your whole plan? Well, in a nutshell, yes. What do you think? Am I on one of those hidden camera shows? You realize you could just buy a bigger watch, or maybe a wall clock? Yes, but then I would have to drive to a store, and find a parking space, then you have to choose from, likeâ Dozens of styles, Iâ It just seems like so much work. This will be much less complicated. Okay, Watson. Excuse me, sir. Were these two boys in here earlier? Well, them two bics were 'angin' about an' they got a bit o' the bushies an', uh, also ran back an' carted off some ol' bangers that ah didn' need. Oi! Aren' they a bit harrish for them kind o' bushies? Stacy? I'm working on it. Ah! He said ""they were here, they carted away some junk from out back, and, aren't they a little young to be doing that?"" Yes. Yes, they are. Aha! It's crawling with clues out here! Hmm Look at these circular indentations in the dirt. And the subtle scent of rubber in the air. By Jove, Stacy! What could it be? Uh ""Free tires""? Maybe, maybe We need more clues! Oh! (Song: Elementary)  We've got a mystery to solve   Clues and puzzles to resolve   It's elementary   Separating fact and fiction, gonna get me a conviction   Elementary   Oh, what is truth, and what is lies?   It's elementary   I see it with my private eyes, grab your magnifying glass   'Cause deductive reasoning's a gas   It's elementary   (Elementary, it's elementary, yeah)   It's elementary   (Elementary, it's elementary, yeah)   Oh, yeah, it's elementary   (Elementary, it's elementary, yeah)   Yeah, it's elementary  Stacy, I think I'm close to figuring it out. Well, I'm going up to the top of the tower. I'm sure you two will have a hot time together! Don't worry, Agent P. I'll have us out of these before you know it. There they are. They dropped a notebook. The page is torn, but it says, ""To big race 1600 Water S."" Water Street! The final clue! They're having a big race at 1600 Water Street! Ooh, I gotta call Mom! And that's why you've gotta come down to 1600 Water Street. Huh? I don't get it! I thought I'd figured it out. Hello? Hello? Candace, are you there? Sorry, Mom. Disregard everything I said. Okay, sweetheart. Remember, no snacking. Dinner's at 1900. Oh, okay. See you later. What if 1600 isn't a place, but a time? I didn't get that impression. Impression! Stacy, you're a genius. Wasn't it in one of those Holmes stories that they used pencil lead to reveal an impression on paper? Well, if my hunch is right ""To do today: Big Ben race to Thames at 1600 for water slide fun""! Stacy, 1600 is 4 o'clock which is right now! Let's go! Just a few more minutes. Ow! Oh, there you go. Good thing I had the watch laser. Now Doofenshmirtz took the stairs, but if we work our way up the inner mechanism of the clock, he'll never see us coming. Wow! Candace, you're amazing! You totally figured it out! Yeah, I guess I did. Now, on to the busting. Next! Phineas! Hey, guys! Do you like it? I figured you guys were up to something. The tires, the pipes I see what those were for, but what was with the pineapple? Oh, that was for Ferb. He was hungry. Oh, and the butter too, huh? No, no. He's using that for speed. It's a new world record! Mom's gonna flip when she hears about this! Hello? Someone with a thick Cockney accent. Wrong number. Can I take a turn? Go for it. Last customer of the day. Whoo-hoo! That's what I'm talking about! Ooh! It's 4:15. Mom should be here. Mom! Look! Look up here! I hope the kids had fun today. Well, It's about time! Mom, look! Mom! Mom! Uh Candace? Not now, Stacy! Butâ Mom! Mom! Hey! Hey, look at this! It's like a ride! Woo-hoo! Cannonball! Well, I was expecting a bigger splash Whoa! Mom! Here come the girls! Mom, you gottaâ Oh, look at your cute outfit! Mom, you gotta look atâ Oh, Big Ben! Gorgeous! But-but-but-but-but Ah, here come the boys. Hey, Mom. You missed all the fun. Looks like we did. All right, let's catch a cab and head home. Come on! Looks like Candace and Stacy did some shopping. I'll never understand fashion. Aha! Well, that took longer than I thoâ Wait! Oh, I wish I had a bigger watch."
"""Boys are human beings too. If you're interested in one of them, make him feel comfortable by asking him questions about himself."" Okay. They lost me at the ""boys/human beings"" thing. Candace, this article specifically says not to growl psychotically. It makes boys feel uncomfortable. Look at them down there. Planning something. Oh, I'm gonna bust them today for sure. That's what you say every day. Well, that's because they build something everyday. Seems like every time I get Mom and I'm ready to bust, their stupid invention disappears. Candace, looks to me like you're going about this the wrong way. Don't focus on the boys. Focus on the invention. If you can find out where the stuff goes, maybe you can take your Mom there, and she'd finally see the evidence. Yeah! Stacy, you're a genius! Wow, go figure! Would you call my mom and tell her that? Hey, Phineas! Yo. Um You know how you guys, like, build stuff everyday? Yeah? And you know how you make it disappear at the end of the day? No. Andâ What do you mean ""no""? We don't make it disappear. Well, then where does it go? We don't know what happens to it, but it helps with cleanup. And Ferb here says to never look a gift horse in a mouth. So you're telling me you're not even a slightest bit curious as to where the thing goes? Yeah I guess we're a little bit curious. Hmm Why don't Ferb and I build something and you guys keep your eyes on it? Maybe you can find out where it goes. Sounds like a plan! A plan of busting! All right, boys. Make it big and make it obvious. Now remember. We can't take our eyes off this for even a second. What if I need to blink? Here! Use this! Saline solution. Hey, where's Perry? What do you think, too much? Oh, I'm just getting into the mood. I'm going to Vegas this weekend. Okay. Our sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz is working on an invisibility ray, and that can't be good. Get out there and put a stop to him. And may luck be with you! Lady luck, baby! Hot-cha. Hey, Phineas. Whatcha doin'? We're just building a big and obvious ride in our backyard! Cool! Can I ride it? No one's riding on anything! We're just gonna watch it. Candace wants to see where it goes. Okay Whoa! What is that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's another one of the cool rides. Just get behind us and help us watch it. How's my schedule? Well, right now you're just carrying me like luggage. We're in! Perry the Platypus? You're just in time. Just in time to be trapped! Didn't Major Monogram tell you I was working on an invisible ray? Yeah, well, I made one, and now you're in an invisible cage. And so you don't get bored, I put in an invisible tin cup in there for you to play with. Yes, see? Fun with sound. Behold, Perry the Platypus. My Invisinator! And why would I need an invisibility ray, you ask? Well, you know when those cute, little Fireside Girls come by to sell theirâ Their cupcakes, or theirâ Or their raffle tickets or whatever? And you forgot to close your shades, so they come to the front door, and they could see you! They could see you, right in there watching TV or whatever. And you can't pretend that you're not home because they can see you! And they have those big, pleading eyes making you feel guilty, andâ So, Iâ I'm just gonna shoot them with the ray so I don't have to look at them. Hey! No shut-eye, girly. (Song: Watchin' and Waitin')  We're watchin'   And we're waitin'   On the edge of our seats, anticipatin'   It's looking awful permanent   But we know it could go away   We're keeping our eyes peeled, keeping 'em glued to the spot   'Cause one moment it's there but then the next maybe not   Don't know if it's magic or some weird cosmic plot   So we're watchin' and we're waitin'   We're starin' and we're glarin' 'til our corneas burn   We hope it will stay for the rest of the day 'til our mama returns   So don't even think about blinking or it just might go away   So we're watchin'   And waitin'   So we're watchin'   And waitin'   Yeah, we're watchin'   And waitin'   We're watchin'  You see, Perry the Platypus, the entire Tri-State Areaâ Hey, whatâ What are you doing?

Uh, are you feeling any biting or scratching in there, becauseâ Oh! Oh! Oh! Back away! Ah! Oh, g-get back! Oh! Back, you tiger! Ow! Whereâ Where are you? So I canâ So I can snap my whip at you! Get in there! Get back, get back! In there! I'm gonna chopped at to poor planning. If I had the tiger door inside your cage, you-you would have been inâ Now, Perry the Platypus, you can never be sure where the final strike will come from. I am an imperceptible enigma. I move in silenceâ Ow! Oh, you followed the sound of my voice, maybe I should stop talkâ Ow, ow, ow! Quit it! Hm, interesting! If you're already invisible, it turns you visible agaiâ Ow! Ow! Oh, well that came out of nowhere. So, how long is this gonna take? I mean, it usually disappears as soon as the kids are done playing onâ Oop! Wait a minute, that's it! You guys gotta play on it! Go! Go have fun! Go! Okay. Eh, my schedule's flexible. I used to be. Oh, Buford loves this! That's it, laugh. Laugh while you still can. Look at you! You're just a bottom! Oh, it's on now! Oop! Look at me! I'm just a top! Okay, fun's fun! Now everybody, back in your seats! Now, if we just keep watching it Any minute now I can't believe it! Mom's home!

Do me a favor and just back down the driveway a bit! Um Okay. Any changes? It's back! I can't believed that worked! Okay, Mom! Come back! Come back! It's gone again! Candace, how are you doing that? Back back back back back! There's gotta be some kind of sensor in the driveway! But where is it? It's gotta be here somewhere! It's back! It's gone! It's back! It's gone! Back! Gone! Back! Gone! Candace, you obviously have some issues with the driveway. I'm just gonna park in front. It's back! Wait. She can see it from the front yard! Mom! Just a sec, honey. I'm getting my stuff. Mom, look! No! Hey, Candace! It's still here! It's just invisible! What?! It's still here? Candace, check this out! Hum Paint! Candace, where are you going? I'll be right back! You think you've beaten me, but you haven't. Beause I can turn the Invisinator into a Disintegrator. With just the simple push of a button! Hey, I was using that! Hey, kids! Hi, Mom! I got someâ Coming through! Candace, what are you doing? You'll see! Everyone will see! I don't understand! I don't understand! I just don't understand! Candace, I have no idea what you're up to. But you're more that welcome to join us for cookies when you're done cleaning up. Come on kids! Yeah! Cool! Cool! Cool! Go Mom! Buford loves cookies! Well, we were all watching it, and Quantum Theory states that the mere observation of an experiment changes its outcome. Now you tell me."
"Ferb, what's that noise? Is that your stomach? Yeah, I'm hungry, too. That trendy restaurant Mom and Dad took us to last night wasn't exactly satisfying. Dad, can I borrow your glasses? I can't see my entrÃ©e. You know, because it's so small. Yes, I think we got that. How hard is it to have a trendy restaurant that's fun to go to, and has great food? That's it. I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb. S'up, Stace? Candace, are you sitting down? I don't want you to have an aneurism. Why would I have an aneurism? 'Cause someone just IM'd me, that someone else heard, someone else overhear, that Jeremy is gonna call you and ask you out for a very special evening tonight! Candace, do you need medical attention? Oh. I need attention From the doctor of love! Paging Dr. Jeremy. Doctor, I got a fever. Well, let me take care of that, little lady. Wow, a special evening. It's my call waiting. Honey, just calling to remind youâ Ah, it wasn't him. Don't worry, he'll call. Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Ferb and I decided to build a restaurant. Hey, you could be our hostess! Hmm. What'cha eatin'? You guys can bus tables. Baljeet can be our soda jerk. I make a mean milkshake! Ferb will be our chef. Hey, I can work the velvet rope. I never leave home without my velvet rope. Uh Where do you keep that? I'll never tell. So, what's the name of your restaurant? Chez Platypus, of course! By the way, where's Perry? What? Nothing available for tonight? Oh. Never mind. Oh. Sorry, Agent P. It's date night tonight with the wife, and if I don't figure out something special to do, I'm royally in the doghouse. Rreow! Pkshh! Carl! Anyway, Agent P, sources indicate Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to one of his evil schemes. Iâ need you to get out there and put a stop to it. Good luck.  Beautiful, kind, and gentle  Jeremy's dreamy pre-set ringtone!  Beautifulâ  Hello? Hello? Candace? This is Candace. Candace, it's Jeremy. Jeremy? Candace? Okay, no-no. You talk, you talk. Okay, you go. Okay, so, I was wondering if you wanted to do something tonight? Just the two of us? Yeah. Sure. That'd be great. Well, awesome! Uh So I'll pick you up later? Bye. Okay, bye. Yes! Oh, no. Listen, you twerps. Sometimes your stuff messes with my stuff, and tonight I got some big stuff going on. So you leave your stuff out there, and leave my stuff alone, or you'll get some of this stuff! Get it?! So, are we pairing the chicken entrÃ©e with the soup?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, Perry the Platypus! You must have noticed how I reinforced the locks. But You know, not the door. Well, let's just get you out of theâ You'reâ You're really trapped in here, just Just like I planned. Obviously. So let me tell you my latest scheme. I'm so tired of all these happy couples around me, romantic and laughing, mocking me with their happiness. Well, not anymore. My De-Love-inator satellite will eliminate the feeling of love in the entire Tri-State Area. All I have to do is press this button. It would be so easy to press it right now. It would be so simple, butâ You know, I've got a date tonight, and I like to stay optimistic. But if we don't hit it off, I'm definitely gonna ruin it for everyone else. Hi. Hi. Ready? I'm, like, so looking forward to tonight. A special evening, just the two of us. So, what do you have planned? Horseback riding? I just love horseback riding. Oh, you stopped. Ta-da! Your brothers have opened the trendiest restaurant in town, and this is where I'm taking you. Oh. Uh, really? How fun. Well, i-if you prefer to do something else Well Platypus-themed restaurants are so now, so wow. It will be a miracle if we get in. Cool. Let's definitely eat here. But no way are we waiting in this line. I practically own the place. Come on! Outta my way, people! VIP coming through! All right, Buford. Make with the rope and let us in. Name? It's me. ""Me"" who? I'm Candace. Candace Flynn? You're not on the list. You should have made a reservation yesterday. This restaurant didn't exist yesterday. I demand to be let in right now. Good evening, sir. Oh, I forgot to make a reservation. No problem, dude. Did that guy just bribe you? He didn't bribe me. He just caught my attention in a monetary fashion. Now, back in line. Right this way to your table, sir. Hey, Isabella. Have you seen Perry? No. Not lately. Hmm. So I noticed in your online profile that you say you like tall men. Is-Isâ Is that true? That's right. And you're not very tall at all. Well, I-I'm 6'2. I slouch. My last date was 6 foot 9. Now, that's a good-looking man. But I'll be honest, I've never been able to resist a man in a lab coat. Really? Look. Look, I'm wearing one right now. Hey. There you are, Perry. We've gotta put you in your place of honor. I'm usually extremely attracted to blonds. Oh, I-I see. But there is something about your windblown style that gives me goosebumps. Really? Well, I-I must say, it's quite a bit of work in the morning, you know, butâ Apparently worth it. There you go, Perry. Now everyone can see you. Hey, Ferb. We need a chicken special for table five. Enjoy your meal. Really. You're letting complete strangers in. I'm the owners' sister. I demand to be let in right now! I'm supposed to be having the time of my life! Candace? I really don't mind waiting a bit. It's actually kinda fun just hanging out here with you. Oh, really? All right, next party, step this way. Oh, come on! So, how do you feel about evil? Huh? That's a weird question. Is it? Iâ I'm just making conversation. But I love it. Look. You have an evil tattoo. Look, look, look, just like mine. I can't believe we have so much in common. Y-you know, I don't even put ""evil"" on my profile anymore because it attracts so many weirdos. Don't I know it. That's it. I'm calling Mom and making her tell the boys to let us in. Mom, Phineas and Ferb have made an exclusive restaurant in the yard and you've got to tell them to tell Buford to let us in. Okay. Okay, honey. We're just finishing dinner. We'll be home in a minute. Urgh! Jeremy, hold our place in line. I'm going out front to wait for my Mom. But Candace Perry the Platypus? Oh, looking for my remote, are you? Well, here. Take it. I don't need it anymore. I am in love! Sven, I heard a trendy new badger restaurant just opened up the street. Badger? Cool. Ooh, let's go! Ooh, badger restaurant. Ooh, I love badgers. Platypus-themed restaurants are so four hours ago. Let's bail. Cool. Yeah! I haven't eaten badger in a week. Woo-hoo! Sounds cool! Let's go! Ah The public is fickle. Excuse me, young man. I'd like to buy your restaurant. I envision a chain of platypus-themed restaurants as far as the Tri-State Area can see. Heck. Dinner service is over. You can have it. Mom! Dad! The boys have a restaurant in the yard, and they're not letting me in. You've gotta put a stop to it! Come on! Have fun with the restaurant! Bye! Uh, guys? Ugh, whatever. Excuse me, miss. Do you have a table for two? Right this way, sir. Enjoy. You know, Candace. I've had a lot of fun in your backyard. But this is the best time yet. Oh, look. How adorable! Candace, you want me to put a stop to this? No! No, no, no! Go! Shoo! Keep moving, nothing to see here. Now, where were we?

"Mom, the remote's not working! You know, you could get up and walk five feet and change the channel the old-fashioned way. Oh, be for real, Mom. I'd rather watch the stupid nature show. I'll get batteries while I'm out. This week on Walking with Nature, one of the world's slowest creatures, Chelonia mydas, the sea turtle. Five feet, huh? Nah, it's still not worth it. Well, Ferb, time to make the sunniest day ever! I guess it's already as sunny as it's gonna get. Wow, it's not even lunchtime and we're already done with today's project. Think about it, Ferb. That means we have the whole rest of the day to do another project. It's like having two days in one! Can't ask for better than that. Hey, Perry. Do you have any cool ideas for projects? That's an egg. Perry laid an egg! You know what this means, don't you? We're gonna have two Perrys! Congratulations, old boy! You're gonna be aâ Hey, where's Perry? How did you like our new pneumatic transporter? I used it myself this morning. What? Oh, who am I kidding? The new pneumatic transporter sucks. I mean, literally, sucked every piece of hair off my body. Anyhoo, Doofenshmitz has brought up the Tri-State's entire supply of krill. Krill? Krill is a small shrimp-like creature that plays an important role in the diet of the humpback whale. Krill. You know, Ferb, Perry's egg is getting kind of cold. No, I don't think that's gonna cut it. This calls for desperate measures. We need the ultimate, best-ever egg hatcher. Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today. Five feet for popcorn, fine! Five feet to change a channel? I don't think so! This turtle is seeing the world for the first time. Hey, this little fella is kind of cute. Here's one that's found himself in the unforgiving position of being stuck on his back. Watch as he instinctively turns to his stomach. Whoa! Cool! But the sea turtles' struggles are just beginning. Without the protection of their mother, they face many predators. As you can see, they make easy prey even though the safety of the ocean is a mere five feet away. All right, Ferb. Let's get our nurture on! Easy does it! There! Activating temperature control. Initiating platypus lullaby loop cycle. Nothing says ""mother's love"" like a giant, robotic platypus butt. Unbeknownst to the delicate infant turtle, it's caught the eye of a sea hawk, and he's looking for a meal. Sadly, the sea hawk wins this battle. Unlike humans, sea turtles don't have a mother to protect them through these crucial moments of infancy. What's that? Hey, Candace. Perry laid an egg! It's okay, little guy. Candace is here to protect you! What are you doing to this precious gift of life? After Perry left his egg unattended, we decided it would be best if we watched over it for him. Given the rudimentary needs of the average egg, we calculated the heat transfer due to elemental exposure, plus the positive developing life responses to familiar and expected sound, and factored in the obvious visual surroundings. The result was the Platydroid. But since we were pressed for time, we only built the Platy-posterior. That's so wrong in so many ways, I don't even know where to start! An egg is like a little baby. It needs a living, breathing mother. It needs Hold on one second. Okay, let's do this thing for real!  Doofenshmirtz holding a bucket!  Ah, Perry the Platypus! You're just in time for my backstory. You see, it all started a lifetime ago. I was young and in love with a beautiful girl. She taught me how to see the beauty of life, and I taught her how to hold a petty grudge. She was very interested in whales, for some reason. In retrospect, it was probably more of an unhealthy obsession. But to win her heart, I created the Whale Translator-inator! I rented the best oceanographic vessel that I could afford, and we headed out. But when I turned the Translator-inator on What a loser that guy up there is! She should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me. She left me for that trash-talking 35-ton pile of blubber. And broke my fragile, 10-ounce utterly-too-human heart. Unfortunately, my Translator-inator only worked in one direction. So I was not able to tell the whales what I thought of them. Until today. Watch this. See, I taught myself whale song. I just told him he's fat, and he has barnacle breath. Come on. Come on, who's diabolical? Okay, first things first. Dismantle that thingamajig ofâ Of weirdness. Sometimes, I swear, I'm the only normal one in this family. Like I said. Weirdness. Now, let's get serious. See what I'm wearing here? Serious. This egg's not gonna hatch itself. We need to build a nursery. We have this cool blueprint for an incubator! Too antiseptic. Think warm and loving, not cold and clinical! Hugs and kisses, not hard and mechanical! (Song: Technology vs. Nature)  Motherhood's for life   It's not something in which you dabble   For machine's not built to last   Their love is only techno-babble   Mother knows what's necessary   'Cause she always pays attention   That's why they say necessity's the mother of invention   Now I got you on the run   Technology, zero   Mother Nature, one!   When a child cries out in the night   It's rarely for the washing machine   Science can't improve upon a mother's heart   But given time, it could trick out a spleen!   So if you think that you could build a better mother, let it go   'Cause nature already nailed it 60 million years ago   You see, before we'd even begun   Game over! Technology lost, Mother Nature won!   Game over! Technology lost, Mother Nature won!  So how does it feel to have your Platy-posterior handed to you on a plate, son? I justâ I just told him his macaroni and cheese recipe is too cheesy and not macaroni-y enough! Wait, wait, Perry the Platypus. Where are youâ Where are you going? Wait! Wait! My evil plan isn't evil enough for you to foil? Is that it? Really? I've just insulted the macaroni and cheese recipe of a whale! What part of that is not evil? Perry the Platypus, you get back here and thwart me this instant! There. That just about does it. Candace! I'll say when it just about does it. Mmm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. And how's my wugga wuggums? So cute! Hmm. Not bad for a couple of boys. You're pretty good at this, Candace. You bet I am. This is what real mothering looks like! Stymie me! Foil me! Hey-hey, what about the fact that I held a petty grudge against an inferior mammal all these years, huh? Thwart me, Perry the Platypus. Aw, come on! I hope it's a girl! Come to Mommy, snooka wookums! Huh? It was just a bird? That's not just any bird. That's a rare whale song-singing double-breasted angle hooper the natural enemy of the platypus in the wild. Okay, okay. I have something really evil. Really, really. It-It'sâ It's actually evil. Just kidding. Ow! Ow! Candace, I have your batteries. Candace? What are you wearing? It's my mom suit. All right. I'll try not to take that as an insult. What is the rest of this? Candace has us build this to show us what motherhood is like. Okay Candace, you made them build all this? No! That's not fair! You know, Candace, you're gonna have to clean all this up. Mom suit. I swear. I'm not even gonna ask. How do you only manage to see this one? Why only mine? Wait! Come back! Oh, this is so unfair! Wait! Hey, Candace. I was just stopping by to invite you Hmm. Well, nice mom suit. See? He gets it. Heinz? Elizabeth? Best decision I ever made."
"See? Isn't this the coolest game ever? It's called Jump and Duck. Hey, how'd you get your face in there? Easy. I just use this camera. See? Cool. And then you do this, and this, and this and this and this and this and this, and this, and this, and this, and this and this, and then this and this, and then that. Look! This is awesome. Stacy, you are talking to the luckiest girl in this house. Jeremy is taking me to the summer cotillion! Cotillion. It's like a dance. Yes, it's a real word. All I know is it's gonna be great. Wait a minute. I just thought of something. Two somethings actually. And one of them is pointy. Stacy, I'll call you back. It's time for a little preemptive bust. So, beyond jumping and ducking, what's the actual objective of this game? It's called Jump and Duck. Duh. I can see no educational value in this game. Duck! Consider yourself educated. I stand corrected. Far be it for me to cast dispersions on jumping, and or ducking, but I think you can improve this. With a little effort we couldâ Okay. What are you guys up to? Playing a video game. That's it? That's all you're doing today? Huh. How normal. I guess my night's safe after all. Who would have guessed you two would get sucked into a video game? I'm going to go get ready. ""Sucked into a video game"". Brilliant! Ferb! I know what we're going to do today. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning Agent P. I've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's internet activity. First, we know what you're getting for Christmas. Don't ask, our lips are sealed It's a vase. Second, he's been doing a lot of research into the molecular structure of taffeta, satin, and most ominous of all Velour. Ugh!  Perry!  Introducing the all new and improved, Jump and Duck. The world's first truly immersive video game experience. Hey, Ferb! Throw the switch. Hey! And once your zapped into the video game by the digitizerâ Okay, what's going on? I was drying my hair. Sorry about the power, Candace. Ferb went to check the circuit breaker. Jeremy is going to get here any minute. Hey! Where'd you guys go? We didn't go anywhere. But you're inside the video game. What do you mean I'm in the Wow, cool. How come she got to go first?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus, you are too late. Wait-wait, i-is it eleven o'clock yet? Wait. Now! Now you are too late. So Perry the Platypus, tremble in fear before the most twisted, nightmarish creation the world has ever known! The ball gown-inator. You see? It's hard to fight when you're in a ball gown. It's portable too. Ooh, you look so elegant, like you're going to a cotillion. It's a word. It means dance. So, why would I create such a device as this? Hm? Hm? You see, back in Gimmelshtump in the depths of my childhood, my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. U-Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, andâ Because we were out of material, I, was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year, drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates. Now with my ball gown-inator, I will be the manliest man in the Tri-State Area! You know, by comparison. Because everyone else will be wearing dresses. A-After I shoot them with my ball gown-inator. Amâ Am I over explaining this? Because I have this whole musical number prepared, andâ Oh. Oh, you're good? Okay. Take five girls. You guys better get me out of here. I still have to get ready. Well, we designed a whole bunch of different worlds you have to go through to get to the boss, but You know, justâ Just continue screen right. Can't you just press a button and get me there now? Oh, you want cheat codes. No, we don't roll like that. Just jump and duck. Okay not necessarily in that order. Just choose the appropriate action that corresponds to the highly approaching fruit. What does that even mean? Duck! Now run! Duck! Okay, you can try to jump here. Duck! Duck! Duck! Duck! Duck! Duck! Okay, stop falling. Stop falling. Sheesh. Maybe we should go and help her. Don't worry, Candace! We're coming! Hmm. Maybe they should call it Jump, Duck, and Blow. Whoa. What happened here? Oh, that's right. Candace has her hair dryer. We'll just follow the carnage.

Yeah, it looked way outside, but then it was right in the zone. There's a lesson, baseball fans. Never judge a book by its cover. Boring, dull, stupid, lame, heavy-handed and derivative. Oh, thank you for those insightful reviews of books you haven't read. Mom, that's why books have covers. To judge them. I mean, why did you choose these books from the library? They looked interesting. So? Point taken. Okay honey, I'm off to help Dad at the antique store. Oh, hey, here's a package for you. My Bango-Ru! Your what? My Bango-Ru. They're these adorable Japanese characters that are so in right now. Like in a kitschy way. The lead guitarist for The Bettys has one painted on her guitar. Stacy and I designed our own dolls online. Well, assuming none of that is teenage code for something I should be worried about as a parent, I'm off. Bye Mom. I got to call Stacy! Bango-Ru! Bango-Ru! I just got my little bunny-bear! It's a cross between a bunny and a bear! You get it? It's the most precious thing. I just got mine too. He's a cross between a cow and a frog. I'm calling him ""SeÃ±or Frowg"". He's gonna be the cutest thing, you're just going toâ Candace? What's going on? I just discovered why cows and frogs don't date. Well, we'll still have fun at the Bango-Ru convention today. Yeah, I guess. Okay, Ferb. Let's see what this bad boy can do. Go long! Pop fly! Cool! Oh, here it comes! Um Hey, Ferb. I know what we're going to do today. Run for our lives! Whoa. I think we may have just stopped and/or started an alien invasion. I hope he's not too angry. Or hungry. Meap! Wow. That is cute. Hey, are you okay? We're really sorry about your ship. Meap! What's your name? Meap! Hi, Meap! I'm Phineas and this is Ferb. Meap! What'cha got there? Hey, this must be his father. Don't worry, Meap. We'll fix your ship, and you'll be with your dad in no time. Hey Ferb, I know what we're going to do today. Let's get ourselves totally busted by crashing our stupid toy in the backyard. Oh, hi, Candace. It isn't a toy. It's a real live alien spaceship! Oh, good! Because this isn't a cell phone. It's an inter-galactic little brother buster-izer. Which I'll use on you if you don't clean up this mess. What's with the spaceship anyway? Haven't you guys, you know, been there, done that? We weren't planning on going into space. But if we did, I'm sure there's still a ton of cool stuff left to do. Yeah, well I'm all done with outer space. Never again! I'll stick with Earth, where I'm the one in charge of busting people who do stuff they're not supposed to do. Huh? Oh, that is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my life! You guys made a Bango-Ru doll? That's Meap. Meap! He talks? Well, more than Ferb, but ""meap"" is pretty much the only thing he says. Well you and your little Bango-robot better not show up at the convention and make me look bad. That's strike one. Okay. Let's fix us an alien spaceship. Meap! Where do you want to start? Hey Ferb, have you seen Perry? Meap! Meap! Meap! Good morning, Agent P. I wonder what exciting mission we have for you today. Excuse me, my nose is really itchy. Doofenshmirtz has purchased a lot of carpet. He must be up to something bad. Because he's a bad, bad man. He's this bad. I can't do this. Carl was doing my arms. See? Oh, too funny. Anyway, stop Doofenshmirtz with the carpet thing. It seems to run on a quantum front loading system. Can the new frame support that? Hang on, I'll bring you down. Hi, guys! What'cha doin'? Oh, hi, Isabella. Come over here and we'll show you. Oh, oops. Sorry Ferb. We're fixing up this spaceship that belongs to our new friend, Meap. Meap. He's the most adorable thing in the world. Really? Are you sure there's nothing, or no one that's more adorable? No. Not a chance. Here, see for yourself. Meap? Meap? Bango-Ru! Bango-Ru. Oh, Candace! Look at it! It's so cute, I could die! What? Oh, no Meap! And it makes little noises. How did you do that? Oh. Well Phineas and Ferb, you know? Oh, they tricked it out for you, cool. Come on, lets go to the convention. Right behind you. Hmm. Your reign of terror has come to an end, SeÃ±or Frowg. Okay. I jury-rigged Ferb's old GPS device, to create a cute-tracker. It locks on to the cutest thing in the area, so it should lead us right to Meap. Let's see if we can get a signal. Got something! Oh, that's probably me. Sorry. No. It's three miles in that direction. Ferb, why don't you stay and finish the ship? Isabella, want to come and help me find Meap? Sure. I still have to get my ""You Wouldn't Know Cute If It Bit Your Legs Off"" accomplishment patch. Cool! Let's go.  Doofenshmirtz Evil is carpeted!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. Just in time for your little lesson in static electricity! Looks like I rubbed you the wrong way, Puffy the Fuzzypus. You might ask, ""Why the carpet?"" ""What is he doing?"" ""What is going on?"" ""Why is he listing questions I might ask him?"" Well, I believe the answers are best expressed in back story form. When I was a boy, the smell of pork emanating from me was so bad because ofâ Wellâ Well, the reason's unimportant, it was part of aâ different emotionally scaring back story. I'm not getting intoâ Regardless, the smell of pork was so bad, that no one would come near me. So, one day, the carnival came to town and I needed money because ofâ Well, yet another back story thatâ Basically my parents disowned me, I was being raised by ocelots. The point is, I had to get a job at the carnival, butâ The only work was at the dunking booth, andâ Not as the guy who got dunked though, I-I was what they threw to dunk him, whi-which is again a whole other back storyâ Okay, look atâ Long back story short, I got a balloon at the carnival, I drew a face on him, I sprayed him with special ""Life Long-lasting"" spray I created, and I named him, Balloony. He became my best friend in the whole world, yadda yadda yadda. Then one tragic day, when I was protecting our garden as-as a lawn gnomeâ What-Whatever, you remember that back story. Balloony started floating away. I tried to reach out and grab him, but (Don't move!) And I never saw Balloony again. He's still out there, somewhere. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I put that ""Long-lasting"" spray on him. So, he's still around. And I plan to bring him to me! Balloons, you see, are drawn to static electricity, so I created this. Behold! The Static Electro Amplif-inator! Keep-keep beholding, keep beholding, beholding, and we're still beholding And scene.  La-la-la-la-la-laa-la-la-la  Hmm. I keep getting some kind of cute interference. It's me! I'm endangering the mission! I shouldn't have come. No. Now it's cleared up. I wonder how Ferb's doing.

Irresponsible kids. I'm totally gonna have to get some Bango-shoes to go with this! Hey! Is this your doll, young lady? Yeah. We found it abandoned on the floor over there. Oh, sorry. Your irresponsibility makes our job as security guards a million times harder! Someone could have stolen it. Or tripped over it. That's right. Injuries, lawsuits, stolen property. Even death! Yes, you could have killed me. Me too! We're lucky to be alive. Yeah, you're in big trouble. The cute signal's getting stronger. Phineas? Yes? How come you think Meap is so cute? What does that even mean anyway? Cute. I can't define cute. I just know it when I pick it up on my cuteness meter. Although, I keep getting this weird cute interference from somewhere. Hmm. Whoa, sweet! You tricked it out! Isabella and I are hot on Meap's trail. Let's bounce. You can't ban me from Bango-Ru conventions for life. I ban myself! And what kind of a toy are you anyway? It isn't a toy. It's a real live alien spaceship. That's it! You're not a toy! You're a real live alien. Hey Candace, you found Meap. More like he found me. Well, his ship's fixed, so he can get back to his family now. What's happening? We're caught in some kind of tractor beam! It's pulling us in! Maybe it's the space authorities. Did we do something wrong? Well, it occurs to me that perhaps not all of the modifications I made are technically ""street legal"". What's going on? Wait! Come back! Who was that? That was your father? Meap! But why Oh, it's not your father? It's a mug shot? Oh, no! Phineas and Ferb have been abducted by an intergalactic criminal! Meap. Where's he taking us? Look! He's headed for that small cloud! That's no cloud. That's a space station. I've got a good feeling about this! Ha! You thought you were clever disguising your ship. But I've got you now, whoever you are. Hey, look! It's Meap's dad. All right, what the heck is going on? Is this some kind of joke? I'm Phineas, that's Isabella, and this is Ferb. What's your name? I am known by many names throughout the universe. Well, two mainly. Mitch, and uh Some of the guys call me Big Mitch. Anyway, where did you get this ship? It's Meap's ship. Meap? Yep.

That's wrong! These poor creatures shouldn't be locked up here. Yeah. They should be brought back to their homes and set free. Oh, really? Maybe I should lock you three up in here as well. Nah, that's cool. Tonight's taco night at home. Hi, Mom. Phineas and Ferb have been abducted by an evil alien, and I'm here with another alien, who isn't his son, and How does that sound so far? I agree. Craaazey! What are we gonna do? Play catch? Hmm. Well, if you think it will help. Phineas and Ferb. Your father. No. Right, not your father. A bad guy. Say Where do you keep all these pictures? Meap! Right, stay focus. They're in a giant spaceship. But how are we supposed to get up there and save them? Oh, I get it! Duh. You're trying to tell me something. What? Soâ So you know when you walk around in socks and rub them on the carpet, you get that little static shock? Behold, the new uniform of pure evil! I call it the socky-shocky-suity. Oh, cool! Would you three sit still? You don't get it. You're my prisoners. You should be afraid of me! Ah, like a moth to the flame. Whoa. I got this situation, totally under control. You kids might be of some use to me aftâ Hey, dâ Don't go in there. You'll track dirt back into the corridor. Ugh! I'll deal with them later. Wow, check this place out. Well, now I know how to find Phineas and Ferb. They'll be where the cool stuff is. Woo-hoo! Ka-ching! Okay. I'll go in and get them. You stay here. This could get dangerous. Wow. Cool! So, we meet again. Meap! I agree. It ends here. Oh, and by the way I talked to your little friends, and just so we're clear, I am not your father. Okay, I'm almost done charging up to shocky-socky-suity suit. You know, it's the technical side of evil that I think people don't really appreciate. There! Now watch, as every balloon in the entire Tri-State area is ripped from the hands of children, and clowns, and clown-children. Wow. That's a lot of balloons. You know on paper, ugh This was the outcome too. Meap! Oh, yeah? Oh, man, what theâ Oh. Hello. We're right in the middle of a showdown, if you don't mind. Oh, uh Oh, oh. I get it, nemesis confrontation, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it looks serious. Uh, one of those ""it ends here"" kind of things. Whoo-ee. Not fun. O-Okay, wellâ Well, don't mind me, I'm just playing through as they say. You're doing fine, justâ Just ignore me. I-I'll show myself out. No! That's where I keepâ It's you. Balloony. Hey! That's the most unique creature in my collection. Colin. M-My best friend. What? That's Balloony, my best friend. No, I-I found Colin just floating all alone in space. Well, I actually drew his face! Look. Look, I signed it. That's a birthmark. A birthmark! It's a balloon you idiot! ""Colin"". Come on Balloony, let's scoot. Baâ Balloony? Ha! See? Colin is my best friend. You've changed, Balloony. And I though you were actually back-story worthy. It makes me sick! Well, I don't even need you anymore. Yeah! I-I've got an even better best friend. He's a really good listener, he even put up with me going on about how great you were! Ha! It's clear to me now that my real best friend is Perry the Platâ Oof! Uh Hello? Falling to my doom here! All too easy. That was awesome. I knew there was still more cool stuff to do in space. Uh-oh. What are they? I don't know. Hi. Okay? Strike three. They're out. Cool! What ever happened to strike two? Uh Where's Meap? I told him to wait right here. Hmm. I'm having trouble picking up his cute signal. Phineas, since you obviously won't figure this out on your own, I think I'm the one causing the cute interference. Don't be silly, Isabella. I took into account your cuteness, and adjusted the cute-meter settings accordingly from the beginning. See, look what happens if I change it back to normal. Oops. So much for finding Meap. Do you think he's okay? No. No, I don't. Hi, Mitch. Meap! Get away from him, Mitch! Foolish children. Only now you understand your grave situation. ""Hi, Mitch!"" ""Look at the cool stuff, Mitch!"" ""Blah, blah, blah, Mitch!"" Ha. He totally nailed you, Ferb. Silence. I mean, seriously. Seriously! You're still not getting this. You're all trapped, on my ship, forever! Like animals in a cage. Get it? You lost! I won! Go, hide. Huh? Whoa. I I don't believe it. Oh, oh! Okay, okay I surrender, youâ You can stop behaving in a way counter intuitive to how you superficially appear. We get it. Hey! Stay away from my universal mustache translator. Ow! MEAP! Meap! Children, thank you for your help in bringing down this villainous scoundrel. You see, I am an intergalactic security agent who roams the universe, busting people who do stuff they're not supposed to do. You're like the me of the galaxy. Exactly. I am pleased to have not only made some true friends, but to have met a kindred spirit as well. I thought Meap was a helpless little creature. Huh. I guess I learned to never judge a book by its cover again. An alien monster! Get to the ship! Um Actually, that's my mother-in-law, so Yeah, she's correct. Let's get out of here! Aren't you a little young to save the universe? Yes. Yes, I am. I want your hat on my desk! Balloony! Colin! What? Jeremy's going to be there? The Chronicles of Meap, Episode 40. Meap. Meapless in Seattle. In a world. There. I said it. Happy?"
"All right Candace, I'm off to the grocery store. You're in charge. Whoa-whoa-whoa wai-wai-wait By ""in charge"", does that mean I'm in control of everything around here while you're gone? Yes. Including Phineas and Ferb? I'm the complete overlord of them? Suddenly I'm a little scared. But, technically, yes. So like, in a court of law, anyâ Candace! I'll be back later. Excellent. Oh, boys! Hear ye, hear ye! Mom has left me in charge, so I hereby demand that you do nothing crazy today. No building any whoosy-whatzits, or goozy-mahookoffs! In other words, don't be the world's most annoying brothers for one afternoon, okay? Your brothers are annoying you, too? Hi, I'm Mandy. And me and my world's most annoying brothers are visiting our aunt next door for the weekend. Oh, you're Mrs. Weaver's niece. You have annoying brothers? Oh, my gosh! My brothers, Thaddeus and Thor, are constantly building the most annoying contraptions on Earth! Soapbox cars with lawn mower engines, Uh-huh! tire swings that launch over the roof, Uh-huh! a mini shopping center for the cat! Finally! Someone who relates! Listen to how annoying Phineas and Ferb are. One time Gum me. 'Sup, chumps? Thaddeus. Thor. Overheard you two like to build stuff. Where we come from, we're known as the best. Jealous? No. No, I'm not. Well, you should be. Today, we're building the most awesome fort ever. What do you think of that, suckers? Cool. Good luck. Gum me. Puh-lease. Hey, where's Perry? Agent P? Agent P? Agent P? Where is he, Carl? I don't know, sir. Maybe he decided to quit. Quit? Well, why would he wanna do that? Well Remember his last mission? You were pretty tough on him, sir. Hmm. You're right, Carl. I can be pretty rough sometimes. Poor Agent P. Do you think the little guy will ever forgive me? Oh! Agent P! You're here! Ahem! So, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been sighted in the Danville Park. We need you to make sure no one is in any danger. There he goes. Jeez, Carl, just hope I wasn't too rough on him this time. I don't know, sir. He looked pretty upset to me. I hate myself. I dunno, Candace. In terms of obnoxiousness, I'm sure my brothers have your brothers beat. I beg to differ. Yes, they're both obnoxious, but my brothers' stuff has a sprinkling of awesomeness, which makes it that much more annoying! Um, have you not been listening? Today, my brothers are building a fort and it'll probably be the most obnoxiously awesome fort ever built! Not if my brothers are building one! Oh, yeah? Yeah! It's on, sister! Well, Thor, I know who we're gonna outdo today! There you are! I order you to get out there and build a fort! I thought you wanted us to take the day off and not annoy you. Those kids next door are building a fort and I will be annoyed if theirs is better than yours! Candace, we don't do this to compete. We do it for fun. And for the ladies. Rrrrrow. Well, do it 'cause I say so!  Doofenshmirtz Family Reunion  Oh, hi, Perry the Platypus. Welcome to the Doofenshmirtz family reunion. They're just about to start the dreaded kickball game that my mother organizes every year. The one my brother's team always wins. You see, I'm not very coordinated with my feet. But with my hands Hey, watch this. See? I hold the cup-stacking world record. But does my mother care? No! You see, Perry the Platypus, throughout my childhood, my mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball. You know, I thinkâ I think this is best expressed through song. (Song: ""Couldn't Kick My Way Into Her Heart"")  My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball   And my brother was an expert from the start   But I lacked finesse   So when put to the test   I couldn't kick my way right into her heart  Ladies and gentlemen, Love HÃ¤ndel!  Oh, yeah!   He tried playing rugby   And soccer and football   He tried kick the can and even martial arts   But even with this dedication   I still got no coordination!   He couldn't kick his way right into her heart   Oh, yeah!  Goodnight, Gimmelshtump! How do you like that, Perry the Platypus? Love HÃ¤ndel, in my flashback! I know people. This year, it's going to be different! W-W-Wait right here, I'll show you! Behold! The Kickinator 5000! Could you help me practice, please, please? Just take the ball and go over there and then just roll it to me. Go ahead. Any time. I'm ready. Well, youâ You threw it too early! Couldn't you tell I wasn't ready? Come on, try again. O-Okay, do it right this time. It's, uh, you know, it's a process. What'cha doin'? Building a fort. What are you doing? Showin' two chumps how to build a fort! Oh, no, he di'n't! Phineas, how can I help? Stainless steel 18-8 woodscrews, eh? The choice of amateurs! Why? What kind of screws are your brothers using? That's classified. Isabella! Get a tarp over that thing ASAP! What color? Hey, where's Harry? Yo! Over here! Well, he is a contractor. They don't do much. Okay, slowly. Not so fast! I can hardly keep up with it! Heads up, Heinz! Ugh! Hey, you know what? Justâ Just-Just bring the ball in front of the Kickinator. Justâ Put it right thâ Wait, what are you doing? I didn't say a mile away! Right here! Bring it closer. Okay. No, noâ Oh. That's a little bit better. Step back and get ready to witness some real kicking. I did it! I did it! I still did it! Alright, guys, it's do or die time. This is the chance to really show your stuff, 'cause there's no way you're gonna lose to a couple of lame-os and their loser sister! I can hear you! I know! I said it loud! Mom! Gotta get rid of her! Oh, Mom! You're home, you're home! But, uh I-I think you should go back to the grocery store. Why? Because Iâ I bet you forgot, uh That stuff! Oh, I guess I did. All right, throw these in the kitchen and I'll be right back. Boy, that was close. Oh! I'm next! All right, easy out! Everybody move in! Hey, you're not even a Doofenshmirtz anymore! I kept the name! You can do it, Dad! He can't really do it. Welcome, citizens of Danville! I give you the architectural stylings of Thaddeus and Thor! Whoa! That's nice. Pfft. What you architectural illiterates see here is a split-level edifice, complete with slide and licorice dispenser. Huh? What? People, people, I'm not gonna soft pedal this. That was adequate, but I think we're ready to witness the greatest architectural feat this town has ever seen! I give you Phineas and Ferb! You call that an architectural feat?! What?! Have you lost your minds?! You've completely humiliated me in front of everyone! But, Candace, thisâ Phineas, all summer long, you build the most amazing things. And the one time I reach out to you as a sister, the one time I count on you, you give me this? But, Candaceâ No! Just leave me alone! Excuse me! Candace, wait! Whoa! Whoa-ho! Ladies and gentlemen, topping our fort is our homage to old-school construction. And now for the rest of it. Ferb? Tada! Our modern take on a well-known classic! I I did it. I did it! Who's the loser now, huh? L-O-S-E-R! Who's the loser? You are! Let's boogie! That's right! Let's boogie! You're out. Oh, Roger! My son! You make me so proud, again! But Ow! Well, here's the foyer. All imported marble, by the way. Here's the bowling alley. Pool. Telescope. Terracotta army room. JET ENGINE WIND TUNNEL! And scoring stage with 40-piece orchestra. We don't, however, have a licorice dispenser. That was a nice touch. Yeah, that rocks! Nice going. You broke their brains. Come on, boys. I'm taking you home. Hey, I got the stuff. Thanks, Mom. At least you came through. Well, Candace, as much as I hate to say this, your brothers are the best. A ten-story addition with a swimming pool! Ugh! Why didn't you think of that?! Could it be true? Candace, have you seen this? I'm looking at it! Wait, where are you? In the kitchen! When I said, ""throw these in the kitchen,"" I didn't mean it literally! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, Mom! Candace! I'm not going anywhere until you take care of this mess! Well, fun's fun, but there are those pesky zoning laws. Ooh. I just felt a disturbance in the cup-stacking universe. I think my record's been broken. That wasn't so hard, now, was it? Mom, let's go, let's go, let's go! Mom, I've been trying to tell you all summer! They make these amazing things! Look! Candace, you're right! It is amazing! Hey, Mom. We've built a fort. It's wonderful! Isn't it great? The boys are starting to take an interest in building things. Who wants stuff? We do!"
"Okay, Stacy. We've got about ten minutes until Jeremy's party, so you've gotta help me decide. Should I go with this swimsuit or this swimsuit? Hmm, that's tough. One on hand, if you go with the achromatic pink, it kinda says, ""Hi, I'm Candace, and I'm bedraggled and pallid"". Trust me, you don't want that. I've been both. But, if you go with the more saturated pink, it kinda gives you that ""overkill, out-to-kill, my currency is urgency"" look. I don't want that. I've been all three. Let your subconscious do the deciding. Go with the one you touched first. Of course! Stacy, you're a fashion phenom. Which hat should I go with? I don't think it matters. Yeah, you're right, I fuss too much. Nothing starts off a day better than some breakfast and some education. We now return to ""Wacky Millionaires Throughout History"". Howard Hughes is probably best known for building the Spruce Goose, so-called because of its wooden frame. With a wingspan of 319 feet 11 inches, it still holds the record for being the largest plane ever built. Wow, that's an impressive record. and only one afternoon away from being broken. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? We're makin' the biggest airplane ever! Cool! Coincidentally, we're going for our Aeronautics patches. Coincidentally, we could use extra hands. Coincidentally, we're in. We're making our plane out of paper mache with newspaper! Why? To make sure it's newsworthy? And red all over! Oh! Oh, oh! Hah! And funny! And funny! Heh! You know, 'causeâ 'Cause, the Funnies! Heh. But seriously, Howard Hughes called his plane the Spruce Goose, 'cause it was made of wood. So, we're gonna call ours ""The Paper Pelican"", 'cause it's made of newspaper! You know, so it will have a good circulation! Aw, come on! Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P. We just discovered Doofenshmirtz has been stealing bottles from recycling bins, and nothing good can come from that. Unless, of course, he's recycling, in which case nothing but good can come from that. Unless, he's recycling it into some hideous weapon, which is something once again no good could come from. Except, of course, for the recycling part, which I guess is still at its essence, good. Even if you're making something evil, it's still reducing theâ You know, you know, perhaps we shouldn't even put these good and evil labels on things. Let's just say Doofenshmirtz is doing something neutral. So, just get out there and make sure it stays like that. (Song: Quirky Worky Song) Huh? Eh?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus? Hello? It's for you, Perry the Platypus. Prank call! Now, say hello to my new evil weapon. My Evaporator-inator! It's made completely out of recycled materials. It's green and evil! I call it, ""Greevil."" Backstory time! You see Perry the Platypus, when I was a young boy, my mother would never let me swim in public pools. No. What? That's it! You know, not every backstory has to have some big in-depth spiel, Mr. High Expectations! Wait Now! We're exactly fashionably late! We're here! This is gonna be so cool! Hey! Yeah, totally hey! That is so cool. Who's that Jeremy's talking to? I have no idea. I've never seen her before in my life. I thought Jeremy invited me to this party. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. What is Jeremy doing with her? Slow down. You remember how you thought Jeremy was with a girl and she wasn't even a she? And then you ended up on that snowboard all crazy and out of control? Yeah, but she's obviously a real girl. So then I've got two west African pit vipers, and had to dive off a 300-foot cliff, and swim up through a school of piranha. That's awesome, Nicolette. Stacy, it's conclusion-jumping-to time. Strategy session, now! She's amazing! She's all exotic and stuff! She has on the same bathing suit as me, only it's brighter and she wears it better. And she dives off rocky cliffs holding poisonous snakes into piranha-infested water! What am I going to do? She's like catnip for boys! She's boynip! Nicely done, people. Hey, Baljeet, what are the stats on the Spruce Goose again? The Spruce Goose's wingspan is 319 feet 11 inches. And the Paper Pelican's wingspan is Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. You'd better have some decent grub on this bucket. You will be most gratified. As long as you find insignificant bags of peanuts gratifying. Welcome to Wedgieville.

Adjust angle of departure, check. We've reached cruising altitude. You are free to move about the cabin. Would you like some peanuts? I'll take two packs, please.

So peanutty, you won't even taste the chicken!  I'd better not taste any chicken then, loser. All right, you survive. For now. Oh, thank you, sir. What are you worrying about? You're Candace Flynn! Yeah, and she's super cool, foreign accent, snake wrestler, high-diving, natural hottie, Nicolette. Snake wrestler? Whatever. You've fought dinosaurs! You've been to Mars! You've traveled through time! Oh, yeah And as for diving, you've been perfecting that quintuple-somersault backflip-jacknife-swandive for a week now. You're Candace Flynn! Yeah! I'm Candace Flynn! Candace? Oh, he remembers my name. How nice. And now, for your in-flight entertainment, The Paper Pelican Floor Show!

So darling, put your goggles on   And up, up and away we'll fly!   In a big ginormous airplane   In a big ginormous airplane   In a big ginormous airplane   In the sky!  Ahem! There's been a lot of talk around here about diving and snakes, and diving with snakes, and snakes into pools filled with piranha and sulfuric acidâ I didn't say anything about sulfuric acid. Leave all questions to the end of the rant? Thank you. Now, say ""goodbye"" to splashy-pool time fun, forever! Even my power source is greevil. Look! Look, it's solar! D-Do you mind Perry the Platypus? This isâ This is really a two handed job. Huh? Seriouslyâ Now, as I was saying before I was so lamely interrupted, I'm going to show everybody a real dare-devil dive. Oh, well, that's just not fair! Hey, cool! It's like a half pipe! All right! No, wait! No! Ugh! No, I've been practicing diving, not skateboarding! Ugh. Everyone, stop doing things that I'm not good at! Oh, this is a nightmare. Come on Stacy, let's go! Safety first! Whoa. Safety first! Safety first! A steering wheel? How's this safe? Wow, Candace. That was your last highly-improbable judo maneuver, Perry the Platypus. I will now evaporate-inate you, into non-existence! Oh, no! Myâ My power source! Oh, great. Now I can't see a thing! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Go, Candace! Help me! I can't see! Candace? This is your captain speaking. We're beginning our descend. Okay, everyone. Please return your seats to their upright positions, and please do not panic. As you can see the Paper Pelican is dissolving in water, because it is, after all, made of paper mache. But do not worry, because your seat cushions also function as flotation devices. Thank you for flying with us. Oh, there you are, Perry. Well, everyday is eventful in the emergency room. Candace, you really should be more careful. Mom, I told you, we had our helmets on. So your cousin Nicolette was trapped on a video game level? Yeah, took her a week to get through it. You didn't think she really did all those things? Candace? Do you mind? Yes! I mean no! I mean Sign it! Thanks. Oh"
"Oh, my gosh! Stacy, have you heard? ""About what""? About Jeremy. He's on a TV commercial. Yeah, I know. I heard it from Christina, who heard it from Jenny, who heard it from Jessie who heard it from you! Well, it's totally true. Do you know what this means? He's totally out of your league? He's totally out of my league! What am I going to do? How should I know? I donât know anything about celebrity relationships. That's it! If I can get on TV, then Jeremy will see my star quality and we'll be on the same level again! How exactly are you gonna do that? I guess you're right. Getting on TV might be kinda difficult. Yeah, I guess you forgot about that insignificant little detail. Insignificant little detail. Insignificant little Phineas and Ferb! Stacy, you're a genius. Would you call my mom and tell her that? Phineas and Ferb! Phineas and Ferb! Phineas andâ So you just switch the solenoid here with the ganglion there andâ Phineas and Ferb. Hey, Candace. What'cha doin'? Freaking out!

Dozens of delivery trucks have been This was, uh Part of the bet. showing up at Doofenshmirtz's, and no good can come from that. Get to the bottom of it. This actually wasnât part of the bet. Do not worry your pretty little head. I have plenty of experience with this sort of thing. You better, man! My face is my fortune! Of course it is. Yeah, Stacy, the boys are putting on a game show! And I'm the star! This'll totally do it! Well, I hope that does do ""it"", because Jeremy's getting huger by the minute. I know because Megan's blog says she thinks so. No way!

With my Scorch-inator, I will target TV towers and melt, smelt, and render them into their basic components, thereby eliminating infomercials! And how much would I pay for this? Nothing, it's free!

She's taking the physical challenge! Dude, it's so cool you're in this commercial. Thanks. Hey, let's see if it's on another channel. Wai-w-w-wait! Is that Candace? Whoa! She's like a TV star! Not only will I defeat you with this Flab Crusher, but I'm simultaneously getting a good burn on my delts. $10.99! Hmm? The Tornado Vac only needs one setting because of its painfully awesome suction power! Shrinkinator, why haven't I unplugged this thing? I keep leaving myself notes, and I keep forgetting. ""Shrinkinator. Unplug Shrinkinator."" Ugh! I'll do it tomorrow. This is the final question. Winner takes all! What isâ? Teddy bear stuffing! Be a star, Candace! Be a star! Be a star! Come on, be a star! Wow. Somebody's got issues. Ha! I'll crush you with my Burgermatic hamburger flipper! All right, forget the Burgermatic. Let's see how you fare against my Shrinkinator! Curse youâ Hey! Hey, you missed my hand! Oh, now not only am I shrunken, but I'm freakishly shrunken! Curse you, Perry the Plâ Aw, this is kind of heavy. Hey, look! Our game show set instantaneously miniaturized itself! Well, I suppose we could call that the home version. Well, we are home. Let's play it! There you are, Perry! So what? That's it? Who won? I'm so busting you guys! Hi, Candace. Hi, Jeremy. I saw ya on TV and just wanted to congratulate you. I guess you're, like, on a whole new level now. What about your commercial? You mean this? (Song: Flip Flop Jingle)  Available only at Devors   It's the Tri-State Area's flip-flop store!  I was just the foot model. You have hunky ankles. Thanks. I like your branch. You should have seen me covered in pie. What kind of pie?"
"Hi, Mom. Hi, boys. What are you kids up to today? Just trying out our new invention. It's called the Ladybug 2000 Roving Swingset. Want a whirl? Not right now, sweetie. I'm going to the gardening store. Something's been eating my hydrangeas. Hmm. Hey, Isabella. Good thing we installed an air bag. So, what'cha doin'? The Fireside Girls are trying to raise money to save the star-nosed mole. And how's it going? Not very well. We started a bake sale Then we tried cat-sitting Even a lemonade stand. But, nothing worked. Now what's a good way to raise some money? I got it! We construct a zip line from the top of Danville's tallest skyscraper, all the way to ourâ Or we could have a car wash! That's good too! We'll build the best dang car wash in the whole dang world, dang it. Iâ I can't really pull that off, can I? You're not very street. Yeah. Hey, where's Perry? Way to stick that landing, Agent P. Eight and a half, Carl? Really? Well, sir, he did separate his feet a little on the reentry. Carl! Ugh! Hey, is something burning over on the stove? My spaghetti! Anyhoo, we've had some grave concerns. Seems there's been some extreme seismic activity in the area. We're pretty sure our old friend Doofenshmirtz is up to no good again. Excuse me, sir. I wrote my sophomore thesis on quakes and seismic events. If you want, you can check out my website. Ugh. Carl. Spaghetti. Oh, that's right! Hey, here's your delivery, kid. Friction rollers, spot-free rinser, individual driers, turbo spray nozzles, jet powered vacuum, atomic collider. I suppose you're gonna ask me if I'm too young to use this stuff. Nah, just try not to blow a hole through the earth's core, or we'll both be in deep doody. Okay. Stacy, I sent Jeremy a text message twelve minutes ago and he still hasn't answered. You don't think I'm making a big deal out of this? No way. What am I going to do, Stacy? You've got to play hard to get. Hard to get? Jeremy thinks you'll go with him anywhere, anytime, just for the asking. Don't be a lapdog, Candace. Just say no! Uh-oh, Stacy. That's Jeremy. Hello? Hey, Candace. I'm taking my mom's car to this crazy new car wash. Would you like to go for a ride? A car? That is so grown-up. I mean, hold please? Stacy, Jeremy's asking me out for a ride, in a car! Wow, that's so grown-up! But you gotta be strong. Remember, hard to get. Right, hard to get. I'll call you back. Um About the car and the ride I would love to! Wait. I mean I better check my schedule. You're in luck. I can just squeeze you in. Great. Pick you up later. Ah, Jeremy. Stacy, I am like so hard to get right now. It's like totallyâ Wait, what in theâ Gotta go, Stacy. Okay, Ferb. Let's test out the turbo-charged uber-nozzle. What the heck is goingâ It works!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Well, it looks like that the anti-platypus security system was a total waste of money. I am so taking that back. Thank goodness for old reliable traps, huh? I'm so glad you're going to hang around. Anyway, you arrived just in time to witness the unveiling of my latest invention. Let me introduce to you, the Mountain-out-of-a-Molehill-inator. All my life, I was told, ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill,"" ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill,"" ""Don't make a mountain out of a molehill."" Well, now I intend to do just that! This machine will infuse electricity into a small little sphere of compressed nitrogen molecules, which I will then drop into the earth, and it will make all the tiny little molehill molecules grow and grow into enormous moâ Y-You know what, it's kind of complicated. I learned about it on some kid's website. Oh, oh, and you know what else I found on the web? It's these pictures of cats and they write theseâ Oh, lo-lo-lo-look at this one. ""Invisible Cheeseburger"". No, huh? Well, it's not for everyone, I just think they're funny. Anyway, so I take the sphere, electrify it, drop it in the ground, ta-da! Mountains! Out of molehills! I know when people say that, they usually mean it figuratively, it's an analogy, bu-bu-but making a point, I can do whatever I want. I will be honest. I think we look ridiculous. Are you kiddin'? I make this look good. Okay, Ferb. Let's fire this baby up! (Song: Phintastic Ferbulous Car Wash) Oh, they are so busted! All right, you dweebs, what's going on here? I don't have time for this! I've got a huge date andâ  Scrub! Scrub! Gotta get it all clean!  (Scrub)   Just drive on in to our brand new machine!   Shake! Shake! Gotta shake off the grime!

Looks like this whole town is going to this cool new car wash. I might have to make it some other time. Wait, no! I-I mean I've got to put you on hold. Stacy! Wow, I can't believe you're still there. So how is ""hard to get"" working? Working? I'm impossible to get! And now Jeremy's playing hard to get. Wow! This car wash is really hoppin'! At this rate, the star-nosed mole will be saved in no time! Phineas, I'd love to bust you, but if you don't speed up this car wash, I'm going to miss my date with Jeremy! No biggie, big sister. This is Big Squirt to Super Suds. Accelerado, por favor! No, wait! Too fast! Stop! Wow! That was quite an entrance! Jeremy! You made it! Oh, I must look like a wreck. No, you look great! Hop in! What'd you do to your hair? Hot wax. And a sealer I think. I like it! I'm really glad that you're goin' with me. There's nothing I'd rather be doing. I put an energy what'cha-ma-call-it in here and Nice. Wow, these things go fast. I guess I need a new battery. Nope. Nope. Uh-uh. Not here. Nope. Ah! Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Finally! Ah, dang it! Oh, sorry, Perry, I didn't mean to get all street there. But now it's probably got all that, grease and refrigerator fluff on it. Oh, there's my retainer! This is so romantic. It's like we're going through our very own tunnel of loâ HORROR! Throw! Throw! No worries. I'll protect you. All right, here we go! The energy ball is growing and Ah. All right, time for the Unstuck-inator. You know, in hindsight, I probably should've done this in the basement. Wow. I guess that's who's been eating Mom's hydrangeas. Well, looks like they're safe now. It's working! It's working! And so much better than I thought it would! All my life, everyone told me I couldn't make a mountain out of a molehill. Well, everybody, take that! Why do I even bother? System overload. ClichÃ© explosion imminent.  Agent P!  Who wears a shoe this size anyway? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Oh, no! It's a hideous giant mole! Hey, shut up! No no! That mole, ya fool! I don't know what that was, but let's do it again! Stacy? Candace?! What the heck are you doin'? You're supposed to be playing hard to geâ Oh. Oh, where am I? Hey, check it out! An aglet! So this is why you shouldn't make mountains out of molehills. Curse you, giant mole! There goes a perfectly good car wash. Oh, there you are, Perry! Oh no! Now, how are we supposed to save the star-nosed mole? I think he can take care of himself.  Rinse! Rinse!

"Ugh, no more peach and pumpernickel sandwiches before bed. You! For an animal that doesn't do much, you sure know how to make a mess of things! Good morning, Agent P. I've got bad news and good news. The bad news is you're being reassigned to a new, more evil villain. His name, The Regurgitator. You keep pushing him down, but he keeps coming back up! That's not funny, Carl. That's just disgusting. You laughed earlier! It was a pity laugh. Anyway, Dr. Doofenshmirtz had to be downgraded to minor threat status, and, we've just assigned Agent S to his case. The good news is, you've been relocated away from your host family, to this new family in the Quad-State Area. It's the other way around, sir. Oh, oh! Yes, yes, of course. Bad news is the relocation, and the good news is the new villain thing. Uh. Just make sure you take your belongings from the house when you leave. Good morning, Candace. What's so great about it? Not much. We can't find Perry anywhere. He's never missed breakfast, not even once. Uh Y-You don't think he could've argued with someone, at say got his feelings hurt, then run away, do you? Nah, he never would've gone outside on purpose. Everybody knows platypuses are supposed to stay inside at night. You haven't seen him anywhere, have you? Well, maybe he just wandered off. Doesn't he always wander off at some point in the day? A-And then later, when he comes back, you say, ""Oh, there you are, Perry"", and he says, Yeah, but he's always here in the morning. I'd be devastated if something happened to him.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Hold on, I'm coming! Another gift basket? ""We regret to inform you that due to The Regurgitator's recent evil behavior, you have been downgraded to a minor threat. If you believe this to be a mistake, please fill out the included appeal."" A minor threat?! Regurgitator. Ugh, well there's a lot of weirdos out there. Oh, here we go. He has his own blog. ""World's Most Evil Villain""? Who does this upstart think he is? It's time to show him who's boss! All right, Ferb. Activate the Platy-Attracker 3000. If Perry's anywhere in Danville, this'll bring him home. Wow. I didn't know there were so many platypuses in Danville. Geez, what a dump! Well, so much for Mr. Big Shot Supervillain. Uh, yeah, hi. I'm looking for someone named Mr. ""The Regurgitator."" Hmm. ""Do not push"". Heh. Oh, my Heinz heinie! Look at this, all this technology, a giant vacuum tube, and they can't afford a throw pillow? Oh, hello. I am The Regurgitator!

You can start by making a fresh pot of coffee! Nope, Ferb, not Perry. This little guy's eyes are too close together and his beak is orange. Perry's is more of a tangerine. Nope, too fat. Too thin. Too cartoon-y. Whoa, that one smells like meatloaf! Perry? Perry the Platypus! Peâ Huh? Perry! Get over here. You're coming home with me so I won't get in trouble with theâ You have a pet beaver? You have a pet platypus. TouchÃ©. Nope, too blue. Too angular. Too French. That one's just a duck with a beaver tail taped on. Well, that was the last of them. Maybe we need to think bigger. And with music! Perry just loves music, remember? Let's get the guitars. I've got an idea. What are you looking at, Perry the Platypus? This is a great job! And look at all I've accomplished. I mean, just today, I organized this evil invoices, swept his evil lair, picked up his evil dry cleaning. A-And look, I even had time to do this. See? ""Best Boss."" And if I do a good job, I could be promoted to head assistant in just three months! Where are you gonna be in three months, huh? Huh? Never mind the three months. I'll take care of him right now! Wait a minute. Well, first of all, he's my nemesis! A-And you can't get rid of him now. Whereâ Where's the fun in that? Youâ You need to explain your whole plan to him. Don't you have a nemesis? Me? The world is my nemesis! Sorry, this thing doesn't always work. The world is my nemesis! Perry's gone, and it's It's just my fault. I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna have to tell the boys. Oh, there they are. Well, I guess now is as good a time as any. Phineas, Ferb, I just have to tell you that I'm the one who Hey. Marty the Rabbit Boy and his musical blender? Maybe this'll make you feel better. Nah, not so much. Don't look at me like that, Perry the Platypus. I know what you're thinking. I'mâ I'm not some lowly intern. I'm an evil scientist! I'm Heinz Doofenshmirtz, and he should be bowing down to me! Hey you, Mr. Regurgitator! Let's get things straight! What? Okay, okay. You see that, Perry the Platypus? Compromise. Who am I kidding? Ugh! You can do it! You can do it! You can do it! Okay, Regurgitator! I've done everything for you. I'veâ Y-You see those hard-to-reach files up there? Well I invented these rocket shoes just so you can reach them! A-And look at this! I even put in the self-destruct button that you forgot! What? Why is it counting down? Okay, well, I may have pressed it by mistake. But at least I didn't push the release button I installed inside Perry the Platypus' cage! Look what you've done! You've pushed my buttons for the last time, you disturbed lunatic! Get ready toâ We did it! We did it! Lo hicimos! We did it! Congratulations, Agent P. You've defeated the Regurgitator. As a matter of fact, he just landed in our prison. You can return immediately to your host family, and Dr. Doofenshmirtz is once again your nemesis. So, if we're enemies again, does that meanâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Oh, now see there, a-a throw pillow. Youâ You guys do it right! Excellent.

"All right, crew. Prepare to set sail on the hunt of a lifetime! Ensign Isabella, raise the jib! Aye, aye, Captain Phineas. Ahoy, Ferb! Any sign of the great white whale? You guys better not be talking about me! Boys, can't you wait till we get the boat in the water? Well, it's uh not actually called a boat, darling, it's called a sloop. And when we're on sea there's no right or left, only port and starboard. So, which side has the restroom? It's not a restroom, it'sâ It's called the poop deck. Well no, actually, it's called the head. Really? 'Cause poop deck makes much more sense. Dad, can we just get this over with? Jeremy's throwing a romantic summer soiree at sunset tonight. I'm kinda on a deadline here. Oh, don't worry, darling. It's only gonna be a three-hour tour. A three-hour tour? You can use the time to soak up some vitamin D. Fine! Candace distracted, check! Kids with the lifejacketsâ Check! Excellent! Family pet. Say, where's Perry? Oh, Perry stayed home. Baljeet's watching him. Hey, Baljeet. What'cha doin'? I am watching Perry the Platypus. I promised to not take my eyes off of him all day. Well, this is lame. He's a platypus. They do not do much. Maybe he needs some motivation. No, no! Please! I have given my solemn oath, to protect the little monotreme until the Flynn family comes home. What is that weird noise? I don't know. Maybe a car alarm? Wait. I think it stopped. Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? My king-of-the-world bit. Hey, check that out! And look at those cool flags. According to my Fireside Girls manual, each one of those flags has a meaning. The blue flag means crab season, and the yellow flag means hold the mustard, and that last one I'm not sure what that one means. Okay, who turned off the sun? Oh, here it is. The red flag with the black box means Storm warning! You kids get below! I'll head us back to shore! Whooah! Lawrence, we're heading towards that whirlpool. Keep faith in me, my darling! I have everything under control! Agent P, come in! Agent P? Blast it! Carl, why doesn't he answer? I think it's comin' from his stomach. He must be hungry. I will get him something to eat. Don't worry, little ducky thing. We're gonna take good care of you. Is everything all right, Agent P? I'm sensing you're in a bit of a jam. Can you get us a better view of the situation? I'm gonna hug you and squeeze you, and never let you go. Looks like we picked a bad day to send all of our field agents to sensitivity training. We're all out of options. I was hoping this day would never come. But, Carl, this is your big chance! (Song: Carl, the Intern)  Carl!   He works a camera!   Carl!   He knows what all those buttons do!   Carl!

Carl!  Ugh, I think it's finally clearing up. Well, the ship held together pretty good, didn't it? Of course, we'll have to re-attach the wheel, and fix that, uh Giant hole. Now, kids, are you all right? We're fine! Hey, where's Ferb? Are you okay? Oh, there you are. And there's Candace! Hey, what gives? Whoa, this doesn't look too good at all. Kids, don't come up here! It's far too dangerous! Mom and I will fix the boat. Candace, why don't you look for some food? And, boys, you could find us some shelter if you like. We may be here for a while. A while? You mean we're stranded? That means I won't get to Jeremy's party before the sunsets! We'll be stuck here forever eating rocks and bugs, then I'll have to marry a monkey and have monkey-kids, and name them Xavier and Amanda! And we'll love them anyway. Candace, the sooner we get started, the sooner we all get to go home. Fine. Stay safe, everyone! Shelter Shelter Well, this spot has potential. Great, let's get started!

Rookie mistake. I did not even get toâ Wait! Where is Perry? Glad to have you back, Agent P. You lost some time, but I brought along the escape cone. Agent P, we've just received reports that Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the laundry detergent in the Tri-State Area. We want you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. You'll need to use your tracking device to find him before your delicious ice cream cone melts. ""Oh, Candace, go find us some food."" Yeah, like a quart of ice cream is just gonna fall out of theâ Ugh, where is Perry the Platypus? He should have been here hours ago. Ah, Perry the Platypus. Well, y'know, I had a trap for you, but no time. This one's a little complicated, okay? You remember a few schemes ago when I couldn't figure out what ""Big Laundry"" meant? Well, this! This is what I meant! I am nefariously planning to provide the entire population of the Tri-State Area with free laundry, which will drive out of business all of the local laundromats, freeing up prime real estate locations for my newest franchise, the Doofenshmirtz Institute of Evilology, where in only six weeks, students can earn a certificate in mayhem, larceny, or Ponzi schemes. And I'm here in this volcano on this deserted island 'cause I get all this free monkey labor. I control them all with my Monkey-Enslave-inator helmet. And all I had to do was build one of them, because, you know, monkey see, monkey do. Hey, hey! Yeah, y-you can't put the red clothes in with the white wash! You'll turn the whole batch into a big pink mess! Bright colors over there, you incompetent baboon! Literally. Okay, now what was I talking about? Perry! Where are you? Oh. It is no use. I fear he is gone for good. Why don't you just buy him a new one? They won't know the difference. You cannot just buy aâ Wait. That gives me an idea! We don't need to eat.

All you had to do was make a little lean-to for survival. Well, there's survival, and then there's living. Let us give you a quick tour. We've got everything we need to make our maritime mishap as enjoyable as possible. Here's our warm and cozy family room, a fully-stocked kitchen. We even have indoor plumbing. You're giving a monkey a shower? Yep. Had to be done. Ugh! Don't you realize I have a very important party to go to?

Great job fixing the ship, honey. But how are we going to get it back in the water? Oh, yes. Well Um Mom, Dad, we gotta get outta here! Woo! Hurry up, kids! Women and children first! Kids, we're headed home! You were magnificent, captain! Can't we go any faster! Come on, steer this thing! Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, Buford. Perhaps this will buy us a little time. Frozen waffle, please. Ugh. Sorry. Got hungry. Ugh. Maybe they will not know the difference. I think it's pretty convincing. Oh, who am I kidding? We will have to tell them the truth! You're on your own, Jeet! I'm outta here! Hey, Baljeet. We're home! Hold on, Jeremy! I'm coming! Oh, my friends! I hope you can forgive me! Hey, Baljeet, wait till you hear what we did today.

"Phineas, Ferb? I'll be over at Vivian's house for a few hours. You kids have fun. What kind of fun can we have when it's raining? We could talk about our feelings. Okay, I'll rephrase it. What kind of fun can we have when it's raining? I would not mind talking about my feelings. How do you feel now? In pain? There, we're done. I guess that was fun. How about a game of hide-and-seek? Who said that? I did! Who are you? Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Irving. I'm your biggest fan! How long have you been sitting there? A couple hours. My horoscope says I'm a background type. Check it out. I've kept a scrapbook of your adventures. This is the time you built that rollercoaster. And this is the time you built those chariots. And this is when you had that soup. Oh, what a nerd. Is that a lock of Ferb's hair? Don't touch it. Irving suggested hide-and-seek. Isn't the house a little small to play a good game of hide-and-seek? Perhaps the problem is not that the house is too small, but that we are too big. He's right! You kids hang tight while Ferb and I use the technology from our submarine adventure to make a new shrinking machine. Ferb, I know what we're going to do today! You said the words. Hey, can I say the Perry thing? Whaâ? You know, when you say, ""Where's Perry?"" Okay Where's Perry? Ah, wait, wait, I can do better. Where's Perry? Where is Perry? Wherefore art thou Perry? I wonder where that Perry went. Oh, where is that platypus? Where the P-man at? Good morning Agent P. We've received some disturbing calls from Doofenshmirtz. Hello? Monogramare you home? If you're home, please pick it up. Pick it up. Hello? Oh, I, I-I hate these machines. Okay, listen. I'm being evil and I need Perry the Platypus to come over and stop me. Waitâ Wait, d-did I hear a beep? Did the machine just cut me off? Oh-oh-oh, I don't know what to do. Y-You know what, I'm just going to call back. I want you to find out what he's up to andâ Uh, hello? I-I think your machine cut me off before, so what I was saying wasâ Find out what he's up to and stop him. Okay. I'm gonna call later, save message on yourself, or just in case. Here it is. A shrinking machine. Now, everybody touch the top of the machine. Wow! We're really tiny! Phineas, your coffee table is huge! Look at this pencil. Somebody take a picture of me next to this dust bunny! Phineas, this is amazing! Everybody should shrink. Get teeny. Get tiny. Be small!  When you're small, every sink is a swimming pool  (Song: When You're Small)  When you're small, a spare button's a base  Safe!  When you're small, everyone's gonna think you're cool   'Cause you're the only one who fits through a grate!   When you're small, a kitchen sponge is a trampoline   When you're small, your dad's comb is a jail   Oh, when you're small, every TV's a movie screen   And your goldfish is a great orange whale   You can climb inside a paper airplane   And fly yourself down the hall   Every puddle's a lake   Every crumb is a cake   And there's never any reason to crawl   Baby, when you're small!   Baby, when you're small!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorâ  Oh, Perry the Platypus, you caught me. I've been putting recyclable trash in the regular trash bin. I am so bad! You've taught me a valuable lesson. From now on, I'll be green. I'll be all the shades of green. They will call me El Verde, and tell my tale in Greenland. Goodbye now, drive safe. And thanks for busting down my door. I deserved it! All right, gang. We can start that game of hide-and-seek now. What's that? Earthquake! No. It's Candace. Hey, Candace is it! Everybody hide! Stacy, the bow is totally cute. It's your signature look. You have the bow, and I have some weird metal contraption in the living room. Stace, I'll call you back. This thing was obviously made by Phineas and Ferb, so it must do something. Phineas, look! On the umbrella stand! It's Baljeet! Oh no, she found me. I guess I'm it! Oh! Oh! Ohh! Baljeet? I'm okay! We gotta get that shrinker back! You guys always have a plan. We don't have a plan. What? We'll just have to wing it. There's no winging. There's no winging in the book. You guys have just been improvising this whole time? Oh, how heroes fall! Hey guys! Remember me? Up here with the dead flies? Sit tight, Baljeet! We'll have you down as soon as we can. How can I sit tight? With that air conditioner up there freezing me! So cold. So cold.  Doo be doo be doo ba   Doo be doo be doo  Activate bug eye-bot. Yes, my little robot eye. Find Perry's address for me. That's right, I walk towards the front door so I can see the number. Oh, it will be so delicious to know where Perry lives. I can ring his doorbell and run away! Hey Mom? I want to show you something! Yep, I'm one step ahead of you boys, one step. What the heck is this thing? I'm shrunk! Where's the reverse button? Hello, hello? I could have sworn I heard someone knoâ Oy. That's not a good place to leave a toy. Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro! It's me, Candace! Hello?! Guess I deserve this for trying to be one step aheâ Phineas, we've got to get to that machine across the street. What's the point? We're vacuum bag filler. Thanks for that, Captain Bring-Down. What? Some kiddie TV show? Oh, the signal must have gotten switched. Ugh! Oh! Aw, now I've lost the picture entirely. Hmm. I hope it doesn't go rogue. What is that thing? Did we ever make mechanical bugs? There's nothing in the book. Okay everyone, split off now! Thread 'em and throw 'em guys! Come on, fanboy. You want to live forever? Is that an option? I'm okay. Great job, Isabella. Thank you very much. Yeah! Yeah! Wargh! Yeah! I couldn't have said it better myself. Yeah! Ugh! That was awesome, Phineas. Yeah, but guys? We're still small. What now? Ferb, you're a genius! Everyone on? Hey, I don't have to digitally insert myself. Go tell it to your blog. Let's get Baljeet. Baljeet? Where is he? I don't see him. Look over there. Something's moving! Eww! I did what I had to do to survive! Pinky, no! Down! Bad dog. Where are your manners? How are you doing there, short stuff? Phineas! Thank goodness! Who smells like fly guts? I had to survive, okay? Come on! Hands on! All right, Phineas! Cool! Yay, Phineas! You did it, Ferb! Isa, is that you? Yeah, Mom! You guys are so busted! Wait 'til Mom sees this! Mom?! She's gonna go get your mom! What? Oh, work! Work!  Perry!  Come on. Ooh, hey, random pounding works. Oh good, we're back on the Perry show. All right, Perry the Platypus. Could you just do me a salute and hold this thing up to the street address in front of- Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! You gotta see something in the kitchen! Come on, come on, come on, come on! Okay, Candace. You think you're so clever, Perry the Platypus. But for the first time in my life I can actually use a self-destruct button that I have installed! Prepare to be vaporized, Perry the Platypus! See, Mom? See, see? What?! But it was right here! I swear there was this machine, and we were tiny, but then we got bigger, Oh, teenagers. and, and Hormones, all it is. Well, that's done. And no comeuppance. Why do I feel so empty?"
"Now this is a ship. My, she's yar. Is she ready to sail? She's shipshape in Bristol fashion. What does that mean? What does ""yar"" mean? Phineas! Ferb! I need your help! Hey, Baljeet. I thought your friend Mishti was visiting from India. She is. Butâ She is different now. Different how? Did she turn into a werewolf or something? No, she is a girl! She was probably a girl the whole time. Let me explain. Four years ago, back in India, we used to have such a good time together. Give it to me! No, no, no! Me! Give it to me! No, me, me! I'm open! And she never ever showed any kind of sign of werewolfism at all? If we could just stick to the topic, please. Five minutes and forty-eight seconds ago, back in my home Baljeet! The Patels are here! Coming! Mishtâ âaah! Hi, Baljeet! So after hiding in the bathroom, I jumped out the window and came over here as quickly as possible. I do not even know how to act in front of a girl! I do not even know what girls like. Hmm. Isn't it like, ""sugar and spice, and everything nice""? That is what they are made of. I do not want to build one. Duh! You know, I think what girls really like is romance. Romance? Yeah. We learned all about it in this movie we watched last night. Dinner, music, candlelight, and all on a romantic cruise over the ocean blue. Lucky for you, we happen to have a ship right here. Ferb, cancel the giant bottle. I know what we're gonna do today. Hey, where's Perry? Uh, you're gonna have to pick it up a little, sir. They're starting to boo. I've gotta hear, Carl. Ooh, he's here! Agent P, sorry about the delay. Doofenshmirtz is at it again, he's been frequenting hobby shops and Well, Carl's worried sick. Aren't you, Carl? Well, not really sick, sir. I am a little concerned. What did I say about contradicting me in front of the agents? Sorry, sir. So, that's pretty much it. You can go, Agent P. That's it. Okay, Carl. Baljeet? Aren't you in the bathroom? I climbed out the window. Oh, I thought it was a Mother, please! May I just speak to Mishti? Hey, Baljeet. What's up? Uh, if you do not already have plans for this upcoming afternoon Actually, I had plans with you. Oh, okay! Well, if you are busy Oh, no, Baljeet! What did you have in mind? Well, some friends of mine have planned ""an all-inclusive luxury cruise around Danville Harbor"". A boat ride? Cool! I will go get my stuff. ""Highlights of the evening will include a romantic candlelit dinner withâ"" Oh, she's gone. I just wish Jeremy was more romantic. You know, like Romeo-and-Juliet romantic, but without all the dying. Ahoy, Candace! Yeah, Stacy, I'm gonna have to call you back. Hey, Mom. Candace, make it quick. I'm in the middle of something. Phineas and Ferb are leaving on a cruise ship, but I don't even know where they're going! I can hardly hear you. What-What's this about a ship? Are you at the harbor? No, I'm at home! Wait, the harbor! That's where they're going! I'll bust them there. Was that Candace on the phone? Yeah. She probably doesn't know we're in the living room. So, what do you think? You know, you're right. It does kind of sound like the ocean.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. You like my scale model? I even put my own little building in here, look. Look, there it is! Ah, yes, my home. I can still remember the day I bought it. Flashback! My real estate agent had already shown me hundreds of other places within my budget. But none of them were acceptable. That was until he showed me this magnificent building, with a view all the way to the ocean! But the first night I realized why the price was so cheap. All night long, foghorns from passing ships would sound. I couldn't understand why all these ships were there until one day, I turned my neck to the right, about forty-five degrees, and there, I saw it. The Danville Lighthouse! It was attracting the ships like moths to a flame. So, what I'm going to do is, going to move the light house all the way over here, to the other side of town! The boats will follow it, like moths following a Have I already used that, uh That metaphor? I think I How about like, bees to, um Whatever bees go to, or flies to Oh, let's just go with the moth thing. For your safety, Mishti, I invite you to hold on to the rail. It appears to be very clean, which I know is important to you now that you are a girl. Huh? Hey, Isabella. What'cha doin'? The Fireside Girls and I just got our Shrimp Net Repair Patches. What are you doing? A romantic cruise. You wanna come? You want me to come on a romantic cruise with you? Yeah. It'll be fun. Um Okay. (Song: Boat of Romance)  Romance   It's not in the air   It's not on the breeze   And it's not in the trees   And it's not in your hair   It's on the water   So I'll warn you well in advance   If you're not looking for love   Don't set foot on our boat of romance   (On our boat of romance!)   On our boat of romance!  I knew it! Time to call Mom. Candace? I can't understand a word you're saying. Candace, if you're feeding the geese again, I hope you're not wearing a tube top. Do you mind? Now it sounds like a spaceship. Okay, let me try. Well, they've gotta come back sometime, and when they do, I'll be standing right here ready to bust them. Would you get off of me? Wow, Phineas! This is so romantic! You think this is romantic? Wait 'til you see what else I have planned! Yes! Behold! A romantic candlelit dinner for two! Oh, Phineas! Ferb, show the happy couple to their table. Here is our table, Mishti. Is this okay with you? It is not too drafty, is it? It will be fine, Baljeet. Cue music! Classical music. Very romantic. Cue rose petals! Cue 'pid! Hey, everyone. I'm wearing a diaper. So Do I know romance or what? What. I said, do I know romance orâ I heard you. This food is really good. Do you not think so? Uh, yes I guess so. Subtle, yet pungent. Yes, very. Hey, can you pass me one of those bad boys? Uh, look, Baljeet. I appreciate all this, but, uh I just want to hang out, like we used to. But, uh, are you sure you do not want to hear more music? Did somebody say music? Ohhh! I've attached rockets to the lighthouse, so when I push this button, it will fly to the other side of town. The ships will follow, and then I can finally get some sleep! Well, I suppose I should've put some sort of steering mechanism on it, but, um Live and learn. Perry the Platypus? How did you escape? What's that? Ooh! Oh! I guess I walked into that one. Aw, man, I worked all weekend on that! Oh, look, this staple makes a perfect little chimney. I hope Perry the Platypus appreciates all this hard work. He won't. I know! You know what, Perry the Platypus? I think it's time for you to go. That's right, go on! Your services are no longer required. The lighthouse is gone, and there's nothing you can do about it. So you might as well run back to Major Monogram and tell him you lost this one.  Perry!  Did I mention how nice the weather is? Several times. Well It-It is nice. I don't get it. We've tried everything in that romantic movie but nothing seems to work. The orchestra, the petals, the love song. The only other thing they did in that movie was sink the ship. Hmm. That ought to do it. I must apologize, the ship sinking was not in the brochure. Wow. Is this romance or what? Phineas, where are the life preservers? We don't have any! What?! We've got ""Fun Preservers""! Hit it, Ferb. Well, that's the end of this diaper. Okay, everybody. To the Fun Preservers! Oh, oh! Cupids first! (Song: Gotta Make Summer Last)  Summer, I love summer   Give me that summer time   Summer, every 86,400 seconds that pass   Gotta make summer last!  So you are telling me that even though you are now a girl, you still like to have fun just like in the old days? Of course, Baljeet. Then you would not mind if I went like this? Not if you do not mind if I go like this! Hey, this romance stuff was fun. We should do it more often. Yes. Yes, we should. Hey, there you are, Perry. All right, you guys better tell me what you were up to on that cruise ship. Just whipping up a little romance for Baljeet and his friend, Mishti. You created romance? Yeah. And Did it work? Looks like it. They seem to be having a great time. Do you think you could do that for me and Jeremy? I don't see why not. Candace, I love having some kid's feet in my face as much as the next guy. But how about we just go grab a Slushy Burger?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   After hours  Ah Finally. A good night's sleep. Hmm? Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
"Okay, what the heck is that sound?! Come on, Ferb. I know what we're not gonna do today! We're not gonna figure out what we are gonna do today as long as that noise keeps up! If you don't stop that racket, I am so gonna bust you empty backyard? Candace, stop trying to bust your backyard! Jeremy! Yes? Yes! We'll see you in a bit. Thanks. No, you get off the phoneâ Hello? So, what's the scoop? Jeremy just invited us to his friend's concert! Oh, I don't know Lately I've been feeling like a third wheel around you guys. What? No. I always saw it more like Jeremy and I were two wheels, and you were separate, on a unicycle all,  ""Doo-doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo doo-doo-doot""  Wait a minute! I just thought of something. Jeremy's never given me a nickname! I refer you to the chart. Oh, goody. The chart. See, Jeremy only calls me ""Candace,"" and nothing else. When a guy makes you his girlfriend, he comes up with a nickname for you. A pet name like, ""baby,"" ""honey,"" ""Peg-Leg Pete!"" His own personal stamp! Maybe you should just let whatever happens happen. You know, naturally. Naturally? Where is that coming from? Baljeet's house? For such a mild-mannered kid, we wind up here for a lot of weird reasons. Ah, I wish I had some earplugs. Thanks dude! So, uh What up 'Jeet? Oh, uh Hello, my friends. I did not hear you come in. Is everything okay? If by okay, you mean that my life is a meaningless, black cauldron of swirling failure Then yes, everything is groovy. That's not at all what I meant by ""okay."" I signed up for a class called ""Summer Rocks,"" believing it was a geology course. It turned out to be a rock-and-roll camp. And no matter how hard I study, I just do not rock! I could actually get an eâ Anâ Oh, I cannot even say that terrible letter. 'Ineas! 'Erb! What am I going to do? Well, that was an interesting sound you were getting out of your guitar. I think you'll be just fine! That was not my guitar. That was me. I call it, ""The Fail Wail."" Baljeet. Baljeet! Whoa! Hey! Thank you. We can show you how to rock! Really? Absolutely. Hey, I think the Fail Wail scared Perry off! Ticket, please. Right this way! Enjoy the show. Evil. Wait. You. Await. Evil. Awaits. Cut, cut! Oh, come on! Sorry, Agent P. Carl's been taking some film classes and now believes I'm stifling his creativity as my cameraman. Camera artist. Seems Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying baby supplies all over town. One could only imagine what he's doing. Two can discuss it between themselves, more than two is frankly a waste of our resources. Good luck, Agent P! Okay, once more with feeling! The agency isn't paying for these classes, are they Carl? I have read every book on the history of rock music. Gosh, Baljeet. Rock and roll isn't about books! It's about letting go and having fun! Rock and roll is a way for you to tell the world how you feel! Feel about what? Expressing yourself! I mean, what do you do when you're angry? Math. Okay, what about when you're sad? Math! Happy? Ma-ath! So every feeling you have makes you want to do math? I do not know if it is so much cause and effect. I do a lot of math! The feelings come and go. What kind of concert is this? It's the Summer Rocks graduation concert. Jeremy's friend, Coltrane is an instructor. Look, there they are! Oh, that's Coltrane. He's really cute! Hmm, I guess he is. Hey, wait a minute. You like Coltrane! Well, I've never actually talked to him before, but Quick, what should we do? Hide? No. Wait, pretend you're a talent scout. Ooh, here! I think I have a fake mustache on me! Let's just go over and say hi. What do you think it means when a girl leaves a fake mustache at your house? Hi guys! Hey gals! Ha! ""Gals."" Yeah, that's me, ""the gal."" Gosh, when did you start calling me that? Hi, I'm Stacy. Hey, how ya doin', Stacy? I'm Coltrane. I like your hair. Thanks. I like your bow. Let me show you round. Cool! Hey, Coltrane and Stacy That was easy. What?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Aw, congratulations, it's a platypus! What do you think of my new Nanny-inator? Nice, huh? You know what time it is? Evil story time! See, I wrote my new evil scheme in pop-up book format. Once upon a time, yesterday, like a quarter to six, I was watching a nature documentary, and I learned how before a baby's born, its constant companion is the soothing, steady beat of its mother's heart. Even after it's born, the sound of the mother's heartbeat continues to be a safe, calming beacon to a growing child, in some cases up until their early thirties. Suddenly, I was struck with a brilliant idea, to project the sound of my own heartbeat across the city, causing all the babies to believe that I am their leader! Like the Pied Piper, except with babies. I will have a mighty baby army, and no one would fight back, 'cause, you know they're babies! Finally, the time came for me to tell you my evil plan in pop-up book form, and Iâ Oh, Iâ I'm sorry, theâ The book seems to have caught up to us in real time. Anyway, behold! The Bum-Bum-inator! Rock's not about getting good grades and following the rules, it's about rebellion! It's about using music to express your true feelings and emotions! Just play how you feel! Baljeet, that'sâ That's just an A chord. I feel like I want an A! This is gonna be harder than we thought. Do you think you could teach me how to play the bass? Let's see if you have big bass player hands. Ooka! Ooka! Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooka! Uh, excuse me for a second. Ooka! I have to go talk to my friend in the bushes. Ooka! Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooka! Cool! I gotta go get this show started. Save me a dance? Coo-coo-coo-coo-cooo! Hooka! Ooka! Ooka-ooka-ooka-ooka! Eeka-eeka-eeka! What are you doin'? How's it going with you and Coltrane? I think it's going really well! He asked me to save him a dance! He did? What do you think he meant by that? I'm pretty sure he meant he wants to dance with me. Hmm. Men and their impossible endless riddles! So how's it going with you? Has Jeremy nicknamed you yet? No Maybe Jeremy just isn't the kind of guy who nicknames people. Huh. You could be right. Look, here he comes now! Yo, T-Bone! Hey, Clammo! What up, Sassy Miss K? Momo! Binkie Hi Candace, where you been? I'll, uh I'll see you later. Catch ya later, Staceroo. What? Oh, I do not know about this! You'll be great! Just remember what we practiced. Follow the beat and let your feelings out through the music! I am about to let my feelings out through these pleather pants! Okay, I'm almost ready, Perry the Platypus. This monitor takes my pulse and transmits it to the Bum-Bum-inator, which will then broadcast my heartbeat to all the babies in the Tri-State Area. See? You might say I'm wearing my sleeve on myâ I- I mean my heart is wearing, uh Never mind, whatever, you get it! And now, the band you've all been waiting for The Baljeatles! Hey, cool beat, Buford. Uh Thanks? What's up, Baljeet? Your band is waiting for you onstage. I can't do it! I just do not know how to rock! I know I am going to get a bad grade! Wait, what are you talking about, ""grades""? This is Summer Rocks! There are no grades. No grades? Oh, so it is pass/fail? No! We use a free-floating curriculum to encourage kids to just, rock out and have fun! I do not believe this! I wasted all this time in a class without grades?! Ohhhhh! If only there were some other kind of outlet for me to express these feelings, to my like-minded peer group! Pardon me! I want to try something! (Song: Gimme a Grade)  Oh yeah!   I have got something to say!   I have been burned by vague lesson plans and a free-floating curriculum!   I like my rules, baby, etched in stone   'Cause you know I am going to stick to them!   Can I get a syllabus, a little discipline?   Judge me on a scale from A to F!   You wasted all my time learning how to rhyme   Then left me hangin' from a treble clef!   Somebody gimme a grade!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   I need the man keeping me down!   Somebody gimme a grade!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   Is there a red pen in this town?   Somebody gimme a grade!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   I already said it   I need some extra credit today!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   And make it an A!  Okay, now to relax and keep my heart rate slow and steady, you know 'Cause too much excitement would cause my heart to beat too fast and short out the Bum-Bum-inator. Change time! Change time! Perry the Platypus, stop chasing me, I'm supposed to keep my heart rate down!  Oh, I am so upset!   I am stone cold, honor roll   I won't be told how to vent!   I won't cry or sigh, I'm here to testify   Up with the establishment!   My parents understand me, put conformity inside of me which I can help the system out!   I ain't gonna waste my summer taking beatings from my drummer   Put a mic in front of me and I'll shout!   Gimme a grade!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   You know I'm gonna wreck the curve!   Somebody gimme a grade!   (Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)   The only letter I deserve!   Somebody gimme a grade!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   This isn't a request, I demand there be a test today!   (Somebody gimme a grade, somebody gimme a grade!)   Gimme a grade!  Uh-oh. Not good. Curse you, Perry theâ Wait, is that the Baljeatles? Just call me ""Can't-Dance Flynn."" Okay, that's your new nickname. Wait, what? No! I'm not supposed to nickname myself! You're supposed to come up with it! You don't even care enough to try! Hey, wait a second! I call you Candace, but not because I don't care enough to come up with a cute nickname for you! I call you Candace 'cause I happen to really like that name. You do? Of course I do! 'Cause it's your name. That was easy. Well, Baljeet, if it means anything, I'd give you an A+ in rock. No. That means almost nothing."
"Dad, I need a car. I can't keep riding on the back of your scooter every time I go someplace. It's totally embarrassing. Hey, sweetheart. How'd you like to take a ride on a real bike? She's sixteen! Ooh! Yeah! You know, ever since I installed the Away-inator on my helmet, driving is fun again! Hey, Ferb, check this out. The Super-Duper Megastore is the largest supplier of everything in the Tri-State Area. Heh, I know what we're gonna do today! Well, I'm gonna buy Jeremy a gift. It's the anniversary of the very first time Jeremy and I went to Slushy Burger. He spilled a cheese dog on me and mustard got all over the place. He was so sweet. Hm. Tough one. I don't think they make a card for that. So Mom, what are you gonna get at the store? I need a 25 pound tub of mayonnaise, and 80 pounds of potatoes to make potato salad for the bridge club. Wow. That's a lot of potato salad. Remember to meet me back at the car in three hours. Wow. Think of it, Ferb. You can whistle that again. And you get to go to the pet-sitter's, Perry. If you want a car, you're going to have to prove to me that you're responsible, that you can do things by yourself. How could I do that when I'm always on the back of your scooter? It's a conundrum, isn't it? Psst. Agent P. Agent P. Down here. It's the new dog bone communicator. Pretty clever, huh? I thought of it, Agent P. Carl, I'm trying to use the bone. Anyway, Agent P, we've learned that Dr. Doofenshmirtz is shopping for parts to build another one of his outlandish devices. Put a tail on him. You look fabulous! So I've got to find some way to prove to you I'm responsible. There must be an easier way to earn a car. You know what they say about taking the easy way. What do they say? Well, I could tell you, but that would be taking the easy way, and you know what they say about that. Ooh, look! Pizzazium Infinionite! What's that? You've heard of hydrogen. You may know boron. But of all the elements on the periodic table, none is more fascinating and less abundant than Pizzazium Infinionite. Pizzazium Infinionite was first discovered by fortune hunters fifty years ago in the year 1894. No one is really sure what it does, but look to the future for hover vehicles powered by Pizzazium Infinionite, in the world of tomorrow! See? That's what it is. Where did you get theâ It's gone! Someone took the last one! What luck! Pizzazzium Infinionite! That science prize is as good as mine! So why am I here again? Because, as a person of superior intellect, I require an angry wall of meat to protect my science project. Angry wall of meat, huh? Yeah, I can do that. Oh, great. Now I have to scour this whole place and find the Pizzazzium and probably have to wrench it out of the hands of some random shopper. Wait, Dad. I can do this for you. I can go find thisâ this Pizzazzium thing and prove to you that I can be responsible. That I can do things on my own. Then you can get me my own car, right? I don't know. Are you sure you canâ Of course I can. I'm me. It'll be a piece of cake. We'll see. I'm not hearing a no. I'm not saying a yes. Here, you can take this Pizzazzium locator. It'll help. How am I gonna find that one perfect gift in this humongous store? Hey, isn't Jeremy into camping? Yeah. So maybe a pocket knife, or a fishing lure, or a compound bow. Take that, apple on kid's head! He said he needed a lantern! Yeah, a lantern's good. And then I will start my own foundation to Are you not hearing me? What? Buford hungry. I really have to rethink having you as my wall of meat. Too big. Too small. Oh, I don't want just get him any old lantern. You can't expect the perfect gift to just drop out of the sky. But Whoa. It's perfect! It's all futuristic-y, and cool, and it dropped out of the sky! Well, I guess I stand corrected. When Jeremy looks into its bright glow, he'll think of mâ Hey, what's this? Hey buddy, watch where you'reâ Say, you look fabulous. Haven't I seen you somewhere before? No need to get huffy, you ran into me! Ahhh. You know Ferb, I think I know what I want to do every day. Well, that was easy. I gotta get it.

Hey, watch where you'reâ Oh, great, now this thing is broken, and they've got the Pizzazziuâ Look, thanks for your help, but I can do this on my own, okay? That lantern was the perfect gift. Woo-hoo! Buford and Baljeet! How did they get it? (Song: I'm Me)  I can do it, I can run, I can hunt you down   You can try but you can't stop me 'cause I'm gainin' ground   I'm light on my feet and I'm quick to the punch   I had a heavy breakfast but a real light lunch   I'm a raging bonfire   A cherry bomb   I'm me   I'm rough-and-tumble, I'm the one to beat   I'm a fresh coat of blacktop burnin' at your feet   I've got a poisonous sting, when I rain I pour   I'm the best of the best, I'm the soup du jour   I'm smooth as glass and sharp as a tack   I'm me   I'm the last and best stick of gum in the pack   I'm me   I'm a strong woman, fast-talkin', big bad dog-walkin'   Hifalutin', drum-beatin', foot-stompin', corn-poppin'   Speedy locomotive that just won't stop!

I'm me!   I'm me!   I'm me!  Ferb, you've gotta try this chair! I can't feel my brain! Ugh, I hope nobody sees me in here. Ferb, honey, aren't you a little old to be playing in the ball pit? Yes. Yes, I am. Okay, then. Your name is Ferb? Well, yes. It's short forâ Oh, here it is. Thanks, Ferb! See you around! Push button, start mower. Does this really work? I will take that! Ferb, my fingers look just like snakes! Oh, it's one of those 3D things. I can hardly see theâ Oop, there it is. Ferb! Check it out! They do make a card for a spilled cheese dog with mustard. Well, Ferb, you certainly know how to show a girl a good time! I've gotta get this to my dad immediately. Whoa! Well, that worked. I got it! I got it! I got it! Excuse me, sir. You know you have to pay for this. I was! I was going to pay! Tell it to the judge. Don't worry, guys, we'llâ We'll get this all straightened out. Vaâ Vanessa! Vanessâ No, no. You can't take me, I don't have anyone to curse! Whoa, Mom. Do you think you found everything you need? I think I have enough to tide over the bridge club. That's a lot of potato salad. Well, time to find out where they dragged Dad off to. Guess that car will have to wait. Oh, yeah. Thanks. Did I miss something? Thanks, Ferb."
"Is it here yet? Sorry, boys. Not today. Aw, rats. Oh! Wait, boys. I almost forgot. Your mom's Penny Shopper. Hey! When are you two gonna move that stupid box out of the doorway? Box? When did that come? The delivery guy brought it while you two were camping out in the mailbox. Oh, man. I can't believe it's here! Finally, the world-famous X-ray vision glasses. This is gonna be great! Whoa! We got totally ripped-off! Ferb, let me see that comic again. Oh, for crying out loud! ""Amazing illusion""? ""Fool your friends""? ""Does not actually provide X-ray vision"". Oh, man, this is a rip-off! It's just like the body building course we got last summer. And I was so looking forward to looking through things. Ferb, that's it! I know what we're gonna today! Oh, my gosh! Are you the cutest thing ever? Aw, you're so adorable! I could just eat you up. Not literally, but you know what I mean. Hey, where's Perry? Agent P, Doofenshmirtz is up to his usual shenanigans, but, we have a more serious problem. There's a rouge agent on the loose, and he's in your area. Carl is working with our field agents, to create a composite sketch. Finished, sir! Carl? You said you could draw! I'm sorry, Agent P. In the meanwhile, he may try to find one of your secret passages and infiltrate your lair where he could hack into our mainframe. So, be on the lookout for any suspicious characters.  Perry!  Look, Ferb. There's Perry. Maybe that's where he disappears to all the time. Well, if he got himself up there, he can get himself down. Anyway, we've got the frames and the polycarbonate lens solution. Now what we need is something that really improves eyesight. Hey, I know! Oh, Ferb, you're way ahead of me. Agent P, we've hired a professional artist and got much better results. We've identified the rogue agent as Dennis. He's a mercenary for hire and a master of disguise. You need to stop him at all costs. First, I'm going to name you Mr. Cutie-Patootie. Then we'll give you a complete makeover, and teach you some cool tricks. You stay put while I find you a new stylish outfit. Let's see what we got here. What am I doing with a scepter? Huh. Next! Leopard headbands are so last year. Ooh, here's some of my doll clothes! Uh, let's skip the tiara. What is this? Leg warmers? Who wears leg warmers? I definitely don't. Mr. Cutie-Patootie? I finally foundâ Get away from him! I don't want your blandness to rub off. Aw, poor Mr. Cutie-Patootie. Don't mind him. Once I'm done making you over, you're going to be new alpha pet. I know! Matching shoes! I found it! These shoes should complete the outfit. ""Ah, Perry the Platypus! How unexpected for you to burst in on my nefarious"" Nefariâ? No, it'sâ It's too much, even for me. Perry the Platypus is due any second. Hey, it's getting a little late. Where is he? Oh, who needs him? He never even does anything until after I tell him my plans. He just stands there like a potted plant. It'sâ In factâ Ah, Planty the Potted Plant. How unexpected! I'd invite you to foil my latest scheme, but I can see you're all tied up. You see, I don't even need Perry the Platypus. Mom's just got back from the grocery store, so we ought to have plenty of carrots for our X-ray glasses. Thank you very much! Oh, actually, Candace, we need those. Oh, really? For your stupid X-ray glasses? Hey! They're not stuâ Do you know what this is? Uh Is it not a rabbit? This is an actual living creature that uses carrots for food instead of science experiments. So, why is he wearing a tutu? He likes it! Don't worry, Mr. Cutie-Patootie. They're just jealous. Come on. Maybe Isabella has some carrots. Okay. Let's start with simple tricks. Sit. Roll over! Do the Worm! Now the Robot. Great! Wow, you must really like carrots. What theâ? Oh! A bunny rabbit. Candace must have gotten a new pet. Well, Planty the Potted Plant, since you're just hanging around Let me demonstrate the brilliant evil-losity of my latest invenâ Ugh. You see? See, that's what I'm talking about. Ever since those condos next door started allowing pets, it's been driving me bonkers! All day and all night with the barking, barking, barking! Oh, that is why I created my latest masterpiece of evil, the giant Dog-Biscuit-inator. Thank you! Thank you for making my point for me! Now, I'll cover it with an irresistible gravy coating, and then it will take off and soar through town, getting all the dogs to chase after it until they follow it, right off the edge of the Tri-State area! Well, Planty the Potted Plant, pretty clever, eh? Don't give me that look. Prepare to launchâ Hey, how did you do that? Ow! Ow! All right, come out in the open where I canâ Ow! (Song: Quirky Worky Song) Stomp harder, Ferb! This carrot juice is gotta be really concentrated. Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Just waiting for the concentrated carrot extract to mix with the super heated optical polymers. Now I dip the frames into the X-ray vision solution. It may take a couple of hours to set properly. Or just five minutes in my Quicky-Bake Oven. Fireside Girls are always prepared. Looks like they're ready. Here goes nothing. Oh, no! Hey, that sounds like it's coming from my house. Mom, what's wrong? I lost my wedding ring! Okay, Mom, what did you've been doing since you last saw it? Uh, si, si, si. Uh, I was fixing some lunch, then I washed the dishes. Dishes, huh? This looks like a job for X-ray vision glasses. I found it! Oy, thank you, Phineas. Uh Where is it? Down in the drain pipe under the sink. We'll have it out for you in a jiff. Quick, Ferb! We need a 14-inch pipe wrench, a blowtorch, and a jar of mayonnaise. Ooh. That's very sweet of you boys, but Iâ I think I'll call my regular plumber. He's bonded. Okay, suit yourself. The glasses work great! This is gonna be fun. (Song: X-Ray Eyes)  They say that beauty's just skin deep   But I've got a brand new perspective   Your skeleton is symmetrical   And your vascular system's effective   You can't keep secrets from me   'Cause I can always see it   With my X-ray eyes!   I got a brand new way of looking at life   An altogether different visual spectrum   Sometimes photons behave like a wave   But they're particles when you reflect 'em   But that don't bother me   'Cause either way I see it   With my X-ray eyes!   Oh, with my X-ray eyes!   Oh, with my X-ray eyes!  Looks our X-ray vision glasses have passed all the quality control tests. Good thing, because we're stacking up quite a pile of orders. Excellent. It's time to order a big old truck load of carrots. Mr. Cutie-Patootie?! Where are you? MR. CUTIE-PATOOTIE! Intruder alert. Intruder alert. Uh, hello, Agentâ No! Not you! Agent P, you've got to stop him before heâ Access granted. Yes, ma'am, you heard me right. I need three metric tons of your highest grade carrots delivered A.S.A.P. Why, yes. Yes, I am. Have you seen Mr. Cutie-Patootie? I can't find him anywhere. Well, did you check the backyard? He might be there. Hmm. How about the kitchen? Well, Planty the Potted Plant. You have proven yourself quite the adversary. Why don't we just call this one a draw? I'm kind of pooped. Ah! Curse you, Planty the Potted Plant! Good work, Agent P. You don't suppose he could've run away? Don't worry. I'm sure he'll turn up. Hey, what happened to all the carrots? One minute there's a backyard full of carrots, I turn around for half a minute and, Poof! â now they're gone! Welcome to my world. Wow. That must be really annoying. Oh, there you are, Perry. At least you're still around. Do you like wearing pink? On behalf of the entire Agency, I like to thank you for your valiant service in one of our darkest hours. Planty the Potted Plant, welcome to the Agency."

Thank you, sir. So, where are they? I'll go get them. Agent P, you'reâ You're here. The, uh, Tri-State Area is mired in gloom and, we believe Doofenshmirtz is behind it. We thought he retired the Gloom-inator, so, this one is a big question mark. I'm sure you'll know what to do, Agent P. So, Carl, how are we doing on those pants? Did you want the ones with the triangles or the imitation paint splatters? Triangles. And make it snappy. I got the urge to pop and lock. Let's hurry up so we don't miss our appointment.

That's a good one, you know, because he'sâ He's got the oneâ You know? And his little friend, the intern, is Dr. Coconut. Yeah. Sometimes I wish I didn't know so much.

The way I see it, you prevented me from going to the spa, almost killed me with a jackhammer, dropped a wall on me, I've got gypsum in my hair, and basically wasted my whole day. But, you did it for love. So, it's okay. Really? Yeah, remember that time in the third grade? You mean when you glued that hamster to my hair just to impress Billy Clarke? Yeah. It's like that. Ah Billy Clarke So, I guess we're even. Oh My Gosh It's not plugged in. Hey, sis. Wow. You seem pretty wiped out. Looks like you two could use a spa day. A backyard spa? You guys are so bustâ Yeah.

"Okay. Well, we finished the superstructure, but what we really need now is a tool that would fuse wood and metal out of a molecular level. Technology like that is twenty years away. You will need a time machine. Luckily, I have been working on a design. I have not filled about all the quantum physics yet, but if you give me a couple of daysâ Or we could just use the one at the museum. There is a time machine at the museum? Yeah, we took it back to the Mesozoic Era. You got to hang out with dinosaurs? Yeah, earlier this summer. Hmm. Well, thank you for inviting me. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Or I should say, I know what we're gonna do twenty years from today. Hey, guys! What'cha doin'? We're time-traveling. Can I come? Why not? Yes, Stacy. They're building something out there. But I decided the problem is, I always jump the gun. So I'm gonna wait 'til just the right moment toâ Hello? Hello? They're on the move! I'll bust them now! I'll bust them now! Twenty years forward, and away we go! So, that's it! They're time-traveling again! And the best part is, they have to return to this exact spot. And I'll be standing right here with Mom to bust them when they do. Actually, right over here. I'll be, uh crushed by the machine if I was standing there. And I'm talking to nobody. Here we are! Twenty years in the future. Isabella, wait. You're the only one who we can trust to watch the machine. He trusts me Oops! Yeah, I hate cleaning that thing anyway. Hey. I see the museum finally had that new wing. And would you look how Danville's changed. Hey, mobile homes! Flying cars! Jet packs! Hey, look at that! That looks like It is! It's Candace twenty years older! I almost didn't recognize her. She looks so relaxed. And those must be her kids in the yard. I can't believe you, Xavier and Fred. You two are so lazy. It's summer vacation and you're wasting it! You guys never do anything! I'm sitting under this digital tree. I'm sitting next to him. Do you see your two sons out there doing nothing?

Good luck with that llama legislation. and yesterday, I was sitting on the left. And I was sitting next to him on the right. We like to mix it up. It is them! I bet they traveled here from the past.

The end game is finally here. Oh, wait. I-I moved in one piece. I'll just put it back. So, what spectacular adventures have you got lined up for this summer? I'm sitting under this digital tree. And I'm sitting next to him. That's it? But it's summer vacation! And you're free to do anything! Yeah, but this is the future and everything's already been done. The Stone Age was once the future, as was the Middle Ages. Creativity and invention never end! There's a whole bunch of stuff you can do this summer.

No! Wait! We're too late. Mom! I've always loved this old bone. Mom! You never saw them and you still never see them! It's unfair! It's unfair! It's unfair! Candace, you're a grown woman.

Oh, hi, Candace. Mom! Mom! Look, Candace. They're putting a new bone on display. Oh, you missed it again! Hi, Mom! Oh, hi, boys. Wow, imagine the size of the creature that bone came from. I know, huh? No, can't you see? They're time-traveling! This obsession with the boys has gone on too long. You need to stop. I won't stop! Never, never, never! And I was so close to busting them.

I'll set it for a day I know I can bust the boys. Back to the first day of that summer. The day they built the rollercoaster. Sometimes it's here, sometimes it's not. Why do I care? Phineas and Ferb got a rollercoaster? You think we could get a discount if we bring the flier? Maybe we better take it. Here! Look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy! I told you! And you're not crazy because? The poster's missing, right? Follow me. Oh, my stars! Phineas and Ferb made that?! It's horribly unsafe and dangerous! Hello! Police?! Fire department?! Army?! Air force?! Marines?! Anyone?! Save my sons! It's no use! It's no use, we are doomed! This is Base to Chopper One, some kids built a rollercoaster through downtown. Roger that. I'm alive! Roger, got the kids, bringing 'em down now. Phineas! Ferb! You two are in so much trouble! Yes! Yes! My work here is done. Back to the future. The first day on the job, and I'm already seeing things. Oh, thank goodness. It's great to be back home? Welcome to Danville? Uh-oh. I can't believe this is Danville. Hello? What happened to the museum? Didn't you get the new ShmirtzMail? It's the new doofen-law. Law number six million and seven. ""All museums that aren't about Doofenshmirtz are to be dismantled."" Hey, why aren't you wearing your lab coat? Uh I've gotta go see my children. Children? There are no children allowed anymore. How long have I been away? That's strange. Joe's, Joe's, Joe's, Joe's Hi, Joe. Hello, Joe. Pardon me, Joe. You haven't seen my wife Joe, or my friends Joe and Joe? Uh No? Thanks anyway, Joe. Why is everyone named Joe? Why else? So Emperor Doofenshmirtz need not bother remembering names. And who isâ I said too much. I said too much! Who the heck is Doofenshmirtz?! That's odd. I've got to find out what happened in the last twenty years. Our glorious dystrophy began one summer afternoon when two local boys were caught building and riding a dangerous rollercoaster. The rightful reaction by concerned parents groups was to stop all creativity in young people before someone got hurt. Everything fun and unique was gleefully banned! Dangerous swing sets were re-made into dismal hospital beds. Coloring books were colored in ahead of time. And inside the lines. Eventually children themselves were child-proof and stored away until adulthood. Yes, oppressive beauty and happiness were gratefully replaced by the glimmering cesspool we wallow in today. A demoralized Tri-State Area cried out to be oppressed, and that cry was answered by one hero Emperor Doofenshmirtz! Ugh, get back to work! So this is all my fault! I've got to stop this. Excuse me, Joe. Lab coats must be worn at all times. Sir, excuse, Iâ A woman just ran past your statue there without basking in your awful glory. Oh, Joe, you're such a tattletale. Well, yeah. That's my job description. Tattletale. Quiet! I need to address the populous. Attention, underlings! People often ask me, ""Doof, how does it feel to wield such absolute power?"" Well, I'll tell ya. (Song: Charmed Life)  It's been a charmed life   Got all I ever wanted   And I'm not too shy to flaunt it, you see!   It's been a sweet ride   Everyone is genuflectin'   And erecting giant statues of me!   It's like a great lunch   With all you can eat   And I can leave my wallet at home   And everyone pays for me   Because it's compulsory   Or into the stockade they're thrown   Still, I'm a nice guy   How many emperors would always remember your name?  How ya doing, Joe?  I must admit, I   May take quite a lot   But I'll always give you plenty of blame   It's been a sweet ride   Life's a bowl of cherries, and nobody's merrier than me   Because, everyone else is the proletariat   And baby, I'm the bourgeoisie  Look it up, Joe!  Baby!   I'm the bourgeoisie!   Oh, yeah!  Agent P, another failed mission. It's gotten really hard to defeat Doofenshmirtz ever since we swore that oath to obey him. Major Monogram, I've detected a temporal anomaly in quadrant four which means a time machine was recently used there. That's it! Agent P, you've got to get to that time machine and go back to the past, right before that giant tin foil ball put you in a full body cast for eighteen months. That's when Doofenshmirtz got the upper hand and it's been downhill ever since. This is our chance to fix it. Oh, wait! Perry the Platypus. Change of plans. Instead of doing that, DON'T! All right, see you later. Remember the oath! Curse that oath! What? Where's the time machine? Excuse me, where's everything from the museum? It's all at the city dump, Joe. Let's go. Back to the past, back to the past, back to the past! Looks like this good a spot as any to start a dump. Yeah, works for me. W-Waitâ What? W-Waiâ What? Are you me? But I have to bustâ Change of plans! Come on, I'll explain later. We can't let Candace see us. But I'm Candace! So am I. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom? Mom?! Aw, I was so cute. Why did you stop me? I was just about to bust the boys! No, that's just it. I'm from the future where we did bust the boys. Really? How was it? Was it great? No, it was awful. The future gets all messed upâ Oh, look! So, that's how that happened. Get down! Look, look, look! See?! Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at? No! It's not possible! I'm gonna go get the cart. It was right here, and it was huge! Mom! Wow, that future sounds horrible! Time to go, I've got frozen. It was, trust me. Okay, but coming from anybody but myself, I wouldn't listen. They're gone! Let's get back to the time machine and get out of here. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Okay, that was weird. Well this machine is shot. How do we get back? Phineas and Ferb. Okay, we're here. Are you happy now, Candace? Yes! See, Mom! I told you they weren't there! Oh, hi, boys. Hi, Mom. Come on, Candace, help me with the groceries. But-but-but-but-but-but-but-but Let's go. But-but-but-but-but But-but-but Hey Phineas, that was great. Way too cool. That was awesome! Can we do it again? Sorry, only one ride per customer. That was great, Phineas. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Remember? Three, two, one. Wait! Candace! You're grown up, and there's two of you! Phineas, we're from the future. Two alternative futures. One that's good and one that's terrible. Someone should really fix that. We did. So the bad future no longer exists? Right. Well if it doesn't exist, shouldn't the Candace from the bad future cease to exist too? Oh, darn. Guys, I need your help. The time machine I arrived in is smashed to pieces. I'm stuck here unless you guys can build me one. Ferb, isn't there an old time machine in the Museum of National History? Yes, that's the one you'll fix later this summer when we go to the museum. It's the one I took back from the future but now it's destroyed. Okay. So the future time machine gets destroyed, that means the one here in the present is rarin' to go! We'll fix it, take you to the future, bring back the time machine, and unfix it again. So it'll be ready to be fixed when we go to the museum next time. Phineas, I'm a fully grown woman and I didn't understand any of that. Just trust me. Come on! Wow. Rollercoaster ride, now this. Bonus. Wait a minute. You sure you can fix this time machine? Don't worry, Candace. We're almost done. Candace? Time machine? Aha! Candace, meet Candace. Awesome! I finally have proof! I'll take my older self, bring her to Mom, Mom will see the boys have invented some kind of time machine, and they'll be busted! Oh! I love you, me! Come on! Let's go! Let's go see Mom! Come on! Wow. Was I always this nuts? Candace, honey, get a hold of yourself. I have no interest in busting the boys anymore. What?! But you're me! You have to want to bust them, because I'm never gonna stop wanting to bust them! You know, sometimes getting what you want isn't what you need. You'll find out as you mature. Ready? ""You'll find out as you mature"". Candace, just relax. Everything works out. Twenty years into the future, here we come! Ugh! Aha! If you won't show my mom what's going on, I'll show your mom! I'm all the proof I need! Candace! We better go and get her. You know that whole space time continuum thing. Mom and Dad's antique store. Yes, it's still here! Ooh, future. Mom! It's me, Candace from the past! I came here in the time machine that Phineas and Ferb borrowed from the museum. You gotta bust them! Honey, what are you talkingâ Candace! You're so young! Mom! You're so ooollll. Don't say it. oooollllllddd. You don't have to say that word. I mean it! ddddd. Mom! You're so old! Hi, boys. Aren't you a little young to be time-travelers? Yes. Yes, we are. A time machine. Does this mean that all those times you told me the boys were up to something, they really were? Yes! Yes, yes! Oh, honey. I am so sorry I didn't believe you. Woo-hoo! I finally caught them! Hello? What? Aren't you going to bust them? Candace, my Phineas and Ferb are thirty years old now. Well, I suppose I could call them, but Phineas is in Switzerland for the award ceremony, and Ferb's still at Camp David for theâ Bust them. Young Phineas and Ferb! I don't think I have jurisdiction over these guys anymore. Ugh! Okay. But officially, on record, they are busted. Right? Sure, Candace. They're busted. Yes! Guys, we've seen how time travel can mess things up big time. So, promise me you won't go into the future again. Yeah. Maybe it is a bad idea. Just think, it's all started because we needed that steel-and-wood fusing tool. Hey, Candace, you never told us. How do Ferb and I turn out? Fantastic. Just keep doing what you're doing, and be nice to your sister. Yeah. Be nice to your sister. You guys coming or what? Where'd you get that? So, that's Uncle Phineas and Ferb as kids? That's right. And that girl looks like Aunt Isabella. Did you hear that? Aunt Isabella! That means I'm gonna marry Phineas. Or Ferb. Let's go. Bye! Looks like everything is back to normal. Wow, Mom, your brothers are so cool. Meanwhile, I'm stuck withâ Hey! Where'd they go? Xavier and Fred, what are you doing? Nothing? See, Mom? They never do anything! Give it a rest, Amanda. Ah, memories. I know, huh? Oh, man! In twenty years you guys are so busted! I guess that's a hollow victory. But it proves you can be busted. So, I'm never gonna give up! Never, never, never! Did I say, ""never?!"" Yes, I did! Never, never, never! Never! Never! Never! Well, at least we know she mellows with age. You got to hang out with dinosaurs? Yeah, earlier this summer. Hmm. Well, thank you for inviting me. Ferb, I know what we we're gonna do today. No, you don't. Here's the wood-and-steel fusing tool you need. Thanks. Hey, you want a soda? Thanks. Well, looks like we don't have to go to the future after all! Some other time, perhaps. I'm watching you!"
"From the PFT studio in marginally attractive downtown Danville, animated live in front of the studio audience, it's the Phineas and Ferb Musical Cliptastic Countdown! And now, our hosts, from opposite ends of the moral, ethical and philosophical spectrum, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and Major Francis Monogram! Hello, Danville! Yes, we're taking a break from our usual hostiliâ Y-You know, I've gotta go back one. Your first name is Frances? Yes. Spelled with an 'i'. Spelled with an 'i'? Wouldn't that be ""Frinces?"" No, F-R-A-N-C-I-S. It's the masculine spelling. Francis? Yes. Anyway, we're not here to discuss my name. We're here because kids all over the world logged on to vote for their favorite Phineas and Ferb music videos. And we're countin' 'em down! Starting with number 10. Are ya ready, Dr. D? Fran, Frances, Franny. Yes, very macho. Ugh! Now you see, this is why I just go by ""Major"". (Song #10: Ready for the Bettys) Ladies and gentlemen, Candace and her best friend, Stacy.

Y-You can't really pull that off. Oh. Roll number nine. I'm just telling you as a friend! (Song #9: Queen of Mars) That's it! You're getting it.  I was just a lonely girl   Looking for a little fun   Though without a friend in the world   I was forced to find a new one   Now I'm the Queen of Mars, I was invisible on Earth   It only took a magic portal to Mars to give me some self-worth   You put a crown on my head   And you all seem to worship me   Well, you don't understand a word I've said   Still you treat me like royalty   'Cause I'm the Queen of Mars, I was invisible on Earth   It only took a magic portal to Mars to give me some self-worth  Whoo-hoo! Follow that music, Ferb. I'm standing here with Cindy, an animated member of our studio audience whoâ Phineas and Ferb rock! Whooo! Okay, then. Let's throw it over to my partner in crime. Not that I actually perpetrate a crime with him of course, I would neverâ Carl! Who wrote these cue cards? Agent M, sir. What? What is that all about? I mean, he's using a typewriter. When was the last time you saw someone using a typewriter? Whatâ What is this, 1987? Well You realize most of the kids watching this show have never even seen a typewriter, right? We're on a budget. Oh, so you went to an antique store Moving on! Number eight, roll tape! Oh-oh, so you got tape, you're not just using film, orâ or-or hand shadows. (Song #8: Ain't Got Rhythm)  So, you're saying that you don't have rhythm   But listen what you're doing right there   With that stamp and a book, you got a real nice hook    Sounds to me like you've got rhythm to spare   I have no idea what you're talking about   I have as much rhythm as that chair   What happened to me was a tragedy   But I don't have to be a millionaire   Look, I got a sweet deal going on here   I got all the books that I can read   All these sweet old ladies and this carpet from the 80's   What more could a librarian need?  Ssh!  Besides, I ain't got rhythm   No, I ain't got rhythm   Said I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   You're kidding me right   Y-You're kidding me   Don't you see what you were doing right then?   That's a wicked groove you were starting to move   Mister, you got rhythm times ten   I think perhaps that you're not listening   I find it tedious to repeat   It's no big crime, I just can't keep time   I'm telling you I lost the beat   I don't need my face on t-shirts   Or hit a power-chord guitar   They were screaming my name   I guess it's a shame   But I don't need to be a rock star   Besides, I ain't got rhythm   No, I ain't got rhythm   Said I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   Sounds like rhythm to me   No, I ain't got rhythm   Seems like they all agree   Said I ain't got rhythm   But you're laying down some funky syncopation!   I ain't got rhythm   I ain't got rhythm   But you got that beat   No, I ain't got rhythm   Look at them, they're stomping their feet   Said I ain't got rhythm   It's time for you to rock a brand new generation   A brand new generation   (Brand new generation)   Gonna rock a brand new generation   Because I ain't got rhythm!  Ugh! Would you just go join the band?  (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)   (Ain't got rhythm)  Hey, I got rhythm! Okay. Anyway, I knew I couldn't up here on the cliptastic countdown empty-handed, so I brought a little something for all of us to enjoy! Behold! The Music Video Clip-inator! You see, when I was a small boy, my parents would never let me watch music videosâ No, no! We don't have time for an emotionally scarring back-story. Well, maybe I should give you an emotionally scarring front-story! Okay, that doesn't even make any sense. It doesn't have to, I got a monster truck! Woo-hoo! Video numberâ Number 7! That was my foot! (Song #7: I Love You Mom)  Mom, it's your birthday   Thanks for all the care and love you give  Nice song, sis.

It's a Music Video Mind-Control-inator! Oh. Oh, hi! Uhm I mean, uh I wasâ I was just sayingâ Mimes control my gator! See, look over there! And you thought I was making it up! Now, onto video number 6! (Song #6: E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S.) Candace. Have you been near the wild parsnips again? Yes, but you gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing. What is it now?  Those boys are always up to something   And it's bringing me to tears   'Cause just before you get home   It always just magically disappears   Those boys are evil!   But before you get home they somehow always clean up the mess  Testify, Candace! Testify!  Those boys are evil!  Let me spell it out for you, Mom!  E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!   They built a roller coaster   And a beach in the backyard   Drove cattle through the city   And messed up the boulevard   They took me back in time   When we went to that museum   They built 50-foot tree house robots   But still you didn't see them   Those boys are evil   Their crazy shenanigans cause me all kinds of distress   Those boys are evil   Sing it with me!   (E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!)   E-V-I-L B-O-Y-S!

Well, thanks for tuning in, folks. We'll see ya next time. Say good night, Doofenshmirtz. You know, someday I'll get out of this cage, but your name will still be Francis.

"I don't know about you, Ferb, but I think bubbles have a great sense of humor. Look at that bubble's doing to my face. You make me laugh out loud, bubble. Hello! Hey, Baljeet. What are you guys doing? We're blowing bubbles and relaxing. Oh, I remember being relaxed, but that was before I had this! That looks like a color-coded schedule. That's because it is. Every minute of my entire day is planned out right here. Remember how you told me to seize the day? Consider it seized! That's not exactly what I meant. Hey, is it time for me yet? Not quite. Okay, now. Do you have any extra time for a bubble? Uh, I guess I have time for one. Oh, oh! Can I blow a super huge one, so I crawl inside it and float around like a little woodland pixie? Did I just say that out loud? Yes. Yes, you did. But that actually sounds fun minus the pixie part. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! There's no better way to see Danville than from inside a huge bubble. I wanna float around! Like men. Wanna come, Baljeet? Uh, my schedule is extremely tight. I doubt I even have a second to answer your question. Maybe if I move my polka recital back. Okay. Great! So, you're coming? No! I moved polka back so I could answer your question! It would take some major rearranging, but I think I can at least come to watch you make the bubble. Awesome! Hey, where's Perry? Right on time! I had Perry's absence on my schedule! Shh! Quiet, Carl! He's coming! Surprise! Alright! Happy birthday, Agent P! Woo! Agent P's birthday! It's not your birthday, is it? Are we close? Told ya! Put a sock in it, Carl! I was, uh a bit too busy planning your party, so I'm not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up too, but I am sure that it's no good. Get to the bottom of it!  Perry!  So, Candace, are you ready to do some practice driving for your permit? I'm easing my way into the driver's seat. I start with what's familiar then slide into the new. Well, start sliding. We've got errands to run. Okay, you drive! Your dad says you're already good at parallel parking. That was in the backyard! That's way different than the open road! Candace, I thought you want to be the first of your friends to have a driver's license. Okay, I'm sliding.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here. I-I did get your invite to your birthday party over the internet, naturally, I couldn't go, since it was most likely a trap. Anyway, I got you this. It's just a card, but here, look. Surprise! I finally figured out why my evil schemes always fail. You see, I am completely, and totally unlikeable. No, really. So, I asked myself, ""what are the two most popular things on this planet?"" Country music and western music. So now, I am bringing them together for the very first time. I'm calling it, ""Country and Western Music."" I know, I know. I'm brilliant, right? Great bubble design, Ferb. Now all we need is the missing bubble ingredient. Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? Making changes to my schedule. We're building a machine to make the biggest, most durable bubble ever. Oh, right. No one ever asks Baljeet what he is doing. We have just about everything we need for our durable bubble, but if you guys wanna help out, we still need some sap from a maracanut tree. Yeah, we can definitely do that. Excellent! While they're getting that, we can finish the design on the transponder. See you girls back at the field! I know what you're thinking. ""But Doof, you have a terrible singing voice!"" Well, feast your eyes on this little baby! Ta-da! I call it the Yodel-inator! Pretty cool, huh? Oh-oh, right. You just think it's a big cowboy hat. It is so much more! See? Huh? See? It's designed to make my singing voice sweet and mellifluous. So, my first gig is in an hour. Come on, you can help me hand out fliers. Everyone's going to love me! You can do this, Candace! Just look into the turn and ease your foot off the brake. I'm l-l-l-l-looking into the turn Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb! Candace, I don't find that funny. No! Behind the bus! They were building some kind of contraption! I'll show you! Oh, good. Now we'reâ Candace, slow down! Nice work as usual, Ferb! All we need now is the final ingredient. Hey, Phineas! We got the sap you guys needed. Here! Thanks! At this stage, the maracanut sap isn't fully congealed. So, we can pass through the semi-permeable membrane with ease. Voila! Girls, I think we all just earned our Passing-Through-A-Semi-Permeable-Membrane patches! Yay! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! See, there they Perhaps I should get tired of asking this, but. What am I looking at? Ugh! They were right there in theâ Hold onto something, Mom. Well, that was very entertaining, but that is all I had time scheduled for. Oh, wait. You are already airborne. And I am already still with you. Oh, I cannot believe this! My schedule is totally blown! I am going to miss my polka recital! I've heard ya. It's a small loss. Candace, trash cans again! Oops, my bad. Where'd they go? Candace, I think we've had quite enough of your driving! Not now, Mom! I have to get this car into the sky! Candace! Uh-oh! How long are we going to be up here? Awhile. And And how do you even steer this thing? We're at the mercy of the breeze. Sure, when you say it like that, it sounds relaxing. Hey, everybody! Downdraft! Oh, no, look out! Power lines! Girls, you know what to do! Lean! Cactus garden! Lean! Public art! With our angle of descent, leaning will be ineffectual! What? We're gonna crash! Oh, no! I knew I should not have forsaken the rigid beauty of my candy-colored schedule! The bubble is expanding. It's Baljeet's breathing! It's blowing the bubble up! Everybody breathe heavy like Baljeet! Yes, sir! We're doing it! Baljeet, you totally saved us! When in danger, I always hyperventilate. Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm next, Perry the Platypus. After this concert, I will be the most well-liked man in the Tri-State Area! (Song: Yodel Odel Obey Me)  Let me tell you my evil scheme   I'm gonna enslave your minds with a predictable melody   An uncomplicated rhyme   But if I asked you to, you'd even change your name to Amy   Because you're gonna yodel-odel-odel obey me   You'll be my obedient mindless slaves, and nobody will blame me   Because you'll yodel-odel-odel-odel obey me  I like him! Yeah! Let's do whatever he says!  You'll yodel-odel-odel-odel obey me   You'll yodel-odel-odelâ  âodel-obey me  He's terrible!  Yodel-odel-odel-odel-odel obey me  Yeah! It stinks so bad I wanna break someâ  Yodel-odel-odel-odel-odel obey me  Yeah, that really wasn't worth it. Let's get out of here. I'm hungry.  Yodel-odel-odel-odel-odel obey me  You can't mix country and western! They's two completely different types of music! That song was horrible! Yeah, those lyrics was way too on the nose! Okay, that wasn't as successful as I'd hoped. But at least I can beat a hasty retreat before I'm too humiliated! Huh? Uh For your information, I had these way before I met you. Okay, see you tomorrow. Candace! Watch where you're going! They're around here somewhere. Ooh! Ooh! There they are! Headed for the old drawbridge! You're mine! Candace, stop! I can't! There! There! I told you! Iâ Mom, open your eyes! Not till we're back on the ground! Mom! That was Candace driving. Her car control has gotten a lot better. Mom, we're back on the ground! Okay, Candace, now just gently apply the brake. I'm trying! Wow. This whole relaxation thing is Well, relaxing. Candace, at least take your foot off the gas. Oh, you think? You think?! There! How's that?! Is that better?! Well, guess your father was right. You do have parallel parking down. Look! There they are! Candace, I can't see anything. ""They"" who? The boys! They're up in there in theâ Ugh! Oh, hi, boys! Hi, Mom! Nice parking, Candace. What?! No! It's notâ But they were upâ Well, Ferb, I guess we should consider this day, seized. Oh, there you are, Perry."
"There you are, Isabella! I made a funny. It's always humorous when one refers to oneself in the third-person. You try it, Pinky. Yeah. Not a hard and fast rule, I guess. What's that? I hear a sash calling me to earn it some more new patches. Come on, Pinky. Sesquipedalian. Here's your ""Saying a Word No One Else in the Room Knows"" patch! Does anyone else want to try? Shh! Someone's coming! Defense positions. Look alive, people! It's our fearless leader. Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? Earning patches! So, did you guys decide what patch to get today? 'Cause I have a suggestion! Let me guess. The ""Let's Help Phineas and Ferb"" patch? It's called the ""Help Thy Neighbor"" patch, Adyson. Don't make up patch names. I already have 52 of those. I have 53. Remember, I went back one afternoon after everyone else went home. I know. Don't remind me. You just want an excuse to see Phineas. The very thing I live for. All right, then! Let's go see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Why don't we ever go see what Baljeet is doing? Because we've done that before. Yeah. And that patch wasn't worth it. Hey, where's Pinky? Hello, Agent Pinky. Professor Poofenplotz has been making a barrage of inquiries about hairspray, of all things. It's all very suspicious. Suss it out and put the kibosh on it. Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't know what I'm doing. I don't know what I've been doing. Always getting so wrapped up in these silly projects that I don't care about. It's you I care about, Isabella! Can we be together forever and ever? Yeah, we can definitely do that. Excellent. While they're getting that, we can finish our designs on the transponder. See you girls back at the field. Okay, Phineas! Oh, my gosh. What did he say? What does he need? I was in Phineasland again. We'll explain on the way, Chief. Right now, we have to find the rare maracanut tree, and earn our ""Sap Collecting"" patch. What's that patch for? It's the ""I Just Saw a Cute Boy"" patch. Where? Duh! That one over there with the color-coded schedule.  Poofenplotz Evil is Crazy!  (Song: Important to Look Your Best)  It's important to look your very best when you're doing your very worst   And by that, I mean evil   Uh  Pinky the Chihuahua! So, you thought you can sneak up on me, huh? Stop shaking, you jittery little pest. Anyway I woke up from my beauty sleep and thought to myself, ""What the heck? Why not try to take over the world again?"" But, as you know, Pinky, I can't very well take over the world until I'm drop-dead gorgeous! But I can't make myself beautiful, because I ran out of my favorite hair spray. It went a little something like this. Can I help you with something, ma'am? Yes. Can you tell me where you've moved your Stiff Beauty hair spray? Oh, I'm so sorry, ma'am. That product has been discontinued. As it turns out, only amusement park clowns used it. And ever since the old amusement park shut down, Stiff Beauty hasn't been selling. Discontinued? Discontinued. So what you're saying is Stiff Beauty's no longer going to be sold. Right. That's what ""discontinued"" means. How about I discontinue you from this dimension! This so isn't worth minimum wage. The only supply of Stiff Beauty left in the world is at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park. And I intend to use my Me-Mobile to get me there! According to this Fireside Girls book on dendrology, the maracanut tree is indigenous to mountain valley micro-climates. So, it looks like we're heading in the right direction. Hi. Excuse me? Um, hello? Earth to hippie? Excu-u-u-u-u-u-use me-e-e-e-e-e-e. Whoa! You just harmonized with me. Ooh! Would you possibly know where the maracanut trees might be located? Indeed I do, my formidable little flower. Behold. Oh, no! What happened? Where did they all go? They were all chopped down so their sap could be used for hair spray. Such a shame. So, there aren't any left? Don't fret, my pet. There happens to be one sole maracanut tree left in existence. It's at the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park over on the next hill. Did you just say ""the old abandoned old abandoned amusement park""? Yes, the old abandoned Old Abandoned Amusement Park. ""Old abandoned"" twice? Yes. All right. Step up, little sister. Let me bestow upon you, the Key of Wisdom. Bask in its glory! Cool, huh? Um He's gone! Wow. No, he's not. He's right over there. Oh, uhâ Hey! Hey, hi! Hey, little sisters. See you on the flip side! So, Mom, am I doing great or what? Well, ""or what."" Candace. Trash cans! Well, here we are, I guess. Oh, I get it! It was actually called ""The Old Abandoned Amusement Park""! And now it's old and abandoned. Hence, ""old abandoned"" twice. Girls, we're goin' in. We have a tree to find! Fireside Girls, report! Nothing up here, Captain! Ditto, Chief! It just smells like feet in here. These clown lockers are just full of cheap hair spray! It has to be around here somewhere. Creepy roadside hippie gurus are generally reliable. Wait. I think I found it! Yeah! This must be it, Chief. I think you're right, Chief. This should be it. I think you're right. ""Stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses, and of all the stickinesses, the sap of the maracanut tree is the sticky-messiest. This Temple of Sap attraction is a monument to the rare and beautiful maracanut tree, the world's greatest stickerizer."" Looks like we've tracked our quarry to its lair, girls! Although, if their biggest attraction was a sap-themed ride, I understand why this place closed down. Girls, get your gear. We're climbin' up. Probably not a good idea. The whole thing's structurally unsound. Look out! The whole place will fall! And there's no way to get that tree! Calm down, girls. Have you forgotten who we are? We're Fireside Girls Troop 46321, (Song: The Fireside Girls) and we never give up!  We're Fireside Girls, one and all   And together we belong   We wear our patches upon our sashes   And stand cute, small, and strong   This is the Fireside Girls song   And it's not too terribly long!  So, let's procure the sap for Phineas! Yay, Phineas! Oh, and Ferb too! And Ferb too! And Baljeet! Well, the old hippie didn't mention how to get to the top of that. All he gave us was this Key of Wisdom. Groovy! Out of sight! Jinkies! Far out! Dy-no-mite! Pinky the Chihuahua! Well, Momma knows how to deal with bad little doggies! Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad dogâ Well, there's no engine, but it looks like gravity will do the trick. All right, girls. Are we ready to get that ""Reckless Disregard for Life and Limb"" patch? Aye-aye, Captain! All right, ladies! Lean! Lean! So, how exactly is this gonna work? Girls, sashes! Now! Gretchen, you have the controls. What good will that do?! Just trust me! Oh, my goodness! What a cute little tree! Aww. Isabella? What now?! We're gonna crash! Oh, no, we're not. Everybody! Lean! Yay! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah! Okay, girls. It's time to tap that sap! I'm on it! Hold it still, Katie. We got it, Isabella! Hey, Phineas. We got that sap you guys needed. Excellent, Isabella! That's the last ingredient we need. Now all we have to do is .run away together. Isabella? Isabella? Phineas said, ""Thanks."" ""Thanks."" He really does appreciate me. Yes. Yes, he does.  Stiff Beauty!  Yes! At last, my own lifetime supply of Stiff Beauty!!! I may be stiff, but at least I'm beautiful. Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua! Have you forgotten who we are? We're Fireside Girls Troop 46321, and we never give up!  We're Fireside Girls, one and all   And together we belong   We wear our patches upon our sashes   And stand cute, small, and strong   This is the Fireside Girls song   And it's not too terribly long!"
"Okay, the camera's all ready! We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat, constructed entirely out of playing cards. Hey, where's Candace? I bet she'd love to see this. ""Does He Think You're Pretty Enough? Ten Ways You Could Be.. Better."" Wow. Ten ways? Thank you Quazmo Magazine. Jeremy! Hey, Candace. Um, so listen. I'm really sorry, but something's come up and I won't be able to make it to our date tonight. I hope you understand. Hello? Candace, are you there? Hello? Helloo? Well, I guess we got cut off. He just broke our date and hung up on me. Oh, it's probably not as bad as I think. Let's see what Quazmo has to say about it. Last card. You do the honors, Ferb. What? Um Hey, Candace. Everything okay? Beat it, dweebs! I'm having a crisis! Sounds like Candace is in a serious funk. I wonder what we can do to snap her out of it? Ooh, I know! It's all right here in Tween Bleep magazine. ""Three Sure-Fire Ways to Lift Your Friend Out of a Serious Funk. Number one: Give her a complete make-over. A completely different look will often do the trick."" A completely different look? Come on, Ferb. We need somebody who's good with make-up and fancy hair-dos. Um Okay. I'll just stay here with my ""Expert Makeover"" patches andâ Hey, where's Perry? Agent P. Uh Well Due to your reprehensible behavior over the past few days, which I can still barely believe is even possible from an agent of your caliber, who has learned nothing but the best in his field, Iâ Uhâ Uh. Actually, I don't know what's particularly bad about this clip here, butâ We have no choice, butâ Why? Why'd you do it? Not yet, Carl. Wait till I'm done here. You are officially discharged. Okay, now, Carl. Why? Why'd you do it? Cuff him, boys. Red alert! Red alert! Renegade agent on the run! Hello? Stacy, Jeremy has, like, totally lost interest in me! What makes you think so? Quazmo magazine! I'll be right there. Well, that was almost impossibly fast. Woah, woah, wait! You're not Stacy! Hey, hey, hey! What is going on? Huh? Uh, wait a minute. Now, don't try anything funny! So, are you ready for some cheering up? No biggie, Shlocko, you gave it your best shot. In hindsight, a clown may not have been the best choice to do a makeover. Ya think? So, what else does the magazine say? ""Step number two: Make her laugh. Laughter is the best medicine."" Sure! Make her laugh. Candace has a great sense of humor. Remember that time she got her face caught in the sink? Okay, how 'bout now we get you some ice cream? I don't know, Stacy. Good afternoon, ladies. Or, we can do this. We have a table reserved for you close to the stage, Miss Flynn. Oh. This is so cool. Hey, hey, hey, hey, everybody! We havin' fun yet? First up, our favorite math-formula funny man, Baljeet! Thank you. Thanking you much. So, little Jeet, I hear you went to New Delhi. And did you try the chicken club? Wow. That's really what you're going with? You know, just do the water drinking bit. Okay. The Pythagorean theorem The square of the hypotenuse of a right triangâ Let's hear it for the dummy! And that puppet wasn't bad either. Next up, my favorite vegetable-based comic, Broccoli Top! I'm gonna do some prop comedy for you, and you're gonna like it! Okay, what have we got? Here's aâ Here's a house. For, uh I don't know. A mouse or something. Here's a book. Hey, what am I What am I supposed to do? Read? Next! All right, let's see what else we've got! Um And here's, uh, um Oh! An oyster shell, look! My My mom went to a seafood restaurant I don't have any It's just To me, it's just interesting. I'll put that one back in the box. What else we got? Oh, here we go. Look! A nerd to go with the book! I am in both acts. Thank you! Buford's still in the building! This isn't making me feel any better. What? You wanna wrestle? Coming up next, Ferb Fletcher! Ahem. So, how about that airline food? This, is making me feel worse. What's airline food? Doesn't look like it's working. So, what does it say for step number three? It says ""Introduce her to someone new."" That should be easy. There are lots of nice people in Danville that she's never met. Ferb, I've got an idea. Hey, fellas! Look who decided to make an appearance. You see, it occurred to me that what I should really be doing is fighting fire with fire. And by fire, I mean Perry the Platypus. And by fire, I also mean Perry the Platypus. It occurred to me while I was on fire. I made a bunch of doppelgangers to discredit and totally destroy you. Behold! The Plata-Proliferator-inator! Meet Terry the Platypus, and say hello to Larry the Platypus, and say aloha to Jerry the Platypus. Yeah, he was the first one out of the batch, but you know, he was so cute, I couldn't bear toâ Ow! Ow! No, no! Jerry, you do not hit people. You do notâ Ow! No! Use your words, Jerry. Anyway, all you guys, go get him! Yeahaa! Aww. Look at this, Stacy. He won't even answer his cell phone. Excuse me, Miss Flynn? You and a guest are cordially invited to the Mixer Mingler. Mixer Mingler? Say, aren't you that dummy from the night club? She's talking to you. It's obviously some lame attempt by my brothers to cheer me up. I'm not going. Come on, it will do you good. Oh, would you look at this? If I wasn't so depressed, my brothers would be so busted! With the Mix 'n' Mingler, you can meet someone new every two seconds. Now, let's fire this baby up. Fasten your seatbelts! I can't believe I'm doingâ THIS!

Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Sorry, folks. Prepare for emergency ejection. In hindsight, a simple ice cream cone might have been more effective. See? Congratulations, Agent P. I knew it couldn't be you causing all that trouble. You are officially reinstated. You know, a little ice cream always makes me feel better. Maybe you're right. I'll have two scoops of Jeremy? Jeremy! Hey, Candace. What are you doing here? I didn't wanna break our date. I just wanted to earn some extra money, so I could surprise you. A surprise, for me? Oh, Jeremy. Oh, Jeremy! This was so worth the wait. I'm just glad you're not one of those people who freaks out just because someone cancels a date. Right"

It's funny, the cleanup usually takes care of itself, but we've been working all night on this one. That's the last of it, guys! Thanks! It was our biggest project ever! How could you miss it? I was kind of busy. Stacy, what's up? My ticket is in row R!  Close enough to smell them! What did you get?!!? Ticket? How'd you get a ticket? That's right, folks! Unless you've had your head stickin' out of a window, you know those tickets just went on sale and sold out in 13 seconds flat! Sold out? That's right! Sold out! But you still might be able to catch this special added benefit concert tonight at the Fireside Girls Jamboree! Okay, I still got a chance! What the heck? ""Fireside Girls Only? Please Enter Your Patch #""? Gotta guess the right numbers. Gotta guess the right numbers. ""You Have Exceeded Your Log-In Attempts""? No, you've exceeded your log-in attempts! Phineas! Yes, Candace? Your little friend, Isabella, she's a Fireside Girl, right?! What's her patch number?! I'm not sure. But I can ask her when she gets back from her meeting at the Fireside Girl lodge. Lodge, huh? C'mon, you're takin' me down there. Now! Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. We're not sure what Doofenshmirtz is up to, but we're sending you to his lab. And we're using this new transporter device we've been working on. It's not approved for testing on humans yet, so you get to try it out first. Good luck, Agent P. Carl, fire it up! Yes, it's true that the Paisley Sideburn Brothers tickets can only be ordered by an active-duty Fireside Girl. But if you just want toâ Tell you what, I'm joining up! Set me up, sister! Okay. I hereby nominate Candace Flynn into membership in the Loyal Sisterhood of Fireside Girls. I second! Jinx! Alright, girls, come to order. Now, just fill out this application, read the training manual, sign the insurance waivers, and you can be sworn in at our meeting next week. Next week?! But that's too late! I'm sorry, but the traditional procedure comes straight from the Fireside Rules of Order, as established by our founder, Eliza M. Feyersied. Well, that's a stupid rule. You watch your mouth, little lady! Who puts a picture frame on a window? Is there anything Ferb and I can do to help? Candace really wants to see that concert. Candace, ifâ If you don't really want to be a Fireside Girl, thenâ No, no, no! I do, I do! I've gotta get to that concert! Candace, you're not listening to me. You don'tâ Pfft! Forget it! I thought Fireside Girls were supposed to help people. There is another way! You don't meanâ Yes! Isabella, please read Article 9, Section Charlie, Footnote 6. ""A troop leader may award full Fireside Girl status to any girl who has earned 50 patches."" But, Mrs. Feyersied, 50 patches in one day?! Is that even possible?! Well, it depends on how badly she wants it. Bring it on! Alright! All you need is a cadet uniform and we can get started. Okay. Where can I buy one? Ouch! Uh, Agent P, we've teleported you three feet too far to the right.  Perry!   Doo bee doo bee doo bahâ  Perry the Platypus?! Do you even realize how much trouble it is to set a trap? And for what? You just jump out of the way! Ah, here we go. We've recalibrated the teleporter. I-I don't know what just happened, but I like it. Now, with you safely inside the cage, I can unveil my new device of doom. Behold, the Metal-Destructinator! Fifty patches in one day? Where do I start? By combining the shortest linear distance with the highest population density, we've plotted a course for you that's optimized for the greatest number of patch-acquiring opportunities in the shortest period of time. Then after you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch. Got it? Is all that really necessary? We're going to need you to plant one of these Fireside Girl markers at the site of each task, so the girls at the lodge can track your progress. Now, is Candace Gertrude Flynn your full legal name? Ugh. Yes. Great! You just earned your Honesty Patch! Congratulations! Really? That was easy! C'mon, let me do another! Ooh, I think you just earned your Enthusiasm Patch! Wow! Two down! Yippee! This is easy! Okay. Ooh, goody, I'm great at word problems. No. There's 15 senior citizens that need help crossing the street. Good luck, Candace. Don't forget your helmet. (Song: Go Candace) Senior-service patch: Check.  Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!  Running with the Bulls Patch: check. And Running with the Bullies Patch: check.  Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!  Discovering Something That Doesn't Exist Patch: check.  Go!  Here you go, Candace. Wrestling an Alligator in a Sewer Patch. Alligator, you're goin' down! C'mon, Candace, you can do it! Pin him already! We're running behind! This is really putting us off schedule. So, let me explain my new evil scheme. A while back, my doctor put me on a low-carb diet, but I still can't lose those last ten pounds. Every time I get close to my goal, there's this knocking at the door. Who is it? Fireside Girls. Would you like to buy some of our cupcakes? Cupcakes you say? Iâ I-I really shouldn't. I should get back to my exercise. I'mâ almost down to my goal. Oh, we understand. Have a niceâ Alright, you talked me into it! Thanks! So with my weakness for high-carb sweets, there's really no other choice but to get rid of the bridge to the Fireside cupcake factory. And my Metal-Destructinator can turn any metal object into broccoli. I know what you're thinking, why broccoli? But, w-well, y'know, it's healthy. It's like the opposite of what I'm trying to getâ It'sâ It's poetic justice. It'sâ Well, it's notâ Not justice, exactâ It'sâ Poetic evil. It's poetically evil. Now, to make some last-minute adjustments Wrestling an Alligator in a Sewer Patch Check. So what's next? We're a bit behind. You can finish out the rest while you work on your Delivering Cupcakes Patch. Sounds easy enough. Well, you have to deliver all these cupcakes. All these?! No problem. We've built you a rollercoaster delivery system. Alright, let's do this. Siga sentados, por favor. (Remain seated, please.) Are you speaking Spaniâ Here are your cupcakes! Bug Collecting Patch: check. I'm going to hurl! Motion Sickness Patch: Check! The Paisley Sideburn Brothers! Let's hurry!  go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!   Go, Candace! Go, go, Candace!  Ready to fire. Ow! Ow! Yeawwo! Oh! Oh! Ow! Ow! Quit it, you annoying little pest! Last one! Woo-hoo! Oh! Wow, that was fun. Fun? Are you nuts? And how did a rollercoaster turn into broccoli? And why broccoli?! How does that make any sense?! Candace, focus. You've still got five minutes and it's 20 blocks away. So, uh Good luck with that. No, I can do this. Now that's persistence. I see the building. And I still got three minutes! Got it! Out of order?! Okay, stairs. Step aerobics, don't fail me now! Come back here! Oh, what are you doing down there?! Uh-oh. Curse you, Perry theâ Coming. Fireside Girl. Here's your order of cupcakes. Aren't you a little old to be a Fireside Girl? Yes. Yes, I am. Candace, we are all very impressed. You earned more patches in one day than anyone in the history of the Fireside Girls. which pretty much blows away the previous record of 6 patches held by our own Adyson Sweetwater. Aw, nuts! No, I know I did all 50, and I made sure to plant the markers and everything. Huh? Looks like I forgot one. I'll just run back before it's five o'clock. I'm sorry, Candace. Y'know, you may not have lit up the entire board, but you did demonstrate remarkable persistence. You mean I get a persistence patch? And that makes 50, right? There's no Persistence Patch, is there? Nope. 'Fraid not. Hold on, Isabella. Little Miss Sassy Mouth here gets a special patch for breakin' the all-time record. Congratulations, Fireside Girl! And here's your ticket for the Paisley Sideburn Brothers concert. Let's go! Woo! Yeah! Phineas and Ferb? How did you guys get in? Isabella invited us. She's allowed to bring guests, you know. That's what I kept trying to tell you, Candace, but you were so insistent on becoming a Fireside Girl. Maybe you can start working on your Good Listener Patch next. C'mon, Candace, you can do it! Pin him already! We're running behind! This is really putting us off schedule. Ooh! That's gonna leave a mark. Yes. On the alligator."
"by ashirogi27 Do you find it as curious as I do that your menu has not changed since you opened in 1929? I know! It's awesome, right? It's our motto. ""Slushy Dawgs Will Never Get Any Better."" Well, in that case, I'llâ Step aside, weener! One Windmill Dog, hold the bun. Excellent choice. You saved my life. It was nothing. What are you doing? I am your humble servant. What? It's the Bully Code. I live my life by it. ""If a nerd shood save a bully's life, the bully is the nerd's slave for life."" ""Should"" is misspelled. Duh, it was written by bullies! That is very nice, but I do not want a slave. Too bad, you got one. Goodbye! I will empty my mind of all thought, except for Baljeet. There, that was easy. You are following me. At a respectable distance, little master. So, what do you think? What am I looking at? Duh, it's a new red shirt!  Beautiful  It's from Jeremy! He sent me a picture. Aw, look at his cute, little wiener hat. Let's send him a picture of me. Make sure you got my good side. How's the lighting? Wait, you took it while I was still talking! Oh! Let me see. I'd better erase that. Picture sent. Oh, no! I hit the wrong button! Um, go into the menu andâ Picture sent. No, not again! Here, let me see. Stacy, no, stop! Pictures sent. I'm ruined. Well, he's at work, so maybe he hasn't looked yet. We've got to get to Jeremy's phone. Come on, we're going to Slushy Dawg. Peanut butter and jelly robot races, masking tape mummy gymnastics, a jelly bean monetary system for emergenations I don't know. I'm not feeling any of 'em. Phineas and Ferb are up to something. I'd better tell Mom. Candace, the photos. Eyes on the prize. Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P. Sorry to disturb you on Canada Day, but the world's top evil scientists have been photographed leaving Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated. Something big is going on, real big. I need you to infiltrate his headquarters. Ahem? Sorry. We need you to infiltrate his headquarters. Carl thinks I need to be more ""inclusive"". Find out what he's up to!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. Have you come to sign my cast? Look, I saved your spot, right there. It says, ""Save for Perry."" But, i-it was a bigger spot before I wrote, ""Save for Perry,"" but thereâ T-There's some room  there. Grab that marker! Ha-ha! You've heard of the Internet? Well, this is aâ Uh  Well, this is just a net. But you're caught. In exactly thirty minutes, the Tutti McFrutti ice cream man will park his truck in front of my building. I know, because I was standing there yesterday when he ran over my foot! But today, I will wreak my whole revengeance! Behold, the Re-tire-Inator! Because, you know, he ran over my foot with the tire, and I'm going to hit him with a giant tire. Re-tire. It-It's not like retire, like stop working. That's not that Retire-Inator, thatâ That's actually over there. The-Theâ I-I've got it ready. It'sâ Full with crossword puzzles, and a big, fat, house cat that will lay on my belly and warm me into my senior years. Anyhoo, where was I? Oh, yes. Evil laugh. Little Master, I've washed all your dust jackets and dusted all your cold knick-knacks. Those are not knick-knacks! They are food, and they should be in the refrigerator! Oh I've disappointed you, Little Master. I will strive to do better. Do not strive for anything. And I am not your little master. I'll just fluff up your pillow then! (Song: ""He'll Do Anything But Go Away"") Little Master? Little Master? Stay away from me!  He follows me all over town   And every time I turn around   He's standing there at a respectful distance   He's arranging my underwear drawer   By dumpin' it out on the floor   When I'm brushing my teeth, I don't need his assistance   No, no, no   Well the story is old   (Story is old)   It's a 70's sitcom clichÃ©   He says he's in my debt, but, I wish he'd forget   He'll do anything for me   Anything but go away!  Phineas, Ferb! I saved Buford's life, and now because of the Bully Code, he is my personal servant! It is driving me crazy! You have got to help me! Okay, okay. We've just had to get Buford to save your life, and you'll be even. But, how? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Stacy, I see Jeremy's phone. Where? There! His message light is still blinking. That means he hasn't retrieved his pictures yet! Okay, let's justâ What are you two doing here? I mean, not that I don't like surprise visits from you, but this room is for Slushy Dawg employees only. We're Slushy Dawg employees. We are? Yeah. We did our training at the downtown branch to surprise you. Surprise! Hey, that's rad! Candace, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. What are all these buttons for? It's hot dogs. How hard can it be? Here, fry something. I'm gonna go et-gay the one-phay. (Lit: get the phone) Ugh, you know I don't speak Spanish! Oh, hey, Candace! I see you've sent me some pictures. I can't wait to check 'em out later when I take my break. Yeah! No! I found out what all the buttons are for. Oh, yes. This thing is definitely the thing! What is this thing? This contraption, my friend, is completely foolproof. Let me explain. You'll ""accidentally"" step on to that platform, which will launch you up and over that flight of stairs, where you'll be kicked and rocketed through a piece of sheet-rock onto a trampoline. Then conveyer belted up to a rotating system that will drop you onto a spring, bouncing you all the way to that red X, where Buford will be standing, waiting to catch you, saving your life. Ooh, I am thoroughly terrified, yet tingling with excitement! Candace? While I check the stockroom, can you take the drive-thru orders? Ooh, my favorite! Uh, welcome to Slushy Dawg, can I take your order? Candace? You work here? Mom?! You eat here? Honey, where are you? Can you see me? Candace? Uhâ This is weird. My mom's here. I think your brothers are, too. Across the street. What are they up to? Candace? Mom? Mom! Drive up to the window! You gotta see what the boys are doing! The boys are here, too? Hon, I'm boxed in. I've got a heckuva line in front of me. Fill orders, fill orders! Hi, enjoy your meal. Come again. Enjoy your meal. Bon appÃ©tit. Okay, Baljeet. You just stand on that platform and when Buford comes along, we'll guide him to the right spot. Although, it has occurred to us that you're giving up something really cool here. What? You're spending all this energy trying to stop Buford from being your faithful servant, when the reality is having the biggest, toughest kid in town as your personal bodyguard is a sign of supreme coolness. Really? Yeah, think about it. Hmm Maybe you are right. Ooh, hear that, Perry the Platypus? Tuttie McFrutti has arrived on time! In a few seconds, he'll be flattened by a speeding tire. Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Oww!!! Ow! Oh, my good foot! My good foot! Ow! Ow ow! My bad foot! Oh, my good foot again! Oh, no, my bad footâ Oh, this is really a viscous cycle! Hey, Candace, I'm takin' my break now. Uh-huh. Stacy, we gotta get Mom up here so she can see what the boys are doing. Keep throwing food out the window! Okay. Hey, Jeremy, can I borrow your phone? Thanks! Erase photos, bust boys, erase photos, bust boys! Little Master! Little Master! I finished color-coding all of your overalls. Whadaya want me to do next? Well, first, I would like you to iron all of my books, then perhaps polish my retainer, then you can start my college applications. Massage my tootsies. Sew my name onto my underwear, organize my book reports by subject. Ooh, build meâ Weenie! Alright, we're even. What? Aw, man. Ha! All photos erased! Now, onto the boys! Hey, just so you know, Mom's on her waay Oops. Stacy, you're here, too? Yeah. Candace wants you to go out front to see what the boys are doing. Well, just give me a chili dog and I'll be on my way. Sheetrock. Trampoline. No! I saved your life. Now you're my servant. Ugh, all right. Ew! But, the code! You've got no honor! Candace, wow! You okay? Um, yeah. Here's your phone. There's a picture on it. No, no! Hey, that's a great photo of you! Huh? Phew! Now About your job No worries. I quit. Hey, you guys wanna hit Slushy Dawg before we go home? Ew! Nah. Oh, heavens, no. Slushy Dawgs never get any better. Candace? Boys? Hmm. I'll never understand public art."
"by ashirogi27 Oh, cool! Old records! Lindana. Now that's a blast from the past. I wonder where she is now Probably singing at retirement homes. Oh, give me that. Hey, you look familiar. Hey Dad, what are these? Oh wow, those are my old black and white detective movies. Do you mind if we watch them? Not at all, boys, the projector's inside. Great, come on, Ferb. Oh, I see you like that little doll. Well, let's see That'll cost you, uh Fifty cents? I'll give you a dollar. She rolled into my office like a fog bank. Mysterious and cold. My instincts told me this dame was nothing but trouble. But trouble's my middle name. Well, not really. My middle name is ""Trumble"". Sounds a lot like trouble. Wow. This detective stuff's great. She had something she needed to say. She spoke with the voice of an angel Phineas! Where's the box that was in my room?! Well, Dad was taking boxes out to the yard sale Dad, Dad, wait! Dad, is that the box from my room? Well, yes Uh I think I put my little Mary McGuffin doll in there by mistake. Have you seen her? I just sold her for a whole dollar. Here, you can have it. How about two dollars?  Doofenshmirtz's Ex-Wife's House on a Hill Somewhere!  Dad? What are you doing here? This isn't your weekend. Yes, yes, I know, but Iâ I have a surprise for you and I just couldn't wait! A surprise? Really? Yes, it's something you've always wanted. Something you've asked for time and time again. In my hand, I hold the key to My new car! No, your happiness! Remember how you said if I got you a little Mary McGufffin doll, I'd be the world's greatest dad? Yeah, when I was like, seven. At long last, I have found one! I have been scouring the Internet andâ And garage sales, trying to find the discontinued doll. Wow, I can't believe you remembered I wanted this. Remembered?! I never stop looking! Really? You know, I may be an evil scientist, but it doesn't take a degree purchased from the Internet with your ex-wife's money, to know how special and important you are to me. That's so sweet. Well, I'd better run. I bought a used -inator today at the garage sale, and it's missing one small part. Really? What does it do? I don't know yet, it's missing a part. But, whatever it is, I'm sure it will be pure evil! Well, at least you're non-evil. It was a dull, hot day in Danville, and she swept into the room like a cool, tropical depression. I could tell by the way she walked, she had something on her mind. Either that, or she was chaffing from the heat. What's going on here? Her voice flowed soft and smooth, like butter on toast. And why are you talking like that? She was observant. Maybe too observant. Why is everything black and white in here? We painted everything like an old detective movie. What about you guys? Detective makeup. Detectives? Perfect! I know what you're gonna do today! Track down my little Mary McGuffin. Piece of cake. Ooh, chocolate. Thanks, Ferb. We'll have your little Mary McGuffin back here faster than you can say, ""Hey, where's Perry?"" Sir, Agent P is here. I can see that, Carl. Now get back in that corner until I tell you, you can get up. Still fifteen minutes left on the timer. Okay, Sir. Agent P, weâ We just found out that Doofenshmirtz is scouring the Tri-State Area for some sort of on-off device. A switch, Sir. Right, we think it might be a switch, but, we don't know what it's for so, we need your help. Good luck, Agent P. The sun beat down on the city like a hammer, a relentless hot beating hammer, hammering down like a big metaphor that was Hot, for some reason. Stop with the narration and start finding my doll! We decided to investigate the scene of the crime. We talked to a Lawrence Fletcher, a tall gaunt looking average Joe who Sorry. Is that my old black and white saxophone? We thought the investigation could use a little ambiance. Oh, delightful. How can I help? We need you to tell us everything you can about the man who bought the doll. Well, let me see He had some kind of a German accent, and ooh! He was also wearing a lab coat. A lab coat, huh? Ferb? For an average Joe, he gave us an above average clue. Our next step was clear. Who is he talking to? Oh, don't get me started. (Song: Not So Bad A Dad)  You were a sub-standard dad   But the only one I had   I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall   But when I look at this thing   It makes me wanna sing   Maybe you're not so bad a dad after all   At my first ever swim meet   You stepped on the other team's feet   At my recital you clapped louder than you should   But when you taught me how to drive   We actually made it home alive   I guess it's possible not every part of you isn't good   I know at times I would cringe   Like when you wore all that fringe   And when you went out of your way to catch that foul ball   But this piece of plastic in my hand   Makes me finally understand   Maybe you're not so bad a dad   Not so bad a dad after all  Vanessa, Charitable Charities is here. Do you have your box ready? Yeah Mom, it's next to my bookshelf. Oops, looks like something fell out. Here you go. Aww, thanks Char. I'll pick you up at eight. See you then, Sam. We figured the best place to find a man in a lab coat was at the Lab Coat Emporium. We interviewed several suspects. Well, yes I was at a garage sale, but as you can see, I don't have an accent. Yeah, I have an accent, but I have not been to a garage sale. Whoa! Hey kid, slow down. I can't answer all these questions. Well that wasn't very productive. Was it? We decided to have a talk with the owner. What do you know about a man in a lab coat with a German accent, frequents garage sales? Oh, that guy. I don't know anything about that guy. Alright Ferb, lean on him. Alright, alright, I'll talk. Okay, there's this guy. He comes in every week for a lab coat. He has me put everything on his ex-wife's tab. See, her address is on the bill. Hm. I do see. Well, thanks a lot for your help. You can wrap it up, Ferb. Can I take this makeup off now? I can't believe how lucky I was at that garage sale. Someone's personal collection of on-off switches. Score! Hmm Looks like this one doesn't fit, more where that came from. Nope. How 'bout this? Come on. Papa needs a band new -inator. Oh! What theâ Perry the Platypus, are you making your own keys now? Oh, you like all the stuff I got at the garage sale, huh? Want to know what else I got? This lobster trap! Yeah Uh Anyway, sorry I can't tell you my evil scheme, becauseâ I-I don't know what this does yet. I-I'm still looking for an on-off switch. Life was much simpler when I worked as a lawn gnome. Mom! Yes, dear? Have you seen my little Mary McGuffin doll? Could it be the one I just put in the box for Charitable Charities? Oh no, Dad gave that to me. Well, I'm sorry I didn't know. But I think the truck is still out there. Wait! Sam! I want to retain a portion of my mother's charitable donation! Excuse me, ma'am. We'd like to ask you a few questions. Are you with the census? No, ma'am, today we're detectives. Aren't you a little young to be detectives? If it's all the same to you ma'am, we'll ask the questions. Oh, ho-ho, okay. Come on in. Would you kids like some apple juice? That would be nice, ma'am. Alright lady, what do you know about the little Mary McGuffin doll? You too? Well, like I told my daughter, I just gave it to charity. And? Well Nothing, that's it. The Charitable Charities truck just left. They have a few locations around town, so I'm not sure which one they're going to. Alright Ferb, pack it up. We've got some charities to visit. But I think we're going to need to update our approach. We checked out act of the charitable charities in Danville, using every cop persona we could think of. In every case, it seemed we had the wrong location. Aren't you a little young to know about all these old detective shows? Yes. Yes, we are.  YEAH!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, man, how many different kinds of on-off switches can there be? I mean, lookâ Look at this. An octagon? And one shaped like the Statue of Liberty? That doesn't even make sense. Oh, and here's one. The exact same size and shape that I'm looking for except it's upside-down. I mean, the words are actually printed upside-down. What kind of a dummkopf would invent an upside-down Switch That Hmm. I did it! Time to find out what this bad boy can do! On. Off. On! Off! On! Off! On! Ugh, I'm hearing a clanking noise, so I know it's doing something. Oh, the -inator and the cage, they'reâ Connected. It just, opens and closes theâ Well, I guess that's why I got the cage for free. Hey, I was talking! Take that! And that! Hey, let's see if you can take a couple of hits, from the 70's! Ah, that takes me back. Hey, where'd you go? Yow! Is that a shark's head? Are you trying to make me cry? Wait-wait-wait! Hold on one second here, just a second. It occurs to me that all this machine does is open and close a lobster cage, soâ You know, it's not even evil, much less illegal. Besides, I've run out of clever fighting puns soâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus. There she is! My little Mary McGuffin doll! I'm sorry, but this is my doll. No, it ended up here by mistake, and it's my doll. You might think it's your doll, but it's not. I'm going to have to ask you to please, let go! You, please let go. You, let go! Give it back! This is exactly why they took that doll off the market. You give it back! Oh! Oh! Give it back! Give it back! Look! She's perfect, and I just love her. Oh, forget it. I guess I'm too old for dolls anyway. Yeah, maybe I don't really have to have the one object my dad spent years to find in order to show me his affection. No, actually I do. Give me that, kid! So you just took it from the little girl and left her there crying? Wow, that is evil! Honey, I am so proud of you! It felt good didn't it? Yeah, we can build on this.  Not so bad a dad after all   You were a sub-standard dad   But the only one I had   I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall   But this piece of plastic in my hand   Makes me finally understand   Maybe you're not so bad a dad   Not so bad a dad after all"
"by ashirogi27 Hello, boys, I thought I heard a noise out here. Oh, hey, Dad. Say, there is something pretty peculiar going on here, now, don't tell me! You turned the entire garage upside-down, now why on earth would you do that? We're searching for Ferb's favorite skateboard. Dear! Are you aware the boys have turned the garage upside-down, looking for Ferb's skateboard? As long as they clean up after! Oh. Right-o. Ooh, just a minute. Does that skateboard have a Union Jack on the bottom? That's the one! Turn the thing right-side up and come in the house. I believe I solved your mystery. You heard him, Ferb. Let's turn it over. So, what have you got, Pop? Take a gander what a certain old geezer posted on his blog. Hey, it's Grandpa! Ferb, you must have left your skateboard in England the last time we were there. I know! We could create a highly intricate and sophisticated machine, that will transport any object from anywhere on the globe to our backyard! Well, why don't you just build a new skateboard? Nah, I don't think so. If it's all the same with you, Father, we're going to build the machine. Whoa, Mom. What's with the getup? I'm on my way to join Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, at the Mexican-Jewish Cultural Fair today. Would you like to come along? Let me think. Um No. Oh, well. Suit yourself, bubelita! Let's give her a trial run. Start with something small. Check it out, dweebs! Betcha can't shoot this apple off my head. Hm Not really what I meant. But, okay. But I still got my apple here, William Tell! Nice buzz cut. High and tight. Hey! It worked. Now, let's try it on something more complex. I'm complex! Really, I'm like an onion. Whoa. It's like there's thousands of you guys. Oops! I forgot to install the Fly Filter. Better try that again. Sorry, Buford. Are you all right? I have a weird craving for something stinky. He's all right. Okay, Ferb, let's get that skateboard before Grandpa breaks his neck. What in blazesâ Yes! It worked! Oops. I say, that's peculiar. My bloomin' feet have gone missing. I can breathe again! I smell lupins! Better send his feet back. They're back! Egad, they're facin' me 'iney! I say, ha-ha, I can get the 'ang of this! Now I can finally see where I've been! Crackin'! Now, let's try out that half-pipe. Hey, where's Perry? Hello, Agent P. Nice entrance today. Simple and understated. I like it. Anyway, we have a situation. We recently discovered that all of the mimes in Danville Park have been trapped in actual invisible boxes. It took days to discover because, well, everyone just assumed they were really good mimes. I'm not even a mime! I'm a robot guy! We're convinced that it has something to do with a new machine Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been working on. We're sending you a photo of his new -inator. Oh-ho, yeah! It looks evil all right. You better destroy it. Good luck, Agent P! Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? We're conducting an experiment with our mega-half-pipe and our new photo transporter. Okay, Ferb, let 'er rip! No way! Yeah! Yeah! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Â¡Oy, carumba! I've got to tell Mom! Now where did she say she was going again? (Song: Mexican-Jewish Cultural Festival)  It's the Mexican-Jewish cultural festival!   Mexican-Jewish cultural festival!   Oy-le!   There is kreplach on tostadas   A pupik in our piÃ±ata   We kibitz when we lambada   How are things in Ensenada?   We put bottles on cabezas   We do mitzvahs up on mesas   And we're coming to your places   With big smiles upon our faces.   It's the Mexican-Jewish cultural festival!   There is kreplach on tostadas   A pupik in our piÃ±ata   We kibitz when we lambada   How are things in Ensenada?   We put bottles on cabezas   Mexican-Jewish cultural festival!   We do mitzvahs up on mesas   And we're coming to your places   With big smiles upon our faces.  Â¡Oy-lÃ©! Candace, I'm so glad you could make it! Mom, you've gotta come home, right away! Phineas and Ferb Haveâ Th-they built aâ Thâ A thing thatâ Thatâ Oh, what's the use? I'll only drive you home to find that the boys' contraption I wanna show you has inexplicably disappeared, and once again, you'll think I've lost my marbles. That does seem to be a pattern, doesn't it? Come on! Enjoy the festival! Here, have a dreidel-raca! You think your machine can find my long lost teddy bear? I got his picture right here. Hmm Let's give it a shot. Teddy Boo Boo! Where have you been, you bad bear?! I bet you've been on the road again, haven't you?! Well, you're grounded, mister! Oh, I love you! You know, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro, every time I try to show my mom something, it disappears and she thinks I'm crazy. What do you think I should do? Eat! You're too thin! Have a matzah ball-rito! Err Thanks.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Who's tap tap tapping? Is that that pesky raven again? Oh, big surprise! Perry the Platypus! And by ""surprise"", I mean completelyâ Uh.. Uh I got nothin'. I was really expecting the raven. I'll be honest. And by the way, you're trapped in an invisible box! Yes, I know, I trapped you before in an invisible cage, but this is different! It's a box! It's all part of my evil plan to rid the world of annoying mimes! You see, recently, I was strolling through the park, when suddenly, I had the strangest feeling that people were looking at me. And laughing! Probably because people were actually looking at me and laughing! I couldn't figure out what was going on until I turned around and saw a mime! He was mocking me, my walk, my incessant hand-wringing, my mantis-like posture! Then, that I decided to get even. Behold! The Mime-inator! With this baby, I'm going to trap every mime in the Tri-State Area, in their very own invisible box! I know, huh? Fun with irony! Okay, Ferb. We're ready! How 'bout you? I'm tasting the clouds! I'm feelin' the ozone! I am dryin' my pits! Say, ""Â¡Queso!"" Wait a minute. The photo transporter! All I have to do is put my mom's photo in the machine, then she'll be transported right to the boys! Right? Jess? Then the boys' invention can't disappear before Mom sees it because she'll be in it! It's fool-proof! Phineas and Ferb will be busted once and for all! Can I borrow this? Hey! My mom gave me that! Smile! Aha. Aha! Aha. Aha! Aha. Aha! Aha. Aw. Aha! It's nice to see you giving up your obsession with the boys and getting into the spirit of things. Aha. Aha! Aha. Aha! Perry the Platypus, you really are quite the mime! It really looks like you are inside an invisible bâ Oh, that's right! You really are inside an invisible box! I'm already tired of that joke, but I can't stop saying it. You know, it works so well with the mimes that I decided to put everyone in the Tri-State Area in an invisible box! Oh, for crying out loud! And now, to pull the switch! Thanks for the headache! Thanks for the face-ache! Has everyone had a chance to try the machine? Yeah, I got my teddy bear. I got my missing Mindy doll. And I found my missing Uncle Maulik! Baljeet, I was just on vacation. Oh. Were you having a good time? I was. Perry's not back yet. I know! I'll put a photo of him in the machine and transport him back here. No, Perry the Platypus, don't press the self-destruct button! You're all so busted! Oh, there you are, Perry! Ah-ha-ha! Move it! This is it! The ultimate bust! Okay. Oopsies! Ha! Come on! You gotta put more effort into it! Â¡Oy, carumba! More effort? You got it! Yes! It worked! Mom! Mom, look! Where is the piÃ±ata? Mom! W-Where did he go? He was standing right there about to foil my evil plans and now I'mâ And now I'm totally free to move forward with my heinous project! Woo-hoo! MOM! There is no candy in me! Look out! There is no candy in me! Could somebody please tell me if I am warm or cold? You're cold! There is no candy in me! Why is this happening?! And now, invisible boxes for everyone! Sure! Why not?! Mom! Look! Mom! Look! Mom! Look! Oh, my goodness! I walked all the way home? I guess it's hard to judge distances blindfolded. Well, snacks anyone? Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Bu-bu-bu-bu-but (Song: There is No Candy in Me) Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  There is no candy in me  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  There is no candy in me!  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  I am just a little boy  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  There is no candy in me!  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  Your mother is blindfolded  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  So she cannot see!  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  She attacked me with a bat!  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but  There is no candy in me!  Bu-bu-bu-bu-but Nerd ain't no piÃ±ata!"
"by ashirogi27 It's totally time for a totally favorite TV show! Hey, Jeremy. Care to have a seat? I have something to show you. It's impossibly important Ooh, it's starting! Shhhh (Song: ""Let's All Dance Until We're Sick"" theme)  Oh, yeah   Everybody get up, time to shimmy and shake!   Stomp and twist 'til your ankles break!   Jumpin' all around like a pogo stick!   Let's all dance until we're sick!   Let's all dance until   We're sick!  Hi ya! Nikki Stars here. Get ready, Danville. This week, the world's most popular dance contest is coming to you! See Jeremy, that's my surprise. They're taping here in Danville and I already entered us! No, way! You guys are totally gonna win! Sure, Candace! Um.. I'm gonna go get some fresh air, okay? Okay! He's so excited to get free! So, brother of mine, whatever shall we engage in today? Hey Jeremy! What's the haps, Big Guy? Oh, man. Your sister's into that some big dance show. Andâ You know, I just don't wanna let her down. So, what's the problem? Have you seen the fancy dancing on the show? I can fake it in a school auditorium. Just not in a nationally syndicated dance show. Oh, maybe Ferb can teach you. Wow. That's reallyâ Uhp-uhp! Wait for it There's no way I can learn that by tonight. Hm Maybe you don't have to. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! What? Oh-ho, sorry. Hey! I wonder where Perry is! Ah, Agent P. Seems Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up the entire Tri-State Area's supply of, potatoes, vegan, and whole boatloads of chopped green onions, sounds like a recipe for evil. Literally! So, uh Get cooking, Agent P! Monogram out. So, here it is! The Ferbalistic Groovatron 9000! How is that supposed to help me? You put it under your clothes, and nobody will see this electronic exoskeleton helping you with dance moves! Ferb does the fancy dancing move over here, and you do the same fancy move over there! Sweet.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incâ  Intruder alert. Well, well, well, look who's here. Perry the Platypus. All shackled up and no place to go! Yeah, I think we made too much potato salad, Norm. Iâ I guess we'll have to give everyone a 2-ton take-home container. And I still think you should have added more green onions. Well, next time you can do all the cooking and I'll stand around coming up with evil plans that ultimately fail! Wow. Cuttin' deep, man. Well, I'm off to an annual evil potluck and press conference. I'll just leave you here to, you know, meet your doom. That, I saw it in a movie once. I didn't catch the ending, because I have other things to do, but i-it seems pretty foolproof. Well, gotta run! Can't be in two places at the same time, but of courseâ Soon you'll be able to Norm, let's go. Would it kill you to say please once in a while? You going to be like this all day? Yes. Yes, I am. We're so going to win this thing, Jeremy. We are going TO WIN! Dancers! Your dance floor awaits! Our dancers will boogie until they get axed by the judges. If your light goes out, your time is up. Now, let the dancing begin! Ready? Alright Heinz, where's the press? Patience, Dr. Bloodpudding, they'll be here. When have I ever let you guys down? Far too often, Doofenshmirtz. Far too often. Rodney, I don't remember inviting you. I told you! I prefer you use my full name. Aloyse Everheart Elizabeth Otto Wolfgang Hypatia Gunther Galen Gary Cooper von Roddenstein! Anyway, today is the day we reveal to the Tri-State Area, the existence, of the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness! You want us to be called L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.? Oh, good grief! It doesn't matter what we're called. What's important is that we get our evil message out to the people of the Tri-State Area! And how are we going to that with no TV cameras or no press of any kind? They'll be here, they'll be here. Clearly, the buffet alone will bring 'em. Yummy, yummy potato salad! And we do seem to have a surplus of that. Did you expect everyone to lug home 2-ton take home bags? No. Yes! Shut it, Norm. Whose side are you on, anyway? And the press will be here, Rodney. I don't think so, Heinz! Dr. Diminutive? Here, look. All the present town is covering this. That's right. Let's Dance 'Til We're Sick is filming here in Danville. And I've got all the live coverage 24/7! Huh! Well, if the press won't come to us, we'll go to the press! To the dance hall! Attention, miserable citizens of Danville! Hello? Evil scientist speaking! C-Can I get a hand over here? What? Nothing? Why are they so focused on these dancers? Because it's a dance contest, Heinz. Clearly, they're only filming the best dancers! Hm. Wait! That's it! Okay, split up and start dancing like you've never danced before! Whoever gets on camera first, they deliver our message of evil! They're terrible! Oh, the humanity! This looks like a job for Aloyse Everheart Elizabethâ Oh, can it, Rodney. I think we both know that I'm a better evil dancer than you. See this? It's my hand. You can talk to it. All right. Hey, hand! My evil dancing's better than yours. It's like you're stuck in a canoe but you've got no oars. See you on the dance floor! Nobody talks to my hand that way! Agent P, you must stop Doofenshmirtz and his unnamed gang of evil scientists before they broadcast their message of evil, and interrupt what is quickly become my and Carl's favorite show. Well, this shindig is in full swing! Looks like the judges are starting to eliminate dancers. Who will survive? They're eliminating people. Let's kick it up a notch! People of the Tri-State Area, you may begin pointing in fear at your earliest possible convenience ofâ Wait, really? W-Were you even watching that move? Well, my future subjects, it is I, Aloyse Everheart Elizâ This is ful zwein So I represent the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investmentsâ Ah! Philistine! Thatâ That was a perfectly good Charleston! Wow! You're realâly good! Bravo! Bravo! Go, Candace! Oh, man! That guy is awesome! Looks like someone's a fan favorite. Hang on in 90s! Ugh! Wait, that's my spotlight! If anyone's pushing this dancer out of the way, it's me! Oh no, Doofenshmirtz, I was here first! Am I gonna have to talk to your hand again?! Maybe in your own mind! No! Mine! This is awkward And look! There's only one dancer left standing! Let's see what he does. Say, that was some fabulicious dancing out there! I see quite a future for someone with moves like that! Is she saying what I think she's saying? How'd you like to dance 'til you're sick every week? Do it, Jeremy, do it! We could be stars! Dancing stars! We canâ Candace, I can't do this. All those great dance moves I've been doing today Well It was actually That's kind of disturbing. It was this crazy contraption doing all those dance moves. If you wanna see what a real dancer looks like, then here you go! Well, it looks like my work here is done. I'm sorry about all this, Candace. Iâ I just didn't want to let you down. Oh, Jeremy. You weren't gonna let me down. I just wanted you to come out with me and have a good time! And you know, dance 'til we're sick! Well, I am feeling a little dizzy. I got ya, big guy. They should have called it Let's All Dance Until We're In Intensive Care. Wow!"
"by ashirogi27 Look at that, my fine feathered friends! Not a bad bit of work, even if I do say so myself. Just wait till you see the hidden surprise. Oh, nothing? Not even a sausage? No matter. Wait until Linda and the kids see it. It will blow their tiny minds. Well, not their tiny minds, that's not fair. You're watching the UNcovery Channel. We now return to Rrrrr? Many believe that in the 1950s, a UFO crash landed in Roswell, New Mexico. But the scientists had no idea what the advanced technology was or how it worked. To find out, they used a process called, reverse engineering. By closely examining the individual parts, they were able to build their own craft and figure out what it does, and how it does what it does. Way to go, reverse engineering! The reverse engineering craze reached its zenith in 1982 when new wave band Zanzibar released their smash reverse engineering-related hit, ""What Do It Do?""  Do do, do do do  Cool! Hey, where's Perry? Hey, Carl, where's Agent P? Oh, he came in early today, sir. He did? Heh. Well, good for him. Well, I guess we're done. I'm going home. Me, too? No, not you.  Doofenshmirtz Rocket-powered Jet Skiff!  Ha! Close! But, no! Cigar! See, Perry the Platypus, my new jet rocket skiff has more hidden traps than Uh Um Ehâ Uh What's something with a lot of hidden traps? Huh Wow, I felt so confident going into that sentence. Man, okay. Anyway, you might be wondering why I got such an early start on my evil scheme today. You see, my dating life has been a seemingly endless series of disappointments. It all started at a drive-in movie.  That's wings, you turkey  Okay, the coast is clear! You can come out now! Eww. It's grody back here! Well, on the bright side, you got in for free, so We'll just split the cost of my ticket, right? Right? You know, I could've gotten in the trunk, like, a block away instead of when you first picked me up at my house. Wow, you just love to live in the past, huh? Is that like a thing with you? Whatever. Let's just try to enjoy the rest of the evening. I am a happy robot, likey what I hear. I'm just kidding, that's a thing I do. C'mon, hop in!  That's wings, you turkey  You were listening to, ""That's Wings, You Turkey"" by King of Loud. And here's a new one from Zanzibar, ""What Do It Do?"" (Song: ""What Do It Do?"") Oh, turn it up! I love this song!  Do, do, do, do, do, do!  Eh, it's okay, I'd say it's in my top seven, eight favorite songs about reverse engineering.  Do, do, do, what do it do?  Makes me want to be a pop star!  What'cha gonna does when you don't know what it do?  Ha! Yeah right, and I'm going to rule the world! Well  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do!  Why not? Yeah, like I could do that.  What does, what does, what does, what do it do?  Maybe instead of, you know The whole world  Do, do, do, what do it do?  Uh Start small, with the Tri-State Area. Hey, the movie's starting! You have to put the speaker thing on the car. No-no-no-no! Check this out. I built this awesome device that transmits the movie sound in fifth-dimensional stereo! I just plug this in here and voila! I am a clever robot. Bing-bong, bing-boing. Huh. So, can we hold hands now? Take me home. Fine. Get in the back. And I never saw her again. Oddly enough, she did become a pop star later! I'm still struggling with the whole Tri-State Area thing, but y'know, the dream is alive. Anyway, they recently reopened that drive-in, dredging up all these unpleasant memories for me. So, naturally, I built this. Oh, really?! Really?! Okay, Mom. I've gotta get to Stacy's! Love ya! Bye! Oop! Mom! Mom! Mom!! Come here! Look what Phineas and Ferb made in the front yard! Quick! Oh, yeah. You're in suchâ The boys built that?! Yes! They're always making crazy things like this! See?! See?! What is it?! Well, obviously, it's aâ Why don't you ask/bust them?! Ask/bust us what? Do you mind telling me what this is and why you built it in our front yard?! Um We didn't build this, Mom. Ha! Quick! Bust 'emâ Wait. You didn't? Not that I'm aware of, no! Ferb? No one is going anywhere until we figure out what this is and where it came from! Hmm Let's see what this red button's all about. Don't! Touch it! Nobody touches it! I'm calling your father. Hey, Ferb. Reverse engineering, huh? Huh? I know what we're gonna do today! Think again, Bucko! Mom said ""No touchee-touchee!"" We don't need to touchee-touchee. We have a portable electronic scanner, gumption, and another portable electronic scanner. Well, I'll be watching you closely. So don't think you can get oneâ All done, Ferb? Cool! Let's get reverse engineering! And here's the 17th century Whiskershire spring stick, which belonged to the Earl of Whiskershire. Oh, 'scuse me for a second. Hullo. Honey, do you know about the thing in the front yard? Oh, yes, of course I do, honey. I made it myself. Do you like it? You Made that?! Ahem. Look, darling, I'm in the middle of something right here, so I'll have to phone you back. Butâ Okay, honey, but don't press the red button on it, will you? I want to be there when you see it, okay? Well, okay, but I'm really not very comfortable withâ Cheers, love! Bye! You know, in retrospect, I probably went a little overboard with the traps on this thing. Alright, I'm gonna try to reach the release switch for the trap holding your arms. Then you try to reach the steering wheel, and change our course away from Mount Kilimanjaro. Interesting trivia. Kilimanjaro is actually comprised of three volcanic cones. Kibo, Shira, and the one that we're about to crash into, Mawenzi. Cool, huh? There! Oh. Oh, that wasn't the release. Who knows what that did? This one should be the rightâ Okay I. Got it! Quick! You know, Perry the Platypus, I justâ A golf course! A golf course has a lot of traps in it! That's what I should've said. Well, it turns out your father is the one responsible for thisâ Hold on. Is it buzzing? Yes. Yes, it is. Okay, stay calm! Just move away from it! Friends, bullies, Irving, at 0900 hours, a UCO, or Unidentified Crashing Object, landed in our front yard. We've reverse-engineered a piece-by-piece duplicate of the strange object. We have called you here to help us discover what this object is and how it works. (Song: ""What Do It Do?"")  What'cha gonna does when you don't know what it do?   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do!   It's way too big to be a buckle, and too bland to be a belly dancer!   Or when it tries to guess your height, it's never right unless you're three-foot-two   When you come or go, you can't tell if it waves goodbye or waves hello!   And in the library it's useless 'cause it don't care when the books are due!   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do   It doesn't seem to understand the game is not rock-paper-scissors-spaniel!   Instead of picking up the trash it started picking Lady Liberty's nose!   It makes a lousy baseball umpire or brow-wiper for bongo players!   And when it walks a dog it never really pays attention where it goes!   Do, do, do, do, do, do, do   Do, do, do, do, do   What do it do?  Soon, the entire village of Whiskershire began following the Earl's lead to, of courseâ Uh, do forgive me. I-I-I'm awfully sorry. Hello? Lawrence, you have to come home right now! This thing is freakin' me out! Uh-uh, L-Linda, my dear, I love you, but you couldn't have chosen a worse moment to go completely bonkers! I'm sorry, but I've got to call you back! Bye! Ohh, he doesn't believe me! He said I sound crazy! Ohhh, re-e-e-e-e-ally? Yeah! It's not like I'm not imagining this! Of course not! Gosh, that must be so frustrating to have someone not believe you when you're telling the truth! Oh, you don't know the half of it. That feeling you have right now, that's how I feel every single day when you don't believe me about what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Now that you finally understand, will you come with me to the backyard? Why? Now, keep in mind how Dad just made you feel, okay? Phineas and Ferb have reverse-engineered and built an exact duplicate of this thing, and at this very moment, they're trying to figure out what it does by forcing it to belly dance and work in a library. Candace, honey, I love you, but you couldn't have chosen a worse moment to go completely bonkers! Pierre! Did anyone look? I betcha, like, half the people down there are looking around, like, ""Who called my name?"" You know, Isabella, I sometimes wonder if it was mere coincidence that it was you and I chosen to portray the young, happy couple. ""Chosen?"" Baljeet, you charged to that empty chair like a crazed wolf. Ah, here we are, madame and monsieur. And what can I get for you this afternoon? Ah-buh-bup! Give. Hmm Interesting. Okay. There's been no change in the last ten minutes. I should call your father. You know, Mom, I understand. Obviously, you're not gonna come see what Phineas and Ferb are up to until this is resolved. So here's what we're gonna do! First of all, no more calling Dad! If I don't convince you to come home to bust the boys after a couple of calls, I go get you! But what if he doesn't wanna come with me? Did that ever stop me? This statue, which stands outside the Whiskershire Rectory, still holds the Earl's actual spring stick, yes. The spring stick is used as such. It's placed in front of you so as to spring the hidden mousetraps to avoid capture. Now some suggestâ Move it, Fletcher! Oh, any questions? Ah, the quaint town of Whiskershire. It's a great place to fly nilly-willy through, manacled to a rocket skiff this time of year. Friends, bullies, Irving, we've reached our conclusion as to the purpose of the object that landed in our front yard. We believe that it is an anti-romance rocket created to scan for, and then eliminate romantic elements from potentially amorous situations. Ohh. So it's not a wedgie machine? This is gonna be awesome, Stace! So when they get home, I'm gonna drag both of them into the backyard, and it'll be a busting feeding frenzy!  Bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water  W-W-Wait a minute! Perry the Platypus, where are youâ? Oh!  Agent P!  Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  Bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water   It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water   Oh, yeah   I like the way the sunlight glistens off your chrome  Wow. Two anti-romance rockets falling in love. That's what I call ""ironing"".  It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water   It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water  There! Tell me that's not terrifying!  It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water   It's a bustin' feedin' frenzy, stay out of the water  I'm so sorry I doubted you.  Going down down down at the busting feeding frenzy, stay out of the water!  Wait! But Candace, where did that thing go? Hm. I don't know! But, Mom, you and Dad have to come to the backyard with me right now and see what the boys areâ Nevermind. I wonder what would make someone want to build something to destroy romance in the first place. Well, if you reverse-engineer the human heart, you're bound to find love at its core. And Gross smushy red stuff! Yes. Love and gross smushy red stuff. And ventricles! Actually, I think ventricle is already included in gross squishy red stuff. Yeah."
"by ashirogi27 Ahh, a nice relaxing day at the beach. Nothing but the waves, the sun and peace and quiet Buford drank all the sunscreen! Coconut is my favorite flavor! Who wants to play volleyball? I spoke too soon. Oh, Candace, look! There is a sandcastle building contest over there. You used to love those. You should sign up! Yeah! Wait Why bother? With these two here, there will be no competition. They'll build a real skyscraper out of sand, with a working elevator! And window-washers! And a parking garage with flying cars! They'll totally steal my thunder! Actually, there's something else we may be doing today. With a minimal amount of research, Ferb found out that The Lost City of Atlantis is probably located right off the coast of Danville! Ooh! I hope I'll finally see a real life seahorse! And get my Underwater Equestrian Patch! I'd like to see a shark! I heard it is the toughest fish in the ocean. I got in the car when your mom stopped for gas. I'm just happy to be here. Wow. Ooh! And I brought my camera, to take pictures of all the action! Guess we know what we're doing today. Hey, where's Perry?  Doo wa doo be doo be doo wa doo be doo be doo wa  Thank you, thank you very much.  Agent P!  Ahh, Agent P! Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been to every plant-nursery in town, buying up little seedlings, and now he's out and about in his blimp. Find out what he's up to! Carl? Ohh Sir? Are those my old mustache clippings? Some of them? Sorry you had to see that, Agent P. Please find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to! Hey, Mom! We're gonna go find The Lost City of Atlantis! Be back later! What imaginations Mom! Ooh, they're leaving! Mom, get out the turret molds. We've got a sandcastle to build! Okay everybody, follow me! And remember, if you get lost, the surface is up! Wow! Is that the Titanic over there? Look! It's Amelia Earhart! Ah, the tomb of Poseidon. Focus, guys. We're looking for Atlantis, remember? Which way, Ferb? Take phytoplankton road, north. Hold it! That one's for my wallet! Why is the water always so warm next to you? I'm so glad you want to join the contest. This'll be fun! If we're going to do this, we gonna do it right! Here. Fill these buckets with water. I'm going to go find some sand. Lunchtime, my little plant friends! Yes, you like your water, don't you! Everyone gets H2O Even you little algaeâ Oh, Perry the Platypus! You landed in my fertilizer trap! Look at you. You've potting soiled yourself! So, I got to thinking, why use animals or insects to aid in my evil scheme, when there are these shiftless do-nothing-plants just laying around? So, I've created a super evil growth formula, that when sprayed on my plants, will turn them into thorny, prickly minions! With them under my control, I will rule the Tri-State Area, with an iron fist, and a green thumb! And, if you don't mind, I'm going upwind of you. We're almost there, guys! Turn right at kelp. These skulls are pretty cool! Hey! It's okay, Irving. You still have the greatest camera ever made. Where? Right here. The human mind. You can take pictures with your mind and store them in your memory. Try it! Okay Click! Well, I guess that worked. Seahorses! You can get your Underwater Equestrian Patch now! Um That was a joke. They're way to small to ride. Not if you scoop up a whole bunch of them! Giddy up! Hey, guys! Look what I found! A door, with ancient runes telling us how to open it! Forget that! Step aside! Or that. (Song: Atlantis)  Atlantis!   Submerged city, you enchant us  Click!  Oh Poseidon, please grant us   Entry to the city of Atlantis!   Atlantis is a city at the bottom of the sea   It's soggier now than it used to be   'Cause it used to be above now it's down below   It's the waterlogg-ed city of Atlantis!   Every room and every house has an oceanic view   If you shoo away a whale or a manatee or two   There's not a better, wetter place for you to go   Than the waterlogg-ed city of Atlantis!   Well, the forecast says the humidity is high   And it's not your kind of place if you wanna stay dry   You can always have tea with the sea anemone   In the waterlogg-ed city of Atlantis   In the waterlogg-ed city   In the waterlogg-ed city!  And everything is so pretty.  In the waterlogg-ed city of Atlantis!  Okay, everyone, moving closer, while I put my camera on a timer! I think he's taken this camera thing to a weird level. Say ""cheese""! Click! We are so privileged to be here in this strange and beautiful place. To think that the greatest mind in history have been searching for Atlantis for thousands of years. Those guys are punks. We should bring this up to the surface for the whole world to see! Oh, yes. How do we do it? That is a great idea. Up! Up! Ugh! This is the third time it's fallen! I used to be good at this! Now I'm Frank Lloyd Wrong! When did it get so hard? Oh, man! This is super simple! Ugh, I hate this stupid contest. I quit! Hon, will you relax? This is supposed to be fun. Hey, Candace! Hey, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher! Jeremy?! Hi! Uh So, what brings you to the magnificent shores of Danville? Well, I'm the judge of the contest this year. No way! Way! I'm excited to see what you two come up with! But, you better get started. Time's tickin'! Mom? Why are you just standing there? Sandcastles don't build themselves. Chop chop! You see, Perry the Platypus? Your efforts to stop me have been fruitless. Fruitless. Y-You like that? That's a good one! Yeah, yeah. Next time you'll ""leaf"" me alone! Yes, Perry the Platypus, I sure can be a fun guy. Get it? Fungi? Plural of fungus? It's a Yeah Anyway, grow, my green minions and get him! Wait, wait, not me! Not meâ Hey, wait, don'tâ Don't be grab! I-I gotta turn this thing off. This has become a thorny situation, Iâ Four weather balloons and helium canisters, for underwater delivery. That's us! Aren't you kids a little young to be discovering Atlantis? Yes. Yes, we are. Well, good for you. Alright guys, let's get to work! Oh, no! Jeremy's almost here! Help, Perry the Platypus, help! Aha! Yes! Yes, Perry, you got it! That's it, you're free now, and nowâ Now, move over here andâ Wait! Where are you going? Perry the Platypâ Okay guys, tie the balloons to the four corners of Atlantis. Looks good, Ferb! Woo-hoo! It's working! Woo-hoo-hoo! Yes! Lookin' good, guys! Looks kinda cool! This is horrible! Jeremy's gonna take a look at this, and think I'm a big losery loser! Oh, honey. Jeremy's smart enough to separate his feelings about your sandcastle from his feelings about you! Okay Uh, last, but not least, we have the Flynn-Fletchers. Well It's not perfect, but We had fun doing it, so I give you, our sandcastle. Holy Moly, Candace! I know, I know, it's not great, but we did our best. Are you kidding? It's amazing! You win! You win! I'm going to get your blue ribbon. Huh? I have to say, I think Jeremy can't separate his feelings for you from his feelings for this sandcastle. He must like you more than you thought. I know! Let's go get that blue ribbon! Perry the Platypus, you came back and saved me! Thank you, Perry the Platyâ Whaâ Oh, what's this? Iâ I'm having an allergic reaction to these stupid plants! Curse you, inadequate immune system! What happened? Did anybody see it? Why did it go back down? Perhaps The Lost City of Atlantis wanted to stay lost. At least I got the pictures in my head. Hey! I had my thumb in front of the lens the whole time! Ugh! Now all I remember is my thumb!"
"by  ashirogi27  There are two wondrous weeks for our winter vacation   Before New Years and school comes to end it   So the holiday challenge for kids of all nations   Is finding a good way to spend it  Ah, Christmas Eve. It was a great idea to climb back into bed this morning. Oh! I almost forgot! Helmets! All set? Let's do this thing.  Like maybe   Turning our beds into dual toboggans,   And sliding down a ski jump tower!   Building a snowman the size of Colossus,   Or giving a yeti a shower!   (Fa, la, la, la!)   Staging a snowball fight   With giant catapults,   And snow angels that really fly!   Rocking a Christmas carol,   Wrapping a present,   Or just shoveling snow off the drive!  Well, they can't all be fun.  As you can see there's a whole lot of stuff to do before school starts next year   So stick with us   'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna spread some Christmas cheer!   So stick with us   'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna spread some Christmas cheer!  Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a Christmas special! We're slowing down. I SEE WHY DOGS ENJOY THIS SENSATION! Delayed! What do you mean delayed? Candace, honey, the snow storm has delayed your grandparents' plane. Your father and I have to wait here at the airport until they arrived. It may be hours But I need your help! Stacy told me that Marcus told her that Jeremy told him that he got the perfect gift for me! Oh, no. How will you manage? Mom, think! If Jeremy found the perfect gift for me, then I have to find the perfect gift for him! I thought you already got a gift for Jeremy. I did, but I can't show up with an obvious, stupid present that anyone could've gotten him. The perfect gift means that you totally get the other person in the most deep and paying-attention-y way. If his gift to me is perfect and my gift to him isn't, he's gonna be so hurt and insulted, and think I'm lame, and thoughtless, and he'll stop liking me! Oh, Candace, honey, I don't think You poor thing. Forgive me, boys. What are your brothers up to? Not a thing. Which is weird. What are they up to? Love you, Mom, gotta run, bye! Plow! House! We're coming in too fast! Those two are so busted! For lolly-gagging in bed? That's not like you two. We've been working on a way to seize the day, while also not having to get out of bed so early. I think we can cross that one off our To-Do List. Let me see that. What is this? Number one was write letters to Santa. What, did you start this To-Do List when you were three years old?! We write letters to Santa Claus every year. Don't you? Letters to Santa?! That's for little kids! Santa's not just for little kids, Candace. Okay, fine. Let's assume there is a Santa Claus. Well of course there is. There's been a ton of reported sightings. Oregon, 1978. Northern Scotland, 1954. The so-called Santa Cloth found in Istanbul, 1912. Santa's one of our biggest heroes. Talk about making the most out of one day. Imagine, flying around the whole world, delivering toys and gifts to everybody in one night. Ferb and I have done some cool stuff in our time, but that, that's something else. Again, let's assume there is a Santa Claus. He's got it easy. The hard part is trying to figure out what to get people when they don't write you a letter, telling you exactly what they want most. And by ""people"", I mean ""Jeremy"", and by ""you"", I mean ""me"". And uh No, the rest is pretty much literal. Well, I'm sure Jeremy would get exactly what he wanted. If he wrote his own letter to Santa. Letters to Santa?! Wow. That's for little kids. She's lapped us. Wait, that's it! I'll trick Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa, so I can sneak a peek and learn what he wants straight from the horse's mouth. And by ""mouth"", I mean ""pen"", and by ""horse"", I mean ""Jeremy"". And, yeah, we're good. Or you could ask him directly what he wants to avoid any unnecessary complications. Ah, you are such a child sometimes. You know, Ferb, just think of all the wonderful things Santa does for us, and he never asks for anything in return. Wait, that's it! Ferb, are you thinking what I'm thinking? As usual, we'reâ Oh! Ugh! Man, no, that's not at all what I was thinking! Oh, dude! Oh, yeah. That's it. I'll call in the troops, you wonder where Perry is.  Fa la la la la la   La la la la la la   Fa la la la la la la!  Hello! Wintertime's fun! Follow me! Come on! Follow me! Plow! Ah, Agent P, there you are. Merry Christmas. Oh great, you brought snacks. Wintertime's fun. Follow me! Secret Santa time. Agent P. Ah, here you are. Oh, a ""Sal Tuscany Christmas"". You lucked out, Agent P. Your secret Santa has exquisite taste. Criminy, Carl. It's supposed to be a secret Santa. What? No! I didn't get it for him. Huh, right. No, really I didn't! The more you protest, the more we know you gave it to him. Fine! Think what you want! Whatever! Huh. Okay, Scrooge. We got it. Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Sorry Agent P. Iâ I guess evil never takes a holiday. If you'll direct your attention to the screen. Good morning Agent, P. A wise man once saidâ eyes on the screen. A wise man once said, ""Evil never takes a holiday"". We don't know what Doofenshmirtz is up to. But he's evil, it's Christmasâ Evil people hate Christmas. It's a cliche. Sad cliche. Good luck, Agent P, and Merry Christmas. Carl! Stop filming your butt. Film mine. It's a party! Woo-hey! Hello? Happy Christmas Eve, my little drummer boy. Hey, Candace. You know I don't play drums. I play guitar. I know silly-billy. So, what'cha doin'? Not sleeping anymore. How 'bout you? I just thought it was the perfect day to show some Christmas spirit. Like when you were young and wrote letters to Santaâ Would you keep that lame junk away from my window?! I'm sorry, what was I saying? Writing letters to Santa Claus? Letters to Sâ Oh! Brilliant idea. Let's get together and write letters to Santa, and be very specific, within a reasonable price range. For fun. I'll be over in a bit. Candace, this isn't one of these thingâ He doesn't suspect a thing. Awesome! Phase one complete. Hey, guys. Cool clubhouse. Oh, no. This is not how you would say, a ""clubhouse"". This is the ultimate rest and relaxation lounge, perfectly tailored to the jolly, rubenesque world traveler. It's a rest stop for Santa. Oh, I see. Oh, why did you not just say that? Highlights include Sauna, massage table, satellite television, elliptical machine to work off all the milk and cookies, milk and cookies, reindeer feeding station, and of course, beard purifier. But, this is only the beginning. Remember when you wrote letters to Santa asking him for presents? Yes. Letters to Santa?! Did you always get the presents you asked for? Pretty much, yes! Of course. Now, did you ever write a thank-you note to Santa? Well, no. Butâ Nobody ever toldâ No. Well, I think it's time someone did something cool for Santa to show him we appreciate everything he does for us. So, we're gonna turn the entire city of Danville into a giant, shimmering thank-you card to Santa Claus. So, what you're saying is, it's not a clubhouse.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. I have a present for you. And by ""present,"" of course, I mean ""trap."" Aw, look how festive you are. Wait, wait, hold on!  And a partridge on a Perry  the Platypus! Now, Perry the Platypus, behold! The Naughty-inator! When activated, the naughty nectar in these giant glass cylinders will create a massive charged cloud of pure naughtiness. When Santa then makes his list, and checks it twice, everyone in the Tri-State Area will appear to be naughty instead of nice! And no nice equals no Santa equals no Christmas! There's just one tiny, little blemish on my otherwise perfect plan. Iâ Don't actually have a problem with Christmas. There's no tragic holiday-related back-story in my past. Christmas was always fine growing up. It wasn't great, it wasn't horrible. You see, unlike every other evil scientist, I don't hate Christmas. There are plenty of other holidays I can't stand.  For example  Wait, wait, hold on. I-I can't get thisâ Uh,  for example  (Song: ""I Really Don't Hate Christmas"")  You see Valentine's is torture   And my birthday is a mess   New Year's is a lot of noise, and Arbor Day's a pest   Halloween's a horror but I guess I must confess   That I really don't hate Christmas!   You see Flag Day is infernal, April Fool's is just a bore   Mardi Gras a waste, unless you own a candy store   All these other holidays I can admit that I abhor   But I really don't hate Christmas!   Now, it isn't that I like it, all the most I feel ambivalence   But should I really just destroy it? I'll admit that I'm still on the fence   It makes me tense!   From the evil scientist community I'm sure to get ejected   But for Christmas I can't seem to summon any true invective   Because what is there to hate? I mean, it's really so subjective   No, I really don't hate Christmas!   I hate puppy dogs and kittens, I hate flowers in the spring   Heck, I even hate the sunshine and the birdies when they sing   I can work up animosity for almost anything   Tell me why I don't hate Christmas!   Though my childhood was atrocious, Christmas never was that bad, you see   So the most that I can muster is complete and total apathy   What's wrong with me?   How can I prove that I'm an evil villain worth his salt   When with a holiday so jolly I can't even find a fault?   If I didn't feel ambiguous I'd launch a big assault   But I really don't hate Christmas!  Oh, what the heck. Kickline!  No, I really   No, I really don't hate Christmas!  I have an intense burning indifference! I didn't even create the Naughty-inator myself because I compulsively, obsessively, just couldn't be bothered. Nah, the plans were mailed to me from Borneo where my Uncle Justin is rumored to be in hiding. It's really a sweet gift, but how can I destroy Christmas without having a good reason? Well, I guess I have no choice. But to sit and wait for a reason. Alright everyone, I want to thank you all for helping. Grab yourself some decorations, and let's get our grateful on. (Song: That Christmas Feeling)  We're hanging the star above our tree   And don't it look lovely?   The lights and the tinsel sparkling for you!   I got that Christmas feeling   I take it everywhere I go   And make that Christmas feeling grow!   So warm by the fireplace we glow   All cozy and happy   Hang all the stockings in a row with you!   I got that Christmas feeling   I take it everywhere I go!   And make that Christmas feeling grow   It feels like Christmas   (Christmas)   Christmas   (Christmas)   Come on, I know you don't want to miss this!   Let's make that Christmas feeling grow   Oh!   Let's make that Christmas feeling grow!   Got that Christmas feeling   Tricked Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa   Yeah, yeah   it's that old Christmas feeling   Singing what I'm doing   Yeah, yeah  Hello, my little red nosed reindeer. Ready to write our letters to Santa? Hey. In a minute, Candace. I'm right in the middle here. I was thinking maybe you could help me finish decorating. First. No! It'll be too late! The stores will all be closed! And by ""stores"", I mean ""the post office"", and ""by buying a gift"", I mean ""mailing the letters"". You didn't say ""buying a gift"". Oh, good. That would've been a dead giveaway. Hey, everyone! The next decoration delivery is here! The tinsel! Wha- Wait! Come back! Our letters! We have to write them quickly! I already licked the stamps! You know, all I really want for Christmas is the ability to hate Christmas. Is that too much to ask? Hmm Were you expecting someone?  We wish you a Merry Christmas   We wish you a Merry Christmas   We wish you a Merry Christmas   And a Happy New Year  Ah, yes.  Now bring us some figgy pudding  See, how can you hate Christmas listening to that?  Now bring us some figgy pudding  Thatâ That can be very.  Now bring us some figgy pudding  Uh, ""bring us figgy pudding.""  And bring some right here  Well, you could say, please. But you know whatever great.  We won't go until we get some  Figgy pudding.  We won't go until we get some   We won't go until we get some   So bring some right here  Whoa! What?!  We won't go until we get some  A-Are you threatening me?  We won't go until we get some  How dare you!  We won't go until we get some  No one barges into my home and demand desserts.  So bring some right here  What sort of plan is that anyway? Let's go to a stranger's house and in a song form, refuse to leave unless he hands over a fruit dish no one's prepared since the 16th century. Well, if that's how things are, I have my reasons to push this button. So long, Christmas! You're Feliz Navi-dead to me! See? It's aâ Uh, it was Spanish. 'Tis the season to be naughty! Can I at least get a diet soda? Hmm What have we here? Ooh! Tsk! Tsk! Oh, Blay'n. Oop! What have you there? Oh, bunch of last minute naughties. It's a shame, huh, Clewn't? Kids! They get worse every year. Ungrateful littleâ I'm going to sit in the dark and mumble to myself. He wasn't always that way. In fact, he used to love kids. In fact, he used to be where the action is. Toy making. In fact, he was the fastest, best toy-maker of 'em all. In fact, they used to call him ""Clewn't, the fastest, best toy-maker of 'em all."" Though, they just called him ""Clewn't"" for short, which also happens to be his name, so the nickname thing was a kind of a moot point. In fact ""Just go up and talk to the first person you see. That's how you make friends."" I'm never going to another seminar. Okay, listen, you twerps. Your ridiculous efforts to thank Santa Claus are getting in the way of my ridiculous efforts to get Jeremy into writing a letter to Santa Claus. So why don't youâ Hey, what's with the clouds? Whoa! Is it me, or does the sky look really dark and ominous, as if its foreshadowing events which will have a negative impact on our lives. I'm sorry, kids. Looks like everyone in Danville got a return on their letters to Santa. They've all been stamped ""naughty"". What? Hey, Candace! Look! I did it. I wrote a letter to Santa saying in great detail what gift I want most. Cool! Thank you my Little Town of Bethlehem. I'll just hold onto that for you. Oh, I'll take that buddy. Huh? Maybe you'll have better luck with Santa than your friends. Butâ Butâ Ugh! Santa thinks everyone in Danville's been naughty? Now, that's just nonsense. Butâ But, how can that be? Oh, well, let's see. What's different this year than last year? Oh, I know! You went out and got everyone in Danville involved in one of your off-the-cuff, harebrained schemes. You think this could be my fault? Oh, who can say, really? But, y'know, sometimes, we do naughty things without ever having any idea they're naughty. Sometimes, we do an entire summer's worth of them. Could this be true? Oh, no I mean, how couldâ Well, I guess itâ I am cold. Maybe. This is Gordon Gutsofanemu reporting from the Googolplex Mall here in downtown Danville. The Christmas spirit is all but banished, ever since Santa Claus stamped the big red ""naughty"" across this once nice city. It was all a bad dream! Christmas wasn't cancelled! Phineas! No matter how many times you try that, it's not going to work. Maybe if I hadn't gotten out of bed today, I wouldn't have done the things Santa thought was naughty. So, what? Are you gonna stay here for the rest of your life? Why not? Well, for one, the mall closes in twenty minutes. I don't see what everyone's so worried about. I got this system, see? You act any way you want all year long, but then right before Christmas, you do one big selfless act of kindness and Santa will wipe your slate clean. Works like a charm. Really? So, I might still have my one big Christmas wish come true? Maybe. Are you not going to ask me what my Christmas wish is? Nope. It'll only make me wanna hurt you, which will counteract my one act of kindness. All I want is one sweet, special Christmas kiss under the mistletoe. I'm outta here. Not from you! From a pretty girl! Do not flatter yourself!  We won't go until we get some   We won't go until we get some  Ugh!  We won't go until we get some  Don't you guys see what's going on out there?  So bring some right here  Game over! Your plan failed!  We won't go until we get some  There's no figgy pudding!  We won't go until we get some  There's no Christmas! You can all just go home!  We won't go until we get some   It's a principle of a thing  Ugh! Come on, guys. Let's do ""but, it's Christmas, Becky"". You got to get over me, Josh! Okay, bye. I gotta get home. Suzy's pretty upset about Santa not coming. But, wait, no! Let's do some last minute window shopping. Candace, tell me what's wrong. I can't read your mind. Yes, you can. That's the problem. I don't understand. What is it you want from me? Oh, right! Like you need me to tell you that. The question is, what do you want from me? I just want you to tell me what you want. Fine! I just want you to tell me what you want. I don't want anything. Nothing? Oh, right! Yours is perfect, and I show up with nothing. Do you want me to look like a total monster?! Candace, that doesn't even make any sense. It's just that I think you're perfect, Jeremy. So, I don't understand why you want to make me feel like I'm not. Candace, you should know me better than that. Look. I have to go home. Oh, how did this go so wrong? (Song: Where Did We Go Wrong?)  How could we be naughty when I thought we'd been so nice?   Could we have been blinded to some little hidden vice?   Did our visions of sugarplums not dance like they should?   I'm rackin' my brain here, I really thought we were good   I know you've got that list   And I know you check it twice   But could you check it again 'cause it seems to me   We were all pretty nice  All except for Buford, 'cause he's got that whole ""last minute reprieve"" theory. It's gonna work. You watch.  Where did we go wrong?   Please tell me   Where did we go wrong?   Where did we go   Won't somebody tell me   Where did we go wrong?  No! Y-You know what? Iâ I can't except this. I know Danville, and Danville is not naughty. We have to get a message to the North Pole to let them know there's been some sort of mistake. But, how do we do that? Yes, they're not even answering our mail. Wait! I've got an idea. Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today. The North Pole? Well, I hate to tell you this Phineas, but WJOP only reaches the greater Danville area. We just don't have a very powerful transmitter. You leave that to us. (Song: Danville for Niceness)  Everybody's saying we're naughty   It's getting really hard to take   So we've come to let the whole world know there must have been a mistake   So if Santa and his elves can hear us   We hope we've been clear and concise   In the verses vice versus us   Vice versa, us versus vice.   Danville is very nice   Santa, please   Check your list more than twice   Guaranteed!   Danville is very nice  Danville. What's he talking about? Let me see that list of last minute naughties.  Santa, please  They're all from the same place.  Check your list more than twice  Hmm We've got to get to the bottom of this.  We won't go until we get some  Uh  We won'tâ  Uh, guys. Uh, lookâ uh Don't hate me, but Iâ I went into the kitchen to get some almond brittle Love it! and lo and behold it turns out I did have figgy pudding. Quite a bit, actually. Iâ I guess this whole thing was pretty easily resolved. I feel kinda sheepish that I'm making such a big deal. Anyway, here. Figgy pudding. Come on, guys. Our work here is done. Bye, bye now. Thanks for the evil motivation for destroying Christmas! Well, that was fun at least. What do you think the chances are that anyone in the North Pole saw that? Hello, hello, hello! I'd say pretty good. So, what's all this business about Danville, then? What's this? A Sal Tuscany Christmas? Score! What a perfect way to enjoy the last several hours before Christmas officially doesn't come.  We wish you a Merry Christmas   We wish you a Merry Christmas  Alright! Y-You know, this one's really grown on me.  We wish you a Merry Christmas   And a happâ  So, that's what happened. Do you think it could be a mistake? A whole city deemed naughty at once. I've never seen anything like it. Huh? Oh, hey, Candace. These are two of Santa's elves. You've gotta be kidding me. Blay'n, Clewn't, this is my sister. Ah, yes, Candace Flynn. You know who I am? No, that's not a good thing. They're here trying to figure out why Danville was branded naughty. Well, maybe everyone did something naughty. No, it doesn't work that way. You see, everyone does naughty things from time to time but that's different from being a naughty person. You see, Santa's very forgiving. Oh, jolly to a fault, if you ask me. Well, something is definitely screwy around here. According to these readings as if the city itself is misbehaving. Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh, Agent P. Uh-oh! It turns out Carl was lying about getting you that Sal Tuscany CD. I never said I got it for him. Quiet, Carl! Haven't you caused enough harm? Your ""so-called"" Secret Santa must've somehow infiltrated the agency. And, uhâ Until we get to the bottom of it, whatever you do, do not play that CD. Boy, this Sal Tuscany guy is good. Let me crank it up some more.  That's what Christmas is for!   Christmas cannot be destroyed!   Not even by a Naughty-inator!  What theâ? How did heâ? Okay, so we'll have Christmas. I simply don't care. Curse my intensely burning apathy towards Chriâ Oh, it is hopeless. I am never going to get my special mistletoe Christmas kiss. Ah! And I'm never going to get to my one great act of kindness. Those were long johns. What about you, Isabella? Isn't there some big Christmas wish that you're afraid will never come true? Oh. Um, we don't celebrate Christmas. But I got the coolest stuff for Hanukkah. Eight straight days of dreams come true. I mean I'm with you guys. Boo, no Christmas. Come on, guys. Do we really seem like bad kids? No, no, you're all good kids. Yes. I knew your heart will lead you to the truth. No, a-actually the meter suddenly gave you a ""nice"" reading. Yeah! ""Nice""! ""Nice""! Everywhere! Everyone, ""nice"". Um Except for him. Sorry. Well, that's great. All you have to do is tell Santa and Christmas is back on, right? Uh Um, it's not that simple. You see, Santa's already left. The elves loaded the sleigh and map out his route, it's too late now. Santa's not coming to Danville. It's too late now. Santa's not coming to Danville. Well, that doesn't seem fair. What are you gonna do about it? Me? Him? Yeah, him. You saw his file. Ferb, I know a third thing we're gonna do today. We're gonna save Christmas. Who's in? Me. I'm in. Me too! I guess I'm in too. Yay! Blay'n, dust off my toy-making gloves. I've found a reason to believe again. Friends, I'm not going to lie to you, this is going to be difficult, but failure's not an option. Candace will keep track of who gets what presents. Blay'n and Clewn't will make the presents. Isabella and Buford wrap. And Baljeet feeds the gifts in the Christmas cannon manned by Ferb. Any questions? Yeah. Are you sure that's not a clubhouse? Yes, I'm sure. Hang on, everybody, here we go! The cloud layer is too thick. I can't see. What happened to all the lights? Everyone was so bummed out, I guess they never turned them on. I'll take care of it. Just get me in low. Good luck, Buford! All right, Buford, here's your chance. All right, who's first on the list? It's Buford, but it says he's naughty. Plow! Christmas is coming! Christmas is coming! Turn the lights on! Did you hear that? Christmas is coming! Hey, let's get those lights on. Yeah, let's turn on the lights! What are we waiting for? Wow! Buford did it! But it still says he's naughty. Oh, what the heck. It's Christmas. So, what does he want? To be thought of as nice by his friends. Aww. Merry Christmas, old buddy! It's beautiful. I wish Santa could've seen it. Oh, well. Come on, guys. Let's make up some lost time. (Song: Christmas is Starting Now)  Grab some holly and mistletoe   'Cause we're gonna go out tonight   We're gonna bask in the electric glow   Of a million little colored lights   We've got a lot to do, before the dawn   So with a minimum of introspection   I think you better put your mittens on   Shake your jingle bell in my direction   Sometimes I feel like a big snowman   That's fallen under a plow   But tonight I'm on top of the world   We're gonna bring it around somehow   Christmas is startin' now!   Oh, yeah   Christmas is startin' now   That's right   Christmas is startin' now   Oh, yeah   Christmas is startin' now   Right now!   Yeah!  Good going, guys. We only have a few more blocks to go. We gotta hurry if we're gonna make it by Christmas Day. Okay, next up Jeremy Johnson? I don't believe it! What does he want? We can skip this one. I already got him what he really wanted. Yes! We're coming up on the last house. Fire away! Oh, no, it is stuck. It's Wendy Stinglehopper's present. She asked for a really big hat. Isn't that that pretty girl from the math team? I know what I must do. Be careful, Baljeet! Uh! Almost got it. Ah! Baljeet! Goodbye, my friends! Ah! Hey, that was fun. Baljeet? Oh. Uh, hi, Wendy. Did anyone order a really big hat? My hat! Oh, how can I ever thank you? Hey, look. Mistletoe. Later. Okay, yeah, yeah, I get it. A taste of my own medicine, right? Oh, of course, and the bird. It doesn't even work!  A partridge on an evil scientist!  There's no play on words. That's not clever. You're not clever!  Perry!  Ugh, I hate Christmas. Yes! I hate Christmas! Woo-hoo! This is the best Christmas ever! Woo-hoo! Yeah! Great job! Nice shootin', Ferb. Well done. If you'll excuse me, I gotta see Jeremy. Great work, guys. Not to alarm you, but your house is on fire. That's not fire. It's steam! Come on! I don't believe it! Santa! Uh, sir, what are you doing here? Having a shvitz. Steam is just what the doctor ordered. We thought you weren't coming to Danville. And pass up on enjoying this cool rest stop you made me? Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Unthinkable! And thanks for doing the Danville run for me. You knew? Of course I knew! I'm Santa Claus! Oh, what a mess. Curse you, Sal Tuscany! Well, I should probably call Uncle Justin and thank him for the gift anyway. Hello, operator? I'd like to place a call toâ Barneo? I thought it said Borneo. Wait, where's Barneo? The North Pole?! Wait a second! The letters of ""A Sal Tuscany Christmas"" spell ""Santa Claus"", with an embarrassing leftover ""Y"". Let me see that picture. Sal Tuscany is Santa Claus? Ah! Jeremy! I was just coming to see you. H-Hey, Candace. I don't know what all that was about before, but I wanted to give you your present. The earrings I wanted. Jeremy, how did you know? I remember you loved them in that magazine. And you were even gonna have your good necklace made into a pair like them. That's so sweet. How did you afford these? I sold my electric. Oh, Jeremy. You were gonna trade that in to get that cool, new silver one. You knew that? I guess I know you as well as you know me, my bowl full of jelly. Here's your gift. The silver guitar! But, how? I sold my good necklace. It's perfect. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Funny how things worked out so that everyone pretty much got what they wanted. What did you wish for, Phineas? May I do the honors? I like this one. Okay. ""Dear Santa, you are one of my biggest heroes. All I want for Christmas this year is a chance to be like you. Thank you, Phineas Flynn."" Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas, Phineas. And by the way, good job. Yeah! Yeah, that was fun. Good job. Well, kids, it's time for me to head home. So, you're sure you don't need this? No, we made it for you. Great! I'll take it to the North Pole, and use it as a clubhouse. I knew it was a clubhouse. Goodbye! Goodbye Blay'n and Clewn't. See you guys. Thanks Blay'n. Thanks Clewn't. Merry Christmas to ya. Merry Christmas! So long. And Thanks. Wait, Santa! It's true isn't it? You planned everything so everyone's Christmas wish would come true. Well, Santa's gotta have a little fun. Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas! Oh, wait! Ferb, what did you wish for? Take a look at this morning's paper. ""World peace""? No, no, this one down here. ""Local boy gets harmonica""! Hey, great picture! Hey, Mom and Dad are back. Hey kiddies! Merry Christmas. Grandma! Grandpa! You made it! Merry Christmas. I made figgy pudding. (Song: Thank You Santa)  Christmas morning, so much fun   Down the stairs the children run   Someone has eaten the cookies   And look what's left under the tree   There's presents for you and for me   As far as the eye can see   What's on the rooftop?   I wondered what that was   It's reindeer flying   Around the world because Santa's coming   I think we all should pause to say that we're grateful   For everything he does!   Thank you Santa Claus   Thank you Santa Claus   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoaaa   A song for all the things you do   Santa Claus we're thankin' you   A song for all the things you do   Santa Claus we're thankin' you   A song for all the things you do   Santa Claus we're thankin' you   A song for all the things you do   Santa Claus we're thankin' you   (Thank you Santa Claus)  Hello! Wintertime's fun! Follow me! Plow! You know, on second thought, don't follow me! Man, that was close."
"by ashirogi27 So, what's the plan today, Dad? Well, your mother's jazz trio has a gig at the Mayor's Day festivities, and I shall be running the antiques auction, oh, yes! I'm very excited because we have a collection of steamrollers on the block, all imported from England. You're kidding. There's a market for that? Oh, you'd be surprised, what with Steamroller Today magazine and Wacky Steamroller videos posted on the Internet. The public is going crazy for the flattening arts. Pfff. People and their silly trends. Hey, Mom, can I get a pink streak in my hair? Why would you do that? To express my individuality! Everyone's doing it! No! Alright, well, I'm all set. I've got my lucky guitar strings, I'm wearing my lucky underwear, and, of course, I've got myâ Oh, no! My lucky gold guitar pick! It's wedged in the wall. Oh, here. Try my lucky butter knife. Oh, it's too far in. You gave me that for our anniversary. Oh, don't worry, love. I'll get a contractor in here to retrieve it. I hate the idea of someone cutting a hole in my nice wall. Well, I can't worry about it right now. I've got music to make! Whoa, yes, we'd better go. See you kids at the festival later, okay? Bye! Good luck! I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb! Hey, where's Perry? Computer authorizing DNA. One moment please. Access granted. Morning, Agent P. How do you like the new spitoon lair entrance? Anyway, your mission. Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz is being honored today with a statue at the Mayor's Day Festival. Considering Doofenshmirtz's hatred for his brother, the forecast suggests mild tomfoolery with a sixty percent chance of slapstick violence. Good luck, Agent P. Now on to Tom Perkins with sports. We're done, Ferb. What'cha doin'? We just built a device that temporarily scrambles your molecules, so you can pass through solid objects. Let's see if it works. (Song: Just Passing Through) Now, listen up.  When there's an obstacle in my way   I don't let it ruin my day   And I don't walk around it   Like other people do   You can scramble my molecules   'Cause I'm just passin' through!   If there's an immovable object in front of you   Takin' up the entire street   Don't skirt around the edge   Don't go over it or under it   Never admit defeat!   Let's say you're in a big brick room   With no windows or doors   A cast-iron ceiling and a concrete floor   I got a quantum-physical solution just for you!  You just scramble them molecules  You're just a-passing through!   So just scramble them molecules   You're just passing through  Hey, we almost forgot! We have to get that pick for Mom! I'll be right back. So, I asked Jeremy if he was going to the festival and he's like, ""Yeah, are you going to the festival?"", and then I goâ Hey. Hey. Got it. Call you back, Stacy. Hey Candace, we're heading out to the festival. See ya! Mom? Hello? Candace? Mom, I know this sounds crazy. I mean, no crazier than all my other calls. You've got a gig, you're upset about losing your lucky pick. Like, you're going to come home now and see what I'm rambling on about. No, you know, I should bring the ball to you! Yeah, that's a good idea. Mom, forget this call ever happened. Bye! What?  Doofenshmirtz flatbed microbus!  You see bobblehead Perry the Platypus, I have created a powerful -inator that will deface anything it contacts! Including my brother Roger's statue that's being unveiled at today's festival. It's going to humiliate him! Isn't that genius, bobblehead Perry the Platypus?  Bobblehead Perry the Platypus!  Oh, yes. So, you agree. You know, I miss our little talks, don't you? Oh, what do you know anyway? Walk through walls, eh? Okay, now I'm mad. You've outdone yourselves boys. Wait 'til Mom sees this. Citizens of Danville, it is an honor to be your mayor and a pleasure to serve. Oh, no, Roger. It is I who will be serving you. Hm! Ugh, okay, push up, and Those are my keys, aren't they? No, I-I don't have my card. Yes, the keys are still in there andâ And it's running. O-Okay, now it's not running, now I need gas. Forty-five minutes, huh? Well, I'm not going anywhere. Eh, well, at least I can get my -inator. As we get closer to unveiling this perfect replica of my body Perry the Platâ Hey! What? That's aâ I-It's an arts and crafts project! I've got a life outside of you! Hey-ah! Curse you, Perry the bobblehead! Oh, no! Bummer, I have a flat! No problem. We can fix it. And now, ladies and gentlemen, what you've all been waiting to bid on. I give you, the antique steamrollers! They're so beautiful! Steamrollers stink! Yeah, pump trolleys rule! It's the Wilkins brothers! Just ignore them, Arlene. They try to cause trouble at every steam-powered antique auction in the Tri-State Area. Shall we start the bidding? Hey, Candace! Enjoy your last moments of freedom, boys! Well, you might have destroyed Plan A, but behold! Plan B! Which I have just destroyed, so now we're even. But not even I am prepared for Plan C! Behold! The Be-Gone-Inator! How do you like me now, Perry the Gone-a-pus? Eh, so I missed. Oh, whatever, I have a bigger bother to be-gone. Goodbye, stupid Roger statue! And Lot Number 2 is a little beaut from Aveling & Porter built in 1924. Do I have any bids? I do! I do! I do! I do! Here! No one's paying a lick of attention to us, Wilbur. Yeah! Let's get out of here. So how long does it take you to fix a flat? Tick tock! Excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through! Ugh! You can build a rollercoaster in a day, but it takes you 12 minutes to pump up a tire? Did anybody else just see the inside of a steamroller? How do you know what the inside of a steamroller looks like? I have a life outside of you! Well, the tire's fixed. And Lot Number 5 is sold to the woman in red. And now the last item of the day, we have Lot 6. Do I have any bids? Mom! Mom! Hmm. What are the odds? Hey, Mom! I'm glad we caught you. Ferb and I found your lucky gold pick. Oh, boys! Thank you! What a relief. I just hate playing without it. Mom! Mom! Look at this! Look at me! Linda! We're on! Mom! Candace, I've gotta go. And just because I won't let you get pink hair, you don't have to wear some weird door. The trends these days But, but! Cool door, Candace. Let's get a good spot. I'd wear a door. Heck, I'd even wear a window if it'd fit. Hey, guys. Oh, no! Jeremy! You seen Candace? She's standing in the door. Thanks. Oh, no! Oh, no! Jeremy can't see me like this. Oh my gâ! Oh, no! Candace? and four. And breathe. Whew, just doing some stretching. Oh, hi, Jeremy. So, our moms are going to start playing when they unveil the statue. Wanna go? Sure. And now, without further ado! Well, Ferb, it looks like everything worked out for everyone today. I can't believe nothing worked out for me today. After Iâ I-I had a A, B, and C and they allâ â'course I destroyed the B, soâ Hey, where are you going? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Hey, look at that! A pump-less pump trolley! Now, that's old school."
"by ashirogi27 Wow, Aunt Tiana, you and Bob have had so many cool adventures. I know, huh? And here's Bob and me jumping out of a helicopter into the South American rainforest. Turn the page, Bob. Okay! Oh, here's where we dodged those man eating plants in the Amazon. Bob? Okay! And here we are climbing the icy peaks of Kilimanjaro. I thought the view was spectacular, but Bob thought it was just Eh, okay. Where are you going next? To the Galapagos. We leave tomorrow. You know, weâve been on so many trips together. This time, I want to go with someone else. My wife. Tiana, will you marry me? Okay! How romantic. Way to go, Bob. Wow. Corny. But, apparently effective. You could get married in the Galapagos! No! You can't get married in the Galapagos. When I was little, you promised I would be your bridesmaid. What about my needs? Candace! Oh, that's right. I did promise you that, didn't I? Well, we could go to the courthouse before we leave. Okay! No, not okay! We have to have a real wedding. We can have it in the backyard! Candace, you can't plan a real wedding in a day. Duh! I've been planning this since I was 10! I could set up the perfect wedding and get you two kids married in a way you'll never forget, and have you on the plane to the Galapagos with time to spare. You and Mom go to the salon to get up-dos and French manicures. Then, head to Tri-State Bridal and ask for Oga. Now, go! Well, okay then. Wouldn't want Aunt Tiana taking her vows in safari wear! Candace, I know you're going to plan a wonderful wedding, especially with Phineas and Ferb helping. What?! Right! Ferb, I know what we're going to doâ No! No, no, no, no! You don't know what youâre going to do today. They're going to build some sort of wedding rocket to the moon, or lawn gnome beach party of taffeta! Then you steer the boys in the right direction, and have fun, okay? Okay! Lawn gnome beach party of taffeta. Make a note of that. Hello? Lake's Cakes? I'd like a 7-tieredâ Oh, no, make that 10-tiered white cake with raspberry filledâ Please hold. Yes? Flowers? Oh, yes, I need something with smellâ Um, please hold. I'm back. Where was I? I want chicken and fishâ Hey, sis. Excuse me. Can't you see I'm busy? Yes, I'm still here. Hold please! Will you guys scram? Well, Ferb and I just wanted to see how we could help. Just go do something and get out of my way! Huh? Oh, no, not you. It's myâ Go plan the grand entrance! Okay! I guess we could make an entrance that's kinda grand. So, have you seen Perry?  I wanna wanna wanna have fun fun fun  Agent P, thank goodness you're here. As you've probably heard by now, Danville's experiencing a shortage of decent, healthy food, and someone's been buying up mass quantities of unhealthy food additives. This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it. We have no idea why he signed it that many times, but anyway, we're all counting on you Agent P! No, I said crab puffs! Please hold. Why would I want my cake in a vase? Oh, you're the florist, not the baker. Alright ladies, let's do a run through! Looking good, Isabella! Oh, hey, sis! Hey, Candace! See, Aunt Tiana, Bob, and the wedding photographer will parachute into their wedding, just like they did in South America. Let's bring those puppies back down. We gotta save our fuel for the actual grand entrance! Absolutely not! You are off grand entrance duty. Just go take care of the flowers, while I order the cake. Got it? Well, I guess we couldâ Just do it! And donât interrupt me. Wow, she's good. I'm gonna have her plan my wedding. Ferb, make a note. I got it!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Surprise, Perry the Platypus! Okay, enjoy your trip! Oh! Oh! The look on his face, that was priceless. Oh! Oh! Oh, here he comes back. Okay-kay. Alright, try not to laugh, okay, serious. Aha, did you enjoy the other floorâ Waitâ Perry? Perry the Platypus? Huh, where did he go? Oh! Ugh! Oh, no! Ugh! No, not beef, chicken! Oh. You're the cake guy? Oh, hold please. What? No, I don't want to save money on my car insurance. Candace! I told you not to interrupt me. Not you, don't hang up. This better be good! Ferb and I just thought you'd like to see how the flowers turned out. Oh, why didnât you say so? Wow, this is so beautifulâ Wait a minute. Are these Venus flytraps! Just like in their adventure in the Amazon. Donât worry Candace, they only have a taste for insects and small vermin. Hey, he likes you! Get this thing off me! Are you okay? One moment. Hello? So, are you and Bob thinking of having kids? Okay, Candace. What can we do next? Next? What can you do next?! Well, Aunt Tiana said we should help, and it is her wedding when you think about it. Alright. But! No trampolines, no robots, no rollercoasters, no firework spectaculars, no native dancers, no running of the wildebeests You could have at least gotten into your trap. It's on the table. You know, I appreciate you trying to mix it up, but I do have a schedule to keep. Ready? Let me show you my latest project. The Junk Food-inator! It sprays my special mix of boiling hot high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated coconut oil. Turning all healthy food into toasty warm junk food! Soon, everyone will become lethargic overweight blobs. Easily controlled by me! Because I will be the only one left eating healthy food, like these delicious broccolis! Hm? Ah. Hm. Ugh. Well, the only problem is, I'm not quite used to the taste. I'm used to eating the, uh T-The junk, uh I'll just dip it in here andâ Hm. Hm. Oh, that's much better! I-I could eat this all day. Um. I can feel myself getting healthier. no giant robot groomsmen, no mechanized rice catapults, no rocket to the moon, no bringing the moon down to earth, just regular good old fashion wedding stuff like you might find at a regular everyday perfect wedding. Like? Like Ice! It's summer, it's hot, people want something with ice, okay? Make ice. Ferb, what do we have in the ice file? I could eat this health food all day. Just look at this lifelike glow I've acquired. I'm the picture of health! And all from eating nothing but thisâ I-I don't know what's under here, but I think it's a vegetable. I'm as strong as an ox! But, nobody else will be after I fire off my Junk Food-inator. I should really refill this. But you know I'mâ I'm so tired. I should really take a nap first. Yeah, the cakes all set up out back just like you asked. Thank you! Hey, aren't you a little young to be a wedding planner? Oh! No! No, I'm not! My perfect cake, done! No! My perfect cake! Mr. Delivery guy, come back! The horror. Hey, Candace! What do you think of our ice sculpture? We incorporated all of Aunt Tiana's and Bob's adventures. There's even a slide she can ride to the altar. I do! I'm telling Mom! Maybe it's my perfect day after all! Mom! Aunt Tiana! Hurry up, you've got to see this thing. Is she always like that? Some days are better than others! It's Phineas and Ferb! They've ruined everything! I'll go check on Lawrence and Bob. Candace, let's go have a look. Look at this cake! It has a chicken in it! Oh And my hair! I think it may also have a chicken in it! Oh, my And this! Hi, Auntie T! We're just putting the finishing touches on the scorpions. Look! The venom is sparkling apple cider! Oh, my goodness! Candace, Iâ Iâ Don't say it, Auntie T. I failed you! I turned your special day into the worst wedding ever! But, I love it. Youâ Huh? I mean your hair, it's all the rage in Montevideo. And the cake! I-It's like a crazy hodgepodge of everything I love. And this Oh. Well, all I can say is thank you. You planned a perfect wedding. Now, why don't you come inside and help me with my dress? Oh, yay! Wait. Whatâ Who am I? Oh, oh, itâs me! Perry the Platypus, how did you free yourself? Wow. But, it's too late! While I was napping, enough grease dripped off my face to fill the Junk Food-inator. Nothing can stop me now! Hoo. I gotta sit down. What theâ? Suddenly I feel like a glass of sparkling apple cider. I donât know how you did that, but get ready to pay, Perry the Platypus! Oi, c-can you â Can you hold on oneâ One second? Okay. Okay. Here we are, letâs do this thâ Uh Uh You know, just, uhâ Just h-hold on, hold on. Uh, y-you know, Perry the Platypus, uh Y-You can just let yourself out. Iâ I may be a while. Are you ready, Aunt Tiana? Wow, you even made it snow! Wait. What about the ice sculpture with all our great adventures? They say the step youâre about to take is the beginning of your greatest adventure yet. Little corny there, bro. Just teeing up the song. Oh, yeah!

One side, coming through. How many times have I told you to keep Perry out of my way when I'm balancing eggs on a spoon? Um Never? Well, I would've thought it would be understood. What the heck are you doing, anyhow? I'm training for this year's Father-Daughter Picnic competition. And I'd really like to win for a change. Dad, c'mon! We're not finished practicing! I'll be right there, sweetheart. I'm just clearing a spot for the trophy we're going to win today. Dad, those trophies are lame. ""Last place""? ""Nice try""? Oh, come on, what about his one? First place! It means loser, Dad. Well, that's not very nice, is it? But, look on the bright side, Candace. This year, we might take home one just like this. Ta-da! Third place? No. Winner. It's a ""W"". How are my two favorite competitors doing? Ugh! Well, I've got a few errands to run. But, I should be there by the time the contest starts. Oh, please try to make it. I think Candace could really use someone cheering her on. Did you hear that, Ferb? I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? How peculiar. Anybody thereâ Oh. Ah, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz has been doing lots of research on the structural properties of glue. It's probably not Say, that fellow wearing the dashing fedora looks awfully familiar. Good luck, Agent P. Perry?! Ooh, I got the feeling I wasn't supposed to see that. Ooh! That hurt. Ah! Ooh! Memory-erase sequence initiated. Hey, Phineas! Hi, Ferb! Hi, Isabella. Come on in. What'cha doin'? Oh, just trying to generate 40,000 cubic feet of compressed air. What's it for? You'll see in a minute. I don't wanna blow the reveal too soon. Anything I can do to help? We still need some pom-poms, a fog machine, and 372 feet of bungee cord! You got it!  Doo doo-doo-doo-doo   Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo  Memory erase: 95% completed.  Doo-dooâ  Mr. Fletcher, are you okay? Daddy? Uh-oh. Major Monogram, we have a situation here. Mr. Fletcher got caught in the memory eraser! Great googly moogly, Carl! This could bring down the entire organization. Get him back to headquarters right away so we can restore his memory.  Carl!  Da-da! We can't let the family see him like this, he's got the brain of a toddler. We need to restore his memory before he's missed at the Father-Daughter Picnic. But, that'll take over three hours! Da-da! Better hurry before it's time to change him. Sir, I haveâ Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da! Will you stop it? I am trying to have a conversation. As I was saying, sir, I may have a solution. Anticipating just this kind of situation, I've been building robot replicas of the Flynn-Fletcher family. We can get Agent P to operate the Mr. Fletcher robot, until we can replace him with the real Mr. Fletcher! W-Wait a minute. You anticipated a specific situation like this? Yup. Wow. That's a little creepy, Carl. Yes. Yes, it is.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  and by inopportune, of course, I mean, completely opportune! I was just, anyway, to drop an entire container of eulg, on the Tri-State Adult Diaper Factory! And what is eulg, you may ask? It's the opposite of glue. A few drops of this will make anything fall apart. See? Now, witness as Iâ Agent P! Agent P! You must abort your current mission! There is something much more important than Doofenshmirtz! Hello? I'm right here! I can hear you, you know! Rendezvous back at headquarters. Monogram out. Fine, fine! You have somewhere more important to be. But, don't you want to know why I want to destroy the adult diaper factory? I-It's a terrific backstory!  Perry!  Y'know, this is gonna be a backstory too, someday! Dad! Where could he be? Dad, come on, we gotta go! Hey, Candace. You wanna see what weâ Dad! Well, she'll see it soon enough. Ladies and girls, I give you the floating pep-squad mobile! Go, Candace! Come on. Let me give you the tour. First stop, our observation and media deck. Our engine room provides pollutant-free power along with a vigorous aerobic workout. And last but not least, our 360Âº fun bounce! Sounds like it's time to get this baby airborne. Fireside Girls, start your pedaling! Dad! Memory restoration, 7% and counting. That's why you'll be controlling this robotic version of Mr. Fletcher. Unfortunately, the operation manual is in Dutch. But, we were able to find a Dutch to French dictionary, and a French to English dictionary. Godspeed, Agent P. Now, commence startup. Startup successful. Now, try the body controls. Body controls seem to be good. Now, try talking. Jolly good, Candace. As long as it's okay with Mom, it's okay with me. Stiff upper lip and all that. Uh Is that all he can say? The kit originally came with one default phrase. Lovely windmill, isn't it? Oh, those kooky Dutch! Now, Agent P, try to emote. Oops, sorry. Sometimes this happens. I'm still working out the bugs then. There, good as new! And not a minute too soon. Good luck, Agent P. Monogram out. Well, if you talk to Dad, just tell him to meet me at the park. I couldn't find him anywhere, so I came down by myself. I'm sorry, Candace. I got stuck in a bit of traffic, but I'll be there as soon as I can. If Dad doesn't get here soon, we'll have toâ Oh. Never mind, Mom, he's here! Let's go get checked in for the contest! As long as it's okay with Mom, it's okay with me. Okay. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Phineas Flynn. And we have a perfect view of today's first event, the father-daughter tug o' war. Let's give our team a little encouragement. Charge! Dad, look up there! Phineas and Ferb are flying in a giant blimp! As long as it's okay with Mom, it's okay with me. Everyone, heave! Pull! Whoa! Come on, Dad! Dig in your heels! Great, Dad! Looks like we're still losers! Jolly good, Candace. Our father-daughter teams are changing positions and settling in for the gooseberry pie eating contest. Each team will have sixty seconds to eat as much pie as possible with their hands behind their backs. Ew! Now it's time for a real crowd pleaser! The father-daughter balloon animal sculpting contest. We've got a butterfly, a snail Oh, and a snake. Very creative. And, uh This is a Lovely windmill, isn't it? That's not technically a balloon animal. Zero points! Can you believe that? She mocked you. Dad? Ouch! Dad, you're burning up! I'll go get you some water. Agent P, I'm afraid your robotic Mr. Fletcher is overheating. Apparently, Carl forgot to top off the coolant levels. Sorry, sir. You've got to keep that robot under control until we can make the switch. Here you go, Dad. Drink lots of water. And where's Mom? She should've been here a long time ago! Candace, I'm just a few blocks away. Well, hurry, Mom! You gotta see what Phineas and Ferb have creatâ Ooh, sorry, Candace. Going through a tunnel. Gotta go! Well, you look a lot better. Let's head on over to the water balloon toss. Closing in on the target. With Perry the Platypus out of the scenario, nothing will stop me! Excuse me, sir, could you stand up and sit right back down? I suppose. Hey, we started a wave! Gently. Jolly good, Candace. Whoa-ee! We're doing great, Dad! Wow, nice reach! Agent P, we've finished restoring Mr. Fletcher's memory. You need to distract the girl so we can make the swap. Uh-oh. Don't worry, Dad! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hello, Agent P. Thanks. We gotta hurry! Off you go! Nice work, Agentâ Our cover's blown! We gotta move! Go, go, go, go! Ooh. Ugh, my head. Where am I? Dad! Dad! I caught the balloon and the judges gave us some points for the longest distance! Ow, yes, but where are we? I think we're in second place. Let's go! The adult diaper factory! I'll be over the target in exactly, uh five minâ Oh, no, that's not going to be good. Welcome to the final event. Ready? Set? Go! Keep up with me, Dad! We're getting out of rhythm! I-I'm trying! Whoa! Ooh Ow. Oh, Dad, it's hopeless.  Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack   Hop to the finish and don't look back!  Dad, you remember!  Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack   Hop to the finish and don't look back!  Isabella, park the blimp and get everyone down here for the final cheer! We're on our way!  Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack   Hop to the finish and don't look back!  Please, I wanna live, I wanna live, I wanna liveâ Oh! What? I'm alive! Woo-hoo! Ow-ow! Curse you, Perry the Platypus, even though you weren't involved in this scheme whatsoever! Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack   Hop to the finish and don't look back!   Bubble gum, bubble gum, running in a sack,,   Hop to the finish and don't look back!  You got it, Dad! Look! We're pulling ahead! And, look! There's Mom! Go, Candace! Go, Dad! Go, Candace! Go, Dad! Go, Candace! Great job! I'm so proud of you guys! Mom, it was awesome! Look, honey! And the winner is Candace Flynn and her dad, Lawrence! Yay! Yippee! Yippee! Huzzah! Woo-hoo! Congratulations! Thank you! And thank you, Dad. Do you know, Candace, I don't remember much of what happened here today, but, I'll never forget this moment with you. Oh, there you are, Perry! Hey, haven't I seen you before? Carl, we gotta fire up the memory eraser again."
"by ashirogi27 Oh, Jeremy. I had no idea you've felt that way about me. But, I still have a lot to accomplish before I get married. Hold on. Much more romantic. It's you! Hello, Jeremy. Hi, Candace. I was wondering if you could do me a favor? Yeah Listen. I got called into work and my parents aren't home Do you think you could look after Suzy for a few hours? Yeah I'll be right over. Thanks! Yeah Huh? Uh, waitâ What did you say? Jeremy? No! Jeremy! I'll be right back. Mom! Mom! Mom! Jeremy's dropping off his little sister and Iâ How nice. A babysitting job. No, Mom, you don't understand! She's evil! Don't be silly, Candace. She's just a little girl. How much trouble could she be? I see you've discovered the broken sprinkler. Yeah, I'd better get to the hardware store! It's beginning to look like Niagara Falls out here. Niagara Falls? Know anything about that, Ferb-meister? It's over 167 feet high. It's also tremendously popular with daredevils. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? I can't believe you forgot to pick up new razors, Carl! Now, I have to go on camera without a clean shave! Me, too, sir. What? You don't have a single hair! I have one, sir. Ew! Agent P, you're here! We're getting very suspicious about Doofenshmirtz. He hasn't ordered any bulk items from the Internet in days. Get over there and put a start to it! Carl, you disgust and fascinate me. Suzy will be here any second! I have to get this place in shape! Must! Hide! Anything! Suzy! Can! Use! Against me! Oh, hey, hi, Jeremy! Candace? What's with the outfit? I get cold. Uh-huh. Well, it's a statement. You guys have fun now. Bye! You know, even though I know that was papier-mÃ¢chÃ©, that's still an impressive throw! Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? Hey, guys! What's with the baby carrier? Ask him. My chiropractor recommended it. It's just as humiliating as a half nelson, and easier on my tennis elbow. What's that grinding sound? Tuff Gum! Like the song says  Pound nerds like a drum  (Song: Tuff Gum)  Stop a train with your thumb   It's Tuff Gum!  Wow, can I have some? Nah, I don't think so. It's for bullies only. You got any regular gum?  Regular Gum!  Alright, everyone. Ferb and I've built a giant waterfall ride and we wanna do a test run. Who's in? Me! Can I go? Well, just be careful. 'Cause I worry about you.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. How do you like my new Shoelace-inator? It's the perfect match for my new Carbon-Footprint-inator! I made it entirely out of carbon paper I kept from the 1970s. I always thought it was gonna come back. Tsk. Shame. Anyway, people are always talking 'bout reducing their carbon footprint. I don't really know what that means, but it sounds evil. Carbon footprint. So, my plan is to leave giant carbon footprints, all over the Tri-State Area! Don't bother, it's double-knotted. So, Candace, are you ready to have some fun?! N-No-no-no. I'm good. I hate fun. I've got a little game we can play. G-G-G-G-Game? It's called making M-M-Making? paper P-P-P-Paper? dolls! Paper dolls?! Huh? It's for you! For me? Aren't you going to do something horrible to me? Oh, no. Making you look bad is just one of the ways I control Jeremy. If he's not here, I'm off the clock. Wait, you can control your brother? Can't you get your brothers to do anything you want? No way! I can't get them to do anything! Un- ac- ceptable. To the backyard! Hey, guys! What'cha doin'? Um Hello?! Hey, Suzy! We were just puttin' the finishing touches on our waterfall ride. Ah, just watching all this work makes me thirsty. What I wouldn't do for a glass of cool lemonade. Lemonade? Whatever you'd like, Suzy. Thank you. I have so much to learn. Well, now that you've watched the master at work, it's time for you to get yours. Me? Oh, no! I'm not ready. I-Iâ What do you want? To bust my brothers? Is that a question or a mission?! A-A mission. So, say it! I wanna bust my brothers! Mean it! I wanna bust my brothers!! Own it! I WANNA BUST MY BROTHERS! Even better, get them to bust themselves. Get my brothers to bust themselves? Get my brothers to bust themselves. Get my brothers to bust themselves! Get my brothers to bust themselves!! GET MY BROTHERS TO BUST THEMSELVES! GO, GO! GET MY BROTHERS TO BUST THEMSELVES!!! Hey, boys! What'cha doin'? Ugh, do I even need to be here? Going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Wanna come? It's gonna be sweet! If Buford does not drop me first. Tuff guys don't drop stuff.  Tuff Gum!  Alright, Candace! Time to bring it on home! Phineas and Ferb, I want you to pick up the phone right nowâ Psst! Everything okay, Candace? D'oh! Can you just help me out and call Mom?! What? So she can come and see this gigantic insanely high waterfall we built in the backyard? Yes? Great idea! Can I borrow your phone? Hey! Whadaya know? It's Candace. Right on schedule. So, what kind of unbelievable contraption have Phineas and Ferb built that requires me to come home immediately? An unbelievably cool waterfall ride right in our backyard! You gotta come home right away! Phineas? Is that you? You sound just like Candace. I mean, you sound like you, but the things you're sayingâ Hurry up! You gotta see it! Alright, alright, just as soon as I find the right sprinkler part! I curse the day these things were invented!  Doofenshmirtz Carbon Footprint!  Everything is goingâ Everything is going according to my plan! Soon, Danville will know what it is to be trodden upon by true genius! I think I'll start with a pond or some bushes or something. You know, toâ To beef up the whole anti-environmental theme I've been dancing around. Wait, where was that from? How did you get out of that double knot? Hey, you like the window? I just had it installed! Sayonara, Perry the Platypus! Alright, Buford, we're ready for you! You can let 'er rip! Roger that! Better eighty-six the gum. It's a choking hazard. Oh, all right. But, I'll be back for that bad boy. Alright, let's do this! I CAN'T WAIT FOR MOM TO SEE THIS! This is it! Today's the day! It's my day! It is my day! Was Buford not in the barrel with us? Bullseye! Whoa, that was great! I can't wait for Mom to see it! Me, too! Mom's home! Yes! C'mon! Let's go tell Mom! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Congratulations! You are now an official driver for the Mr. Banana Company. Man, that is so funny. I literally just wrote a song about a platypus driving a banana truck! Hm. Hm? Wait! My demo! (Song: Alabama Bound)  He's Alabama bound with a load of bananas   Headin' south across the Mason-Dixon line   Then he's haulin' pineapples to Gary, Indiana   Gotta burn some rubber, make that highway whine!   He's a mobile mammal and I bet you a fiver   He's eatin' hush puppies and corn on the cob   He's a semi-aquatic semi driver   A full-time agent with a part-time job!  Oh, yeah! I'll bet you a fiver! That there's a mobile mammal!  Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh!   Woo!  Mom! Mom! Phineas wants to tell you something! We built Niagara Falls in the backyard! Wanna see it? Why, I'd love to, honey. Yes! Yes! Finally! Alright, Danville. Get ready for a carbon footprint you'll never forget! Eh, whatâ Oh, see? This! This is why I hate nature! It's always getting stuck to your foot! Yeah!  Tuff Gum!  Yeah, yeah! There you go. I can't believe it! You walk away from a profitable miniature golf franchise and open up a spring water bottling plant right in the middle of town! What? Did you think a mountain spring was just gonna fall out of the sky? You never believed in me. Alright, we'll try this again. Blah blah blah carbon footprints! I suppose this is inevitable. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Well, kids, you're right. It does look like Niagara Falls back here. But, this part will fix that. Voila! So, who wants pie? Me! Oh, yeah! No! How can this be?! It was supposed to work this time! Don't you have anything to say?! Results may vary? Hey, Candace! Hi, Jeremy! Hold this, please. How's it going? Perfect! Everything isâ Guess we're back on the clock. Splishy-splashy!  He's Alabama bound with a load of bananas   Headin' south across the Mason-Dixon line   Then he's haulin' pineapples to Gary, Indiana   Gotta burn some rubber, make that highway whine!   He's a mobile mammal and I bet you a fiver   He's eatin' hush puppies and corn on the cob   He's a semi-aquatic semi driver   A full-time agent with a part-time job!   Woo!"
"by ashirogi27 Gravity. Hmm. I wonder if there's any way around that. What are you guys doing? Well, right now we're just thinking about defying gravity. Please. Even you can't change the law of gravity. It's a universal law, like, ""you can't wear white after Labor Day"". An absolute law without a hope of appeal? That's despotism! Somebody oughtaâ Hey, that's it! I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? Right here. Oh, I didn't see him there. Carl. One minute, sir! Just finishing up my status update. ""Carl is interning like there's no tomorrow!"" Done. Carl, I just completed your intern evaluation report. You've earned a gold star in every category except one. You need to show more initiative. Sir, I've never gotten less than a gold star in my entire interning life. Well, I do have 24 hours before I have to submit my evaluation. Prove that you can show initiative and that gold star is yours. I'll start right now by triple-checking the chattosphere for suspicious activities. Hey, Ferb. Nice job on that blueprint for our Anti-Gravity Fun Launcher. I just posted it on our website so Baljeet can check the math. Hey, Baljeet. That was fast. Your blueprints are 97% sound. But, you accidentally placed a cosine where you needed a quadratic differential! Not to worry. I fixed it. I will send an attachment. Excellent.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  There's absolutely nothing going on today. Have you finished that puzzle yet? No, I lost the stupid box lid. Now I can't figure out how to solve it. Then you could finish building me a bride out of icicle-pop sticks like you promised. I'd like to help you out, Norm. Really. But, look at my tongue. See? Ah? Look at that. My doctor said no more raspberry icicle-pops until the blue dye flushes completely out of my system. Why must I be alone? I don't know. Why are raspberry icicle-pops blue? And I know what you are doing, Norm! You're a sick, sick robot! I need a really evil scheme. But Oh, it's so hard to create when I'm in one of my moods. Maybe I can borrow someone else's plans from the Internet. Blueprints, and, search. Ooh, an Anti-Gravity Fun Launcher! How about the Anti-Gravity Evil Launch-inator? There. I changed the name, that makes it mine. This could be the greatest scheme ever! Although, I'm not quite sure the evil applications. Eh, something will come to me. Doofenshmirtz just downloaded a blueprint. Anti-Gravity Fun Launcher? Sounds fishy. Let's run it through the anagram decoder. Major Monogram! You don't have to yell. I'm right here. Doofenshmirtz just downloaded these plans for anti-gravity fun launcher. But, when I run that through the anagram decoder, the letters form ""Evil Fanatic Hunt R Raygun"". Looks like you're missing an E. They're probably just trying to mislead us. Let's check the source. Agent P's owners! They must be in league with Doofenshmirtz. I don't know, Carl. Sounds a little far-fetched. But, wait, listen to this. It's a seemingly innocent voice recording of Phineas. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. But, if we play all those syllables backwards in a random order, we get Let's help Doofenshmirtz d-destroy the Tri-State Area. Keep a close eye on those boys. See what else you can find out.  Perry!  Agent P, we need you to track down a missing agent. Code name: Agent G. We're not sure of his current location, but we have a few leads placing him in Iceland, Monte Carlo, Burbank, California, and the moon. It's up to you to chase that goose and bring him back to the agency. Good luck, Agent P. Monogram out. So, who is Agent G again? Garry the Gander? Oh, that's just a wild-goose chase. Get it? Goose? Gander? Heh. Uh We had to distract Agent P because he's too close to Phineas and Ferb. Then, who will investigate the boys? Hm, we need to send someone in undercover, all the agents are out on their missions (Song: Carl, Incognito)  Carl!   Dressed as a cheerleader!   Carl!   Now he's wearin' a pinafore!  Carl!   In his pajamas!   Carl!   Now he's a guy from the Civil War!   Dressed as a cowboy or an old steel worker   And now he's the lead in a '40s tearjerker!   He's Carl!   Incognito!  Good luck, Agent Carl. You can count on me, sir. Okay, now, where's Perry? All right, guys, chop-chop. Time to prove Sir Isaac Newton wrong. Sir, I've reached the target. Over. Roger that, Carl. Now observe, then infiltrate. Who's that, Phineas? Oh, hey, kid. You wanna help? Me? Sure. Sir, I've made contact. Hey, thanks. What's your name? Uh Say a cool name like Nitro, Dax or Steel. My name is Carl. Nice to meet you, Carl. Come and join us in the fun. Sir, I've gained their trust. So, what kind of scheme is this? We're just having fun challenging universal laws. So, I hear you're the math genius behind this operation. Oh, no, no, no. Phineas and Ferb's blueprint was already brilliant. I just made a minor modification. Interesting. So, Ferb, you don't talk much, do you? Actually, Iâ Oh, what's that over there? Nice job, everyone. It came out perfectly. Who wants to go first? I think our guest should go first. Uh, uh, me? Okay, Ferb, let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull. Whoaa! What's happening? Don't worry, it only lasts fifteen minutes. Looks fun though, doesn't it? Let's all go. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Coming through. So, what exactly is the evil purpose in all of this? Evil? This is just for fun. Hey, guys, wait for me!  Bom-bom-bap-bum-ba-ba-da-ba-doo  (Song: When You Levitate)  Gravity's not so much a law as just a mere suggestion   Whether or not you're gonna follow it is up to your discretion  So if you wanna get above the trees   Get ready for some zero G's   And get in line 'cause you know that there's no weight   When you levitate   When you levitate   When you levitate   I said when you levitate   When you levitate   When you levitate   When you levitate   Oh!   Oh, when you levitate!  Phineas and Ferb, floating in mid-air? Ooh, they are so busted this time. I've gotta find Mom. Carl, status update. Over. Sir, I can't. Carl? Carl! Oh, no, they must be torturing that poor kid. Don't worry, little unpaid intern. Help is on the way. Thanks for bringing this down for me, Norm. For some reason, it runs on solar power. How many times do I have to tell you, you can't park in a loading zone? Well, uhâ I-It's not a vehicle. It's an evil device. You see, this is what I do for a living. No, don't! Oh! Gary ze Gander? I know nothing! That was so much fun. Remember when Isabellaâ Ahem. Who's that? Uh, hello, son. Hi, Carl's dad! Hello, children. Carl, uhâ Your mother and I were worried when you didn't come home. Uh, are you in trouble? No, Majâ Er, Dad. I was just playing with my new friends. Sir, situation neutralized. Abort mission. I repeat, abort mission. Well, uh Son, it's time to go home, andâ Aw, come on, Dad, can't I just stay for five more minutes? No, no, we have to go. Your, uh mom is making dinner. See you later, Carl. It was a lot of fun. Nice kid. Last one in has to clean up! Woo-hoo! We are the firsts! Stop! Hm. That's an interesting shape. It looks familâ Oh! Wait. An Anti-Gravity Evil Launch-inator. I found another one. Heh. What are the odds? Norm, get down here. I need help. Our next guest is a covert secret agent. We've pixelated his face to conceal his identity. Now, I understand that you're searching for a long-lost colleague. Oh, you brought a picture. Now, viewers, if you see this agent, call in immediately. Well, I guess he found him. Hey, buddy, you forgot your pixelation! Norm, you're spectacular. I never knew you could do that. Did you know I could also do this? Really? Wow, I-I should really read your instruction book. Yes. Yes, you should. It's about thirty feet tall with electrodes and stuff! Mm-hm. You'll see. I'll just open the gate, and you'llâ Eek! It's gone! That's a shocker. Norm, you've really outdone yourself today. Does this meanâ? Yes, you'll have your icicle-pop stick bride. Yay. Uh-oh. You got a license to drive a robot with more than two axles? Ah-em Uh That's what I thought. Okay, Charley, pull 'er up. Curse you, motor vehicle code! I'm very proud of you, Carl. But, my feelings for you can be better expressed in your evaluation. All gold stars! Oh, there you are, Agent P. Sorry about the wild-goose chase. You were just too close to this case. But, don't feel bad. No one could ever find Agent G. He's been missing for far, far too long. What theâ? Agent G! On an extremely extended vacation, hm? Well, Agent P deserves a vacation more than you do. He deserves one, but unfortunately, evil never rests. So, we'll see you tomorrow. Well, this is getting a little awkward. Carl, my arm is getting tired and he won't salute back."
"by ashirogi27 Ah. Here's the doo-hickey that fuses with your spinal cord. Hey, guys. What'cha doin'? Today, we're gonna fuse our nervous systems with Dad's laptop and surf the web using only our cerebral cortexes. Wow! Surely that would be quite an exciting project. Oh, hey, Baljeet. Why are you dressed like a vegetable samosa? Because today is the Tri-State Area Unification Day! I learned all about it in Assimilation class. You see, the Tri-State Area was the Bi-State Area, until our founder, the great John P. Tristate, uttered the immortal words The, uh Bi-State Area should be united with that Adjacent Area, right over there. But, we knew that. I was just wondering why you're dressed up like a vegetable samosa. Oh, that. My Uncle Kamal is doing an exotic cuisine float in the parade, and I am the vegetable samosa! Hey! Buford? I thought I was supposed to be the vegetable samosa! Why can we not both be vegetable samosas? Oh, sure! Two vegetable samosas! Why don't we all just dress like vegetable samosas? In fact, why don't we just all dress like mashed potatoes and take the word exotic right off the sign?! Buford, wait! No, man. It's over! I'm gonna go find another nerd! But, what about the Tri-State Area Unification Day parade? What? Is that what this parade is for? Does no one know what today is? Well, excuse me, but, that Adjacent Area was founded by my great-uncle Otto H. Adjacent! He didn't wanna be no part of no Tri-State unification, and neither do I! The blood of Otto H. Adjacent runs through these veins, and blood is thicker than water! Well, mango chutney is thicker than blood. You're dead to me! Parade? I love parades. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today instead! We're gonnaâ Hey, where's Perry? Ah, there you are, Agent P. Well, let's get down to brass tacksâ What's this? ""Happy Passive-Agressive Relationship day""? Oh, is that today? That's okay, you probably weren't gonna get me anything, anyway. Well, I completely forgot. No, no, you know I didn't even want a present. Anyway Where were we? For some reason, Doofenshmirtz has purchased a tow truck. Which isn't evil in itself, butâ He may be planning on towing something evil, so, check it out.  Perry!  Candace? Are you ready for our girl's day out? Just a sec, Mom! Aha! Wait a minute. Are you guys just out here arranging kiddie wagons? At the moment. Hmm. Carry on. All clear. Luckily the boys aren't up to anything. A little to the left. There you go. Candace, you have to promise me that you won't obsess about Phineas and Ferb. Yeah, sure, Mom. I promise. Don't just promise this time. Raise your right hand. Do you, Candace Gertrude Flynn, solemnly swear not to obsess about your brothers, or you'll suffer the pharaoh's curse? The pharaoh's curse? Yes or no? Okay, yes! Okay, now we can have fun.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Perry the Platypus? You like that? I call it my Indoors-inator. I got the idea from the Perry-shaped hole you left in my wall, and in my bathroom door, a-and in my fridge. Man, you were hungry that day. Anyway, here's my evil plan. Ta-da! I'm calling it the Duplic-8-inator. Get it? Duplic-, then the number 8, then -inator. I'll bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Here, I'll show you. I can't believe you started a monkey basketball team, and you've only got one monkey. Oh great, now three of 'em are gonna have to sit on the bench. See? It duplicates everything eight times. When I zap those streets there will be eight times the traffic, and Danville will come to a standstill! That's where I will make off like a bandit. You see, I bought this tow truck off the internet, I'm going to call it the Tow-inator or something. And open a service, and then I'll go andâ 'Course it'll be hard for me to drive anywhere, with all that traffic. Well, you knowâ T-There's a bridge I'll cross when I get there. I've never been bullied into stopping a parade before. What should I do? I don't know if this is working out. Can you talk in an Indian accent? Indian accent? No. I can do an English accent, instead! Hello, gov'! Top of the morning, toodle pip! Last night, Mr. Governor, my toilet was broken in two. Actually, that was pretty good. Okay, everyone. Let's show everybody what Tri-State unification is all about. Cue Love HÃ¤ndel! (Song: Tri-State Area Unification Day)  The Tri-State Area was the Bi-State Area   With an Adjacent Area right over there!  They put it all together, now there's no use denyin'   This parade is all about our area unifyin'!  There's only one thing we care about   We want you all to stand up and scream and shout!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!  Ferb, water hazard ahead.  It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!  Commence operation: unforeseen circumstance.  It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!   It's the Tri-State Area Unification Day!  Ah, nugget! That's a-too bad. Maybe you should a-dress like a policeman and a-reroute a-the parade. If that wasn't such a good idea, I'd flatten you. Mamma mia. That was a-close. See, Candace? Isn't this nice to just get away and enjoy a day together? You're right, Mom. This is the best. I'm not even going to think aboutâ Hm, you know. I'm not even gonna say their names. That's the spirit. I'm just gonna sit here and enjoyâ Ooh, the parade coming by. Look at that kid in the cute little car Gah! Mom! Ah! What am I doing? I am blocking my view. What my brothers do doesn't affect me. Letting it go for just one day. Nails. Happy relaxing fun! You say something, honey? Now, they're headin' for the junkyard. Removes gravitational pull, it'll be impossible to escape. Am I thinkin' of a junkyard, or something else? Ferb, treacherous terrain coming up. Execute operation: Thing in our way. AH! Otto H. Adjacent will be avenged! Now, which button was it? Because, one of these buttons just makes it fire will-nilly all over the place. I don't want to hit that one by mistake. Oop, someone's at the door. I'll be right there. Oh, excuse me, Perry the Platypus, what can I doâ Ah! Oh, see there. That'sâ That's the willy-nilly button. Mom, this place is so fancy-shmancy. I just hope it isn't too noisy with that silly parade going on outside. Believe me, I'm trying to tune it out. So, what looks good to you? Remember the pharaoh's curse. Wait! It doesn't count if she sees them herself! Hey, Mom. I bet you can't turn your head a 180Â° like an owl. Nope, just 90. Hey, can you show me that twisty yoga move you do again? Maybe after lunch, dear. I'm curious what the back of you chair looks like. Can you turn around and show me? Okay, Candace, what's up? Mom! Why can't you just turn around?! Okay, you want me to turn around? I'm turning around. Can we just eat lunch now? Fine If that parade makes it to the end, my hopes for the Adjacent Area secession are through. I gotta stop it. Vhat is your next plan? I know it is going to be zomezhing clever! That's it! The other accents were amusing, but that one's just offensive. Vait! Vhat about me? I'm firin' you as my nerd. Das ist nicht gut. Well, that's weird that our floats are floating away. Yeah. Well, they are called floats. What theâ? Ah! Ah!!! Whoa-ah! A platypus balloon? A Perry the Platypus balloon?! Candace, I'm having a great time with you today. See how relaxing it is when you're not obsessing about your brothers? I can't take it anymore! Mom, I really tried my best to give you a day. But, it'sâ The boys. The boys! They're in the parade! With giant floats! So, come on, you've gotta bust them. Wow. It's all just one big place. No Bi-State area. No Adjacent Area. It's all just one big Tri-State Area, right over there! Uh-oh. Momma! You know, this balloon is actuallyâ AHH! Curse you Perry the Platypus Balloon! Oh, no! Buford is in trouble! I must do something! Please, my bully is in trouble. Let go of all of your balloons! Yeah, okay. Thank you. No. Thank you, vegetable samosa. Woo-hoo! Uh, did you guys see that? Let's investigate. What we really need is a grand finale, so spectacular, that people will always remember Tri-State Area Unification Day. Hey, what's that? Happy Tri-State Unification Day! Woo-yeah! Yeah, just some Unification Day Parade stunt. That will do it. Hey, Buford. Great finale. Yeah, it was really, really nice. Nice? Ah, now I gotta go do somethin' to balance out the universe. See ya' on the news. Wait! Wait, no, Buford. No, no, no. Please don't. I was going to eat those jelly doughnuts. Missed ya', Baljeet. Right back at ya', buddy. An thus, the universe is balanced. Candace! Behold, Phineas and Ferb have taken over the parade! Hi, Mom! Hi, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher. Hi, Phineas and Ferb's mom. Say ""cheese""! Oh, how adorable! Excuse me. Are you Candace Gertrude Flynn? Yes. Curse you. I tried to warn you, honey."
"by ashirogi27 Last night's meteor might not have been as innocent as we thought. Look what happened to Dr. Zachary! Cool! Now what? Alright, what are you two up to? Watching The Invasion of the Human Overlords marathon. They're playing all five movies tonight! Is that all? Pfft. Well, enjoy your lame, colorless marathon. I'm heading back. Wait, who's that? That's Dr. Abernathy. He's a scientist! Wow, he's kinda hunky for a 50s guy. Don't worry, I'll keep you safe. Thanks, doctor, but please, call me Amanda. Alright Amanda. Sold! Get me up to speed. The aliens are replacing the heads of all the humans with their own shape-shifting, multi-eyed heads, which can then assume the form of the host human. Get out. And then? Once they replace more than 51% of all the humans, they can assume control of the Earth for their own nefarious purposes. Shut up! And? No way! Is there no way to stop them? Only if you catch them when they're in their human state. That's when they're at their weakest. Then, how can you tell they're aliens? There's three classic ways to spot an alien. First, they have strange vocal patterns. They don't quite get human syntax. Pass me that krie-bop, please. You mean, this hammer? Oh, yes, hammer. Krie-bop is what we call it in Ohio where I am from. What else? They're anatomically disproportionate. Now I need the sprigle-brock. The what? Never mind. I will get it. But, the clearest sign is that they can safely remove any human head, and replace it with their multi-eyed, shape-shifting one. Well, yeah. I guess that will be a give-away. Like this. Doctor? What's wrong? Are you alright? Yes, Amanda. I'm fine. We're all fine. And soon you will be too! NO!!! Sorry, Amanda, but, we've waited long enough. NO!!! This can't be! What's happening? NO!!! I tried to warn you. Doctor, your head is attached! You're a human again! Yes, and once Dr. Zachary returns from heading into those dark, ominous woods alone, with his not fully charged flashlight, you will be too Amanda. But, it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me?! I was a fool! A fool!!! Oh, my gosh, you guys, that was awesome. Guys? Uh, guys? Oh, wow, it's tomorrow already. I gotta find those guys and tell 'em how it ended. Guys, guys, guysâ Ugh! Sorry, Mom. Have you seen the boys? Yeah, I think they're upstairs. Can you do me a favor and take the laundry up? I'm late for an appointment. Sure, Mom. Thanks, hon. I'll be back. Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny. Oh, there you are. You know, that movie was so Oops. Sorry. I'll just put these in your room. Oh, I wish you were there, Ferb. So do I. Tell Uncle Angus and Aunt Mora thanks for the candy. Too right. Scotland out. Peace. Oh, hey, Phineas. Oh, my gosh, you missed it. By the end, everyone got their heads back and everything went back to normal. Well, sort of. The entire laboratory disappeared. But, I loved it. I can't look at anything the same way ever again. Cool, glad you liked it. Ooh, I-I almost forgot the coolest part. Hey, guys. Guys. You're never gonna believe this. At the end, theyâ Ferb? Oh, my gosh! Ferb's an alien. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on a second. I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason Ferb can remove his head. I mean, it's not like he had any of the other telltale signs, is it? Oh, no. Strange vocal patterns Oh, how cute. Ferb's torso is so tiny. Anatomically disproportionate They got to Ferb!!! Phineas! Phineas! I-I know you're gonna think I've completely lost it, but, I'm pretty sure that Ferb is an alien! We've gotta find his head and reattach it. My brother's an alien? How cool is that? But, I think you may be letting your imagination get the best of you, sis. Oh, a non-believer, huh? Well, you know what? I'm gonna get proof. I'm gonna get proof! You'll see! Ferb's an alien! Hey, where's Perry? Sorry about the distraction, Agent P. The ladies are helping to, uh ""net-roy-er"" the lair. TrÃ© biens, Monsieur Monogram. TrÃ©s bien. Bonjour, Carl. Bonjour, Madame. So, we're having a bit of a cleanup here, which coincidentally is what Doofenshmirtz seem to be up too as well. He's put some old -inators up for sale on an evil auction site. If one of those devices were to fall into the wrong hands, it could be catastâ C-Couldâ Could you please wait for me to finish, Mimi? Non Mimi. Fifi. Oui, Fifi. Oh, now I've lost my train of thought. Anyway, get out to Doof's place and put a stop to it. How much is this costing us, Carl? Une petite fortune. Petite. That means small, right? Well done, Carl. (Song: You're Not Ferb)  Something weird's going on 'round here   Gotta get me some evidence!   Some strange goings-on happenin' on the back lawn   And it's gettin' too intense   'Cause you're not Ferb!   No, and I'm disturbed!   'Cause you're not Ferb!   You've got the same colored hair   And his savoir-faire   And his zany serenity!   Though it's not conclusive, something elusive   Says you stole his identity!   'Cause you're not Ferb!   No, you're not Ferb!   No, you're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   You're not Ferb!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, hello. You must be here about the ad, right? Well, come on in. It's right over here. Behold, the Wrapped-Up-in-a-Nice-Little-Bow-Inator. I bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Well, let just say your nemesis is arriving sooner than expected andâ A-And your place is a complete mess. Tidying up is a snap, with the press of this large, red button. See? Wrapped up in a nice little bow. You can also use it to hang your clothes on. Just like a treadmill. So, although my ad said firm, I am flexible, so make me an offer. Wow. You're a good negotiator. Okay, half price. And I'll throw in my Druselstein minor-league baseball collection. Perry the Platypus? Well, it's a good thing I still have my Druselstein minor-league bat. Have at you! Aw. Well, Phineas, what do you think? Wait. Before you say anything, look at these photos. I stalked Ferb all day. See? Proof positive. Ferb is an alien. Um, wellâ No, no, no, no. Just wait till you see. Here, here. Butâ Here, here. Butâ Here and here! And listen to this. See? That is an entirely different silence than the Ferb silence we're used to. Here, I'll pay it backwards. Um Fine! Here, here, wait. What about this hideous ball of goo? Listen, Candace. As cool as it would be for Ferb to be an alien, that's sadly not the case. Here. Follow me and I'll show you. Wait, show me what? Ferb, old pal, our dear sister here thinks you may be a sinister extraterrestrial visitor. I saw Ferb's head ripped off by a hideous alien monster. Oh You must mean this reverse power coupling unit we're repairing. Reverse power coupling unit? Sure. That's all it was. Ferb's no more alien than you or me. Butâ But, what about all this evidence I've been collecting? Well, even though Ferb's not an alien, we are fixing a spacecraft for a friend of Meap's. Wait. What? We just finished and we're about to launch. Ferb, you're not an alien! Uh, you're about to launch? You guys are so busted. I'm getting Mom! Go. Go. You're free, little skinned bird. Mom? Oh! Candace, you scared the bejabbers out of me. Come on. I've got something to show you. Seriously, Mom, I've waited for this moment a long time. All right, you two, let's get the show on the road! Yes! Ooh, how cool is this?  So busted, so busted, so busted!  Mom, are you seeing this? I-I-I-I can't believe this is really happening! You guys are so busted! And I busted you. For once, Mom is right here to see it! Right, Mom? Yes. She sees it! All right!  So busted, so busted, so busted!  You two have done a great job repairing my ship.  So busted!  Haâ Huh? Your ship? No problem, Garbog. I hope you finished your study on the habits of the human female parental unit. Uh, I-Iâ It's Mom! The real Mom! And I still have proof! Crud. But, the launch pad is still there! Uh-oh. Curse you, Perry the Platâ Why did I ever order such a large bedroom set?  Agent P!  Ow! Wow, you know, it's actually quite a bit roomier in here than you'd think. Mother? Is that you? I mean, really you? Candace, I don't have time right now. I have frozens. Yep, that's you. Come on, Mom, quick! Nice design on that rocket gantry, by the way. And it folds up for easy storage. Cool. Please, please, please, please be there! And I'm seeing the backyard. NO!!! Oh, there you are, Perry. But, it was all right here! Oh, why did I think anyone would believe me?! I was a fool! A fool!!!"
"by ashirogi27 Hurry, Mom! You're nobody unless you're somebody in Glosstacular lipstick! All right, Candace. At least let me stop the car. I'm nobody unless I'm somebody. I'm nobody unless I'm somebody! I want you boys to pick out some nice back-to-school clothes. Wow, that was fast. Well, we do have a signature look. Although, Perry's mixing it up a bit. Cute. Okay, here's some quarters for the arcade. I'm gonna see what's keeping your sister. Okay. See you later, Mom. With this many quarters, we can play 72 straight hours ofâ Hey, check it out. This was my favorite ride when I was little. Better enjoy it while you can, boys. These old fellows are pretty worn out. I'll be back in a little while to haul them away. What a shame. I wonder if they're still as much fun as they used to be. You know, in retrospect, I may have over-romanticized those memories. But, I'll bet with a little effort and some unstable uranium isotopes, we could make them that much fun. Ferb, I know what we're gonnaâ Hey, where's Perry? Oh, get with the beat. You're messing up my score. Carl, are you sure I don't have any more clean uniforms? That's the last one, sir. I mean, seriously. I'm growing mushrooms under here. I don't smell too bad, do I? I can't smell a thing. Well, that's a relief. I thought maybe I wasâ No. No, I can't smell a thing, sir. I have no sense of smell. Really? I was born without nostrils, sir. Oh. I thought you were joking about that on your resume. Ah, Agent P. Uh, just give me a few seconds. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up every can of aerosol deodorant in the Tri-State Area. And I'm starting to smell like a science-fiction convention. We need you to find out what he's doing with all those aerosol spray cans and put a stop to it. Good luck, Agent P.  Doofenshmirtz walks to the diner!  I just called in a to-go order for Doofenshmirtz. Hey, Vic? You got an order for Doofyberg? No, no, no. Doofenshmirtz. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Surely you've heard of me. Okay, order for Hans Doofensmith. Is that right? No, Doofenshmirtz. Doofenâ M-My brother is the mayor. Roger Doofenshmirtz is your brother? Yes, Doofenshmirtz. And your name is? Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Do we have an order for a Hans Doofenblatz? Ugh! Mark my words. You will remember the name of Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Hm! Could I still get my whole wheat on rye? Sure, what's your name? All done. Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Oh, hey, Isabella. Hey, losers. Oh, hey, guys. Don't tell me you're playing with that lame kiddie ride. We've tricked it out. And now it's pretty awesome. I'll be the judge of that. Step aside. This better be worth a quarter. Ooh. This is so exciting. Let me catch my breath. What is not to like? It has what every kid loves, rocking back-and-forth, and slowness. May I suggest pressing that red button? Ooh, can I? So, what do you think? I got it. Woo-hoo-hoo! This is awesome! Ah, Perry the Platypus. How predictable. And by predictable, I mean completely dictable, I guess. Uh Anyway Oh, don't bother trying to escape. The walls are made of a super-slick alloy and treated with a few dozen coats of non-stick cooking spray. I'm sure you've noticed my impressive collection of aerosol spray cans. Every can of aerosol deodorant, hair spray and bug repellent from the Tri-State area. All mine. I'm tapping into their ozone-depleting propellants to fuel my latest evil scheme The Aerosol-Propelled Ozone Deplete-inator! The citizens of Danville will definitely learn the name of Heinz Doofenshmirtz, when I spell it out in the sky in hundred-foot-tall letters made of atmosphere-destroying aerosol gasses, thereby depleting the protective ozone layer. And the resulting radiation will burn my name right through town. Then, they'll remember. And if they don't, they can just look outside. I need a little drink of water after a tirade like that. Ah, Glosstacular lipstick! Now, I can blow up a bounce house and my lips would still be shiny! I bet Phineas and Ferb are behind this. Wow, that was fun. I've got you this time. And to make sure this doesn't disappear, I'm going to sit here on the evidence 'till Mom comes back. This is gonna be worth a quarter. Help me! Hang on, Candace, we're right behind you! Good thing we tricked out the other rides. Come on! (Song: Ain't No Kiddie Ride)  Ooh  Phineas! Whoaa! Hang on, Candace! We're coming!  Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh   Well, the way things look can give the wrong impression   But if you adjust the torque and check the valve compression   Well, you would be advised and realize that the old clichÃ© is true   You can't judge a book by the way it looks   Boy, the truth is up to you   Like Jekyll and Hyde appearances aside   Ain't no kiddie ride   (Ooh)   Ain't no kiddie ride, yeah   (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)   Ain't no kiddie ride   (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)  Nuts. Lost her in the skyline. Isabella, we need you to get us an aerial view. Sure, Phineas. Whee! Well, what do you know? Nostradamus was right. Wow. She just flew through a barn and her lips are still shiny. Oh, my friends! It appears that I am out of fuel. No, Baljeet. Just put in another quarter. But, all I have is a dollar. Oh. What do you know. Hm. Oh, come on! Ah, water. It's like drinking wet air. Now, Perry the Platypus, sit back and listen as the entire Tri-State Area, screams the name Heinz Doofenshmirtz and never forgets it again! Hold it right there, Perry the Platypus. Ugh! Uh-oh. Phineas, help, I'm falling! Just put in another quarter! I don't have another quarter! Hey, nice move, Perry the Platypus. I got to hand it to you. Here, let me give you a hand. Hey, hey. I'm gonna crush you with my big mechanical hand. Ha! Well, IâI guess that one was just literal. But, I've got you now. Wow. Nostradamus was right. Ugh! Ow! You know, I don't come to your house andâ Wait. This doesn't have any chlorofluorocarbons in it at all! Theseâ These aerosol cans are completely harmless! Whatâ What was I thinking? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Okay. I got her. Yee-haw! Good work, everybody. Let's bring it on back to the store. Well, it looks like you made it back in one piece. You guys are gonna be so busted when I show Mom what you did to those kiddie rides. Oh, there you are, Perry. All right, one side, kids. We're replacing these old rides with brand-new identical ones. With special emphasis on the identical. See 'ya. Bye, now. Well, that was fun. Maybe tomorrow we can soup up our old bikes. Lame. That's what you said about the kiddie rides. And I was right. Until I wasn't. Here it is, Mom. I'll show you. If you'll just give me a quarter, please. Aren't you a little old for kiddie rides? No. No, I'm not! Check it out! Well I guess it does have rocking back-and-forth and slowness. Okay, dollar. This is your last chance.  Well, the way things look can give the wrong impression   But if you adjust the torque and check the valve compression   Well, you would be advised and realize that the old clichÃ© is true   You can't judge a book by the way it looks   Boy, the truth is up to you   Like Jekyll and Hyde appearances aside   Ain't no kiddie ride"
"by ashirogi27 Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're going to the Space Adventure film festival! It's gonna be awesome!!!  Space Adventure   It's an adventure in space!  We can do better than that.  Space Adventure   It's an adventure in space!  Ugh!  Space Adventure  Ugh!  It's an adventure in space!  According to my motion sensors, Phineas and Ferb are awake! What did you lock your door for, Irving? To keep you out, Albert! Older brothers should have 24-hour access to younger brothers' rooms. It's a good thing I used an old secret military technique I taught myself. Who are those dorks? Phineas and Ferb are not dorks! They are the coolest exponents of awesome stupefaction in the universe! Yeah. Just because you put it on your fansite doesn't mean it's true. And could we talk about all these pictures? What? Too obsessive? Well, there is that, but I'm just saying your composition stinks. I can't even tell what this is a picture of. A solar-powered flock of mechanical hummingbirds. Phineas and Ferb built them. Yeah, right. That's a hoax! How dare you! I suppose this cold-fusion powered merry-go-round they built was a hoax, too! I can tell a fake a mile away, little brother. They call me The Truth Detector. It's not fake! Phineas and Ferb really build these things! A-A-And I'll prove it to you! Well, I have important older-brothery things to do right now. But, if you give me the address, I'll meet you there at noon. Ah, Agent P. I've instituted a new short-order message technique. Listen carefully. Doof is up, put a stop, curses on the side. Well, let's go, Agent P. My orders are backing up. Adam and Eve on a raft, rack em'. Is that a mission, sir? No, it's my lunch. Hello, boys. Are you ready for your Space Thrills marathon? Dad, it's called Space Adventure. It's an adventure in space.  Space Adventure   It's an adventure in space!  Hmm Phineas? Ferb? They went to the movies. No Phineas and Ferb today. What am I gonna do?! Albert goes back to boarding school tomorrow. He'll think I'm a liar. I have an idea. Phineas and Ferb made me this 3D projector. I can project one of their projects right into the yard here. Your brother will think they just built it. And it wouldn't be lying because they actually did build it. What have you got? Well, let us see. Oh! This is from the time Phineas and Ferb built a full-scale replica of the Eiffel Tower. I will hide the projector in the bushes. But, look. Albert is impossible to fool. They call him, The Truth Detector. I don't know, I'm convinced. Uh-oh, and he's supposed to meet Phineas and Ferb too. Too bad we are not Phineas and Ferb. I've got a crazy idea. Time for a makeover! A manly one, right? Full steam ahead. Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, whoo hoo! Oh, hey, there. Is that the Doofenshmirtz choo-choo? No, it's not! You will all be late for your jobs and be fired. Oh, Perry the Platypus. Hello. Have you come to see my new hobby? Scale model reproductions of actual railroads, train depots Look, even scale model litter. Shameful. My father bought one for me when I was just a little evil, butâ You know, he wouldn't let me play with it. Father, may I play with my trains now? Nein! Now that I'm old enough to buy my own, I'm disappointed by the shabby quality of the cheap model reproductions. Which is why I'm going to travel the globe and shrink the world's greatest architectural treasures. Just to put them in my train set, see? The Shrink-inator ray is for the shrinking, the cardboard box is for holding the shrunken treasures, and the bicarbonate of soda is for my motion sickness. First stop, Cairo, Egypt. Wrong way. Ah, we are ready. What? No! No, no, no! You can't both be Phineas! That is what I told him, but he would not listen. But, Phineas gets all the lines! Irving, are you here? He's here! Quick, put these on. Irving! Irving, I thought you were pulling my leg, but this is remarkable. Really? You're buying it? What? Nothing. So, when am I gonna meet this Phineas and Ferb? Oh, well What do you know, here they are now. Hello! I think you know what we are doing today. 'Ello! I'm from England and I don't talk much. Phineas, Ferb, this is my older brother Albert. Albert, meet Phineas and Ferb. Hmm. Remember earlier when I accused you of pulling the wool over my eyes? Well, I take it back! It's a real pleasure to meet you boys. What? So, tell me about this Eiffel Tower. Um, it is big. And Mexican. I thought it was French. What do you know. Learn something new every day. Are you serious? I would be honored to watch the great Phineas and Ferb work. Would you mind building something? Sure. No! I-I mean I know they would love to. Albert? Shh They're working. Hi, Phineas. Hi Ferb? Okay What'cha doin'? Oh Okay! What'cha doin'? They're building something live. In person! Nice. The simplicity of the design enhances its innovation. Really? The simplicity of the design? Okay. First stop on our shopping spree. You know, I've always dug the Sphinx. I mean What is it? A man? A cat? A cat-man? I-It doesn't matter! And gotcha. Now I switch on my Shrink-inator ray and it's mine now! There you are. Perfect. Look atâ L-Look at the detail. Well, you know the saying. ""Honk if you love evil""! Ooh, what are those two up to now? Okay. Phineas and Ferb are standing in the yard with two nerds, Isabella, and the Eiffel Tower. That's nothing but trouble! Wait a sec. Those aren't my brothers. What?! Is that Buford and Baljeet?! Oh, I am so calling Mom! Hold on. If those aren't my brothers, why am I calling my mom? Why not call Buford and Baljeet's moms? That satisfies the Mom response, and the bust urge! I'll call that dork Irving's mom, too. And what the heck? Why leave my mom out of the party? Information, please. Okay, so we have the Great Wall of Chinaâ Oh, e-excuse me, I mean the Great Small of China, and the Uh, The Shrinx, (The Sphinx) and the Teeny Tower of Pisa, (Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the Roman Coliseum The Coliseum Coliâ I have to think about that one. No matter! Because last but not least (Taj Mahal) The Taj Ma-Small! Oh, that's a good one. Back to the Tri-State Area and let the fun begin! You guys are amazing. What else can you do? Um I can turn my head completely around. Wow. I wish I was that double-jointed. Really?! Really. Well, it's been a real pleasure and an honor to meet you guys. Come on, Irving. Let's go. I can't believe we tricked the untrickable. I am at a loss for words, dude. Okay, let's see, the uhâ The Roman Coliseum. The, uh No-Man-Can-See-'Em-Because-It's-So-Tiny. No, that's not aâ Ah! That was really, really amazing. Oh, really? That's right. So, your super senses weren't tingling whenâ Oh, I don't know Ferb had eyes in his mouth?! Didn't that give you a moment of pause?! A scintilla of doubt?! What are you talking about? I can't believe how gullible you are. That wasn't the real Phineas and Ferb. Well, of course it was. I saw their pictures on your wall. That was two kids in costume, and that Eiffel Tower was a hologram, Mr. Ta-Ruth Detector. Sorry, little bro. There was no way that was a hologram. Oh, yeah? Well, let's go back and I'll show you. Yeah, let's do that. What did you think, Isabella? Was I a convincing Phineas? No. No, you weren't. Yeah, but I totally nailed Ferb. Oh, I almost forgot. Wait, w-w-what are you doing with that? Oh, no, myâ M-My Eiffel Tower! Gotcha! Ah Hey, Perry the Platypus. I saved the Trifle Tower. No, Perry the Platypus, don't zap it again. I-It will make it grow. Oh, no, I'm shrunk. What was that? I think it was my stomach. I told you, I'm starving. See it and believe it, brother. See. I can run right through Ow! it. But, it wasâ Butâ I had you! Consider this a lesson learned, Irving. No one pulls the wool over the eyes of The Truth Detector! Hello, Linda. Hi, ladies. I got a call from Candace who said something about our sons and busting! Are Irving and Albert okay? Hello, ladies! Come on, come on, moms! I can't wait to see the looks on your faces when you see the spectacle that's in the backyard. Come on! All right, put up your dukes! Waitâ What are you doing? Hey, this place is nicer than my first apartment.  Space Adventure   An adventure in  Know what, Ferb? We're over it. Yes. Yes, we are. Come on, moms! A-ha! Huh?! Hey, Candace, you built this? Nice to see you're starting to take an interest. What?! No, no, no, no, no. Where's the Eiffel Tower? Oh, wait. I've seen this. A solar-powered flock of mechanical hummingbirds. It's invisible! I've just got to find it! It has to be around here somewhere!  Space Adventure  What did I miss? And look! Here are Buford and Baljeet, your sons being bad! They're in disguises! Uh, really good disguises! Ugh! It'll come off in a second. Does this happen often? Yes. Yes, it does. Welcome to my world. How 'bout a cup of tea? I hope you got cookies! Of course, Biffany. So, let me guess, Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes, we're going to return everything I shrank, right? Even the Roman Small-iseum? Hey, look, I finally figured that one out, huh? Ow! Oh, curse you, Perry the Platypus!"
"by ashirogi27 Ooh, you are so busted this time!  Busted, busted, busted, busted   Tra-la-la   Hey, hey!  Huh? Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom! Hi, honey. Wait 'til you see what Phineas and Ferb are up to now! See?! What? Hey, Mom. Hey, Candace. But, but-butâ! I'm gonna go check on my roast. Ugh! But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but but but but but You've inspired me. but I'm growing out my bangs. but Namaste, compadres. but Oh No matter what I try, I just can't do it! It's impossible! The impossible is possible! With a little teamwork. That's what the Fireside Girls say. Teamwork? Sure! How do you think I got this Mountain-Moving patch? By mindlessly repeating a flawed busting strategy? No Through teamwork! See that mountain over there? It used to be over there. With a little teamwork, you can do anything. Teamwork. Teamwork! Stacy? I know what we're gonna do today. Thank you for letting me choose today's activity. No worries, Baljeet. It is Nerd Awareness Week. It is called spinning tops. Lame! Of doom! Alright, I'll give it a shot. Okay, everyone! Here is how you play. You hold your top, and then.. .you spin! So then, what? You do it again! Ah It is lame, isn't it? Not at all, Baljeet. It just needs a little more oomph. I was hoping you would say that! Anybody else notices distinct lack of egg-laying mammals around here? Baljeet, would you do the honors? Boy, howdy! Where's Perry? Oh, there you are. Didn't uh See ya Sittin' there Anyway, our sources tell us that Doofenshmirtz is up to something and if we're gonna put a stop to it, we'll need a little of that old egg-laying mammalian magic. Why, how didâ Oh, why that little scamp? Alright, ladies. I've got a crew, I've got a plan, I wanna bust. Questions? Stacy? Do you have this jumpsuit in pink? Cause I'm not really a tangerine kind of gal. Why is everything so difficult?! Maybe if we help her bust her brothers, she'll be done with all this busting stuff for good. You're absolutely right, Jenny. Hey, Candace? Uh? I was just kidding about the color, I love orange. And I'm all about persimmon. So, what do we do next? You've heard of Boot Camp? Well, ladies, welcome to Bust Camp! (Song: Bust Your Brothers)  Oh, yeah!  Mom.  You've got to bust your brothers   Make sure that there's no way around it!   You got to bust your brothers   And don't you stop until they're grounded!   Show your mom what they've been doing   The trouble they've been brewing   You know these two are due, and how   You got to bust your brothers   You've got to bust your brothers now!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Norm, hurry up with that coffee! I still got that terrible morning taste in my mouth. Coming right up, sir! Scalding hot, just the way youâ Whoopsie daisy! Ow! I know I didn't make you that smart, but you can't even walk straight? I'll get it. You'll be so delighted when your package arrives in six to eight weeks. My new nemesis toy! Go run my bubble bath while I open it. I wonder which one it is. Oh, not another platypus. I was hoping for something more like Manny the Mongoose or something. Hey, let's see if it lays eggs. Perry the Platypus? Say hello to my little friend! My new Straitjacket-inator! It was tailor-made just for you by my other little friend. It may be small, but it's stronger and smarter than Norm and it's so much more efficient. Listen up, team. I'll be at the front of the house tracking Mom on my GPS device. Jenny, you'll guard the gate. See to it that Phineas and Ferb stay in the hot zone. Stacy, you make sure whatever they built stays there 'til Mom comes home. To achieve that goal, we use the following busting jargon. When Mom comes home, the cue is, ""the condor is in the nest"". When the boys are in prime busting position, it's, ""the peas are in the pod"". And if what they've built somehow disappears, I want you to scream, ""the banana has split""! Got it? Good. Now, in the event that any of us should be capturedâ That's the Mom Signal! Ladies, it's go time! So, move it, move it, move it! The pea is in the pod! The condor is in the nest! Mom! Mom! Phineas and Ferb have built outer space in our backyard! Nice drill, ladies. I'm a-lovin' teamwork! Hey, Candace. Nice us-es! When did you make those? Pay no attention to them, Mom. Yes, this new robot of mine is much more evil than Norm. 'Course, it can't talk, but that can be a good thing. And it even has a convenient blender attachment. Next, I'm thinking of a platypus purÃ©e. This new model requires so little energy to run it really makes clumsy old Norm quite obsolete. Now, I know I have a heart, because it's breaking. We're ready to go. You sure you don't want one, Buford? Nah, I still say it's lame. Fair enough. Canopies down, everybody. Ready! Ah! Ready. Okay, Ferb. Bring out the radiant power source. What's that? You can't plug the tops in or the cords would get all wrapped up. So, we created a power source that will radiate energy across the yard to anything that needs it. Okay, everybody. Now, the secret to a good top spin, if I can call it thatâ Ha, good one, Baljeet! This is almost as funâ I'm going for my Bumper patcâ Code red, busters! The condor is on the wing! I want feet on the ground! It's real this time! Moving in! Rock and roll! Ah, still lame. Maybe I can liven things up a bit. What's going on? Why are they going so fast?! Ah, look at him, he'sâ He's positively shaking with anticipation at the thought of helping me take over the Tri-State Area. He'sâ Iâ I didn't even know he could do that, whatever it is. Wow! I'm a better evil scientist than I thought! Doofenshmirtz, your pathetic schemes have all failed! Step aside and let the true master take over! He can talk! And shoot, too! Ow! Save me! Save me, Perry the Platypus! Perry the Platypus, my fight is with Doofenshmirtz, not you. Agent P, an unusual power wave has struck the city with potentially disastrous consequences. Forget Doofenshmirtz, find the source of that power wave, and dismantle it.  Perry!  Prepare to meet your maker, maker! I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror! Mostly terror! Mostly terror! The condor is in the nest! Let's go, condor! Candace, what is going on? You'll see! Just wait. So, I'm guessing your brothers are doing something wildly dangerous? Uh Well, I've got a few seconds to kill before my bladder bursts like a water balloon, so, let's get this over with. No! Teamwork! I mean, we've got to wait for the signal! Any second now. Come on, girls. Give me the code! Without the headsets, how can we signal Candace?! I don't know! How can she not hear this racket?! That's quite a racket back there. Are you sure you don't want me to take a look? No way! Not until I get the signal. Norm! Norm, help me, I'm gonna be purÃ©ed! Sorry, sir. No can do. I'm bringing coffee to the new boss. Sounds delicious. Just a moment. I don't want to be a smoothie! Here you go, sir. Just the way youâ Whoopsie-daisy. Oh, it's lucky for me you tripped on that rug again. There was no rug, sir. Aw Thank you, Norm. I shouldn't have been so hard on you, but how come you were not affected by that strange energy thingy? Don't you remember? I run on squirrel power! Wow! I should really read your operation manual. Wait for the signal. Wait for it. This is getting a little uncomfortable. Eject, everybody! I lied about the persimmon. Alright, Candace. Enough's enough! No! Is the pea in the pod? Is the pea in the pod?! What's up with the pea?! Not again! Hey, kids. So, what was all the big racket back here? We were just playing with our tops. Oh. Phineas and Ferb and their friends were spinning around and around andâ And they were running so fast and it flew away into the clouds! giant tops of doom! Lame! You girls are beginning to sound a lot like Candace. They were huge! And suddenlyâ Oh, will you two give it up already? But, you said to wait until she offers pie. Ooh! Good idea! Who wants pie? Me! Me! Me. Us! Oh, there you are, Perry!  Oh, yeah!  Mom.  You've got to bust your brothers   Make sure that there's no way around it!   You got to bust your brothers   And don't you stop until they're grounded!   Show your mom what they've been doing   The trouble they've been brewing   You know these two are due, and how!   You got to bust your brothers   You've got to bust your brothers now!"
"by ashirogi27 Ferb, I think we outdid ourselves today. The ultimate frozen yogurt machine. We have enough frozen yogurt to last the entire summer. Huh. Check that out, Ferb. Hey, there little guy. You want some frozen yogurt? Yeah, sorry. We don't have mushroom and larvae flavor. I think he likes you, Ferb! Hey, guys! What'cha doin'? Cool! He disappeared! We found this lizard. Hey, I've seen one of these before. According to the Fireside Girls' Manual, that lizard is a North American chameleon. Then, we'll name him Steve. Okay Why Steve? 'Cause he looks like a Steve. Huh. Can't argue with logic like that. So, I'll see you after you teach your guitar lessons. Yeah. I only have two appointments today. Appointments. Well, all right, Dr. Six-Strings. Good luck with your patients. Dr. Six-Strings. Now, that's banter. Aha! I finally caught you guys! That thing's not going anywhere! You guys are so busted this time! Looks like he's still hungry. Don't worry, little guy. We'll come back with some food. I think Mom just stocked up the fridge. I bet Perry's gonna love Steve. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz has been stocking up a lot of high-end sound equipment and musical instruments. In fact, he jut outbid me on this sweet vintage solid-body maple-top guitar. Ouch! You totally got sniped! Carl! Anyway, we need you to find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. Good luck, Agent P.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Hi, Mr. Doofenshmirtz. Uh, actually, it'sâ Dr. Doofenshmirtz. But, y'know, whatever. Are you ready for your first lesson? Oh, yes, yes. Please come in. I-I have a very special melody that I'd like to learn how to perpetrateâ I-I mean play. Hey, Dad. I'm headed out to theâ Oh, a guitar player, huh? Yup. So, uh, do you know anything by The Scraping Fangs? Nah. Not really into the heavy stuff. I'm outta here. Ugh! Ugh! It's so hard to see all these little notes. D-Do me a favor and flick on that light switch. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, this This is the light switch! Ugh! I tried to make it as obvious as possible. But, what was that? That was just my prototype Gigant-inator ray. It's n-nothing to be concerned about. Mom! Mom, I finally caught them! Ta da Maybe you should take it easy today and run some errands with me. But, but, butâ Steve's sure gonna love these mushrooms. Steve, where are you? Steve! Uh Guys, look at where you're standing. Whoa! It's a huge footprint. A huge chameleon footprint. Do you realize what this means? Some giant chameleon took Steve! The rest of the tracks lead into the city. We're coming to save you, Steve! How am I doing? I rock, right? Um What's so special about this freaky guitar solo? Well, it all started at the pyramids of Egypt! I traveled there toâ You know, discover the hidden secrets of the pyramids of Egypt! And then it hit me! The answer to my quest was staring me in the face. Hidden in those hieroglyphics was a seemingly random series of musical notes. You see, the pyramids of Egypt! were built with the help of alien intelligence. The Egyptians learned how to play a cryptic guitar solo that would summon an alien armada, to help them perform feats of mind-blowing power. That mystical melody is now in my very hands. And once I learn to play it, I can summon the aliens to me, and I will become overlord of the Tri-State Area!!! Have you considered switching to decaf? I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to talk all through our lesson time. Hey, I'm charging by the hour, so knock yourself out. It's just I-I'm used to doing all the talking with my nemesis. He's a platypus. Hey, my friends have a pet platypus. Is he fierce, cunning, and good with a grappling hook? Oh, no. Their platypus doesn't do much. Well, let's take another shot at learning this solo. Hey, doc, not bad. I think you might be getting it! Hey, the tracks just stop. What's casting this big shadow? Whoa! Ferb, what are you doing? Wait a minute. It's just Steve! Wow! How did he turn into a dinosaur? Actually, it's just a giant chameleon. But, dinosaur sounds cooler. Stupid errands. Huh? What? I get it. The sound of Candace's scream freaks him out. What's wrong, Candace? Mom, Mom, Mom! Dinosaur! Follow me! The boys are so busted thisâ Hey, where'd it go? Hi, boys. What are you doing here? Looking for Steve, our dinosaur. Can we keep him? Keep what? Steve. Is he invisible? Yes. Yes, he is. Oh, cute. Alright, Candace, let's go home. Invisible friends? Uh, pfft! I'm so getting to the bottom of this. It's okay, Steve. Candace is gone. Steve, wait! Steve! Sorry to bother you, Agent P. We just wanted to let you know we'd be temporarily unavailable. Seems there's a giant dinosaur running amok downtown and Carl wants to go check it out. Well, I think you've got it. Ah, great! Can you give me a hand moving my Amplif-inator out onto the porch? Your what? It's my omni-directional Amplif-inator. It will blast my scorching guitar licks in all directions, ripping through the vacuum of space to summon the alien armada that will help me conquer the Tri-State Area!!! I don't know why I always say that loud. This is so cool! I'd try to recruit him but I don't think we have a hat that big. Steve? Steve, where are you? There's no way we can catch him. He moves too fast. Maybe we should just give up. Give up? Give up?! The day may come when we'll give up on fruitless searches after a mere eleven minutes, but, that day is not today! The day may come when our favorite reptile may be lost from our memories and his enduring love of mushrooms forgotten, but, that day is not today! Today, we search! We will search for him in the streets, we will search for him in the trenches, we will search for him in the alleys and the mini-malls and the cul-de-sacs of this fair land. We'll search for him in the multilevel car parks and municipal recreational facilities. And we few. We happy few. We small band of brothersâ âa-and girl from across the street. We shall not cease 'til he is found! Yay!!! We'll help ya find your friend! What does he look like? He's a giant lizard about 40 feet tall. Oh. You could have mentioned that up front. Yeah, count me out. You're on your own. Steve! Steve, where are you? You're really rockin' now! The spaceships should be here any minute. And then, it will be time to pump up the volume! Well, that's the hour. I'm gonna pack up my gear. I got another lesson across town. Okay, but the aliens are on their way. Okay. Tell them I said hi. They're almost here. Oh, look, here they come! Perfect! The crescendo of all myâ Ah, Perry the Platypus. You don't stand a chance against my awesome heavy metal gear! Get it? Get it? Heavy metal? Like, it'sâ Steve? Yes? Sorry. Wrong Steve. Steve, where are you? Right here. How can I help ya? Uh, I don't think you're the Steve we're looking for. You might wanna check at the Steve Convention. Hey, Steve! Cool name, Steve! Hey, Steve-a-rino! Hmm Steve! What? No, no, not you. That Steve. Steve is a giant monstrous dinosaur! Huh. I guess they don't like chameleons. Nice to see you again, Steve, old boy. No, wait! Come back! Nothing can stop me now! My alien friends, I command you toâ No! Oh, stop! This is not working up the way it did on paper! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Um, do you wanna pay by cash or check? Maybe I could trade you for some evil lessons? I'll take cash. Whoa! Woo-hoo! Oh, there you are, Perry! Alright, Steve, let's go home. Mom thinks I'm imagining the whole thing! And I know Phineas and Ferb are behind this. Huh? Mom! Thanks, Steve. Sounds like he's still hungry. Don't worry, big guy. We'll be right back with some food. Ah, what's the point? I'm just going to sit here in the dark and rethink my life. Ops! Wrong switcher. Y'know, IâI can see how that would be confusing. Look, Mom! See it? Look at the gigantic dinosaur! Uh-huh. Don't you think that's a bit of an exaggeration? But, but, but Hi, Mom! Hey, Steve's looking like his old self again. So, this is your new pet dinosaur? Well, it's actually a chameleon. You said we could keep him, right? Of course. I'm sure he'll blend right in. Okay, Mr. Monogram, now, this is a G-chord. Uh, actually, it's, Major Monogram. You see, I'm in charge of an elite group of secret agent undercover animals whoâ Y-You don't mind me going on about this, do ya? Hey, man, I charge by the hour, so, knock yourself out."
"by ashirogi27 What to do, what to do? Hi, guys. What'cha doin'? Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. Hey, are you Fireside Girls missing any specific accomplishment patches? Let's see. What's next on the list? Rodeo Clown patch! What does a rodeo clown do? They keep the bulls from knockin' you over, like this! Oh, I can see how that would be helpful. We can build mechanical bulls and have a robot rodeo. Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P. Seems the Tri-State Area's association of evil geniuses, the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness, is having some sort of huge gathering. All of the other agents have been deployed, but none have reported back. We fear they've been captured. Now, see what you can do, Agent P. Monogram out. Tiny Cowboy live in concert! Um, Candace? Tiny Cowboy is our favorite band ever! Candace?! Candace! I can't go. Whaâ? I-It's my mom. She doesn't want me to go to the concert with you. What? Doesn't she like me? No, no. She likes you just fine, she just thinks You're I don't know, flighty and unfocused from time to time. Unfocused? What could possibly give her thatâ Wait. Didâ Did you hear that? Was that Ferb's band-saw? Candace? Yes? Focus. Oh, yeah, right. Mom said if I'm going to a grown-up concert, she wants me to go with someone more grounded and mature. I can be grounded and mature. Really? Well, I can certainly fake it for long enough to convince your mom. Remember that time I pretended to be Irish for a whole week? Indeed I do, Miss O'Flynn! We can do this! Welcome, one and all, to the second annual Inator Creator contest. And now, please welcome last year's winner Rodney! Thank you. Feast your eyes, boys. Ta-da! Look upon this belt of victory. Ooh, I'm taking that puppy home with me, 'cause I'll have a greater Inator this year. Not a greater, it'sâ I-I'm not gonna break a block of cheese and make nachos for you guys. It'sâ It's greater in the sense that it's better than it was last year. That's what I mean. All right, let's concentrate on your look. Ta-da! Butâ They're just a pair of fake glasses. Exactly. Nothing says real focus like fake glasses. What's that? Cowgirls and cowpokes, Wait a minute! welcome to the Flynn-Fletcher Bros' Rodeo! What's going on out there? Candace? They'd better not beâ Feeling busting urge! Easy, girl. Great job on these cowboy hat helmets, Ferb. A rodeo? Gotta tell Mom! Wait. Falling all over yourself to bust your brothers is exactly what makes you look so flighty and unfocused. I must repress my most basic urges to bust. Repressing basic urges is pretty responsible, isn't it? Is it ever! Look at my mom! Cake is a sometimes food. Cake is a sometimes food. All right, cowboys and cowgirls, it's time to get along, little doggy. Or even a short little doggy. I'm here all week. Try the veal! (Song: Robot Rodeo)  You're not a cow   I'm just a boy   With a mechanical bovine toy!   I'm just a boy   Or just a girl   And you rock my mechanical bovine world!

Finally, Perry the Platypus! All the other animal agents were here on time before they got captured, I'm just saying. It's embarrassing. Anyway, join your friends in the inhospitality suite! Oh, and Perryâ Heinz, stop monologuing with your nemesis and show us that supposed Inator of yours already! Doofy rented a private room off the convention floor, because he's still working on his! Laugh enough, now, Rodney, but soon, you'll be crying like aâ Uh, like a Like a something that's cries. Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo! Ugh, he makes me so angry! I'mâ Uh, because he's so right! I need time to finish my Inator! All I've got so far is the fog machine and that's just to add some pizzazz to the presentation. I could turn it on and fog out the whole contest, but all that would do is buy me some time Hey! Okay, shoulders back. Check! Steady walk? Check. Serious look. Check! Uh, Stacy? Yes? I'm feeling the busting urge. Howdy, Candace! Enjoying the rodeo? Ugh! Eyes on the prize, Candace, stay in character. I'm sure your mom let you go to a concert by yourself when you were a teenager. Hmm No. Good afternoon, Mother. Good afternoon, Dr. Hirano. Pardon the interruption, but, is there any tediously responsible errand of a focused and mature nature that I can perform for you? Balance a checkbook, pay the bills, perhaps file some taxes? Why do I feel that all of this has something to do with busting your brothers? What?! No. That would be childish of me. You see? Candace is level-headed and responsible. She's not a bit worried about what Phineas and Ferb are doing right now. What?! Yes! No! Yes! I mean, i-if a responsible and focused person Like Candace Were to see her brothers engaged in some potentially reckless activity Ow! That was childish. There's no case to ruin it whatsoever! This is hideous. It is getting pretty foggy. Should we call the rodeo off? Nah, we'll just incorporate it and have a foggy robot rodeo! Yee-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy! Ride 'em where? You should see what I'm doin'! This fog is making my hair frizzy! It's so nice to sit and be responsible for a change. Just.. .focused, you know? And Candace and I were thinking thatâ Oh, a live musical event might be a good opportunity for us to really Ma Ma Candace? M-M-M-M-M Tiny Cowboy. Ma! Ma! Candace, the concert! I can't help myself! Mom!!! Phineas and Ferb built a rodeo in the backyard with mechanical bulls and bleachers and is really dangerous! Come on, you gotta bust them! This even I have to see. Come onâ Hey, what happened to Danville? That's quite a fog bank. Follow me. Come on, come on. This way, ladies. Pick up the pace! Candace, slow down! Focus, must finish Inator. Whaâ What's all that noise out there? I don't get it, whatâ What's there to applaud? My fog machine should've obscured everyone's Inators. What could it beâ I give you, the Fog Clearer-Inator! Once again, Rodney gives us just what we need, just when we need it. That puts him in the lead. What?! An electric fan? I knew I could beat that if I just had a little more time! Wait! Candace, we've been walking forever! Where's the backyard? Hmm That way! I can smell Phineas and Ferb! And what exactly do they smell like? Motor oil and competence! Hey! Oh! Hey, hey! What's wrong, Buford? I don't know, something's making my bull go whacko! The animal agents are free! My Inator! How disquieting! No, Agent C! Oh, my mom's gonna kill me! No, it's just an electric fan! It's been official to mankind! That balloon! It's making the bulls angry! Hey, kid, you think you can let go of that balloon? This balloon costs me fifty cents! Let go of the balloon! Mom! Mom! The fog is lifting! Aha! Uh Rodeo? Bu-bu-bu-bu-but, thereâ There was anâ And I sawâ A-And the bulls Hey, Candace. Well, so much for Tiny Cowboy. Oh, you can go to the concert. Candace's single-minded determination to bust her brothers shows focus. Something I hope rubs off on you, young lady. Doofenshmirtz, I see you finally managed to cobble something together. What do you call it? A Later-inator? No I give you the Eradicate Rodney's-Inator-inator! What?! No fair! Like a baby! Yeah, that's right! That's what I was looking for. And, it's the last Inator standing! Doofenshmirtz wins by default! By default, my favorite way to win! Unfortunately, the trophy belt was destroyed in the fight. So Uh Oh! Here, take this balloon instead. Eh, a prize is a prize. I'm going to call you Balloony II. What's that? Oh, there you are, Perry. Well, this was fun, but I'm gonna go wash my hair, now. (Song: Izzy's Got the Frizzies)  Whoa, whoa, yeah!   She's gonna be a big sensation   Izzy's got the frizzies!   (Izzy's)   Ow!

Agent P, we've begun emergency evacuation plans omega. We've just received this tape from Doofenshmirtz. Watch closely, Agent P, and join us in girlish panic if youâre into it. Hey, guess what, Tri-State Area, I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have seized control and I'm now your supreme leader. Seriously, life as you know it is over. Thank you, and remember, doof you, doof me, doof us! I'm Heinz Doofenshmirtz and I approve this evil message. While Doofenshmirtz is in charge, no man, woman, child, or hat-wearing mammal is safe. You must find out how this happened then stop it. Until then, Carl and I will be on the lamb, incognito. Good luck, Agent P! Okay. We have to blur the line between skateboard and skateboarder. We can combine dirt biking, ATV racing, in-line skating, street luge, motorized scooters, and Bulgarian folk dancing. Of course, all this extreme fun requires extreme safety, shoulder pads, goggles, gloves, Bulgarian folk athletic supporters, and rocket boosters, razor wire, grappling hooks and laser blaster. Then, we lock it all together with an indestructible titanium exoskeleton that increases strength, jumping ability, and other physical attributes 100 times, including the senses and folk dancing ability. What, you think we should have more Bulgarian-folk-related elements? Oh, less! Less Bulgarâ Okay. Wow, I thought we were on the same page, but no. It's cool. Whatever. Time to suit up!

Yippy ki yi yay!   Wheeeee!   Yippy ki yi yay!   Wheeeee!   Yippy ki yi yay!  Help!  Wheeeee!  Help!  Yippy ki yi yay!  Help! Hey, what's that? Turn down the music. He's stuck in the tree, and I can't get him down! Sounds like Buford's in trouble. Hey, Ferb, maybe we can use this suit to help him. Hold on tight! Hit the rocket boosters! Whoa! Yeah! Hey, Ferb, check us out! We're flying! Phineas, I'm back! Phineas? Ferb? Well, I guess there goes my Early Mid-Morning Edition story. Look, there they are! Help, my nerd is stuck in a tree! Look, it's your favorite calculator and some math problems! Ooh! Fractions? Baljeet! I got you! What is that? This is so much worse than hitting the ground! He saved my nerd! Wow! That was amazing! I can't believe Phineas and Ferb missed it. It's not fair. Every time I try to bust Phineas and Ferb, it's, ""Candace, I'm shopping"", ""Candace, Iâm having root canal surgery"", ""Candace, I'm deliberating with a sequestered jury. How did you even get in here?"" Then myâ Oh, look, a flying man! Wait a second. Isn't that impossible? Wait another second! Something impossible plus that thing existing in real life equals Phineas and Ferb! Well, we've figured out how to fly. Now, we need to figure out how to stop flying. Deploying grappling hooks! Well, at least we stopped flying.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ex-leaders of the Tri-State Area, I have called you here to help ease the people through this transition of power. I thought you called me here to re-caulk your tub. Um I'm only the crossing guard at Fourth Street and Maple. I'm not really sure how much authority Iâ Silence! Are you suggesting that I attempted to gather the leaders of the Tri-State Area, but the best I could do was a crossing guard and my building super? Uh, no But, now that you mention itâ Silence! Wrong! You're wrong! Do you know who that is? It's only Roger Doofenshmirtz, the mayor of Danville! So, shut up! What do you know, youâre only a crossing guard! That's what I'm trying to tell you! Silence! I'm sorry, but if we're not actually gonna plan Mom's birthday, then I've gotta jet. Yeah, us too. Beâ Hey, hey, wait! Wait! Come back! I'm notâ Oh, great, Perry the Platypus. This is all I need. So, what did you want to talk to me aboutâ Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Wow, the suit makes the clean-up fast, fun and 'ficient! I feel bad about missing Isabella. I hope she found something else to write a story about. Early Mid-Morning Edition! The Beak saves the geek! ""Superhero comes to Danville, by Isabella Garcia-Shapiro. I call him The Beak."" Hey, I like that. ""With The Beak watching over us, everyone in Danville is free to have the best day ever."" Best day ever, huh? We'll see about that. Are you in there complainin' again about never havin' a good day in your life? Well, I never did! Where's my best day ever, thank you very much? Ha, I told her. Oh! I heard that! A superhero? That's not at all what we planned to do today! Oh, hi, Isabella. Phineas, where'd you go? You really let me down. Yeah, sorry about that. It's a good thing something else came along for me to report on. Yeah, I know, butâ Hey, maybe we can make it up to you. Really? Yeah, how would you like an exclusive? Great! Meet me downtown in five minutes! Will do. Come on, we have to go tell Isabella we're The Beak. Fine, we can take the suit. I knew it wasâ Blech, blech! ""Superhero comes to Danville."" Well, they're about to get super-busted! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Well, I've gotta admit this flying thing is pretty fun. Hey, look, there's Isabella. Yo, Isabellaâ Take that, birdbrain! Behold, the Khaka Crawler. I built it in my basement out of discarded washers and dryers, thank you very much. And I'm gonna make sure no one has the best day ever! Hide my baby! Phineas, where are you? There's this giant robot machine attacking downtown Danville! I'm all alone here! Call me as soon as you get this. Come on, Isabella, this is what being an intrepid reporter is all about! Oh, this is not good, Melanie. I'll bet they'll try and pin this on me. It's not like you're the one who used the unsigned proposal for defending Danville from giant robot attacks as a coaster. Oh, wait. You were. Yes, it's so easy to blame the guy in charge. The guy in charge. That's it! And whoa! Uh, you know that whole taking over the Tri-State Area thing? I-I was just bluffing. Iâ I-I hoped maybe if I just told everyone I was in charge, they'd be too lazy or too busy to, you know actually check. Oh, hello, Roger. Uh-huh. What? You are? Me? In charge? It worked? You're kidding! Y-You're not kidding? Oh, where is Phineas? He'd know what to do. Please, Phineas. Where are you? Who knew wrecking everyone's day would be this much fun? Hey, you! The Beak! Oh, you're back for more, thank you very much. Oh, great. Now I have to restart, thank you very much. Dude, who are you, anyway? If you're here to give Danville the best day ever, then I'm here to give Danville the worst day ever. You can call me Khaka PeÃ¼ PeÃ¼! What? Oh, come on. It's a family name, loosely translated as ""The Strong Fist"", or ""That Strong Fist"". Thank you very much! All right, let's wrap this up. Hey, my first superhero pun. Well, don't quit your day job, Mr. Comedian. Actually, I thought it was pretty clever. Yeah, 'cause, see, it wrapped around the legs. If you didn't like that one, maybe this will be a hit. Yeah, see, 'causeâ 'Cause he hit him. I'm not an idiot, Charles. This isn't over. You haven't seen the last of Khaka PeÃ¼ PeÃ¼! I'll come at you through what's most important to you. Thank you very much! You were amazing! Huh? Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, the Fireside Girl Gazette. Would it be okay if I asked you a few questions? Um I can't talk right now. Gotta go, bye. Oh. Uh, okay. Bye. Thanks for saving me. We can't tell Isabella we're The Beak now. That would put her in danger. The life of a superhero is a lonely one, Ferb. Even after only eleven minutes. What will become of our heroes now? Find out in the next exciting episode of The Beak! We now return to suburban Danville, where things continue to happen. Are you sure Phineas and Ferb are really The Beak? He is just so heroic and hunky. Ugh! Barf-aroni with cheese! Stacy, please. Phineas and Ferb are doing something totally bustable that's also mobile. We can lure them right to Mom to bust themselves. And how exactly will we do this? Well, if they wanna play superhero, then, we're gonna play super-villain. Call me The Dangiraffe. Right And where do I fit in? You'll be my henchman. Your what? I-It's like the bridesmaid of crime. Okay, got it. Although, it looks like they've got their hands full with Khaka PeÃ¼ PeÃ¼. That's obviously some big, stupid dress-up game they're playing with their little loser friends. Now, if my research is correct, the way to defeat a superhero is to come at him through what's important to him. Hey, check this place out. Swanky. Melanie? Hello, Heinz. No, no, please call me, Supreme Leader Doofenshmirtz. The Great. No. Oh, I see Roger left me a note. Let's see. ""Bro, thanks for filling in for me. You're going to make a great fall guy. I mean, mayor."" Aw, that's so sweet. Go ahead and put that on my new desk. Made you carry your own trap. Now, my first order of business is to make all the citizens of Danville bow downâ! No, it's not. Here's your schedule and all your missed phone calls. Let's focus. Oh, uh, wow. Uh, okay And if you hadn't noticed, the city is in the grip of fear and panic caused by an evil super-villain intent on destroying our way of life. What? Butâ But, that's my job! There. You can't even tell we've built our secret lair up in the tree. Hi, guys. Nothing! I mean Hi, Isabella. We're not doing nothing! Where have you been? Um Oh. You know us. Busy, busy, busy. Right. While you two were busy making sure your summer day was fun, other people were busy saving Danville. The Beak, huh? Check it out, Ferb. A real superhero. And I need your help to find him. I thought there might be some clues in the photos I took that could help him stop Khaka PeÃ¼ PeÃ¼. Fine, if you guys aren't going to take this seriously, I'll find The Beak on my own. Isabella, wait. I gotta go. Bye, Phineas. Ferb, to the nest. Ready, Ferb? Let's wing it. Ba-caw! (Song: The Beak)  The Beak   The Beak   Flies as fast as a supersonic jet   The Beak   (The Beak)   The Beak, The Beak   You can't fly, be honest, you can't   The Beak   (The Beak)   The Beak, The Beak   He's strong enough to move a mountain   You're pretty weak   (Seriously, what do you bench?)   You really are pretty lame compared to The Beak   The Beak, The Beak, The Beak   The Beak!  Phineas, quick! Mom is in danger! And the award goes to Oh, wait, shoot. On the corner of Fourth Street and Maple Drive! Beautiful! Now it's all up to The Dangiraffe. So, then what does The Dangerbil do? I told you. You're my henchman. Hench or something. Oh, no, you did not just tell me to hench. Okay, just watch my bike! Candace, what on Earth are you doing? Ugh! Give, woman! What do you need? Gum? Help, help! I'm taking her purse! Here, honey, here's a 20. Why don't you go see a movie? Aha! I stole 20 bucks from this woman! Help! The Beak! Hi, Mom. Hi, Candace. Everything okay? What? Where's The Beak? Mom's been robbed. Oh, yes, right. Apparently Giraffe Girl has robbed me. Oh, come on, admit it. You two are superheroes. Well, Ferb has been working out. Thanks for noticing. Tell her the truth. You're making me look ridiculous. Way too easy. I lost your bike. Well, as much as I hate joining forces with good, I need to take my responsibilities as mayor very seriously, if I plan to abuse the position later, so Melanie, have you gotten me the phone number of The Beak? That's your stapler. Oops, sorry. Have you gotten the phone number of The Beâ? Still your stapler. ""Apparently Giraffe Girl has robbed me."" ""Ferb has been working out."" ""Excuse me, my child can't see the movie over your monstrous giraffe head!"" Oh, I'll show them. I'll show them all. Hello, there. Hey, you're Khaka PeÃ¼ PeÃ¼. No offense. None taken, thank you very much. I had no idea we had another player in this game. Aha! I knew it. It's all some stupid game. I'm The Dangiraffe. Right What do you say we join forces to defeat The Beak? Fine, but if my friends see us, I don't know you. Hmm. Come on, Ferb. Let's get back to the nest. Oh. Hello, Ferb. Phineas. Hey, Isabella. Sorry we had to duck out on you earlier. Well, that's okay. It's just kind of weird for me not to know where you are or what'cha doin'. Fair enough. Miss Garcia-Shapiro? I've got your next headline. ""Everybody's day ruined once and for all, and The Beak powerless to save it!"" Um, it's a little wordy for a headline. Enough! Okay, Danville, nothing ruins a day faster than unexpected rain showers! You monster! Now I'm wet. Melanie? That's your tape dispenser. Melaâ Paperweight. Oh, no. This is terrible. I'm so glad you're here with me, Phineas. Come on, we can cover the action better from the top of City Hall! Phineas? I'm sorry, Isabella. We can't go with you. You're gonna leave me again? You're gonna have to trust me. Have I ever let you down? Yes. Like, four times today alone. I'm sorry, Isabella. Maybe one day you'll understand. Come on, Ferb. Let's roll. Phineas! Don't you leave me! Phineas! Melanie, could you come in here And that would be a bowl of mints. I've got my finger in a bowl of mints? Yes, you do. Oh, well, that would explain why there are so many buttons. I guess your superhero turned out to be a chicken beak. Well, which came first, the chicken or the egg? Ugh! Well, I've got a surprise for you too. I'm not alone this time. May I introduce The Dangiraffe! Busted. Her name's funny, but not ha-ha funny. Oh, no. He's got Candace. I can't believe it. He actually found out what was important to us. Your move, worm breath. Um Okay. I give up. Then to the death it iâ Wait, what? You win. Huh? Why? Well, 'cause you've got her. What, The Dangiraffe? You're kidding! She's just my henchman. Oh, I do not hench, thank you very much. Dangiraffe is out. Peace. Ba-caw. Wait, how did he get so far away? Melanie, do we even have an intercom? We do not. Hey, look, it's The Beak. Awesome! I'm gonna go check it out. Whoa! Help! Oh, no! Isabella! And that's not all, do-gooder. Watch as I destroy the very symbol of good days everywhere! Oh, no! The Bango-Rus on Ice will crush us! Beak, save me! Uh-oh. Two problems, one Beak. I can't hold on! Gotcha! Phineas! But what happened to The Beak? Come back here, you! Thanks for coming back, Phineas. No problem. Ah, gotta go. Don't worry, your friend's fine. He landed on a ledge, but don't look for me because he crawled in a window. You know, perhaps I'm over-explaining this. Gotta go! Admit it, you're having a bad day. Never! Nothing's gonna stop me from having the best day ever. Oh, yeah? Well, I never had a best day ever. Thank you very much. I get it, Ferb. All this guy ever wanted was to have the best day ever. You know what we have to do, right? Now, Beak, we finish it. I coul dn't agree more! Huh? Phineas is The Beak?! Hey, you just earned your ""Uh-Durr"" Patch. You're just a couple of kids. Sure, my name's Phineas and this is my brother Ferb. Mom, did you see them? Did you? Did you? Did you? Um, no, the optometrist just dilated my pupils. Everything's actually a big, blurry blob at the moment. But get me. ""I'll be back."" But there's no point in being a super villain if there's no superhero to fight with. Exactly. We were thinking of rebuilding our cool skateboard ramp. Wanna help? It'll be fun! Really? You want me to help? Wait a minute. How is that fun? It's like 85Â° out here. That sounds dreadful! Butâ Butâ Butâ Forget it! Where've you been? Oh, hi, honey. Shoo-ush, you! You were supposed to take me shopping. I need me some more throwing chairs! Yes, dear. There goes my day, thank you very much. Well, it looks like he's gonna get his punishment after all. Finally, it's my turn. Now, let the master show you how evil is done!  Perry  Phineas, I'm sorry I doubted you. I should have known you were The Beak all along. That's okay, Isabella. I'm sorry I couldn't tell you. I know you were just trying to protect me. What? Curse you, Perry the Beakapus! What was that? Good work, Agent P. Oh, hey, my vision's clearing up. So, what did you want me to see? Oh, forget it. Okay, then. Why don't we all go home for some snacks? Yeah! By the way, Phineas, you were very brave. Thanks. You were too. Um, hello? Entire lower half of amazing superhero here. I guess there's no glory in thighs. And so Things pretty much worked out. I guess. Narrator guy is out. Peace.  The Beak   The Beak   Flies as fast as a supersonic jet   The Beak   (The Beak)   The Beak    (The Beak)   You can't fly, be honest, you can't   The Beak   (The Beak)   The Beak    (The Beak)   He's strong enough to move a mountain   You're pretty weak   (Seriously, what do you bench?)   You really are pretty lame compared to The Beak   The Beak, The Beak, The Beak   The Beak!"
"by ashirogi27 And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I announce the winner of this year's annual ""Mayor For A Day"" essay contest. For her brilliant essay entitled, Why My Little Brothers Should Be Busted, I relinquish my office as mayor for the day to Candace Flynn! Oh, bravo! Bravissimo! Way to go, sis! Miss Flynn has found the perfect metaphor for our troubled times. In this day and age, it is all of our responsibility to ""bust"" the ""little brothers"" of corporate greed to the ""mom"" of fiscal responsibility. Hooray for ""busting little brothers"" being a perfect metaphor for our times! Oh, that's great. I've been rushing home all summer long for a metaphor. Candace Flynn has that true, good ol' pioneering spirit represented by the founding men and woman who built this city using only what the land provided. Hooray for building things without the tools and technology we take for granted today! Let's hope the city survives. Building things without tools and technology? Hmm. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. I give you Candace Flynn. Iâ I-I think we should bust my brothers. Yes, um When I was the queen of Mars, I All righty, then. Let's get you to your office. Candace Flynn, everybody! Looks like Candace has a full day. And so do we. Let's bounce. And here we are. Oh, look at that. You get the big chair. And you get your own nameplate and a bowl of mints. Ooh! Picture op! Great! Melanie, I'm off to my appointment. You make sure the new mayor has everything she needs. Miss Flynn, you are in charge. In charge, huh? Time to make some new laws. You realize this is just a temporary position for show? You don't really have the power toâ So, as a mayor, I officially give you the rest of the week off. Well, that's really cute, butâ With pay. Melanie is out, peace! Hey, Stacy, how'd you like to be the assistant to the mayor? Coolness. At your service. At last. Candace Flynn is in charge. What'cha doin'? We're gonna build an authentic pioneer town in our own backyard. And we're only gonna use Dad's antique collection of pioneer tools to do it. That's the spirit, Ferb. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. Uh, sorry we have to meet here at the agency sauna. It's just that if we don't use it at least three times a month, we lose our privileges. Anyway, it's our old friend Doofenshmirtz again. He's been researching both theoretical physics and golf fashion. Sounds like an unholy combination. So, we're sending you in undercover to stop him. Good luck, Agent P. Agent W! Didn't see you there. How's the old blow hole? Let's get authentic. Okay, Stacy. Let's get busy. I have a city to run. (Song: Ordinary Day) The task force recruits are looking pretty good. Wait a minute. New law! I'm the only one who can wear that color! Duly noted.  Take your time  New law! Everything should be pretty.  Look far and wide   Just step outside  New law! Free makeovers for the mayor. Good one, Miss Mayor.  Take a walk on the sunny side  New law!  So don't look back  Today is ""Free Clothing For The Mayor Day""! I'll take that!  And find your slack  And I'll take that! And I'll take that! And I'll take that! Andâ  It's never gonna be an ordinary day  New law! New law! New law! Well, looks like you've left your mark on Danville.  Take your time  What?  Look far and wide  I said, it looks like you've left your mark onâ What? I've said  Just step outside  Hold on a sec, Stace. Can we kill the music, please? Oh, brother. I busted my pencil. Brother? Busted? I just realized. I, like so many other elected officials, have forgotten the very promises I made that got me into office in the first place! That's it! I'm gonna bust my brothers! Yes, Mother, I know I promised that I'd spend some quality time with my brother, but, golf? Really? I meanâ No, I am not a big baby! Iâ I am not! Oh, there he is now. Goodbye, Mother. Hello, brother dear. Sorry we're late. Couldn't be helped. You know how it is. Traffic was terrible and I've already wasted half a morning not caring at all about being punctual for our golf game. Oh, and this is my caddy, Katie. H-Hey, where's my caddy? Say, you're not my regular caddy. Oh, lighten up, Heinz. You know what they say, ""you can't be tee'd off once you've teed-off"". That was very funny. What? Who says that? You know. They. Those guys over there. You can't be tee'd off once you've teed-off. Creepy, huh? I've been trying to ditch those guys all day. Are you sure we haven't met before? You look so familiar. Something about your platypus-like beak. Hmm Can't quite put my finger on it. Well, we're almost done. All we gotta do now is get rid of those cattle wrestlers. Tag me in! Tag me in! Ha! Gall dang idgets! Who's that guy? He's the Old Coot. Every frontier town had one. Man, he sure can spit. You tenderfoots better high tail on outta here if you know what's good fer ya! This here town was built on top of an ancient Indian burial ground! Actually, this is our backyard. If you find any gold, it's mine! Uh Okay. If you find any gold, it's mine! That's right, Madam Mayor, we're sending you video now. That's it, boys. Good work. It seems they've built some sort of lame town in our backyard. It looks like they've done a pretty good job. Really, Stacy? Really? Gather the press and the media and get them to my house! This time those pests are goin' down!  Dun dun dun dun  Heinz! Wake up, Heinz, we're on to the next hole already. Oh, I hate golf! It's boring to watch and tedious to play. That's why I came prepared. You think this is a normal golf bag, don't you? But when I twist this club here Behold, the Accelerate-inator! With Accelerate-inator, I can fast-forward my brother through this boring golf game in seconds. Ah, there he is. Let's give it a shot. Fast forward! Oh, yeah! Yeah, look at him go! Welcome, everyone, to The Big Bust! Today, you shall bear witness as I bust my brothers! Yay, metaphors! I want you to take the limo, pick up my mom and dad and bring them back, stat! Oh, yeah! Well, guys, we did it. A one hundred percent historically accurate old-timey pioneer town. Yes, complete with hitching posts. And snake bites. And deer ticks. And various sores I'll be nursing for months. Yep. It took a whole lot of toil, pain, sweat, and hard work to build this town. We should be proud. Let's never do that again. Agreed. Come on, let's go inside the house for a snack. And air conditioning. And indoor toilets. Mr. and Mrs. Flynn? Our Mayor Candace urgently requests your immediate presence at the Flynn household. And so it begins. Oh, yes, I could certainly get used to this. Hello? Hey, Mom! Yes, Candace? I was just checking to see your approximate arrival time at the Flynn household. Candace, this isn't another rant about some imaginary thing your brothers are building, is it? No, Mom! I'm not crazy! So, what time? We're just down the street. We should be home in a few minutes. Â¡Perfecto! Adieu, maman. I wonder what will be waiting for me today. An invisible thing or a non-existent thing? I don't believe it! What on Earth?! It's happening! Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I give you what you've all been waiting for! Look! It's a perfect metaphor that we should return to simpler times and values! That's not exactly what I meant. Ha! A perfect metaphor for how history teaches us about our future! That's pretty good, but no. It's a metaphor forâ Not everything is a metaphor! Candace, what on Earth is going on here? Mom, you know all those times I've tried to fill you in on the crazy stunts Phineas and Ferb have been up to? Yes, Candace. Well, this is one of those times! Phineas! Ferb! Get out here this second! Hey, Mom's home! I'm sorry, Candace. Now I know all the crazy exploits you told me about were true. Amazing! The ninth hole already? Feels like we just started and we're halfway through. This is fun! There's just one tiny, minor flaw to this machine. There's a good chance it could tear apart the very fabric of space-time, possibly even destroy the universe. But, I mean, golf, jeesh! Totally worth it. Whadaya say we amp this up a little? What, are you out of your mind? That is it! You two are so buâ And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I announce the winner of this year's annual ""Mayor For A Day"" essay contest. What is keeping Roger? He's so rude. It's a good thing I have my Accelerator-inaâ Hey, what are you doing? Congratulations to our own local Old Coot! New law! If ya find any gold, it's mine! Hooray for finding gold being a metaphor for Oh, wait. I think we're supposed to take that literally. Pfft! I was robbed!"
"by ashirogi27 Well Ferb, after that long, winded argument of yours, I agree. We'll build a Monorail to Mars! Now all we need is 36 million miles of steel andâ What is wrong with you two? Can't you think of something normal to do like making a lemonade stand or picking your nose or something? That better not be a nose picking machine! Yeah, that's right. Hey, where's Perry? Agent P, I'm glad you're here. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been hoarding all of the paper in the Tri-State Area. Find out what he's got up his sleeve, other than apparently an enormous amount of paper. Good luck, Agent P! So, you boys just try and put one over on me. Hey, Candace. 'Cause I'm gonna be on you, all day likeâ Like a book on a shelf! No, that's stupid. Candace? Like a beard on a face! Ew! No, no, no. Candace? Like a light switch on a wall! That's on! Like I am! On you! Candace! Ready to go to the mall? The mall? Uh Er Don't mind us, ladies. We're just sitting here making every day of summer count. You know, I can't really leave right now I mean Clearly I'm gonna have some serious busting to do around here, andâ You understand, don't you? No, I don't understand! We've been planning this for like three weeks! It's like four months in teenager years! They're using protractors! Candace, I am tired of taking the backseat to the totally unlikely chance that you'll bust your brothers. I want a best friend I can count on. So, you're gonna have to choose it's me, or busting. You're making me choose? You wouldn't dare. Yea-huh! Yea-nothing! A real best friend would never do that to me! A real best friend wouldn't make me do that to her. Then, I guess you're not my best friend. Not anymore. Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! Finally! The plumber. The garbage disposal's stuck again. T-The same one you fixed last week, by the way! And while you're at itâ Oh! Oh, who needs to see that?! Jeesh! Oh! I'll be in the other room. I mean, ohâ For crying out loudâ! What, y-you're done already? You've only been here for like, 15 seconds. And I was talking for like, half of that. What kind of a plumber are you? A platypus plumber? Perry the Platypus plumber?  Perry!  Perry the Platypus?! Amazing what you could do with toilet paper! Which you'd know, if you were a real plumber. In fact, it's amazing what you can do with all kinds of paper! And no, I'm not a hoarder. Gotcha! It's a good thing I threw away a lifelong friendship to keep an eye on you two and your ridiculous Uh Lemonade stand. We liked your idea so much, we decided to go for it. And it's turning out to be a big hit. Wow! This is the best lemonade I've ever had! Hit me again! A regular old lemonade stand? That's it? Huh. That means there's, uh Nothing for me to bust today. Which means I have a free day! Phineas and Ferb, I got to hand it to you. Finally, I do like normal mediocre kids doing normal mediocre stuff. Thanks for giving me the day off. Yeah, that's a lot of paper. Would you like to know what I'm going to do with it all? Well, I'll tell ya. Birth of an inator! The wheel, the light bulb, the frozen pop with two sticks, so you can give half to a friend. All profound inventions in their time, but they fail in comparison to the Paper-Cut-Inator grandchild of the world renowned evil genius, Doctor Heinz Doofenshmirtz! I-I was sick that day! This new and exciting inator turns any kind of paper into razor sharp slicing missiles, and hurled and tore on unsuspecting Tri-State-Area. Watch out Danville! Ouch! Something bit me! That something is evil science, tiger! Good thing the local pharmacy is fully stocked with new Doofenshmirtz Brand Adhesive bandages. They are terrific and expensive! And brought to you by Danville's newest soon-to be trillionaire Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Thanks, Heinz! Yeah, that picture's gonna haunt me. And happy evil! Not bad, huh? I'm gonna do all of my Inator introductions like that from now on! It's just so much more professional-looking! I'm going to the mall! I'll call Stacy. No, wait! Stacy's mad at me. And I'm mad at Stacy! But I can't go by myself, I'll look like a total dork. Okay. I'll just get a new best friend. Hey, Candace. Hey there, Jenny. As you know 'bout her, Stacy has elected to not to renew her option on being my best friend. So, as someone who has expressed interest in the past, I thought you might want to value yourself of this exciting opportunity. Come on, Candace. You just want someone to go to the mall with you. Will you go? Sorry, but I can't. I've got to get to the Save The Pigeons rally. Save the pigeons! Okay, got to cast that net a little wider. Jeremy? No, I can't talk about Jeremy with Jeremy. Mad at Stacy. Jenny, pigeons. Mom, no way! Yuck! How did he even get in here? Delete! Okay, who else? Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. Jeremy, Stacy, Jenny, Mom. How can I only have four friends? And one of them's my mom! Hey, best friend! Huh? I've been looking everywhere for you! Oh, my gosh, I don't know you, but okay! Come here. Let's go to the mall. Hey, did you see that lonely girl? Yeah, she was all by herself and singular. I'm glad people are enjoying our lemonade, but it's getting really hard to keep up. We better check it with Isabella. Isabella, how's phase two coming along? Hold on, Phineas. Little more to my left. Franchise locations are a go. Easy, folks. Relief is on the way. Here you go. Hey, everyone. It says there's a new Phineas and Ferb lemonade stand opening with no wait! They have a lemonade stand inside the grocery store, the bookstore, and the mall. It's even being served on my favorite airline! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Woo! Woo! Lemonade! In your face, orange juice! Boo-yah! That's right! Boo! Yah! Lemonade! Okay No more for that guy. Let me show you my Paper-Cut-Inator in action! First, we get a piece of paper and then roll it inâ Whoop! That auto-feeder. It scares me every time! Okay, Danville. Get ready for some serious minor cuts and abrasions! I wouldn't want to be getting one of those rejuvenating sea salt scrubs right now. The stinging would be unbearable! I-It just takes a little while to warm up. Wow. Finding a new best friend is even harder than I thought! (Song: You're My Better Best Friend) Makes me kinda miss Stacy. Why did I let our friendship go?  Today I've learned a lesson   What a best friend shouldn't do   I put busting my brothers   Ahead of you   You were always there for me   On you I could depend   And now, too late, I realize   I should've been a better best friend   (Ooh-wow-wow-wow-wow)   I said things I shouldn't have   Did things I shouldn't do   Guess I forgot that you cannot   Spell ""us"" without ""U""  So, you lost your best friend, huh? Yeah, I know how you feel. I lost my best friend once. Little guy, all yellowy and scaly. His name was Biff, turned into this whole brouhaha. I had to fight a squid. Wait a minute! Wait a minute! What you're trying to say is that if Stacy's really my best friend, I should just apologize to her. And if I'm really Stacy's best friend, she'll take me back! Oh, sure! It's all about you! It's not too late to fix this! I can still have a best friend forever! Stacy, there she is! Right next to theâ Phineas ..and Ferb lemonade stand. Mom! I'll tell Mom! But, wait! Stacy. Mom! Stacy. Mom! Stacy. Mom! Stacy. Stom! Macy. Stop it! Mulberry. Shish kebab! Marmalade. Hominahaa Okay. It's almost warmed up. Are you watching, Perry theâ Whatâ? What theâ How did you get out of that? It's two ply! Ow, spitballs? Oh, I get it, paper fight! Goal! I am not in love with Sophie! I am not! Oh, you're gonna get it now, Perry the Platypus. Boom! Well, that doesn't do much. I'm gonna get you with the Paper-Cut-Inator! Flypaper? Well, it doesn't matter! Look! One piece? That's it? A plunger jam? Oh, I hate those! They always make the Paper-Cut-Inatorâ E-e-e-e-e-e explode. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Lemon juice! Sorry, folks! We're sold out! Go home, you losers! We're dry! Hey, Candace. Isn't that Stacy over there? Hi, Stacy. You okay, honey? Come on, kid. I got a schedule. Come on, kid. In, or out? Candace? Mom, there's something I gotta tell you. What is it, honey? That if you want me I'll be at the mall with Stacy. Um Okay. Welcome back, best friend. Thanks, best friend. I have had my eye on the cutest pink dress for you. Aw, it's nice to see Candace enjoying herself for a change. Now, where are those lemonade stands I keep hearing about? Well, Ferb, I think it's time to shut her down. Hi, boys. So, what did you two do today? Just normal, mediocre kid stuff. Sounds great. Oh, there you are, Perry. Hey, Dad! I just got some great lemonade from the new stand down the street. It's really sour. You wannaâ Oh! Ow, that smarts, Perry the Platypus! Uh, Dad? You know he's not here, right? Yeah, I know, but I'm sure it's his fault.  I said things I shouldn't have   Did things I shouldn't do   Guess I forgot that you cannot   Spell ""us"" without ""U""  So, you lost your best friend, huh? Yeah, I know how you feel. I lost my best friend once. Little guy, all yellowy and scaly. His name was Biff, turned into this whole brouhaha. I had to fight a squid.  Wah, wah, wah, wah!"
"by ashirogi27 Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be touching down in Hawaii momentarily, but remember, aloha means ""hello"" and ""good bye"". Try not to get the two confused. Aloha! Aloha! I do hope that was hello. Wow, I always want a vacation this close to a volcanic hot spot. Do you smell what I smell, Ferb? Hm-mm. Magma. Your father and I are looking forward to the Annual Couple's Surfing Contest. Oh, I can't wait to wipe out! Dear, wipe out means falling off the board. Yes, I know. Well, there's only one thing I'm saying hello-ha to! Relaxing! And taking a break from trying to bust Phineas and Ferb. What? It's hard work! Come on, kids. Let's check out the gift shop while your father checks us in. Well, I am a little rusty on my Hawaiian, but here goes. Buenos dias, seÃ±or. Me llamo Lawrence. Oh, no, no. Thatâs not necessary. We speak English here. Hawaii is part of the United States. Is it really? How remarkable. Well, we're the Flynn-Fletcher family. Two adults, three children, and our pet platypus, Perry. Excellent. Why don't you join your family while I get the bellhop to attend to your bags? Wonderful. Help desk. Can we get a bell person to pick up the family's bags and platypus. Oh, hey, where's Perry? Aloha, Agent P. I see you're able to subliminally persuade your host family to take their vacation in Hawaii. Still have no idea how you managed to do that. Okay, I'll decide where we go on vacation as soon as I clean out Perry's litter box. Hey, how about Hawaii? As you know, Doofenshmirtz is in the area of the Big Island. He's obviously up to no good. Find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. Sir? Uh I promised Carl to get him one of those hula wigglers for his dashboard. He thinks it would be neat. Hey, what's this? Pineapple scented serenity lotion with SPF. ""Apply and feel instantly serene"". Mom! I totally need the serenity lotion! Check this out. Aqua Primates. A-Primes, Ferb. The back of the box shows them crowning the queen, fighting robots, and designing websites. Ferb, we've totally got to get this! Hey, not to be redundant, but, where's Perry?  Perry!  Perry the Platypus? Well, first of all, I just want to state for the record that this island was not my first choice. I wanted Skull Island right over there, but it was already booked for Jacob Bernstein's Bar Mitzvah, and so all there was available was Pink Unicorn Island. So, go ahead and laugh it up. I will say this was considerably cheaper than Skull Island and, look! I get to keep the robe! Oh, where are my manners? Aloha! That's Hawaiian for you're trapped! And why am I here, you ask? See these little, mini volcanoes? They contain a certain primordial ooze that I need for my latest evil device. Behold, the De-Evolutionator! I-I don't know why it kinda looks like a giant fish bone. That's just how it came in the kit. When I unleash this baby on the Tri-State Area, it will make every man, woman, and child moonwalk backwards down the evolutionary chain, finally stopping at a wimpy little Pliopithecus. ""Ooh, I'm Pliopithecus. I'm not evolved enough to stop a modern man like Doofenshmirtz."" And that's when I will swoop back into town and take over. Isn't that just Darwin? Preparing to relax. Boy, do I need this. Ugh, why are there so many people here? Wait! Wait! One last chair! Excuse me! I was here first! Relaxation. Come to me, serenity. Okay. Well, the A-Primes hatched, but they're really tiny. And it looks like they only do one trick. Moving toward a light source. As impressive as that is, I bet if they were human-sized, they can do all this stuff on the box. Hmm. Ferb, do we have any more that growth elixir? Hey, Candace. Phineas, I don't care if it's a Ferris wheel to Jupiter or a bionic meatloaf. I'm going to relax. Now go ahead. Run along. Okay, Ferb. Time to dump them in. Hey, what are you two kids doin'? We're putting our A-Primes in the pool before they outgrow their container. Is that against the rules? Well, let's see. ""No running, diving, pushing, or modern expressionism"". Nope, nothing here. You guys are good to go. Cool. Let's add the A-Primes. (Song: A-Prime Calypso)  Come along with me my friends   We're going where the party never ends   Here underneath the sea   An aquatic jubilee!   Well, my hands are like prunes   Eatin' mussels from a spoon   Do the A-Prime calypso with me   We're underwater kin   A maritime simian   Do the A-Prime calypso with me   Now, don't you be a wimp   Grab some dried, brine shrimp   And mix it with some H2O-o   Put it in a beaker   Or maybe in a sneaker   Watch the aqueous prime-time show!   Well, my hands are like prunes   Eatin' mussels from a spoon   Do the A-Prime calypso with me   We're underwater kin   A maritime simian   Do the A-Prime calypso with me   Here's a real rocker   Straight from Davy Jones's locker   Do the A-Prime calypso with me   Do the A-Prime calypso with me!  Alright, Candace. You're finally doing it. Relaxing. It's all good. Aloha, malihini, or guests. In the spirit of laulea, or peaceful relaxation, let me be your kumu, or teacher, in an outdoor yoga class, free for hotel guests. Pathetic, isn't it? Some people don't have the discipline to relax on their own. They need to take aâ Oh, who are you kidding? You're taking the class. A little extra serenity can't hurt. Oh, this stuff is slippery! Everybody, find a mat. So, let's start with a gentle standing back bend. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Uh-oh! Improbable creature wrangling time. I knew it! I knew my obnoxious brothers would ruin my relaxation! Shoo, shoo! Get out of here! It's not a real fish! As I was saying, the De-Evolutionator will blast past the Pacific Ocean, bounce off the satellite, and completely blanket the Tri-State Area, de-evolving everyone! How are we doing in the back row? Can you see okay? Alright, away we go! Oh, for badness sake! What now? Oh, I see. It'sâ I-It's a little smear on the lens. I'll justâ Oh, um, excuse me. Excuse me! Hey, mister. Have you seen a group of giant, wet aqua primates running through here? Elevator! Thanks! Hey! You two are so busted! Hold it right there, young lady! I'm the manager of this hotel, and if there's going to be any busting to do, I'm going to do it. But but but but Wait, a minute. I am on vacation. He is working. I pass the bust baton to you, sir! Aloha! Come back here! Stop! Stop right there, young men! What is the meaning of this? Uh I'm not sure I understand your question. Stop! Come back here! Wow. For someone living in Hawaii, he's awfully stressed. Okay. This, I don't even get. Alright, Candace. You're finally doing it. Relaxing. Come back here! Stop! How are we going to round up the A-Primes? Hello? Room service? Wait, I'm going to call your mother! Hello, you've reached Linda Flynn-Fletcher. And if this is Candace, I'm sure whatever the boys are doing is nothing. Ugh! Hon, Doc. Colberg and his old lady are trying to drop in our wave. Ooh, those crazy coots! I'll just do an old-school drop de-turn on them, eh? Cut back up the face, through the sloop, do a nice inner tail-slide, and drop into the green room for a bit of tune time. You got all that on the Internet, didnât you? Yes. Yes, I did. Cowabunga! What? What is it? Oh, great. Now I'm a single-celled organism. Now, how am I going to drive home? You boys ordered a giant flashlight from room service? Yep. You're in luck. We were just about to take that off the menu. Here. Let's switch this baby on. Hopefully the A-Primes haven't forgotten their one trick. It's working! They're moving towards the light. Are you Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher? Yes? Your boys are doing something in the back, and you have to see it. No, wait! Don't throw that out! No! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Perfect. They're still here. Come quick! Come look! See? Look at the slimy, disgusting creatures. Well, that's not a very nice thing to say. Hi, Mom. Hi, boys. Yeah. But But, but But, there were all these My apologies if my daughter put you up to this. We'll be upstairs, kids. Oh, dude. I know, right? I'm starting to get the hang of it. I think this motion refers to the swaying of the palm trees. Oh, yeah, and this motion says this Brit can move it! I wonder how the boys are doing. Nicely done, bro. We are becoming quite the islanders. Oh, Jeremy. I must be the luckiest girl in Hawaii. What is that? Ooh, a good luck charm! With its own theme music. Who could've guessed that my De-Evolutionator would backfire on me? Alright! Put your psuedopods down. Hey, what's that? My De-Evolutionator, right there on the ocean floor. If it's still working, I can throw it into fast forward, and evolve and get back into my former wickedness! Oh, it's a good thing I installed this molecular scale control panel. It seemed frivolous at the time, but I'm glad I did it. And Phew. It's strange that my underwear and socks evolved with me. Aloha, bros. Hey, Candace. Cool necklace. Where did you get it? Oh, you like it? It's my lucky charm. It was delivered to me by tranquil, Hawaiian waves. And what are you up to? Well, we've done our share of terrain-based activities, so weâre gonna try some semi-aquatic endeavors. Speaking of semi-aquatic, where's Perry? Agent P. We still don't know the current whereabouts of Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but we're picking up a strange signal from the island of Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie. It could be emanating from the missing De-Evolutionator. You better investigate. Good luck, Agent P. Carl! More ice! Coming, sir. With the De-Evolutionator back in my hands, I can reverse the settings, and I'll have the most highly evolved brain on Earth! Now that I'm so smart, I don't think it was such a good idea. Oh, my precious, little good luck charm. I'm so glad I found you. Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wellâ If this wasn't meant to be, someone give me a sign. No, no, no, no, no No! Well, that's good enough for me. This single guy is out, peace! Oh, my gosh. I could've been killed. Iâm so glad I have my lucky charm. You totally saved my life. Ugh! Well, I guess that could've been a lot worse. But, thanks to my lucky charm I guessâ No worries! I got my lucky charm on. Well, I guess it could've been worse Okay, that does it. This thing is totally bad luck. Well, little amulet, this girl doesn't need any more misfortune. So, bye-bye, bad luck! Over it! Ooh, nice necklace. What?! Howâd this get back on! Please help me! How do I get rid of this? You must take it to the island of Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie, to the top of the volcano, and Of course! It can only be destroyed in the fire from which it was formed. Hold on, volcano! I'm a-comin'! We work for tips, you know! And, she's gone. Hey, I need a ride to the island of Wa Ta Lot Ta Hoie? Sure, just grab that tow line. Tow line? Do you mean this? Hey, wait! Why is this happening to me? No more bad luck! Wow, sis. Way to hang loose! Cowabunga, kids! Laird Hamilton? Last I checked. Say, aren't you dudes a little young to be riding this kinda surf? No worries, bro! We're just gonna hot dog this honker past the bone-yard to the sand. You got that off the Internet, didn't you? Yes. Yes, I did. Alright, then. Hang loose, kooks. Later, wahine. Hang ten, water man! See you on shore, Candace! I'm doomed. I'm cursed. Phineas, Ferb, I need your help. I can't get rid of this tiki charm. Uh, personally I'd be a little more worried about that manta ray stuck to your head. What? Ugh. You know, with the day I've been having, I didn't even notice. Here, Candace. Let us get rid of it for you. That won't work. Every time I try to get rid of it, my luck gets even worse. No worries, Candace. See? Nothing! No bad luck. Perfectly fine. But But, but, but, but, but Wow, you got pounded. Let me give you a hand. Looks like you could use a little luck. Here, I found this on the beach. Later, dawgs. Later, brah! See, it's back. What can we do to help? We need to get to the top of that volcano and throw it in. Well, alright then. I know what we're gonna do today! Being stranded on a deserted island is much easier with a normal sized head. Oh, I got something. It works! I found a platypus! Perry the Platypus?! Just because we're stranded on a deserted island, doesn't mean we should abandon our normal lives, don't you think? Because then, the Tiki gods would win! So, I made myself supreme ruler of the Tri-Coconut Area when no one was looking. It stretches all the way from the big rock over there where I'm drying my socks and undies to those three coconut trees at the end of the beach. And I have my minions. Look, if they don't obey, I eat them. What's that look? Oh, you're looking at the De-Evolutionator. Is that why you're here? Well, don't worry about that. I had to disable it. It was doing bad things to my head, man. I-I keep it around for the crabs. They really seem to like it. I know. Weird, huh? They get all Kubrick-y on it. Hey! Okay, fine! Go ahead along! See if I care, but keep your little webbed feet away from myâ Ow! Oh! Oh, you're so going to be crab cocktail. (Song: Bad Luck)  When the day began you had the wind in your sail   Things were going your way, you thought you just couldn't fail   Now you're walkin' around, like you're under a curse   And you don't know how this day could get any worse   Bad luck   A dark cloud you're standin' under   Bad luck   (Bad luck)   Wait, do I hear thunder?   Bad luck   (Bad luck)   Well you can try and try   But bad luck is gonna get you and you don't know why   Bad luck   Could it be any clearer   Bad luck   (Bad luck)   Like you just broke a mirror   Bad luck   (Bad luck)   Did you walk under a ladder?   'Cause your luck was just bad   But it's getting badder   Bad luck!  Oh, Perry the Platypus! I've drawn a line in the sand and you are not allowed to cross this line. Ooh, refreshments! Where you get that? Could I, uh Could I have some? Whatâ What, the line? Oh, no, look. I-I was just kidding aboutâ Look! Look! Look! Look! I-It's not a real line. It's not a barrier! Aw, come on! Oh, Perry the Smarty-pus! Behold, the Sand-inator! I bet you're wondering what it does, huh? Huh? W-Well, it's easy. It causes great, irritating sand to wedge itself into your swim trunks, causing it to chaff, and get a rash, and have a lousy day at the beach. How do you likeâ Huh. You don't wear trunks. What is that? A European thing? Oh, hey, it works. I have sand in my trunks and it's really irritating. I may be starving and dying of thirst, but, at least I got my hovel. What has he got? Nothing! He's a platypus. They'veâ They got like webbed fingers and no opposable thumbs. I meanâ Practically flippers. Wait, waitâ Wait, those are my minions! Ugh! Traitors! Are we there yet? For safety sake, I think Ferb and I should check out the scene before you go up. Okay, yeah. Whatever you say. I'm not taking any more chances. What's taking them so long? Phineas? Ferb? Oh, no. Huh? Hey, Candace. Mom? Check it out, Candace. There's tons of these. Hey, wahine. Looks like you took the long way. Most people just take the escalator, you know. No! No, I can't handle any more bad luck! That's not bad luck. That just means your table's ready. Let's see what other luck it brings you. Ah Looks like someone's getting a free dessert, huh? No way. I don't want anything of that necklace brings me. Goodbye. Good riddance. Candace is out, peace! I'll take that free dessert if you're not gonna eat it. No, thanks. I just glad I got rid that bad luck! I've got to get off this island. What I need is a BO-AT or boat as I am now been told it is pronounced. Oh, look, a BO-AT! A-A boat! Uh, Perry the Platypus. I've decided that our efforts would be better spent if we work together to get off the island. Here, l-let me help with it. You won't mind if I borrow your boat. Nice work, Agent P. Agent W will take it from here. Rubber ducky is in the water. Over. Oh, what do you say we get something to eat? I hear there's a great restaurant of the other side of the island. And, uh I found one of these. Maybe we'll get a free dessert. Oh, there you are, Perry. So long, Perry the Sucker-pus! Look after my minions! Those little traitors! Oh, for crying out loud!  Agent W!  Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Listen up, both of you. Let's get one thing straight. I am supreme ruler of this place and don't you forget it! Ow!"
"by ashirogi27  Summer belongs to you!  Uh, hello? Hey, Jeremy! It's me, Candace! Oh, hi, Candace. You realize it's like Oops! Sorry. I-I was just wondering how your vacation's going. Actually, it's funny you called because you were in my dream just now. Really? Yeah, it was weird. You and I were in this Dixieland band and there was an iguana playing an oboe when weâ I gotta go, Jeremy. I'll call you later. Mom! Did you hear that? I can't hear anything because of all this road construction. But, Mom, they've built a giant rope jumping robot and it'sâ Phineas, will you turn that thing off? I am trying to bust you! We can't, it's become self-aware! The jump-roping was his idea! Mom! Mom! Mom! Okay, I'm here. What did you wanna tell me? Backyard, now! Excuse me? Backyard, now, please? I jump, therefore, I am. Oh, there you are, Perry. Right back here, Mom! Look! Here they are. Hi, kids. Did you have fun today? Yes. Yes, we did. Good for you. I would've been home sooner, but it took me an hour to drive around the road construction in the neighborhood. It sure would be helpful if they could just make the days a little longer. Who do I call about that? Hey, do you mind? We have a visual gag going on here. Thank you! Our vacation is more than halfway over, and what have we accomplished? Okay, so we've built a rollercoaster, we traveled through time twice, found Atlantis, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah See? We've hardly done anything! We need a real challenge. We need to create the biggest, longest, funnest summer day of all time! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  Doofenshmirtz in a Jet Airplane!  Well, Vanessa, are you looking forward to seeing Tokyo on our daddy-daughter trip? Yeah. I was really hoping for Paris. I mean, I did drop all those hints, but I guess Tokyo is more exotic. Yes, that is why I chose Japan over Paris at the last moment! That makes perfect sense. There is no other ulterior motive behind it all, so, you know Uh, this is your captain speaking, we're expecting a slight delay for our arrival in Tokyo. There's always something. Turbulence, headwinds, giant jump-roping robots I dangle, therefore, I am. So, Mom, while you're away, I'm in charge, right? For two whole days? That's right. Remember, no boys over. Of course, Mom. Jeremy's in Paris anyway. So When you say I'm in charge, what exactly do you mean by that? Well, to put it simply, I mean, ""you're in charge"". So, Phineas and Ferb were up to something bust-worthy, and I am, as you say, ""in charge"", I have free reign to call you as many times as necessary? Quite the contrary, Candace. Being in charge means you handle things yourself. Yup. Basically, if you're really in charge, you won't need to call at all. You see, if the boys are doing something bust-worthy, that means you're not doing your job and you would be in trouble too. Whoa! Whoa, heavy! By busting the boys, I bust myself? Ah, there's the rub. Right next to the pair of ducks. I'm also packing this book of puns! Bye, kids! Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad! Have a successful endeavor! Paris French girls and Jeremy Iguana playing an oboe Stacy? I am freaking out here! Ugh I'll be right over. Cool, thanks! And could you bring some breakfast? Hello? So, Phineas, what'cha doin' up so early? Today is the summer solstice, the longest day of the year! And Ferb and I are gonna make it even longer. So, you built the Statue of Liberty? No Oh, wow. That is weird. Behold! The Amazing Sun-Beater 3000! Wow! Amazing! It's a name followed by a big number! It's fast and it runs on vegetable oil, so it's environmentally friendly. In this ship, we will travel around the world as the sun does, making this, the longest day of summer, even longer! That'll give us twenty-four hours of continuous daylight, and add the extra fifteen hours we would've had anyway, that's almost a forty-hour day! It can't be done! There's only twenty-four hours in a day and that's that! Well, yes and no. You see, Buford, if you define the day by the passage of the sun, and we follow the sun by travelling around the worldâ Nah, nah! Don't try and confuse me with your sorcerous ways. There's nothin' I've ever seen that would make me believe you could pull this off. Except for that time-machine thing, andâ Oh, and the rollercoaster! But, other than that, nothin'! Oh, and the time you played that song when the platypus came back, oh Man Nature just bends to your will, doesn't it? Yeah, nothing's impossible if you believe you can do it. Well, I don't believe and therefore it's impossible. And what's more, I bet you can't do it! You bet us? Yeah, I bet you! And if you lose, you're gonna have to stand up in front of everyone and say that you are governed by the laws of physics, and summer's not whatever you want to make of it. And what's more, you're gonna spend the rest of your summer doin' nothin'! And what happens when we win? Hm I'll eat a bug. Buford, you'd eat a bug right now if we asked. Are you asking? No. All right. How about I give you back your bike I took when we were little? My bike! Mine! No How about this? When we make it back here before the sun sets, you've gotta give everyone their bikes back. Mine was the one with the unusually large front wheel. I still get to eat the bug though, right? Sure thing, Buford. I want the bug. Phineas, what are you doing? You're putting your entire world view on the line. And for what? A bunch of bikes? And a bug! Isabella, it isn't about the bikes. It's about my world view. You see, we've all gotta ask ourselves just one question. (Song: I Believe We Can)  What is a summer really   But a tepid month or three?  Clay Aiken? Yeah. I hired a stunt singer, what do you think?  If you agree with Buford   That's all it will ever be   And we don't need to break the laws of physics   To make a day that's longer than a day   We can follow that old sun 'round the circumference of the globe   And stop all the nay-sayers from nay-say   ing   'Cause I believe we can   And that's the measure, the measure of a man   It may sound far-fetched   This thing we've got planned   But I believe we can   I believe we can   Ooh, I believe.   I believe we can   And that's the measure, the measure of a man   Oh, that's the measure of a man  Chaka Khan.  We'll make it back here  Nice.  We'll make it back here   To where we began   Oh   Or at least that's the plan!   Of course   First you're gonna have to fix this wing, yeah!  Hey, where's Perry? Uh, hi, Agent P. Major Monogram isn't here right now, but he left this note. ""Dear Carl, I haven't been kidnapped so don't come looking for him. I mean me."" Kinda weird, though, that he took the time to cut each letter out of a magazine. Anyhoos, Doof is on vacation with his daughter in Tokyo right now which is where the Annual World Good Guy convention is being held, and Major Monogram's the keynote speaker. Coincidence? A 100% yes! So, I guess you got the day off! Alright, you got your breakfast. What's eating you? Well, you know how Jeremy's in France for another week? Yeah, so? Do you know what they have in France? The pyramids? No! French girls! Come on, Candace. Everybody knows that you and Jeremy are an item. Not officially. He's never even called me his girlfriend. We've never even kissed! That means that Jeremy is single, in Paris, and surrounded by French girls. I'm no fool, Stacy, I've seen the oil paintings. Candace, you've got to believe in yourself. What do French girls have that you don't have? At the moment, Jeremy. Candace, if you want him to call you his girlfriend, maybe you should call him your boyfriend. I can do that? I can use the B-word first? Sure, why not? Oh, and Stacy Pyramids? Really? Oh, right. That's Belgium, isn't it? Look at this. It says that the tallest structure in Tokyo is the Tokyo Tower. And it even looks like the Eiffel Tower! See? It's just like we're in France! Oh, here's my bag now! I can't believe you brought work with you! What do you mean? Dad, you've got some guy tied up here. No, no, Vanessa. We've got some guy tied up here. I've got a name, you know. All right. Vanessa, Major Monogram. Major Monogram, Vanessa. There, you happy now? I've never been happy. Come on, let's go get a taxi. I'd prefer a town car. Quiet, you! Okay, we're getting a slight late start because of the broken wing, but here's the whole route. With stops in Tokyo and Paris to refuel. You're going to Paris? Yeah, wanna come? To the City of Love? That's what they call it. You're asking me, to go to the City of Love, with you? Yeah, it'll be fun. Now, let me see if I got this straightâ Hey, Dinner Bell! I'm goin' with you to make sure you don't cheat. Okay. So, Baljeet, you wanna come too? Well, naturallyâ I get one carry-on. All right. Carry on, then. Did you get that wing fixed yet? I guess so. We pretty much used up all the packing tape. Okay, the clock is ticking, everyone! Phineas! What's going on here? We're flying around the world to make the longest, funnest day of summer ever. Oh, no, no, no. Mom left me in charge, and I say you and your little friends are not going anywhereâ Hey, Candace! Check out this giant map! You're going to Paris? France? That's the plan. We'll have to stop and refuel. Like I was saying, you and your little friends are not going anywhere without me! No, no, no, no, Candace! This is a bad idea! About as bad as you've ever had in a long line of, and I love you when I say this really, really bad ideas. Stacy, they're going to Paris! Where Jeremy is! You promised your mom you'd keep your brothers out of trouble. What better way to look after them than by going along and keeping them out of trouble along the way? You realize that's a massive rationalization, don't you? Oh, yeah, totally. Well, say hi to Jeremy for me! And hey, you should stop by and see my cousins in Tokyo! Ferb, did you get that giant map packed? Wow, mad folding skills. You guys all ready? Ready for you to lose! Uh, Ferb? All right, everyone, make sure your tray tables are stowed and your seat belts are in their full and upâ Okay, girls. We got roughly forty hours to get this backyard in line and set up for the party. Let's go, go, go! Who left her in charge? Here, make yourself useful. You know, we're only booked for the hour! So, what did you guys think of the Pacific Ocean? Eh, probably like my fifth favorite ocean. Next stop, Tokyo! It says here that the Tokyo Tower is the tallest self-supporting steel structure in the world! Oh, look down there, that guy just fell off his bike. But.. I-It says nothing about a giant water balloon. Dad? Do you like it? We're supposed to be on vacation. Uh, we'll be on our way just as soon as Major Monogram drops this water balloon on the entire International Good Guy convention. I would never pull an elaborate childish prank like that. It w-would ruin my reputation! Destroy my creditâ Oh, I see where you're going with this. Yes! And best of all, without your leadership, it will totally put an end to, ehâ That'sâ W-What's the name of your organization again? The O.W.C.A. The Organization Without a Cool Acronym. Okay. Well I'm going to put an end to Ah-ooh-ca, I guess? Wow, that really isn't a cool acronym. Told ya. Ladies and gentlemen, Tokyo, Japan. Stacy has family down there. We should visit. We're one step ahead of you, Candace. Here we are! Whoops. I thought it sounded a little grindy and sparky. Kon'nichiwa! Suteishi no tomodachi desu! Hey, everybody! Phineas and Ferb are here! Wow, Stacy sure has a lot of cousins. (Song: J-Pop (Welcome to Tokyo))  Welcome to Tokyo   Being glad that you are here   We came visiting, delightful us   Welcome to Tokyo  Hey, do you guys have any vegetable oil we can use? We need to refuel. Oh, sure. Baa-chan owns a tempura restaurant.  As for a list of exotic amusements which makes between the summer there   Is here we look at baseball like the fact that it does   Our some people the fact that volleyball is done and is enjoyed   When it's hot we swim in water like the fact that it goes  Thanks a lot! We'll say hi to Stacy for you! Man, Tokyo's a fun town! I have no idea what just happened. No one in the agency will ever believe that I dropped that water balloon. Oh, but they will. Because you're going to confess that you did it on camera for the world to see! You can't make me talk. I have nerves of steel and an iron will and gold teeth and a copper spleen. Basically, I'm 35% metal. Oh, man. It must be hard getting through the airport. Oh, don't get me started. Anyway, you can't make me talk. Oh, yeah? ""I am Major Monogram. I dropped that water balloon. I have poopy pants."" Eh? Well I stand corrected. That's actually very convincing. Dad! This entire trip has been about your work! That's it! If you don't want to spend time with me, then I don't want to spend time with you. Vanessa, where are you going? I'm going to the airport and I'm flying to Paris. Hey, Perry. Alone if I have to! Vanessa, wait! You have all the traveler's checks. Traveler's checks? Really? Oh, did I say traveler'sâ Uh No, noâ I do wanna spend time withâ L-Look, look. I'll drop the water balloon right now, we'll getâ Cheese and crackers! Oh, excuse me, you two, but, uh Should that button be blinking like that? Yep! That means it's working! Oh, this can't be good. No, Vanessa! No!!! Oh, they caught her! They caught her! Ferb? Vanessa? No matter where we go, Ferb knows everyone. Thanks, guys. It's a good thing we came along when we did. So, where can we drop you? I don't know. Where are you guys going? Well, we're off to Paris to refuel and then back to Danville. Can I just come with you? Sure. Wait, wait, you saved her and now you're running off with her likeâ Oh! I've very mixed feelings about you! Uh, Perry the Platypus, how did you get here? I need a ride. Could you guys help me out? You're kidding, right? No! I have to save my daughter. This is a big deal! Oh, please? Please, please? Oh, please? Please-y, weasy? Please, please? Please? Fine. But, after we get her back, you're gonna have to answer for what you've done here, mister. Wait, what? You were coming here, anyway, andâ Oh, and uh As far as flinging that water balloon into orbit ""I did that."" Seriously. When was the last time you washed your hands? Okay, everybody! Keep an eye out for Klimpaloon! Klimpaloon? Yeah, Klimpaloon! The magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas! You're making that up. Come on Candace, does that sound like something someone would make up? What's that? Uh-oh. We didn't calculate for the weight of an extra body. Will this affect our arrival in Paris? Hmm Let me let you know in about two seconds. Candace? Yeah? It is going to affect our arrival in Paris. And you thought I'd made it up! Do you even have an idea where we're supposed to be going? Fortunately, Vanessa's wearing the earrings I got her. They're made out of these cool little tracking devices. Look, see? The signal's not too far away but it's on the move. That way! Woo-hoo! Team Doofenshmirtz, ho! What? Well, like I'm gonna let you name the team? Organization Without a Cool Acronym? Well, looks like you're gonna lose! Hey! I believe my Uncle Sabu lives not far from here! Perhaps he can help! Cool! Come on, let's go! Forget it. I'm staying with the plane. And I'll keep her company. Okay. Back in a few. So, Candace, what is Ferb short for? I don't know. He's home! Ah, Baljeet and friends, I was expecting you. Really? No, that's just something we say up here to freak out the tourists. Uh, Uncle Sabu, do you live up here? Yes, it's quite a trek, isn't it? It used to be very inconvenient for me. But, then I built my factory right here, and now it's inconvenient for everyone else! What do you make here? Oh, wait for it. There's a whole musical number. (Song: Rubber Bands, Rubber Balls)  Rubber bands, rubber balls   Made with super-special density   Rubber bands, rubber balls   They can bounce with such intensity   This is the room where we test the stretching   This is the room where we test the bounce   Here we add the long-chained hydrocarbons   The names of which I cannot pronounce   This is the room where we test compression   This is the room where we test recoil   This is a break room for all these dancers   And here's a little fridge so the curry won't spoil   Rubber bands, rubber balls   Made with super-special density   Rubber bands, rubber balls   They can bounce with such intensity   Basically what we make here is rubber   We're not trying to diversify   We don't make knickknacks, we don't make tchotchkes   Or really anything that's gonna catch your eye   We don't make pianos, we don't make cream sodas   We don't make the zippers for your parachute pants   We don't make ice cube trays or ceiling fans   We make rubber bands!   Rubber bands, rubber balls   Made with super-special density   Rubber bands, rubber balls   They can bounce with such intensity  So, what do you make here again? Okay, everyone, back to oneâ No, I'm just kidding. Just kidding. Could we borrow one of these? Ugh, I've got like no bars here. Let's see if we get a signal further up the mountain. I got her! She's down there on that craggy mountain. Quick! Let's land this bird. The terrain is too treacherous. You're going to have to parachute. Here's your parachute, goggles and oxygen mask. Wow, you have everything. How about a nice cup of hot cocoa!!! Do you hear rumbling noise? So, as soon as Candace and Vanessa get here, we can stâ Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Start the plane! Ferb, I think we might wanna start the plane. Start the plane! Start the plane!!! Start the plane! Start the plane!!! Sounds like you're flooding it. I'm not flooding it! Start the plane! Incoming! Ooh! Start the plane! Start the plane!!! Huh? No, no, no, no! How am I ever going to explain this to Mom?! That's not helping! Candace, hop on! All right! Hold on to something! So, how'd it go? (Song: Bouncin' Around the World)  Come on along with me   So many sights to see   But not a whole lot of time   We're in a hurry   We're bouncin' around the world   I think we all can agree   That was the Baltic Sea   I check my GPS, I'm   I'm pretty sure that we're bouncin' around the world   We'll bounce across the Great Wall   And past the Taj Mahal   We'll go to Rome and see the Colosseum   The Colosseum   It's a real whirlwind tour   So if you wanna be sure   Don't you blink or you won't see 'em   You won't see 'em   I wish that we could stay and have some fun   But we gotta keep chasin' the sun   With a little compression   And a little recoil   And a big jet engine   We're gonna be bouncin' around the world   And baby, that ain't all   We got a big rubber ball   Did I forget to mention   That we're gonna be   Bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', bouncin'   Bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', bouncin'   Bouncin' around the world   Bouncin' all over the world   Bouncin' all over the world  We're all out of rubber bands. But, the good news is we're gonna crash into Paris. How is that good news? Huh? I thought you wanted to go to Paris? Oh yeah, I did. I'm feeling very conflicted about this! All right, gang. We made it to Paris. We need fuel and parts, so we'd better split up. Yeah, my pants are way ahead of ya. According to this spg, Vanessa's in some place called sÄ±rap. Hmm. Oh, Paris! That makes a lot more sense. That's actually where she wanted to go. Good for her. Okay, everybody, let's get going. Candace, you go see Jeremy. Way ahead of ya! Baljeet and Buford, you guys go scare up the fuel we need. You're still gonna lose, but I do like scaring things. Ferb, why don't you go to the Eiffel Tower and get a reading on the trade winds? Hop on! Vanessa, you rented a scooter! Uh, yeah. Rented. I'm gonna go see if I can find some parts. Isabella, you wanna come with me? Yes! I meanâ I mean, yeah, sure, you know, whatever. It's all good, bro. Okay. Jeremy's staying at the hotel La Poubelle. La Poubelle, La Poubelle La Poubelleâ Ooh! Uh ""Pardonaise-moi, madam"". Oui? Um Uh Une moment. Can you tell me Oh, ""pouvaise-vous me dire"" Uh Can I tell you directions? I-It's okay, I speak English. Yes. I speak English. ""Parlais anglais"". Uh ""Ou est la Hotel Poubelle""? It's, uh, just around the corner. Ugh, around the corner, around the corner Uh ""Oh quan de la rou-ee""? Oui. Oh, never mind. I'll find it myself. Hey, Hotel Poubelle! It's just around the corner! There he is! Jereâ! Merci. So, Phineas, what do you think of the City of Love? I wish it was the City of Airplane Parts. Oh, you're just too stressed. You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it. (Song: City of Love)  We could share a crÃªpe sucrÃ©e   At this Parisian cafÃ©  Huh. That awning could be used as a sail. Or, you know, a parachute. Depending on how things go.  Take a break and smell these flowers   Underneath the Eiffel Tower  I wonder if they still have pieces of that hanging around? The rivets would come in handy. Oh, Phineas.  Won't you share a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with me?  Hey, look at that nifty little blow torch!  How perfect could this be   In the City of Love?   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   We could try some fancy cheese   Or peruse the galleries  I wonder if oil-based paint is combustible. As a rocket fuel.  Isn't this a perfect day?   How do I look in this beret?  Oh, that reminds me. We might need helmets!  Oh, how can he not feel the same way   When we're strolling down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es   In the City of Love?   (In the City of Love)   (In the City of Love)   I wish that he would whisper ""ma chÃ©rie, je t'aime""   But all he wants to do is try to fix that plane   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)  Hey, you! Stop letting my balloons go! Now Buford, your mindless bullying may have a rustic charm stateside, but now we are in Europe. A place of high refinement. So, let me do all the talking. Excuse me, sir. Would you have any used cooking oil that we could have? No! Oh, the French are so intimidating! Out of my way, runt. Do not do anything too crazy! Excusez-moi mon bon monsieur. (Excuse me, good sir.) Auriez-vous par hazard un soupÃ§on d'huile de cuisson que nous pourrions utiliser sans nous dÃ©merder un sou? (Would you by chance have a touch of cooking oil that we could use without losing a penny?) But, of course. Not one word about this to the others. Pardonnez-moi, monsieur, are you throwing those away? C'est les ordres. This is about the plane, isn't it? Well, yeah, what else? Well, I guess we'll always have giant plastic baguettes. I don't know, Ferb. I know he's my dad and I shouldn't blame him for being busy, it's just that He always seems to put his work ahead of me. I just don't know what to do. Well, sometimes if you love somebody, you have to meet them halfway. Halfway, huh? Hmm. You mean like, maybe I should take an interest in his work? I would, but it's actually evil. I just can'tâ Ferb? Vanessa! We've come to rescue you! Dad? I was just gonnaâ Wait. What do you mean we? I hitched a ride! You remember these guys, don't you? Hello again, young lady. I can't believe you brought work with you again! Work? What do youâ Oh, you mean them? No, Major Monobrow and Perry the Platypus, theyâ They were helping me find you! Monobrow? Oh, come on. You've got that whole thing up here, it runs rightâ It's one straight line, for crying out loud! That's it. I'm getting my tweezers back from Carl. Oh, come on, Vanessa. I came halfway around the world to get you! Halfway? Yeah, halfway around the world. You met me halfway. I suppose you could put it that way. You did, didn't you? You know what, Dad, move over. I'm coming with you. Oh, this is great, Vanessa! Why don't we talk these guys into giving us a tour to Paris? We can go check out the Guillotine Museum! Gross. Bye, Ferb! Thanks for everything! Well, the baguettes are rubber-banded on. That should get us across the Atlantic. Why didn't we think of that in the first place? Gee, I don't know. Hey, Ferb. Where's Vanessa? She went off with someone else. That's too bad. I thought the two of you You know, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love. I thought romance was a forgone conclusion. Isabella, did you say something? I need a new pencil. Oh, hey, Candace. So, how'd it go? Did you see Jeremy? Well, I saw him. I just didn't talk to him. Oh, that's too bad. I thought You know, the two of you, a boy, a girl, alone in the City of Love. Isabella?! Isabella, are you okay? Peachy. So, what happened? Well, you know when you know someone, and you see that they have another, like life away from you and it feels weird? Like when you see your teacher at the grocery store weird? Or like when someone you've known for a long time starts wearing a cowboy hat weird? The The first thing weird. That's good. 'Cause I was thinking about getting a cowboy hat. I-It's justâ Jeremy looked like he was having a really good time here. And it suddenly seem creepy and obsessive that I came all this way. What if he doesn't wanna see me? Or came to Paris to get away from me? Candace, like the song said, you have to believe you can! I think Candace may have missed that song. Yeah, man, she was in the house! What? You missed Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan? Uh Apparently. Well, that's too bad. But, the gist of it was that you gotta believe in yourself. Well, that's easy for you, Phineas! Look at all the things you've done. Summer belongs to you. Summer doesn't belong to me. It belongs to everyone! And that includes you. You have to believe that. Well, my summer's been a series of failures. I have a hard time believing in anything. Well, you got on this plane. You know, back when it was a plane. Which means you believe in us! And we believe in you. And therefore, through the transitive property of belief, you do believe in yourself! I do? Besides, when we did all those things, you were right there with us! I was, wasn't I? Yes! You're Candace Flynn! Monster truck driver. Charioteer. Queen of Mars! Well, I am Candace Flynn. That's the spirit! You're right. I'm Candace Flynn! Lifeguard! That's right, Candace! Time traveler! Don't break the engine! I am Candace Flynn! Coup de Crayon! Candace? Jeremy?! It is you! I was just over there in the taxi and I saw you overâ What are you doing here? Well, my brothers have this idea of flying aroundâ Your brothers? Say no more. Oops, we slipped our mooring. I guess we're leaving. Hey Candace, better wrap it up! Looks like we're on the way. What? No, not yet! I have something I wanted to tell you! Really? What is it? I wanted to tell you earlier but then I saw you in front of your hotel, with those kids, and the girl with the ice cream Candace, were you spying on me? No, no, i-it's just that I saw you and it was likeâ It was like my teacher wearing a cowboy hat! I would hope my girlfriend would have a little trust in me. Jeremy You said the G-word! Well, yeah, I used theâ Uh, hold on! Yeah, I used the G-word. It doesn't freak you out, does it? No, because I think of you as my B-word. Well, G-word. You want a K-word? Maybe? Uh Candace? All set, Jeremy! Start kissin'! Candace! No, no, no, no, no, no! Wait, y-you can't leave now! You wouldâ Just get off on the next bridge! I can't. I'm in charge of these guys. Iâ I've gotta be responsible. I'll see you in a week, boyfriend! Candace, you better take your seat. Don't worry, Candace. The week will be over before you know it. At least, you got a love scene on a bridge. ""Love is a canvas furnished by nature and embroidered by the imagination"". Voltaire, Buford? Really? Oh, I can't help it. Paris does it to me every time. It's four o'clock, we're on a baguette boat, with a fuel tank filled with snail grease. I've a good feeling about this. Okay, everyone, hold on to something! Oh, yeah! Hey, everyone! I can talk! We're almost to Le Havre harbour, Ferb. After that, it's nothing but open ocean and a couple of remote islands! We should be home in no time! Huh. Well, that might be a problem. Hey, check it out! It's my giant water balloon!  Gonna follow the sun  (Song: Follow the Sun)  Yeah, we'll follow the sun   As long as we had a good time, we already won  Would you look at that? Five kids in a jet-powered baguette boat in the middle of the Atlantic. Ah, that reminds me of Karen Johnson. Everything reminds you of Karen Johnson. I hate being a sailor.  Gonna follow the sun   Yeah, we'll follow the sun  Well, looks like everything worked out the best! That giant wave really  put us back on schedule. We might even arrive in Danville ahead of time. You know, barring any unforeseen mishaps. Oh, like that. That's what I'm talking about. And that. And that. Yeah, this is all included in what I was talking about earlier. Well, Ferb, that was our worst landing yet. I'm beginning to detect a pattern here. Phineas! This isn't Danville, it's a deserted island! The only things on this island are us, a couple of trees and a big fat ox! Hey! Not you, big fat ox, him, big fat ox. When Mom and Dad left me in charge, I never took into account that we might not make it back at all! And now we're stranded, and now I'll never get my kiss from Jeremy! It's the end of romance! You're gonna lose! You do realize that you're stranded on this island too, right? I don't care! I'm winning! I'm done. Phineas, how are we going to get off this island? Well, we'll just have to fix the boat! With what? There's plenty here. All we need is our imagination! For instance, we could tie those two palm trees into a raft and add a super sonic outboard motor. Oh, wait, we don't have anything to cut the trees with, andâ We don't have an outboard motor. I I know! We could soup up this ox so he could run on a conveyor belt that would charge theâ Oh, we don't have a conveyor belt, and we don't have any soup. Not to mention You're never gonna make it! We'll make it! After all, we've gotâ Uh We've got the seats! We've still got one rubber band! And we've gotâ We've got sand! Hey, maybe you could make an hourglass and watch the time slip away. Well, thanks for the lift. Before you leave, we have one more thing for you. Really? What is it? Those are handcuffs. I know what handcuffs are. I'm not an idiot! And not one word outta you. Well, there's a list of outstanding violations as long as your arm. Oh, well, I do have unusually long arms. But, we're on vacation! Oh, don't worry, young lady. You'll be able to continue your vacation in 10 to 20 years. I'm gonna beat the rap, you know. I've been working on a Rap-Beat-inator. I just don't know if it works in France. I mean, if you see the electrical outlets here, I wouldn't even know where to start. Hold it right there! Step away from the evil scientist! Vanessa! I'm so proud of you! You are evil! I'm not evil. Just get in the car before they find out this is only a hair dryer. This is a hair dryer? Yeah, I got it in Tokyo. Cool! But, they didn't know it was a hair dryer when you pointed it at them, so That means you're little evil! Okay, Dad. Maybe I'm a little evil. I knew it! That's okay. I'm not gonna cry. Dad Well, guess we could kiss that pair of handcuffs good bye. Don't know about you, but I'm gonna go take in a review. See you back in the States. Thereâ There'sâ There's got to be some minerals or something down here that we can use! I mean, we can'tâ We can't just be stuck here! Thanks, Ferb. I just don't know what to do. We were in Paris! The most romantic city in the world, and he didn't even notice me! I just feel like giving up. And look at him! Look! A sponge and a starfish! There's gotta be something we can make out of this! Ah! Oh, no, that's ridiculous! It's as if I don't exist! I would give anything if he would just sit down with me and enjoy this beautiful sunset. W-W-We couldâ Uh, w-w-we couldâ Dig a tunnel under the ocean, and then we could, uhâ We couldâ W-We canâ We canâ Weâ We can't. I cannotâ I can't believe there's nothing we can do to get off of thisâ I guess at least we can sit and watch this beautiful sunset. No What? No! You are not going to enjoy this beautiful sunset! I'm not? You built a rollercoaster through downtown! You made giant tree-house robots! You traveled through time for crying out loud! Twice! But, Isabella, there's nothing here for me to work with. Well, that's not the Phineas Flynn that I fell in to this situation with. You showed us all in Ferb's map how this is possible, and I'm not gonna let you sit there andâ Ferb's map! That's it! Isabella, you're the best! Hey Ferb. Let's see that map again. Okay. We're here, and we need to go there. And we've got about I-I'd say eleven minutes. Isabella, grab Madagascar and bring it over here to Ohio. Now Candace, you grab the Andes and fold it over so that it meets Greenland. You know, folding the map doesn't actually make these places closer together. I know, I know! Crease it here. Buford, Australia over to Africa. Baljeet, Hawaii to Japan. No, no, East, East! Don't go West, you'll rip it! All right. Now, fold it here. Buford, one more crease down this line. Phineas, I don't see how an origami unicorn is getting us off this island! It's not done yet, it needs one more fold. There you go! Now, wait. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! There's no way I'm getting on that plane! Wait, wait. It's gonna work, you'll see! I think it's beautiful. Don't encourage him. Phineas, this is crazy! Car-salesman crazy or mattress-salesman crazy? I don't knowâ Neither! That's a relief. Isabella, Baljeet, get the seats! You got it! Buford, grab the ox! This is the only way I'll actually hold him. Phineas, it's made of paper! So was the Declaration of Independence! Yeah, but it wouldn't fly over 2,000 miles of water! Buford, why are you helping? How often do you get to lift an ox? Have I taken crazy pills?! There's no engine! True, but we do have this rubber band made of super special  density   ! Just believe we can, Candace! Yes. Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan cannot both be wrong. Look, apparently I missed some big musical number with Clay Aiken and Chaka Khan, okay? So, can we please stop using that as a reference?! Well, it was just very inspirational. I'm not getting on that plane! Candace, you won't see Jeremy again 'till we get off the island. I get a window seat! You know, my horoscope said I would be riding an ox today. But I thought that was a figure of speech! A little bit further A little bit further. Okay, that'll have to do. We're almost out of time, everybody on the plane! Everyone ready? It's now or never! Actually Phineas, I-I changed my mind. I wanna stay here. Oh, that's just the mortal terror talking. Well, yeah, that's what I'm tryingâ Buford, pull the release! Whatever, dude. It's not gonna woâ It's working! Look! Yes, yes, yes! What are you so happy about? I finally ate a bug! It looks like we're gonna make it! There's the Tri-State Area! Welcome to the 27th Annual Substitute Teacher Day. We begin byâ All right, who's the wise guy? Hang on, everyone! We're coming in! Actually, that was probably our best landing in the day. Great, the sun's still up and we're only five blocks away. Come on! Oh, no! Road construction! It took Mom an hour to get around that ditch! There's only 58 seconds 'til sundown! What kind of watch is that? No, no, no! Oh I actually thought we're gonna make it! I thought we were gonna do the impossible. For one shining moment, summer was whatever I wanted to make of it! Wait. This is my house! Hold on one second! I'm givin' everybody back their bikes! But Buford, we didn't make it back to our yard. I get it! Everybody, get your bikes! Here's Ferb's, here's Phineas's, here's Isabella's, and here's, uh A recumbent? Really? Studies say it is better for your back. How come I don't have to stand in line to bully you? Wait! Buford never took my bike. Noted. There's one right there! Phineas, I'm not gonna get on a silly little tricycle. Candace, we're in a hurry. Just get on the trike, and we'll goâ There's no way I'm gonnaâ GET ON THE TRIKE! Phineas, there's no way we're gonna clear that! Just believe we can, Candace! Is that another Chaka Khan reference, 'cause I thought I was clearâ You don't have to hear the song, Candace, you just have to believe! I believe! I believe! I believe! Okay, I believe! What a long day. It seemed like the sun would never go down. Where are they? Don't worry, they'll make it. Seven seconds 'till sundown! Maybe it'll help if we count! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! You did it!  Cause I believe we can  Yeah! We did it! Oh my gosh, that was so great! Yes! You guys are amazing! Yes! Yes! Mom, Dad! Oh, for us? That is so nice. And Candace, so responsible. Not a single phone call. Well, I didn't have international coverage. What? Never mind! Anyway, the party looks great. But you would not believe what a long day we've had. So, I think we're gonna turn in early. You guys just enjoy the party, okay? All right, you've heard him. Let's enjoy this party! (Song: Summer Belongs to You)  It's been a long, long day and there were moments when I doubted   That we'd ever reach the point where we could laugh and sing about it   Now the sun has set on this another extraordinary day   And when it comes around again, you know I'll say   Tell me what you wanna do today   All we need is a place to start   If we have heart, we'll make it   'Cause we're not messin' around   (We're not messin' around)   Yes, we can dream it, do it, build it, make it   I know we can really take it   To the limit before the sun goes down   As soon as you wake up you gotta make your move   Don't miss the beat, just get into the groove   The sun is shinin', there's a lot that you can do   There's a world of possibilities outside your door   Why settle for a little, you can get much more   Don't need an invitation, every day is new   Yes, it's true   Summer belongs to you  (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun   There's nothing better to do   Summer belongs to you  All right, I'm taking a verse. Be my guest!  I traveled halfway 'round the world and almost turned and ran away   But you helped me get my courage back   So now I've got to say   That though I've often thought of you as just a nuisance and a bother   Today I can't imagine having better little brothers   And you gotta believe in something   So today I believed in you   And you came through, we made it   I've never been so proud   Never been so proud   I know at first it seemed implausible   But we accomplished the impossible   Now there's something that I've got to say out loud   Time is what you make of it, so take a chance  That's it!  Life is full of music so you ought to dance  She's got it!  The world's a stage and it is time for your debut  By Jove, I think she's got it!  Don't waste a minute sitting on that chair  Yeah!  The world is callin' so, just get out there  That's what I'm talking about!  You can see forever so your dreams are all in view   Yes, it's true   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun   There's nothing better to do  Hey, Candace!  Summer belongs to you  Jeremy!  (Summer belongs to you)  You came back early!  Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)  Well, I missed my girlfriend.  Summer belongs to boys and girls all around the world  Ooh, I like the sound of that! Besides, you forgot something in France.  We wouldn't say it if it wasn't true  I did? What? This.  Summer belongs to you  Hm?  (Summer belongs to you)   Baby, baby, baby, baby   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Whatever you want to do, you make the rules   You got the tools to see it through   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you  (Summer belongs to you)   Just remember that you can do it and when you're through it   Will change your point of view   Summer belongs to you!  Hey, where's Perry? Would you like your with or without fromage?  Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Whatever you want to do, you make the rules   You got the tools to see it through   Baby, baby, baby, baby   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Just remember that you can do it and when you're through it   Will change your point of view   Summer belongs to you!"
"by ashirogi27 Wow, trippy! I'm having one of those lucid dreams where I'm aware I'm dreaming so I can control it. I voted for you, Kevin. Cool! I'm gonna fly, too! Okay. Focus, and Ugh! Oh, no! I've broken my mind! Reality's shattering before my eyes! Candace, you're fine. It's all special effects. Special effects? Yeah, cool, huh? Ferb and I are warming up before we meet our special effects hero, Clive Addison today at the Science-Fiction and Fantasy Convention. That explains why you're dressed in costumes from ""Giant Losers: The Musical""! Actually, I'm dressed as Captain Lump Sharkboard from Space Adventure XIV. And Ferb's dressed as Hymie Silverman, the elf prince from Stumbleberry Finkbat and the Whining Wand of the Turtle Wizard. They're the two biggest movie series of all-time, and Clive Addison did the special effects for both. Ugh! Stop being related to me! And take all your mirrors, and zebras, and junk, and get out of my room! Zebras? Anyway, Ferb and I aren't in your room. We're already at the convention! Special effects! Look at it, Ferb. Science-Fiction and Fantasy, together at last. It's breathtaking. Let's get in there! Hey ""Where's Perry?"" is written on this wanted poster, hanging on a tree. And we see this little hand reach up and tear the poster down and the music kicks in and all, ""Chicka, chicka, chow, chicka, chow, chow, chicka, chicka, chicka, chicka, chow,"" and the opening credits start, like on one of those cool 80's TV shows with a voice over. You know A fugitive, semi-aquatic special forces amateur stage magician, framed for a crime he didn't commit, the 1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln, joins forces with a rogue-trillionaire inventor-extreme fighting champion from the future. Together with the aid of ""R.I.C.K."", their super crime-fighting high-tech talking rickshaw, they'll bring hope, justice, and varying degrees of aquaticness to a Tri-State area in peril. Together, they are  Doof 'N' Puss!  Tonight's episode, Ham on Rye, Hold the Mayor. You know, in the future we won't sit and read newspapers in the morning. Instead, giant robots will control us in human death matches. Well, that gives us something to look forward to. Good morning, team. What's up, Ricky? I've detected some strange, out of character behavior from our mayor recently, which has me concerned. Here he is from a news report a year ago. Notice how he waves. It goes side to side, see? Again, side to side. Now, here's footage from just two days ago. Watch. See? His hand goes up, and then he transforms into a wolf with fiery, red eyes, and runs howling into the misty night. Now that you mentioned it, that is unusual for him. We've got to somehow get close to the mayor, and find out what's going on. We're gonna need a turban and a wig. And while I'm out, I'm gonna pick up some bagels. Anyone else want anything? Hi, Candace. Where are you off to? Oh I'm, uh going to Stacy's. Okay, honey. What's in the big bag? Smaller bags? Great! Have fun. Isn't it magnificent, Ferb? Special effects extravaganzas just have a way of bringing people together. If you think Lump Sharkboard can defeat Hymie Silverman, the elf prince, then you are three phlorics short of a foxonian zipfeller, my friend! Oh, yeah? Well, you can carry your own action figures! Ferb, there he is! Clive Addison! Do you have our special effects demo reel? Yes! I can't believe we're gonna meet him! Oh! Phineas, you're just in time. Would you please tell this dragon-loving heathen, that the Space Adventure movies are superior to the Stumbleberry Finkbat movies in every way imaginable? Oh, uh Uh We're just Oh Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were in mourning. What? Yeah, it also took me awhile to accept the fact that I had no brother any more. What? They actually think all those silly magic elves movies are better than Space Adventure's epic science-fiction genius! Well, I Stumbleberry Finkbat and the Lost Shadow of Darkling Tower alone, was smarter and more realistic than all the even-numbered Space Adventure movies combined! Yeah, man! You tell him! Realistic? Space Adventure is based on hard scientific fact. It's like watching a reality show from the distant future. Affirmative! Yeah! That's correct! Exactly! As it should ..a-be. That fantasy stuff is for kids! It's almost as lame as dressing up as like Ducky Momo or something. Finkies! Speckies! Thank you for auditioning, but we're looking for something a little more dazzling for the mayor's ball. No, wait! We can dazzle, we can. I will now saw The Amazing Platydini in half. See? See? Platypuses, they're like butter. Mayor, we got this surveillance photo from the wig and turban supply store. It's Doof 'n' Puss. And now Plati-padapbra! Oh, very impressive, Dr. Doofenshmirtz and Perry the Platypus! Now, it's my turn to make you disappear. Oh, no! Ninja Vampires! I hate these guys. Wow, he's good. I picked the wrong day to stop carrying garlic-scented throwing stars. Hey Stacy, how's it going? No, I haven't heard from Candace. What? She told me she was hanging with you today. Really? She told me the same thing about you. Anyway, I'm over at the Sci-Fi Fantasy convention with little Suzy. She's really into the kids stuff. You know, like Sea-Horsie Hospital, uh You know, lame stuff like Ducky Momo. Ooh. Ducky Momo! Uh, Suzy? Wait, Suzy! Aww. You know you can't run away like that. Oh, that was close. Why must it be so hard for a lifelong, closet Ducky Momo fan to go to a Science-Fiction and Fantasy convention, and find cool, rare Ducky Momo collectibles, without anybody discovering her dark, humiliating secret? (Song: Ducky Momo is My Friend)  When I was small, the world was such a strange place   And that was all until I saw his strange face   Quacking in slow-mo   Ducky Momo is my friend   And since we've met, he's been a friend to count on   If I could bet, I'd put the full amount on   Never needing to know mo   Then Ducky Momo is my friend   All the lessons that he's taught me brought me luck   Now when life throws eggs, I know how to duck   Oh, oh, but now the world just points and laughs at me here   The hidden girl who risked so much to be here   Showin' my face is a no-no   But Ducky Momo's still my friend   Ducky Momo is my friend   Ducky Momo is my friend ' Finkies! Speckies! Come on, guys. Aren't you blowing this all out of proportion? No. Finkies! Speckies! Finkies! Speckies! Come with me, Phineas. You should meet with the Almordian Council. They'll straighten you out. But, what about Ferb? Forget about him, he's nothing to you anymore. Well, I guess I'm your new brother. Carry my action figures? We seek counsel with the exalted one. Baljeet? Baljeet is the only sixteenth level Space Adventure trivia master in the world. I feel a minor disturbance in the universe. Almost as if Nope! Now it is gone. Okay It's Clive Addison! Pay attention! I have unfortunate news to report, master. Ferb is dressed like an elf! Yeah, and his costume's really cool too. He spun his own wool, and the headband's made of realâ Oh, for the love of humillian dorphite! We lost Ferb, too? He's not lost. He's just enjoying another genre. Never! The line must be drawn here! Right between Phineas and his loved ones. Oh, come on. Did you ever consider that fans of Space Adventure wouldâ Speckies! Right, speckies. have more in common with fans of Stumbleberry Finkbat in theâ Finkies! Maybe Speckies and Finkies have more in common than they do differences. Oh! Bite this prop tongue from Episode 8! Have you ever tried talking to them? Talk!? Have you met the leader of the Finkies? I'm sure you're wondering why I, Buford, have taken a leadership role in such a geek-centered enterprise. Well, take a look around! This place is crawling with nerds! I'm like a kid in a candy store! Plus, I relate to the character of Odaf Underhump and his complex emotional inner journey. I seriously doubt this will work. Buford is not a man of peace. Nonsense, I'm sure he'll be reasonable. Hey! No space bunnies allowed! I am not a bunny rabbit! I am an Almordian Vanksloth. It's time to end this silly feud, so we can all enjoy Clive Addison's special effects presentation. Baljeet, you prepared a peace treaty? I did. We, Speckies, vow to live in peace and harmony with you, Finkies. All we ask is that you admit, Space Adventure is much better than Stumbleberry Finkbat, and that you have brought eternal shame to your families forever, believing otherwise. Uh, that's not what weâ Oh, yeah!? You and what army? Your question makes no sense as a response to what I just said. Well, how 'bout this? Alright! So, it is war then! Bring it on, Speckies! We're gonna go all Hyborian age on you! That is not even a real age! To quote Lump Sharkboard from Space Adventure XVI Glorf.  Glorf!  We now return to  Doof 'n' Puss!  Well, what did you expect? It was like twenty of them, against one-and-two-halves of us. Look, it's the mayor! Get him! Oh, knock it off! I'm the real mayor, that other guy is a shape-shifter posing as me. You know, that's funny, you know, even while I was attacking you, I was thinking, ""Why did he tie himself up in a dark closet with us? Whatâ What kind of a plan is that?"" Oh, you've freed yourself with your amazing magician skills! And also scissors. Now, we've done it, Ferb! We brought the entire convention center to the brink of an inter-genre geek war. It's up to us to extend the olive branch of diplomacy. I'll go talk to Buford, and you can talk to Baljeet. May the luck of Sluffon be with you. Always. Ducky Momo Plushies. Momo Collectible Card Game. Momo the Movie! Oh, the Momo-ness of it all! The sheer Momo-sity! Ducky Momo! Wait for me! Suzy! Oh, that poor sap in the costume. I love you, Ducky Momo! She's relentless! Hey, no cutting! I want to see inside your head! These Momo nuts are such an embarrassment. Seriously. Ducky Momo? Where are you? Ducky Momo? Ducky Momo! Ha! Now, If I could just find one piece of Ducky Momo merchandise I don't already have, all this would be totally worth it. I've got to get to Buford, but how to approach it? Working on your battle strategy, Phineas? What? No! Iâ I meanâ Yes! Yes, I am. In fact, there's a way you can help me with it. Me? Help you? My manipulator/grasper is at your command! Great! We'll need to modify your costume a bit to get you behind enemy lines. Enemy lines?! Uh, excuse me, Mr. Barbarian, sir. Why do you disturb my brooding on the eve of war, stumpling? I come bearing a message. Witchcraft! What trickery is this? Greeting, all-mighty Odaf Underhump. Phineas, your kind is not welcome here. Just hear me out! In a theatrical landscape that's drowning in comedy, romance, and thought-provoking ecological docu-dramas, Finkies and Speckies are all outcasts. They should be friends. There are no friends in these halls, Phineas. There are only my people, and those who must be destroyed. But that's justâ Hold your words, outlander! Once Odaf Underhump has made a hasty and ill-informed decision, he cannot be swayed. Go home, Finkie, your kind isn't welcome here. Did you see that? He just vanished. He must be employing some kind of cloaking device. No, it's an elven cape of invisibility, duh. My time is limited, magician. I must gather my positronic impulses for the coming battle. Speak. Ha! You cannot charm me with your silver tongue, Elf Prince. And your magic rune signs have no power in this dimension. This conversation is over. Transport him away. This day isn't turning out like I'd hoped at all. I know how you feel. Clive Addison! We're your biggest fans! Thanks, man. It's just too bad there aren't more of you out there. That's crazy! Everyone here loves your work. In fact, the only reason they're not in line to see you, is that they're about to go to war over which of your movies is better. Oh, man, I don't wanna hear that. I became a special effects artist to join the nations of this earth together in peace and hope. Well, what other reason is there for creating cool visual effects for film and television? Special effects! That's it! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do from this point in the day on! And we'd better do it fast. Look! (Song: To War)  The sun blazes red over the convention center!   As red as the blood of all who enter!   That's pumped through the hearts into this fearless choir   It's the size and the shape of a fist clenched in ire!   That's raised to the sky in faith and in duty   That holds that red sun in all its beauty   A beauty we all must ignore!   As we take the last steps to war!   'Cause our movie's better than yours!   No, our movie's better than yours!   Our movie's better!   Our movie's better than yours!   Our movie's better!   No, our movie's better than yours!   Our movie's better!   Our movie's better than yours!  You cannot resist our superior technology! Smell my barbarian pits! Eww! Yuck! Let's do this. Ready? The coast isâ I don't believe it. That's the rare Ducky Momo commemorative plate where they accidentally printed the wrong saying. Score! All I have to do is get over there without drawing too much attention to myself. Charge! Charge again! Eat laser, Hymie Silverman! That gives me a five points weapon skills advantage. You lose an arm! Fine, it'll be back. Odaf Underhump has a healing factor of eight! And now to present his various new, pro-ninja vampire laws, here he is the totally, for real, Mayor. Freeze, punk-fake mayor guy! You want me? You come get me! Oh, wait. Hold on a second. Okay, what? You can't just throw a giant monster into a story because you're stuck for an ending. It's lazy. It's lazy writing. What is that thing?! I do not know! Those readings make no sense! That's a pencil sharpener. How is that information helpful at this juncture? O-On second thought, I love it. You may have tied me up next to thisâ What is this? A beaver or something? A-Andâ And pitched me a TV series against my will, not to mention holding up the autograph line. But, my advanced TV executive instincts tell me your show is going to be a big hit. Yes! I'm going to have my own show, on television! And then, all of these fans will be so indebted of me, they will do my bidding. It's actually happening! I, am going to rule the Tri-State Area! Just a thought though, can we get the platypus a girlfriend? What?! Never! Oh, suddenly you know my characters better than me? Forget it! I'm no sell out. I just crassly calculated commercial appeal in a mad quest for financial gain. No, no! M-My artistic integrity and I are out! Peace! Buford! Just what do you think you are doing? What does it look like? I'm running away, hoping that while the monster is busy eating my friends, I can escape. Is that what Odaf Underhump would do? No. No, it's not. He'd never run from a fight. Exactly. No hero would, no matter what the genre. And neither will we! And we'll win. Fantasy and science fiction. Together! Archers! Regroup and protect the left flank. Ion-Laser cannons! Push him back to the center. That'll be fifteen dollars. Here. So, you a fan of Ducky Momo? No. Why do you ask? It's working! Look! They've joined together to defeat our monster. Oh, guys, this is so cool! Watch this man, I'm gonna make him lurch to the right. What is that thing? It's like a nightmare, or a lucid dream. Of course! Phineas and Ferb! Rootah dez-tu valoomus! Rootah dez-tu valoomus! Brother! Rootah dez-tu valoomus! What are you dweebs doing? Don't you get it? This is all baloney! It's just special effects. And even if it were real, what good would this stuff do? Plastic blasters? Rolling dice? You think you could stop a think like that by waving a wand and saying, ""Oogie boogie woogie!""? I can't believe that actually worked. Huh? Ducky Momo defeated the monster! My people have much to learn from your people. You must tell me how to shoot a blaster someday. Absolutely. And you can teach me how to wield a club. I'm afraid that information is proprietary. Look everybody! It's me. Candace Flynn. Yeah, I'm who you love! And I love Ducky Momo! She's a teenager and she came dressed as Ducky Momo! Oh, that's lame, even she did save us. She came dressed as Ducky Momo. Negative. Man, fickle crowd. Candace! That was so cool! Oh, hey, Jeremy. You're not too embarrassed to talk to Ducky Momo? Maybe Ducky Momo isn't really that lame after all. Someone else seems to really like him too. I love you, Ducky Momo! Ducky Momo loves you too, Suzy. I gotta say, guys, that was, hands down, the best special effects show ever. And I've been at Burning Man. Your holo-projection device is brilliant! Thanks, Mr. Addison! That means the world coming from you. Well, it's just really clear that you two are gonna have an amazing career in special effects ahead of you. And if that's what you want, give me a call in ten years and I'll hire the both of you in a heartbeat. Actually, what I'd love to do is direct. Oh, you and me both. We now return to The Platypus & His Girlfriend. Now, Mr. Mayor, I will saw the amazingly handsome Platy-dini in half. Ah, he was right. This is better. I should have sold out. (Song: Ducky Momo Theme Song)  Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo   Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo   Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo   He's your very best friend!   Who's the happy-time toy toy   For every girl and boy boy?   Who's the fuzzy enjoyment?   Make fun with Ducky Momo!   Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo   He's your very best friend!"
"by ashirogi27 Enough moping around, Candace. Phineas and Ferb said they've devised a fun way to wash the house. Why don't you join them? Have some fun for a change! For a change? I have lots of fun! You mean, obsessively trying to bust your brothers for their mystery crimes? Is that fun? I have fun. I'm like the queen of fun! I have fun all day! I can tell. Well, if you just gonna sit inside today, you should at least do a little reading. Aw, Mom? It's one of my favorites. The Wizard of Oz. Isn't this for babies? Or you could wipe down Perry's Platypus Plaza Play set. I'm reading, I'm reading! Well, I'll be at my weight lifting class. Have fun! Ugh! Oh, my eyes hurt! Oh, Jeremy. You're the only one who understands me. Hi, Candace! Buford, Baljeet, what do you two want? What? Like in a metaphysical sense? Nothing. I'm good. I want to be cool! That's not gonna happen. I mean, why are you looking in my window, duh! Oh. Ferb says I should tell you we're about to start washing the house, and you can help us out if you want! Not likely. Either way, you might want to put on some waterproof undergarments. Will you get out of here?! Blah, blah Dorothy, blah, blah Kansas. There's a cyclone coming? Okay, Ferb. Let her lift. Take your positions everybody! And remember, even strokes. Do you guys always wash the house like this? Sometimes, we give it a bath. But, the city's using the tub as a reservoir. Whoa! What's happening? Phineas! Ferb! Okay. Full speed now! Try to have fun! I want to be cool! Hey. I don't want nothin'! Waterproof undergarments! Whee! Hey! I wonder where Perry went? Ew, gross! Perry! Oh, wow! Perry, I don't think we're in Danville anymore. You're in Patchkinland! We're Patchkins, and welcome you because  Little Witch Suzy was a louse, now she's squished under your house!  I'm alright! I have saliva. Gross! Eyeball! Eyeball! Eyeball! What'cha doin'? I'm The Good Witch, Isabella. Welcome to Patchkinland! Hello?! Can someone get this off me?! Don't touch those boots! Witch! Witch! Witch! Not witch, warlock! It's a robe, not a dress! I suppose I should thank you for squishing little Suzie. I'm okay, if you just lift this house off me, Iâ But I won't, because I'm wicked! I'll just take these little boots, and I'll be onâ Wait! What happened? Where are my boots?! Right there. On Candace. Now my feet are cold. Give me those boots! She doesn't have to give you anything! You have no real power in this part of Odd! Wrong! I have the power of positive thinking! True, it doesn't really help me in this instance, but you can't stay in Patchkinland forever! That's right! I'll get you! And your little platypus, too. Now, check me out as I disappear into an evil cloud of black smoke! You know, I'm just gonna use my bus pass. Seriously, can someone get a jack or something? I don't know how, but I bet Phineas and Ferb are behind all these! Oh, hi, Candace! I knew it! Have fun! Wait, stop! How did youâ Ugh! Alright, Eyeball Girl! Where do I go to bust someone around here? You can always try Bustopolis. That's where The Wizard lives. Can The Wizard bust my brothers? You bet'cha! How do I get there?  Ooo-hoo!  (Song: Yellow Sidewalk) Well, listen to this.  Ooo-hoo!   Ooo-hoo!   La-la-la-la-la-la-la   Well, the sky is blue and the breeze is mellow   I'll tell you what to do   Take the walkway that's yellow   It'll get you where you want to go   Just take that yellow sidewalk   Ooo-hoo!   La-la-la-la-la-la-la   Just take the yellow one   Not the one that's burnt umber   And don't you take that purple one, it's covered with lumber  What?  A log truck overturned last Tuesday   Take the yellow sidewalk   Ooo-hoo!  Nothing to see here.  Ooo-hoo!  Move along.  If you wanna bust your brothers, put one foot after another   There's a road that leads you out of this square   And there's nothing really stopping us   So let us state the obvious   If you standing here, baby   You're going nowhere!   So, if you're really in a busting mood   Please don't think I'm being rude!   Just grab yourself some take-out food   And hit that yellow sidewalk!   Ooo-hoo!   Ooo-hoo!   Ooo-hoo!   La-la-la-la-la-la-la!   Ooo-hoo!   Ooo-hoo!  So, remember! If you wanna bust your brothers,  Ooo-hoo!  stay on the yellow sidewalk!  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  I hope there's not gonna be a lot of singing in this thing. How much further is this Bustopolis? For some of us, it is a world away! What are you supposed to be? I am a nerdcrow. I hang in cornfields, wedgie-style, to keep the crows away. They would not be caught dead anywhere around me. For you see, despite my above average mathematical skills, I am not cool. That's fascinating. But, I'm on my way to Bustopolis to ask The Wizard to bust my brothers. The Wizard?! Oof! Do you think The Wizard can do something for me? What do you want? (Song: I Wish I Was Cool) Allow me to put it in song!  I want to be cool, cool, cool   I feel like such a foo-oo-ool   'Cause everybody I see   Everybody but me   Knows a secret to cool, cool, cool   They don't teach it in schoo-oo-ool   Ain't no pamphlet they wrote   No one pass me that note   Guess that I missed the boat  Alright, That's enough!  Down theâ  I get it. You wanna come to Bustopolis and ask The Wizard for coolness, right? Do I! Fine, you can come along. Boy, howdy!  Ooo-hoo!  But, no singing, and don't stand too close.  Ooo-hoo!   Ooo-hoo!  Too close! Sorry.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la!  Hi, Candace! So, you two are on your way to Bustopolis? 'Cause Ferb and I made a more fun way to get there. We've built a beautiful horse path through a candy forest, and genetically-engineered some unicorns to ride. Oh, no. No, we are staying on the yellow sidewalk. Do I have a say in this matter? No! Let's go! Yes, Candace. Sorry you're gonna miss out on all of the fun! I'll race you to marshmallow meadow, Ferb. Well, this is fun. It's a little girly for us, isn't it? Well, it is Candace's dream.  Doofenshmirtz Wicked Witch Castle!  It's not witch, it's warlock! Ugh! Let me just check my security. The front door looks good. The back door looks good. And, the platypus outside my window looks good. The platypus outside myâ Ooh! Oh! Oh, gross! Hey, I know you. You're with that little boot thief, right? Well, I'm going to send my flying squirrels after her! Those stunning little planes, they're cute, but you know, they don't fly so fast. We've got some time. How much farther do we have to go? All I know is Phineas and Ferb are behind all these. And if I follow this sidewalk, I will bust them. Wait a minute. I know this. There should be an oil can around here. Could you leave the lumberjack alone? Jeremy? Forget this! Oh, hi! Iâ I couldn't help, but notice that you're, um A tree? A-ttractive. It's okay. I know I'm a tree. Well, we're gonna go see if The Wizard will grant our wishes Uh Do you have a wish? (Song: Tree Related Wish) Do I have a wish?  Would you take a good look at me   I stand before you as a tree   And you ask me what my wish would be  How come he gets to singâ Shhhh.  It's probably related to me being a tree   It's my tree-related wish   (Tree-related wish)   It's my tree-related wish   (Tree-related wish)   It's my tree-related wish   (Tree-related wish)   I'll tell you what it is when we get to Bustopolis  Ooh, I can't wait to find out. Come on, let's go. Aren't you just going to wish to not be a tree? Shhh. Girls like a little mystery.  La-la-la-la-la-laâ  Hi, Candace. From this point, you have two routes to Bustopolis. On your right is a yellow sidewalk through a terrifying beastbog. We have saliva! And on your left, Ferb and I have built a frozen non-dairy treat sidewalk through an ice cream canyon. You can skate it and lick it for the ultimate and flavorable fun. Ice cream! Ice cream! Oh, no, you don't! We're staying on this sidewalk 'til we meet The Wizard and you're busted. Crow, Tree, let's go! Yes, Candace. Well, there's only one thing left to do. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Woo-hoo! This is better than an ice cream canyon, isn't it? Oh, yes, I much prefer rotting vegetation and blood-sucking demons. Sure are some scary looking trees in here. Hey, we can't all be movie stars. I Iâ I-I think there's something up there. Whoo? What is that? Where? There! It looks like a lion. No, looks like a tiger. I think it is a bear. No! I'm a combination lion, tiger, and bear. Oh, my! If I had a nickel for every time I heard that All right! Let's blow this pop stand! What? Oh, fine. My friends and I are going to Bustopolis to each get something from The Wizard. Do you want to come? There! Nah! I don't want nothin'. Okay, chop, chop, fellas! Time's a-wastin'. But, I am reminded of a song. (Song: I Want Nothing)  I want  Nothin'. Well, at least it was short. Come on! Yes, Candace.  La-la-la-la-la-la-la!  Hi, Candace. You guys could continue walking through this damp bog, and that would be awesome. But if you'd like to take a more fun route to Bustopolis, Ferb and I have built A blue sidewalk? A bouncy sidewalk! What do you say, Candace? I think you already know my answer. Step it up, freaks! Yes, Candace. Okay, have fun! Ugh! Soon, those boots will be mine! In the meantime, I'm going to leave you in the capable hands of my spider-monkey, or maybe a monkey-spider. I don't know what he is. Ow! Bouncy sidewalk. I'm keeping my eyes on the prize! Hey, what's that? Looks like a squadron of flying squirrels! Hey! What are you doin'? Ow, ow, ow! I can't believe I'm doin' this for nothin'! I wish I was still hanging by my underwear! Just kidding! Oh, come on! I'm a tree! We're friends with squirrels! Oh, snap. Oh, that's got to hurt. You get used to it. Squirrels! Squirrels! W-W-Whoaa! Oh, no. The squirrels have got Candace! We've got to do something! I got nothin'. Oh, hey, Candace. We're taking the bouncy sidewalk. Of course, your way looks fun, too. I am not having fun. And neither will you if I ever get back to the yellow sidewalk! Okay. Kidnapped by flying squirrels and stuck in a web that came out of a monkey's butt. Hm. Well, I guess I have had weirder days. There you are, Perry. Silence! I've got you now, missy. You may as well hand over those boots. I would, but they've kinda grown on me. I know. They're nice, aren't they? And the color really set off your eyes. No, really. They've grown on me. I can't take them off. If I can't take the boots off of you, I have to get you out of the boots. And by that, I mean, disintegrate you entirely! Perry, I'm sorry I got you into this mess. Forget about me. Save yourself if you can. Well, if it's that easy Oh! Get him off of me! Oh, he could have rabies! Oh, I hate spider webs! Guards! Uh Ready? Yep.  Agent P!  Getting our wishes will not be the same without Candace. I miss her, too. Even if she was a little bossy. I need a firm hand. Look! It is Candace's pet platypus. Has he always had that hat? What's he want? Could be rabies. Gentlemen, we're out to stop Doofenwitch. You want to rescue the girl. I see an opportunity here for some inter-agency cooperation. Now, here's the plan. Wait! Why am I a fairy? See this hourglass? When this sand runs out thatâs when this big electric timer begins. And when that time runs out, it activates the Brat-Begone-inator, to vaporize you right out of your boots! Ooh, someone is at my door! Hello? Hi! You've been selected for a free haunted castle makeover from Witches Brew magazine. Not witch! Warlock! What about the dress? It's a robe! But, whatever! I'm not going to turn down a free makeover. Come on in. I'll show you around. I see you're into spider webs. Sure, they're classic, but overdone. We see it was more of a modern witch. Warlock! Yeah, whatever. Hey, weren't you taller? Perry! Quick! Get me out of here before that whatever-inator zaps me! That tickles! I like it! Ooh, my Begone-inator! I'm gonna go check my crystal ball. Come on! Doofy wants a new pair of boots! What's this? Well, they won't get away so easy this time! Hey! Why did you do that? It's part of the makeover. Wait a minute! Guards! Again! Dude. I'm good. Run for it! Don't let them escape! Ooh! Candace! Perry! How convenient! Everyone's all together. Yeah. We're kinda expected in Bustopolis. You know, The Wizard, great and powerful. Shut up! You're a tree! Wait a minute! You can't talk to Jeremy like that! Put that bucket down! Melt, evil witch! Oh! Oh, you little brat! This outfit is 100% cotton. Oh, it's shrinking! It's shrinking! I have to go change my clothes. Sorry, I only meant to melt you. Guards! Dispose of them while I switch into my track suit. Dispose of us? Y-You don't really want to do that, do you? Well, no. But, nobody ever asked us what we want to do. Well, what do you want to do? There's a little number we've been working on. Hit it, boys.  Well, we've been cooped up in this castle  (Song: The Guards' Wishes)  So who cares what people say   We haven't had a chance to dance since we were on Broadway!   Hey!   The power of the wizard's all but stopped us from our dance  What the hey! Everyone gets to sing but me?  Now then boys, let's make some noise   Kick up your heels and dance!   Hey!   All we've ever wanted was to be void of rants  I'm back! Sheesh, no need to celebrate. I've only been gone a minute.  But now we get to party  Wait!  But with his boots and pants  Where are my prisoners?  Hey!  Oh, they're escaping, you fools!  La la la la la la la la la la  After them! Raise the drawbridge! Oh, great!  La la la la la la la la la la la  The monkey's the only one working here!  Hey!  Great! Now what? No way! Hold on! Curse you! Uh, I'll get you! Ahh! Oh, forget it. Hey, Candace! Isn't this fun? Fun? Not if you think so! Huh? Squirrel! Squirrel! Wow, dumb luck. And over the Sea of Razor Sharp Rock Spires, too. Good thing it was so inappropriately named. Get lost. Hey! Look over there! Bustopolis! Come on! The stuff Phineas and Ferb made! Itâs all here! The ultimate bust! Follow the yellowâ Oh, shut up! What? Fun way to the top, Candace? Forget it! I'm taking the yellow stairs! Three, please. Hello? I'm Candace the Me andâ Whoa! Guys, you're making me look bad in front of The Wizard. Uh, hello? I'd like speak to The Wizard, please. Hello, Candace. Mom? You're The Wizard? Well, I'm a bit of a whiz in the kitchen. This time the boys are so busted! Have you seen what they've been up to? Up to? Why, no. Iâ Oops, that's the oven. Boys, can you hand out the gifts while I check on the casserole? Hey, Candace. Phineas? Ferb? But, but, but, but Does this mean I would not receive coolness? Well, coolness is such a rare and indefinable quality that few people really have it. Most people just wear a pair of these and fake it. Hey! Works for me, chili cheese. Yeah, don't oversell it. So, Jeremy-Tree. You want to be a real boy instead of a tree, hmm? Well, yeah. But I'll bet you don't have anything in your bag for me. The problem with you is, you're completely delusional. I am? Sure. You've been a real boy all along. You're just wearing a tree costume. He's right. There's a zipper right back here. Hey, let me get that off for you. I'm free! and, I'm in my underwear. Yes. Yes, you are. And you've come all this way just to say you want nothing. But, are you sure you want nothing? Yes, I want nothing. Some people say they want nothing, when really they want something. Not really. I'm cool, man. You might want something later. Nothing! You sure? Alright, I'll take something! Ooh, a ham sandwich. I did want that. And there's one more person with a wish. Wait a minute! If you think you could bribe me or somethingâ I'll get you, my preâ! And here he is now. I want those red rubber boots! Sure. Candace won't mind. Right, Candace? Well, yeah. But they won't come off. Ferb? A red rubber shoe horn? Why didn't I think of that? That's it? Yep. Have fun! (Song: My Red Rubber Boots)  Well, my wardrobe, it used to be duller   But now I got this one splash of color  Look!  I got red rubber boots   And I'm gonna go steppin' tonight  Broom me!  Yes, I can go tip-tapping all over town   Iâ  Golly! Ugh, I didn't get to finish my song. That's just great! Everybody gets what they want except me. I'm back. Now, what were you saying, Candace? Mom, you've got to bust Phineas and Ferb! Bust them for what? Unicorn-pony rides, non-dairy frozen treat ice skating, bouncing sidewalks. That sounds like fun! Oh, you must have a wonderful time. Fun? Are you kidding? I didn't have any fun! I followed the yellow sidewalk like I was told. Who told you to do that? The Good Witch in the floating eyeball. Oh, her. That's what she tells everybody. Take the yellow sidewalk. Take the yellow sidewalk. Take the yellow sidewalk. All this time, the boys were only trying to show you the fun way to go. The joy is in the journey, you know. So, you're telling me that I could have fun throughout this entire adventure if I only stepped off the yellow sidewalk and join my doofus brothers? Is that it? On the nosy. Loosen up, sweetheart. Remember to have fun along the way. Summer won't last forever. But, I want to have fun. I can do it. Really! I'm a fun person! Good bye, dear. Mustn't overcook my vegetables. Wait! Don't go! I haven't had fun yet! Hey, what's happening? No! No, I'm waking up! I don't want to! This isnât fair! I didnât have any fun! No! Noo! No! Noo! Huh? No! It was all a dream. The crazy, wild, fantastic dream and I blew it! Huh? Hi, Candace. Oh, there you are, Perry. We just built a self-balancing monster unicycle. It can take us anywhere the fun way. Wanna join us? Are you kidding? When I tell Mom what you guys are up toâ Did you say fun? Often, the most fun can be found in your own backyard. And the joy is in the journey. Okay, I'm in! Cool! Oh, Jeremy, hi! Let's go! More fun than taking the sidewalk, huh, Candace? You have no idea. Have fun, everybody! (Song: Rusted)  I know what's wrong with you   You're rusted!   (Rusted!)   Don't you know that you've been oxidized?   Somebody left you in the rain too long   And now you've been immobilized   You're rusted!   (Rusted!)   If you move, you make a squeaking sound   That's right, you've got an orange patina   From above your neck down to the ground   You're rusted!  Yes. Yes, I do."
"by ashirogi27 It says on this box of cereal that I need to get Korny the Kornflake through this maze. If I was Korny, I'd wanna a little more of a challenge. They just don't make good puzzles or mazes any more. Mazes should be big and fun and exciting! Ferb You don't even need to say it. Hey, Candace. What'cha doin'? Well, Jeremy is taking me roller-skating tonight, and I thought I could use a little practiâ I'm okay! Let's get started. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P Sorry. We haven't cleaned that entrance in a while. Don't worry, we have a moist towelette. Anyhow, Doofenshmirtz has gone missing. We've used our global location scout and we can't find him anywhere. Even his answering machine has given us no clue as to where he is. Hello! You've reached Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. I'm not here right now or am I? Oh, and if you're calling about the piano, it's already been sold. We need you to find him. Good luck, Agent P. Monogram out. It looks like we're good to go. Time to test out our maze. Did someone say test!? It's not really a test. We're more like lab rats going after cheese. Did someone say cheese? Buford, that's just a metaphor. Hmm. I am to metaphor cheese, as metaphor cheese is to transitive verb crackers. And I want to get the Zoo Keeping patch, and the Cooking patch, and the Astronomy patch. Oh, Melissa. You remind me of me, when I was a Lil' Spark. When I grow up and become a Fireside Girl, do you think I'll earn as many patches as you have? With your enthusiasm, you'll probably earn even more. You really think so? 'Cause that's my goal. I want to be just like you. Hey, everybody. This is Melissa. Yeah, hi. Hello. Hey-ya. Isabella is my mentor for today. She's the best Fireside Girl ever. Melissa, I'm sure they don't wanna hear aboutâ Hey, Candace. So, I-I see you've build another giant whatever in the backyard. I think you know what I have to do. What is this thing? It's our elevator to the top of the maze. Well, make it go down! It doesn't go down, it only goes up. Ooh, you guys are going down!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Hello, Perry the Platypus Sorry I'm not here to greet you myself, but this is a trap. Why would you build an elevator that doesn't go down? Because, people might just ride down on the elevator instead of going through the maze. What do you mean, maze? We had the computer randomly load puzzles and brain teasers to make clearing each level more of a challenge. Okay. First one out is the smartest rat in the lab. Do you want to go through the maze with me? Yes! Yes! Yes! Candace, would you like to join Melissa and me? Candace Flynn can find her own way out. Oh, my gosh! You're Candace Flynn! You're the girl who earned 50 patches in one day! You're on the cover of Lil' Sparks magazine! How did you do it? Well Let me tell you something, kid. It wasn't easy. But the Forestfire Girls really needed me. Fireside Girls. That's what I said. Come on, kids, I'll get us out of here. Yay! Candace is gonna lead us to safety! Brain teasers, huh? Alright! You do all the ones that rely on brains, and I'll do all the ones that rely on teasin'. I do not think you understand the concept. Less talk-y, more work-y. (Song: Not Knowing Where You're Going)  It's so much fun not knowing where you're goin'   Take a left or a right just going without really knowin'   Whether marchin', flyin', crawlin', waltzin' or rowin'   There's no surprise in life if you know where you're goin'   So walk around like a monkey with a blindfold on   (Woo!)   (Woo hah!)   Like an Eskimo in six months of darkness who misses the dawn   So jump in the maze it's the latest craze   Spend your days going every which way   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   (Look out!)   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   (I have no idea where my destination is)   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   (Yeah, yeah)   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'   (I'm really enjoying it though)   It's so much fun not knowin' where you're goin'  Ah, Perry the Platypus. Welcome to my evil space station! Station -tation cookie -tation Wait, did you hear that? That cookie part? I think my echo is broken. I really do. Anyhoo, have a seat. I've set up a presentation for you. Ten years ago, I was backpacking across Europe, when I came across a group of Canadian college students. Dylan was the most popular among the group, b-but I was the oldest, so rivalry was inevitable. How many jellybeans in the jar? Oh, I am really good at solving these kinds of problems. So the base of the jar is Pi times radius squared. You are measuring the radius in centimeters, right? No, inches. That way the inches fractions work with Pi as 22 over 7. You do not use 3.14 for Pi? Oh, for crying out loud! There, zero! Okay, technically that is correct, but you did not show your work. I will in about 20 minutes. then the Ambassador's wife filed a complaint Long story short, I am never welcome in Albania ever again. But the point is, I ended up alone in Italy, and it was lunch time, so I went to the Leaning Tower of Pizza, and you know what? They don't even make pizza there! I said, ""what do you mean? I-It's the Leaning Tower of Pizza! It's got pizza actually in the name!"" But, they were adamant. No pizza for me! L-Likeâ Like I'm the idiot. And I was like, ""You're not so great. You're not so special. What? Justâ Just 'cause you're leaning?"" Then, it hit me. I'll just lean my own building, and then, it will become a big tourist attraction, and I'll sell all this merchandise. I'll make millions. Which I will then use to finance phase two of my maniacal plan. Tilting every building in the world! And the Leaning Tower of Pizza will no longer be special. Ooh, ooh! And then I willl straighten my own building, and it will still be a tourist attraction, 'cause you know, it will be the only straight building. I just now thought of that. Just now. See? That's how genius happens. It's a lot of leaning and straightening, you get the idea. I'm going to use this Tilt-inator, and do it all from space! Space space cookie space There! There it was again. Y-You heard that? My next to last echo is broken. I'm going to have to have that checked. Wow, it's some kind of high wire challenge. Good thing I got my High Wire patch, twice. Did, you get fifty, in one day? Okay, then. Now, Melissa, the thing to remember about a high wireâ Candace, be careful! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! See? It's that simple. Okay. Isabella, do something! Hold on, Melissa. Oh, my gosh. Thank you for telling Isabella to save me. Well, what did you think I was going to do? Let Isabella let you fall? Glad I was able help. The Tilt-inator is set with an automatic timer. Once it's activated, even I can't stop it. All that's left to do is open the bay doors. This may take awhile. How far down is it? I don't know, I can't see the bottom. But, it almost doesn't matter, so long as we get across it. Of course we need to know how deep it is. So, we know how scared we should be. We can use this grappling hook and rope to find out. One Two Three You see? Now we know that it's three seconds deep. And, done! So, Perry the Platypus, in fifteen seconds, the Tilt-inator will turn my building into the Leaning Tower of Doofenshmirtz! And you'll notice, there's no self-destruct button, no reverse levers, no abort switches, it's completely Perry the Platy-proof! Nothing can stop me now! Uh-oh. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Five Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Four Three Stop it! Stop it! Two One Oh, no! Why would you even do this? Now I need to open the door and reset the Tilt-inator countdown to fire again. Okay Now that we want to get across, it sure would be nice to have a grappling hook and some rope. Oh, yeah. Yeah, where can we get a grappling I know, it's right overâ Oops. Oh, would you look at that. The platform's retracting! What are we gonna do? You're the girl who got fifty Fireside patches in one day! That's right! Candace will get us out of this. Won't you, Candace? That was a fake! I only did it to get into a concert! If it wasn't for Isabella and my brothers, I never could've done it. Now, will you please save me? Give me one of your roller-skates. Here. Now, if I take the shoelace and Voila! Everyone, hold on! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, this is just great! I thought you were gonna save us, I-I thought you were supposed to be this perfect Firefighter Girl. Fireside Girl! That's what I said. Wait, there's a lever in the middle, but I can't reach it. Well, I can't reach it either. I bet the rope you threw away was longer than your shoelace. Oh, so now it's my fault? You got another shoelace. What? Right here, look! Yes! I still have time to bust the boys before my skate date! Mom! Come, on Melissa, let's get you home. And, done! Now with theâ Hey! Where'd you go? What are you doing up there? No! Three Two One Mom, you have to see this! Phineas and Ferb built a giant maze in the backyard! What maze? It was right here! Alright, Candace. Inside. But, but, but Perry the Platypus! Wait for me!  Agent P!  Wow, you guys thought of everything! We didn't think of this one. Okay, guys! I see the exit. And, stop! Wow, that was at least three seconds deep. It's a good thing the girls beat us out. Bye, Melissa. See you next week. Everything worked out just fine. Hey, I never got my metaphor cheese! Cheese cheese wombat cheese Huh. My echo must be broken."
"by ashirogi27 This week, Where'd They Go asked where'd they go about pop stars from the 80's. First up, this perky pop star score a one hit wonder by declaring,  I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun   I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun  ""I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun."" Hey, she looks familiar.  I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun  Lindana's real name is Linda Flynn-Fletcher,  I wanna, wanna, wanna have fun, fun, fun!  and she's now living in the Tri-state area. What?! Mom, Mom, Mom! I can't believe she didn't know that. Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! You never told me you were a pop star! Oh, yeah! Well, that was long before you were born. It was fun, but I was happy to give it up to raise a family. But, you were Lindana and you wanted to have fun! Well, now I'm Linda, and I wanna stir broth. Mom, it's for you. He says he's a concert promoter. Really? An '80's revival concert, featuring Lindana? Well, I don't know. Are you crazy? Say yes! Candace, it's been so long. Come on! It'll be fun! And you'll be cool! And by extension, I'll be cool! Oh, what the heck! I'll do it! Woo-hoo! Way to go, Mom! Yes. Oh, yes, good on ya, honey. Okay, then. Dinner's in the oven. Just heat it up. Bye! Rock and roll! Oh, I was afraid that a day like today would come somedayâ¦ today. What do you mean, Dad? Oh, your mother's going to meet a lot of exciting and cool people. What if I'mâ I'm no longer cool enough for your mom? I'm hardly a rock star, am I? I'm afraid I'm hopelessly nerdy. You know, Dad may be a little geeky for the new century, but in the '80s, the rise of the synthesizer allowed even hopeless nerds to rock the charts. Phineas, I know what we're going to do today! Yes. Yes, you do. Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P, there you are. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted playing with a hoop. See what he's up to. That's it. That's all we got. Ah, Perry the Platypus. As you can see, I've been struck by hooping fever. Go ahead, try it. Like this. Yeah. Now do this, with your arms down. Oh, finally! My hips were about to fall off. Behold, the Alien-inator! It's a projector that will transmit holographic images of space aliens onto the steps of the Tri-State Capital. Then, when everyone is scared witless, I will emerge in my king of the aliens costume and seize control of the entire Tri-State Area. I'm gonna go put it on. Ladies and gentlemen, presenting that '80s superstar Max Modem! You know, I feel strangely comfortable like this. But, how can I be a rock star if nobody's ever heard of me? We're not trying to make you into a rock star. We're trying to make you into a has-been. That's much easier. Can I have Bag Your Face onstage for your sound check, please? Mom, this is so cool! I've dressed like half of these people here for Halloween! So, what do we do now? If I remember correctly, hair, makeup, wardrobe and a photo session. A photo session? The life of a rock star. Oh, it does have its charms.  (She's Lindana)   I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun   (She wants to have fun)   I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun   (She's Lindana)   I'm Lindana and I wanna have fun   (She wants to have fun)   I wanna, wanna, wanna have fun, fun, fun!   (Fun, fun, fun!)  Are you ready? Don't peek. Ta-da! What, nothing? Wow, tough room. Okay, Dad, show me what you got. Right, ho! Whoa! Cut, cut, cut! That's a little too '70s for the '80s. Just check out Ferb. See, Dad? It's cool to show no effort. Let the technology and machines do the work. Primo, Dad! I think you're ready for the big time! Correction. I am ready to have once-been part of the big time. Make way for Max Modem! Max Modem? Never heard of him. Didn't he do that song? Yeah, yeah, yeah! I love that song! Oh, I think I had one of his 45s! I had all his albums! How'd he ever land here? I sang backup for him in Prague! Welcome back, Max! Modem! Modem! Modem! Modem! Mom, who is that guy? Modem! Modem! Modem! Modem! I don't know. But, he does seem kind of familiar, in a nerdy sort of way. Modem! Alright, Perry the Platypus, let's start by placing you right here. There you go. And then, I'll set the timer here. Mustn't forget to open the roof. A little something we learned from the Diarrhea-inator debacle. Right, Perry the Platypus? And, set the timer for ten minutes, so, I can get to the steps of the Tri-State Capital building in time to lead my alien army! Oh, and don't get any bright ideas about thwarting me while I'm gone, because this inator, it's got a few tricks up its sleeve. Lindana! Lindana! Lindana! Lindana! Lindana! Lindana! Lindana! But, I should be in the wings, Mom. The show's about to start. I wouldn't be here without you, honey. You backed me up all the way. So, it's only right that you should back me up onstage. Me? Sing? Just relax. You'll do fine. (Song: I'm Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun!)

Gentlemen, let's get our nerd on!  (She wants to have fun)   I wanna, wanna, wanna have fun, fun, fun!   (Fun, fun, fun!)  Oh, good, I'm early! And a killer parking space, too! Score! Time to set up. Nutjob. Now, let's see. Take over the Tri-State Area speech, and water, in case I get parched during my maniacal rant. Loud-inator. Check, one, two, three Papa, Papa! four, five, six I wanna see the clown! Sally, he's no clown. He's a nutjob. Oh, ha, ha, ha! Laugh it up now! A-And when your friends asked what happened to Casual Fridays, you can tell them you opened your big mouth! Good night, Danville! I can't believe I sang backup for Lindana! You can call me Mom. I just sang backup for Mom. Nah, just doesn't have the same ring. I am programmed to defend myself against all attacks. You cannot defeat me, Perry the Platypus. Time is up. Elected officials of the Tri-State Area, look to the skies in horror! You are being invaded, from space, by invaders from space! And I, the King of the Aliens, am here to accept your unconditional surrender! I thought he was a nutjob! Me, too! Now, bow down before me. Bow down, and I will spare your menial jobs! Do we get to keep our healthcare benefits? Thirty seconds, Mr. Modem. Who is that guy? You know, he really does look familiar. Yes. Yes, he does. And now the band you've been waiting for! Max Modem and the Mainframes! (Song: Alien Heart)  I think my girlfriend is an alien   Invading force from Planet 10   Said she was from out of town   But I know what she meant   I know she's from another galaxy   I don't know just what she's a-doing with me!   She treats my love like a science experiment   Hubble-bubble!   Does she love me for who I am?   Or does she want to put my brain in a can?   She can have it, cause I never want to be apart  Take my leg warmers, Max!  From her alien heart!   (She's got an alien)   Heart!   (She's got an alien)   Heart!

You've still got it. Though I can't say I remember you having it in the first place. You weren't so bad yourself. What say, we go out for a spot of tea sometime? Oh, no, thanks. I've got an absolutely wonderful husband back home. Yeah, well, you better believe it, Ducky. But, what did you do all this for? I just thought you might like it if I were a bit more, exciting? Oh, Lawrence, you and the kids are all the excitement I could ever want. Mom, it's the promoter again! He wants to sign you and Max Modem for an extended tour! Tell him thanks, but no, thanks. What?! But, what about the coolness, the fame and the fortune? Oh, Candace, we don't need those things to be happy. All we need is you guys. Right! Who wants to go on tour when there's so much to do around here this summer? Oh, okay. But, if anyone calls offering me a concert deal, I'm takin' it! So, Mom, after all these years, how'd you keep your voice in such great shape? Oh, I was lip-syncing. Even back then! Oh, there you are, Perry!  She's got an alien heart!

"by ashirogi27 Oh, so bored. Bored. Bored. Bored. Snoresville Central, Candace speaking. Oh, good, you're bored. You know how my mom wants me to take things more seriously and focus on what's important, like my grades, my future, andâ Like, becoming a doctor, a lawyer, or a doctor? Yeah? Well, she's forcing me to go to this leadership seminar today. And I'll implode with boredom if I go by myself. Are you out of your mind? There might be cute boys there. Oh, all right. But, you owe me big time! This year's all-terrain vehicle. It goes on the road and in the mud. In the mud and on the road! It's the all new all-terrain vehicle for all terrain zah. Road and mud aren't exactly all terrains. Somebody ought to build a vehicle that actually goes over all terrains. Two, three, four Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Five, six, seven Hey, where's Perry? Ah, Agent P. Oop! Uh, hold on a sec. There we go! Doofenshmirtz has been spotted buying television cameras, boom mics, and makeup. Find out what he's up to.  Perry!  Ladies? Baljeet, this seminar is for high school kids. What are you doing here? Well, I usually attend college level conferences, but I thought I would dumb it down for the weekend. Uh, are we supposed to take notes? Leaders of the Future, let's give it up for Tedd Shaw! Greetings, Leaders of the Future! I am Tedd Shaw. I may be young, but you're never too young to be a success! So, get ready to learn my easy steps which should be your goals. Woo-hoo! Oh, brother. So, fellas, what's on the menu for today? An all-terrain vehicle. With an electromagnetic motor, super rubber tank treads, high speed ceramic body, hydraulics and old remote control. Hey, let's take this baby for a spin, and see what she'll do! (Song: All Terrain Vehicle)  Up, down, all around, over rocks and underground   In the sky, in the trees   Plowing through a bunch of cheese   Flying through the air, we can buzz a county fair   Tell your momma that we're leaving   Yeah, we can go anywhere   Big top, china shop   Off the cliff and take a drop   Under sea, look at me, I'm talking to a manatee   It's not a submarine   It's not a plane, it's not a train   Come on, let's take a ride, we're talking all terrain   Whooo-ooo-ooo   We're talking all terrain, yeah   Whooo-ooo-ooo   We're talking all terrain   That's right   Cross the tundra, through a cave, surfing on a tidal wave   Over pillows, over nails   Off the road, and off the rails   A tight rope, a trampoline, having tea with the queen   I think you're gonna like my all terrain machine   Whooo-ooo-ooo   We're talking all terrain   Whooo-ooo-ooo   We're talking all terrain, yeah   And just so that we're clear  We can ride on the road, and in the mud!  We're talking all terrain!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus, so good of you to volunteer for my cause! Since the cost of evil went up, my alimony checks barely cover my overhead. So, I've come up with a brilliant idea. The Telethon of Evil! With lights and a camera and, uh Ooh, and a tote board, look. People will call in and send me money. And you can help man the phones. I had trouble finding a station that will put it on, so I invented this! The Preempt-inator. With this machine, I can preempt all the other TV programs! As soon as I can figure out if I plug in the red wire or the green wire. So, let's review. We've learned the principal of B.L.A.R.F. Be Living, Always Really Focused! Pfft. That makes me wanna B.L.A.R.F. I can see it is already working. Now, we go down to another step towards the secret of success. N.A.R.G. Never Abandon Realizing your Goal. Isn't that, N.A.R.YG? Please hold all questions 'til the end, thank you. Okay. Now, can you see how N.A.R.G.-ing could help you become president of the United States? Yes! Yes, I can! And you! Do you have a goal you never wanna stop realizing? Well, yeah. I-I've wanted to bust my brothers all summer. And have you used these steps? Believe me, I've B.L.A.R.F.-ed and N.A.R.G.-ed plenty. I've got nowhere. Well, I'm gonna tell you the final step to breaking your old, ineffectual patterns right after the break! So, don't you go anywhere! Stacy, did you hear that? Wake up! I-It's not my ferret! This could really be the answer to me busting the boys. That weird guy is gonna tell us the final step after the break! Can it be that I'll finally achieve my summer goal? Wait. Is that? It is. It's Phineas and Ferb! Woo-hoo! Hey, Candace, do you wanna give it a try? Oh, no. I'm going to do it right this time. Even though every fiber of my being is screaming to tell you to stay here and find out the information, then run frantically out to that ATV and drive my brothers to Mom who'll bust them, I will resist! Yes! I am going to stay right here, and break my old pattern! Good choice, Candace. I can tell you have pracâ Stacy, take notes for me! Hey, Candace. What are you doing here? Let me in! Okay, then! Buckle up! Uh, excuse me, do you know if there happens to be any seats left? There just happens to be an empty seat next to me! Okay, I've learned some skills thatâ Phineas, you're in the drivers seat. Why are you operating with a remote control? Candace, we're too young to drive. Duh! Well, no matter. Because we're driving this thing home. I'm calling Mom to make sure she's there to see this. You're going too slow! Give me that thing! So, how does this thing work?  I'm Lindanaâ  Maybe give me the remote. I got it, Phineas! I hope you're ready for the big show, Perry the Platypus! Because Evil Incorporated is on the air! Down as 2 and 2, here's the pitchâ We preempt your normal programming with the first annual Telethon of Evil! And now live, because it's evil spelled backwards, your host, Heinz Doofenshmirtz! (Song: Give Me Your Money Today)  I want your money   I'm strapped for cash   I need your money   Too lazy to get a job   Give me your money   I'm not being funny   Give me your money today!  This is a brilliant work of satire. It's my new favorite show. Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this. All I need to do is B.L.A.R.F. Be Living, Always Really Focused. I focused, and it worked. And that's how socks sometimes get lost in the dryer. And cut tape. I'm B.L.A.R.F.-ing! I'm B.L.A.R.F.-ing! What was that? I don't know, but it's more interesting than socks. To the news van! And we're back. The Inator Corporation was generous enough to send us a giant check for twenty-three dollars. Thank you, Sid and the guys. Uh, you do an important job. That brings our tally up to twenty-three dollars! Uh, let's go to the phones again. Okay, if no one calls in the next few seconds, the platypus gets it! We preempt this current preemption to bring you another preemption. This is Bridgette Oshinomi in the news breaker van. We're following an out of control all-terrain vehicle that is barreling down Broad Street. This is what preempted me! Ugh! The newspeople, they're behind this, and Iâ I won't stand for it! I must destroy them! Nothing cuts into my television face time! Oh, ha, ha! Very funny! Everyone's a comedian. The vehicle looks to be filled with children. Good thing I installed a TV screen, so I can follow the live coverage. Here's for stealing my ratings! Whoa! Oh, I keep missing! B.L.A.R.F.! B.L.A.R.F.! B.L.A.R.F.! What is going on up there? Are you getting this, Don? Uh, we're right above you. Bridgette, I'm seeing something kinda strange up here. Oh, hey, it's me. It's me. I'm back. Perry the Platypus, look. Theâ Oh. Oh, it's the chopper cam. Hello? I'm back. H-Hi, Mom. Hi. Oh, going for the more dramatic wide angle shotâ And the final tally is unbearable pain. And, probably a herniated disc. And, cut tape.  Perry!  You stay right here, I'm gonna go get Mom. Okay! Mom?! Mom, Mom, you've gotta come outside! I just drove up in this crazy souped up car that the boys inventâ Wait, wait, wait. You were driving? Without adult supervision? Well, no, I was operating a remote. Oh, so it was a toy car. No, no! No, it's a full-sized, and it'sâ You were driving a full-sized car?! Oh, that's it, young lady! You're grounded! But, but, but, the boysâ Candace, go to your room! We will talk about this, later. Ugh! I thought I did it right this time! Only I'd stay 'til the end of that seminar! Wait! Stacy's been there all day. Stacy! Candace, what happened to you? The lecture's over. The gift bags were totally cruddy, by the way. It's just a bag, nothing in it. Stacy, you've gotta tell me the last step to achieving successes. The boys' ATV is still here, I still have a chance. Hmm, the last step I forget. Hey, Chad. Do you remember what the last step to achieving your goal thingy is? Yes. It's F.R.E.E.P.O. Candace, it's F.R.E.E.P.O. See ya! Stacy! Hello? But, what does that mean? What does it stand for? You know, technically we didn't try all terrain. Uh, F.R.E.E.P.O Uh, Frequent Rampages Encourages Enormous Perpendicular Octagons. Uh, Free Raccoons Enter Existential Plastic Origami. Oh See ya in a bit, Candace! We're going to the moon!  We're talking all terrain  Aw, F.R.E.E.P.O."
"by ashirogi27 Are you and your family looking for a peaceful vacation getaway? Come visit delightful Danville! We have grass, milk, and smiles! Come to Danville. Pretty please? Brought to you by the Danville Tourist Board. You know, begging is really unbecoming. I mean, I like smiles as much as the next guy, and milk is a classic. But, what Danville really needs is a big tourist attraction. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Bye, Candace! I'm off to make my rounds. Bye, Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Ugh! I'm gonna need some backup. Hey, Stace. Wanna come over and help me bust my brothers? Ooh, sounds like fun. But, I have to go to the eye doctor. Okay, but just don't get big, thick glasses because then you'd be a nerd, and I couldn't be seen with you. Oh, Candace. You are so shallow. I know. I am so shallow. But seriously, don't get any thick, nerdy glasses. Ooh, as soon as I get some help, you guys are so busted! Just dump it right there, next to the giant gorilla head. Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Ferb and I have decided to construct the world's tallest building. Wanna help? Sure. Who wouldn't want to be a part of the Phineas and Ferb project? Phineas and Ferb? Pish-tosh! I'll take ninja discipline over creative whimsy any day. Well, I just think thatâ Irving, you're my little brother. So, it's my duty to teach you all my secrets of self-defense. I'd rather see what Phineas and Ferb are doing. What's in the box, anyway? It's my old collection of spy cameras. I'm gonna bring them to Phineas and Ferb, and see what they can do with them. Give me those! Give them back, Albert! Oopsie! Ooh! You pick those up, Albert! Make me. That is if you're ninja enough. You're a jerk! I'm gonna go play with Phineas and Ferb. Fine! You realize these cameras are now forfeit? Yeah, sure, Jenny, but what have whales ever done for me? Well, hello. Fine! Okay, if that's the way you feel, I'll just get somebody else to help me bust my brothers. I'll help you. Are you talking to me? As a damsel in distress, I have to help you, milady. It's part of my Medieval Knight's Code. I'm outta here. But, don't you wanna bust your brothers? I'm listening. Well, have you considered applying the manly science of spy cameras to your problem? Spy cameras? Wouldn't it be easier to just show my mom what Phineas and Ferb make? I don't know. Is that easier? No! No, it's not easy! It's never easy! I need help. And manly technological surveillance. I need nerd help. Will you help me? You have my word. My nerd word. Glad to have you on board, Irving! You can pick up your hard hat right over there next to Perry. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P! It appears that Doofenshmirtz has been brushing up on his astronomy. He rented an award-winning astronomical musical, Supernova? Fabulousnova! We don't know what it means, so we need you to get over there unrealistically fast. Good luck, Agent P! Agent P?  Doofenshmirtz, four seconds later!  Oh, Perry the Platypus. Why do you rush over here just to get trapped? It makes no sense. You like that? It's a space helmet. I got a bunch of them used. They still smell like astronauts. I think that's what that is. Anyway, since you're here, let me tell you about my new hobby. Making charts and graphs. See here? This is a chart of my canteen usage! Which has plummeted since childhood. And this is my evil. I noticed that in any given month, my evilness that's the red part, stays perfectly constant. Evenly evil. But, around the same time each month, there's a spike in background evil, see that? See? Right here? And during that part of the month I actually seem less evil by comparison! And why? Why is it? It's the full moon! I mean, werewolves alone must account, for like, 20% of that! H-How can I compete? Then I realized, if I could rotate the moon, then the dark side would always be facing us, bringing all other evil to a standstill, and making me the only evil game in town! (Song: Keep on Building)  Stacking steel, laying bricks   Pounding nails, and moving up quick   2-by-4s and RSJs   Concrete blocks and bales of hay   Keep on building   Stacking steel, laying bricks   Pounding nails, and moving up quick   Up to the sky   2-by-4s and RSJs   Concrete blocks and bales of hay   Keep on building   Stacking steel, laying bricks   Pounding nails, and moving up quick   Birds flying by   2-by-4s and RSJs   Concrete blocks and bales of hay   Stacking steel, laying bricks   Floor after floor after ceiling   Pounding nails, and moving up quick   Carry the load   2-by-4s and RSJs   Concrete blocks and bales of hay   Stacking steel, laying bricks   All of our permits in order   Pounding nails, and moving up quick   It's all up to code   2-by-4s and RSJs   Concrete blocks and bales of hay   Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store   'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!   Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store  'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!   Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store  'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!   Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store  'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!   Floor after floor after floor!  So, to recap, I rotate the dark side of the lunar surface towards the Earth, eliminating the full moon and corner the market on evil! What? It's genius. Why are you looking at me like I'm an idiot? Would an idiot build this?! Oh, wait, wait, not that! That's just a cork with a jellybean taped to it. But, don't judge it, it's a layered idea. Now behold, the Lunar Rotat-inator! Oh, wait, wait, i-it's not up there yet. Hold on. Wait. Almost there. Okay, there! Now, you can behold! Camera one is in position and activated. As soon as the other sixteen cameras are in place, we can render the whole take-down in three dimensions. And busting your brothers will be as simple as a quadratic equation. For a nerd, you rock! Albert and Candace and spy cameras? So, that's your game. Hey, Phineas. How are we gonna know when to stop building? I guess we'll just know when we get there. We're there. That's one small step for Ferb, one giant building for Danville! So, your father's an exterminator? No. Why do you ask? No reason. Now, sit back and watch the magic unfold. Not much of a nerd, are ya? Someone has purloined our cameras! Hey, Albert! Looking for these? Irving! You bring those cameras back down here, right this instant! Ooh, why don't you come up here, and endeavor to reclaim them? We shall! Actually, I don't do high places. I shall! Irving! Hey, Albert! Pretty neat, huh? Just another creative whimsy from the minds of Phineas and Ferb! And you want to bust them. I do if you like them! Hey, Albert! Enjoying the monorail? Yeah, well, I was in the neighborhood, and Iâ Oh, my gosh! This is our chess floor. And up here, we have the Medieval Renaissance Fair floor. Huz-zah! And the new-in-the-box action figure floor. The M.C. Escher floor. And this is theâ Oh, that's right, we sublet this floor. That was a mistake. So, what are you doing after work? The rubber-ball floor! The barnyard floor! The studio audience floor! And of course there are hundreds of other floors to see, but we'll need to get you fitted for a pressure suit first. Thanks, guys. So What did you think? I think you're right. Phineas and Ferb are certifiable geniuses. So, does that mean you're gonna stop helping Candace? I gave her my nerd word. You gave her your nerd word? But, now you've only got two left! Well, that's on me. And it's on me to see that Phineas and Ferb are busted. And so, they shall a-be. Did you get the cameras? No, but don't worry. I've done the math. There is no way your brothers won't be busted. Numbers don't lie. This building is so well-constructed, there is no force on Earth that can move it before your mom comes home! Then, that's it! I win! Through the power of nerd help! Hey, Candace. Working on your cackle? You guys are so busted. What's that I hear? Oh, that's right. It's the inevitable. Oh. I thought it was Mom's car. Mom! Mom! Mom! Ah? Ha! I told you it was a layered idea! Now, to show the moon who's boss! I don't remember adding that. Mom! Mom! Giant building! Just a sec, Candace. Let me grab these groceries. And there we go. Now, what were you saying? Look! Hi, Mom! Oh, hi, boys. What did you do today? We tried to make Danville a more interesting place. Well, you guys do that just by being you. Wait, t-this doesn't make any sense. The moon is rotating, but the dark side isn't moving. Ooh, I bet you had something to do with this. Didn't you, Perry the Platypus? You're always messing me up. You'reâ Y-You're just mean. Mean, Perry the Platypus. Born mean, that's all. Wait, what are you doing? Making magic fingers at me? Areâ Are you even listening to me? Wait, you know this isn't big enough to trap me! Curse you, giant flying building! Oh, I get it! I think I get that theâ The light from the moon is just a reflection from the light from the sun! Ugh, dummkopf! I should've rotated the sun.  Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store   'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!   Floor after floor   Now we know what's in store   'Nother floor, then a floor, then a floor!

"by ashirogi27 I don't know, Stacy, between busting my brothers and trying to make Jeremy my boyfriend in time for school, I just can't seem to get anything done this summer. Like my Jeremy and Me scrapbook. I mean, I've cute pictures of Jeremy and cute pictures of me, but no cute pictures of both of us being cute together! It's a real problem. But, time to check on Phineas and Ferb! Standing around, dorking it up, boring. There's just too much for one person to do. If only there were two of me One to bust my brothers and one to be with Jeremy. Look at what Baljeet did to my candy bar. He got peanut butter on my chocolate. Look at this mess! Look at it! Buford, peanut butter and chocolate are really good together. I don't wanna taste two things at one time! That's unnatural! Well, you're in luck. We just finished our Molecular Separator. It's our cool new machine that breaks things down into their component parts. We used it to separate a mule into a horse and a donkey. And to separate shampoo plus conditioner into shampoo and conditioner. Ferb? Witchcraft! Try it. Well? Singular goodness. Why don't you grab your peanut butter and your swimsuit, and meet me at the flagpole. Come on. Let's see what else we can separate. Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been seen at the Danville public pool, installing some kind of new device. We need you to get there immediately. Good luck, Agent P. Those kids are so busted! All I have to do is bring this to Mom. Wow, it's heavier than I thought. Must bust Phineas and Ferb! Ah, Jeremy. Perry the Platypus, I'm glad you're here. I'm just in line for the high dive. You see, it reminds me of the high dive I knew as a kid at the Gimmelshtump Public Wetness Maker. It wasn't so much of a pool, as it was just aâ Well, let's just say that it only had water in it on alternating Thursdays, and leave it at that. Anyhoo, in Gimmelshtump, jumping from the high dive was an important rite of passage. Are you a man or a schnitzel? I'm a man, I'm a man. Das kind ist ein schnitzel. With all those people looking and laughing at me, I-I just couldn't do it. Ich habe keinen sohn. After that, my father and I became increasingly distant. Zu nah! Now, I will conquer my fear and jump from the high dive. But you know, I-I still don't want any of these people to look at me and make fun of me. So, I invented the Look-Away-inator! You'd think it would attract a lot of attention at the public pool, but so far no one's noticed it. It must be leaking or something. Anyway, when I do my man making dive, you can bet that nobody in the Tri-State Area will be looking. Sure, it would be tough for people who happen to be driving, plus, brain surgeons might have a problem too. But, it's really a small price to pay for me becoming a man, right? You're right. I gotta trap you. Romance!  Lalalalala!  It's a Jeremy bedroom. O. M. G. Mom, Phineas and Ferb made me! Um, I've got some stretch marks that would say otherwise. No, I mean they split me in half. Well, not like I'm cut in half, but they've made another me. Hear for yourself. It's for you. Hi, Jeremy! Not Jeremy, it's Mom. Oh, hi, Mom. Here's Candace. See? That was a very nice imitation of yourself, Candace. Love ya. Bye. No, wait! Hello? Ugh! Hey, Candace. And hello to you, Candace. Uh-oh. Okay Ferb, change of plans. You need to focus on what's important, you touchy-feely ninny! I love you. Hey, guys. So, it appears there's been a little mishap. What say we fire up the ol' Molecular Splitter in reverse andâ Forget it! I've only got one thing on my mind, and that's busting you! I'm going to the mall to get Mom. Wait for me! Well, I guess I know what we're gonna do today. Gotta find Mom. Gotta find Jeremy. (Song: Me, Myself and I)  Me, myself and I don't see eye to eye   Me, myself and I don't get along   Me, myself and I can finally say goodbye   This collaboration always felt so wrong   There's two of us on the scene   And I don't wanna sound mean   But I'll tell you that I'm happy without me   I've been holding me back   But now I'm on my own track   We're done   Finito, I'm free!   From here on out, we can both exist peacefully   Without all of this struggle and internal strife   (Internal strife)   Now that we're separate, we can do anything   So donât let the door hit you, have a nice life   (Have a nice life)   I'm through with myself   Iâm better off without her   (Myself and I)   I'm through with myself   I'm better off without her   Me, myself and I don't get along   (Without her)  Hi, Mom. Have you seen Jeremy? Doesn't he work over there at that hot dog stand? Oh, yeah. Mom! Mom! Have you seen me? I see you right now. Weren't you looking for Jeremy? No! Wow, twins. That's a handful. What? Y-You can go ahead if you want. I'm not in that much of a hurry. Uh-huh. You have fun up there. So Donât talk to me, Mister. There you go, little guy. Hey, Candace. Have you seen Candace? Well, I can see you right now. No, no, no. No. Not ""me"" me. The ""me"" that isn't me. Uh You know ""Blah-blah-blah. Jeremy is so amazing. Hearts, rainbows, and unicorns, blah!"" That me. Well, gosh. I guess I could say, yes, I have. Where? Nowhere. I mean, not today. Ugh! Well, if I come back and I have a flower in my hair, you tell me. Find Candace, find Mom. Bust, bust, bust! Hi, Jeremy. Uh Hey, Candace. You have a flower in your hair. I know. Okay, you're kinda scaring me. Oh, I could just stare at you all day long. Listen, I gotta get back to work. But if you like, I can swing by your house after I'm done. Really? I would love that! Okay then, I'll see you after work. Something to remember me by? Okay. Okay, maybe later. Hey, Jeremy. Hey, guys. Have you seen Candace? Yeah, she was just here. Was she talking about busting or was she oogling over you? Um Both. She said something about going to find the other Candace andâ And Mom and then she went all wild when I mentioned stopping by tonight. Great! So, if we just find Mom, we'll find both Candaces. Uh Tell them I say hi? Mister, come on. It's your turn. Are you some kinda a schnitzel? I'm a man! Not a schnitzel! I will prove it right now! Nobody calls me schnitzel anymore! I bet he doesn't even know what it means, the littleâ Hey. Hey, wait a minute. This isn't as bad as I remember. It's so much worse! Schnitzel. Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom, she's here! I've got Candace here with me! Come out and look for yourself! See? Two of us! Well, actually, right now I can see four of you. That slippery vixen! Don't move. I'll be right back. Yes. Yes, you will. Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust, bust! My Jeremy is going to love this! There she is. Well, I'm heading out. Want a ride? But my sugar-boo is stillâ Candace! Isn't Jeremy coming over? You should be home getting ready. Oh, they're right! Mom, let's go! How about you kids? Don't worry. We'll be home soon. One Candace down, one to go. Phineas, Ferb! Have you seen the other Candace? We just saw her. She's driving away with Mom. If the Molecular Splitter doesn't just disappear when this is over, we should really consider destroying it. Agreed. My Jeremy, my Jeremy, my Jeremy and I will be forever. My Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy will leave me never. Ooh, Jeremy. Yay, Jeremy! What was that noise? Jeremy's coming! Gotta get ready for Jeremy! Ugh! Where is she? Where is who? Candace! She was with you in the car! Yes, ""she"" was. And?! Come on buddy, let's go! Watch out, schnitzel! Yeah! Boo-yah! Now that's a man! Hey, Candace! Look who's here early. Ooh, my Jeremy is here! I'll be right with you, my love! She bought it! I guess love is blind. Okay, okay, I'll show you. My Turn-Away-inator and I are ready to go! That's it, look away! Fantastic. Uh Everyone paid up on their insurance? I taste lilacs. My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here! My Jeremy's here! Busted, busted, busted! Mom! Ferb, now! Yikes. All right, Candace. I'm here. Now, I'm ready. Oh, I didn't realize it would affect me, too! Not ready! I can't swim! I am a schnitzel! I am a schnitzel! Curse you and thank you, Perry the Platypus.  Perry!  What are we looking at? I have no idea. I could've sworn there were more people here. What did you want, Candace? Nothing. Suit yourself.  I wanna sing!  I try so hard to keep you under wraps. I can't do anything right, even with two of me! I can't bust my brothers. I can't evenâ There you are, Candace. Jeremy? Your mom said you got this picture frame for me at the mall today. Uh, no. Iâ I-I mean, that wasn't really me. I meanâ Not all of me. I meanâ Oh, this isn't coming out right. Well, I think it's pretty cool. You do? The only thing is It needs a picture. Anybody got a camera? We're on it. Say fromage. Fromage!"
"by ashirogi27  Na, na, na  Okay, boys. I'm off to the store for as much Mucus Be Gone as I can carry. Are you sure you're going to be okay? No worries, Mom. We'll be perfectly fine. Well, all right. Bye. Bye, Mom. Aw, you guys really are sick. Oh, you know us. Nothing can ever keep us down. That's great! You're completely incapacitated! That means I have the whole day to myself! I could spend all day on my Jeremy Scrapbook, or I could work on Jeremy: The Board Game, or I could go to the mall and watch Jeremy work from my hiding place behind the Weave 'n' Wave. The possibilities are endless! This is gonna be the best sick day ever, for me! Best sick day ever, huh? Ferb, I know what we're gonnaâ All right, Ferb, implement our Sick Day Video Game Backup System. Ready local area network. What'cha doin'? You too, huh? Where's everyone else? Here we are. So, everyone's sick in bed today, huh? Nah, I'm just lazy. Cool, I think. Hey, where's Perry? Agent P, I didn't know you were a germaphobe. Carl, he's afraid of germs, just like you. It's not the germs, sir, it's the garlic smell. If you have something to say, Carl, spit it out! Ugh, never mind, sir. Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has been seen racking up huge bills in Brain, Bath, and Beyond, the area's largest Big Box Mind Control Warehouse store. Get to the bottom of it. Monogram out. Ah, Perry the Platypus. I've been expecting you. Sit anywhere, Perry the Platypus, make yourself at home. So, what do you think of my De-Volitionator? Not to be confused with my De-Evolutionator from a few schemes ago. You see, volition is our ability to choose what we are going to do. Whereas, evolution Eh, that's got something to do with monkeys, I think. But, this allows me to take over your volition and control what you do. Like this, watch. How do you feel, Perry the Platypus? Well, it doesn't matter because I'm in control. Okay, turn, and let's go outside and see what this baby can really do! And let's make this snappy, I gotta pick up my daughter by five. You remember Vanessa, right? Y-You know, you blew me up at her birthday party. All right, gang, who wants to go first? I want to! Me! Me! Oh, me! Me! Let's let the computer decide. Buford vs. Isabella! I'm fighting a girl? This'll be easy! Ooh! Fight-uh! Patch sash smack attack! Isabella wins-uh! In your face, Buford!  Doofenshmirtz's ex-wife's sports sedan!  Thanks for driving me to the Scrapyard Invasion party, Mom. Now remember, I won't be able to pick you up afterwards 'cause I'm gonna be getting my nails done. So, I have your Dad picking you up. Oh, that's cool. If by cool you mean completely embarrassing me in front of the only people whose opinions matter to me. At least he's trying. Yes, very trying. Do you remember the last time he picked me up? Vanessa, over here! Hop in! Ugh, don't ask! Maybe you should just let me off here. At least I can start the party off with my dignity intact. Whoops, too late! Look! It's the only people whose opinions matter to you. Hey, Johnny. Hey, Vanessa. Nice ride. Yeah, hold on to that thought. My dad's picking me up. Have fun at the dump. Watch out for medical waste! All right, gang, let's see who's next. Baljeet vs. Ferb! Oh, great! It is not like Ferb is an internationally ranked video game wizard or anything! Fight-uh! Baljeet wins-uh! Ferb, did you let me win to save my fragile, nerdy ego? Oh, I'd never do that. Look at all the freaks here. I know, huh? Our peeps. And look at this. We're on the Internet. What? This whole place is wired. They've got cameras everywhere. There's like, dozens of live feeds. Oh, here's the crowd dancing, the DJ. Here's the restroom. Not cool, man. Wow! This is like the coolest midday scrapyard rave ever! Okay. Isabella and Baljeet won their battles. So, who am I gonna battle? Phineas vs. Phineas! Okay. At least I'm evenly matched. Fight-uh! Phineas wins-uh! I'm kicking my own butt! Left foot, right foot. Left foot, right foot. Okay, now, skip! I'm controlling Perry the Platypus And Uh Slap yourself! Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourselfâ I can make you do anything! Oh Oh! Eat that gum off the sidewalk! Oh, gross! You're really going to do it? Perry the Platypus, that's so unsanitary! Didn't your mother ever tell you not to do that? Ooh! Oh, it looks so horrible! I can't look, I can't look! Stop! Stop, Perry the Platypus, stop! Oh, man, that was great. Now put it back down and do it again. Awesome place for a dance party, huh? Yeah! I just saw a rat! Ugh, it's my dad. Yes, Dad? Perry the Platypus almost ate gum off the sidewalk! Is that what you called to tell me? No, no. I-I just called to remind you that I'll be picking you and your Visigoth friends up after the dance. Dad, it's goths, not Visigoths. And they're punks, not goths. Uh Sorry, Alaric, I-I thought they were Visigoths. But, you're not going to impress the punks. You're free to go. Oh, but I still get my pay raise! See, this is what it's like having a teenage daughter. You're never cool enough. Anyway Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Perry the Platypus, I can't believe you removed this shopping cart from the supermarket parking lot! You must be feeling so evil! Oh, look at the time. I've got to go pick up Vanessa. Mush, Perry the Platypus, mush! A junk yard? W-Why can't they have their party in a nice place, like the Caribou Lodge? You ever been to the Caribou Lodge, Perry the Platypus? They have a nice spread there. Sweet ride, dude. Thank you. Platypus power. Uh-oh. Batteries are low. Hmm Take five, Perry the Platypus. Phew. That was closeâ Uh-oh. Power surge. No, wait! Ooh, Perry level. Nice graphics. Okay, Perry the Platypus. All charged up and ready toâ Oh, great. Now, what's wrong with it? I didn't do that! I did that! But, I only seem to have control of his left arm. Let me try! Cool! I've got control of his left leg! I've got his right arm. Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Why are you hitting yourself? Ferb's got right leg. Oh, I have got back and forth! What's wrong with it? Stop that! Stop it! What is the goal of this game? I'm not sure. Who cares? Let's just fight that old pharmacist! Sure! This must be the boss level. All right, guys. We work as a team on this one. Uh-oh! Ready stance Now, taunt And jump! Great leap, leg team! I bet those flies are power-ups. Let's see. Oh, Perry the Platypus! Gross! That's worse than sidewalk gum! Oh, yeah! Perry the Platypus, w-what's gotten into you? He's trying to get away! Not on our watch! Now, now, Perry the Platypusâ Eat pig iron, old pharmacist! Stay back, Perry the Platypus! Back! Buford! I'm on it! On my mark, guys! Oh, my. Wait! Baljeet, in! Whaâ Wait, w-why are you moving so deliberately? Roger! Legs Jump Wait. W-What are you doing?! Buford! What areâ Eat it! Finish him off, Ferb! Nice one. We won, gang! And if I may be so bold, I claim the right to throw Perry's hat in the air. Huh. Game over, I guess. Aww. Dad? That's your dad? No! I was at the Caribou Lodge once, and it was just like this. Dad, why? Who's up for charades? Perry the Platypus, what are you doing down here? (Song: There's a Platypus Controlling Me) Dad? Oh, hi, Vanessa. Dad, what are you doing?  Well, I'll be honest, I don't really understand   But I fell down this hill, now I got glue on my hands   And I got records on my fingers   Whaaat?   Records on my fingers   I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   Don't stop   I can't stop, I got a platypus controlling me   Whaaat?   I got a platypus controlling me   Now let me sum it up   It was a strange set of circumstances   Strange set of circumstances   I fell down the hill, I got glue on my hands   Now I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   Don't stop! Don't stop!   Well, I would if I was able   There's a platypus controlling me   He's underneath the table   There's a platypus controlling him   Whaaat?  Oh, I get it! Platypus is a metaphor for whatever's keeping you down!  Like corporations are a platypus   The government's a platypus   Your teacher is a platypus   My teacher is a panda   Society's a platypus   My parents are a platypus   The media's a platypus   It's all just propaganda   Yeah, we all got a platypus controlling us   No, just me   We all got a platypus controlling us   I'd stop if I was able   We all got a platypus controlling us   I'm not speaking metaphorically   The platypus controlling me is underneath the table  Wait! Oh, wait, no, he's gone! Hey!  There's no platypus controlling me   There's no platypus controlling me!  Your dad's kinda cool. You're my punk-rock boyfriend! You're not supposed to think my dad is cool! It only matters that I think he's cool. She thinks I'm cool! Well, it looks like all our fevers have broken. Ugh Except for Buford, who managed to get sick by laying in bed all day. Oh, there you are, Perry. Just in time for your walk.  Well, I'll be honest, I don't really understand   But I fell down this hill, now I got glue on my hands   And I got records on my fingers   Whaaat?   Records on my fingers   I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   Don't stop   I can't stop, I got a platypus controlling me   Whaaat?   I got a platypus controlling me   Now let me sum it up   It was a strange set of circumstances   Strange set of circumstances   I fell down the hill, I got glue on my hands,   Now I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   Don't stop! Don't stop!   Well I would if I was able   There's a platypus controlling me   He's underneath the table   Whaaat?"
"by ashirogi27 You know, Ferb, one of the best times we ever had was when we built that rollercoaster. We should do it again! But this time, as a musical. Whaddya say? We'll do all the same things except we'll break into spontaneous singing and choreography with no discernible music source. Hmm What assurance would we have that everyone else will also break into song and do the same thing? I don't know. I think they probably will. Fair enough. I'm in. (Song: Hey Ferb)  I know what we're gonna do today   Though it might sound just a bit clichÃ©   We can build a rollercoaster, but this time with songs and dancing!   'Cause when we're back in school come next September   And they ask us, we can both remember   Every cool and clever thing we did all summer long, and glancing   Back we're gonna be so glad that we   Didn't sit all day and watch TV   I don't think anyone can disagree   The world is possibilities   And that's what makes me say   (Hey, Ferb!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today   (Hey, Ferb!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today   (Hey, Ferb!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   (Boredom is something up with which I will not put!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today   (Hey, Ferb!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   (Boredom is something up with which I will not put!)   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!   Hey, Ferb!  Phineas, Ferb! I'm gonna go pick up a few things. You boys stay out of trouble, okay? Okay, Mom. I'm in charge, right? You did tell them I'm in charge. Relax, Candace. Nobody has to be in charge. But what if there's an emergency? Like what? What if, uh What if a wild moose, a whole herd of them, burst into the house and attack everyone? If that happens, you're in charge. Yes! Mom says I'm in charge conditionally! The condition didn't have anything to do with the moose, did it? You know, it's funny that you mention thatâ Oh! I'm watching you. Hello? Oh, hi, Stacy! Mom just went to the store, she left me in charge. Well, you know, conditionally. Well, that's better than not in charge at all, I guess. It's all about the varying degrees of authority. There's conditionally in charge, and you've got you're basically in charge, you're mostly in charge, and there's just in charge, completely devoid of modifiers. That's what I'm shooting for. Huh? Wait, what are my brothers doing right now? What do you mean you can see it from where you are? See what?! Check it out, Ferb. We can see Stacy's house from here. Phineas! What is this? Do you like it? Ooh, I'm gonna tell Mom, and when she sees what you're doing, you are going down! (Song: You're Going Down)  (You're going down, down, you're going down)   You're going down when I get Mom to see!   (Down to the ground, down, you're going down)   This ridiculous monstrosity   (You're going down, down, you're going down)   You'll never get away with this again   (You're going down)   You're G-O-I-N-G D-O-W-N!   (You're going down, down, you're going down)   Spread the news from coast to coast   (Down to the ground, down, you're going down)   You're going down, your operation exposed   (You're going down, down, you're going down)   I could say more but I don't wanna boast   (You're going down)   Get used to butter 'cause you both are toast!   (Shooby doo wop, bop, bop)   If a certain condition arises   (Shooby doo wop, bop, bop)   I'm the one to avert the crisis!   You think you're livin' large   (Shooby doo wop, bop, bop)   But you forgot that I'm the one in charge   (Shooby doo wop)   Conditionally!   Down, down, down, down, down   You're going down!  See? No discernible music source. Hi, Candace. Hi, Stacy. Hey, Jenny. How'd the number go? Pretty good, but I'm still angry. Well, I guess I'm up. (Song: What'cha Doin'?)  I'm just the curious girl 'cross the way   Every day I come over, and here's what I say   What'cha doin'?   What'cha doin'?   What's the day's activity?   What'cha doin'?   What'cha doin'?   By any chance could it include me?   What'cha doin'?   (What'cha doin'?)   What'cha doin'?   I don't mean to disturb   What'cha doin'?  (What'cha doin'?)   What'cha doin'?   You know it's not really directed at Ferb   When I say-ay-ay-ay-ay   What'cha doin'?   Don't you know, Phineas   You have no idea   That every day I'm just dyin' to see ya  And say  What'cha doin'?   (What'cha doin'?)   What'cha doin'?   I really wanna know   What'cha doin'?   (What'cha doin'?)   What'cha doin'?   Can I be part of the show?   When I say-ay-ay-ay-ay   What'cha doin'?  Hey, Isabella. What'cha doin'? Building a rollercoaster. Again? Cool. Hey, Ferb! Still a man of few words, I see. Nah, you missed it. Earlier he had two lines. Wow, chatty. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. The evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to his old tricks. For reasons unknown to us, he bought up 80% of the country's tin foil. Carl, d-didn't he already do that? Yes, sir. At the beginning of summer. Well, all right then. Uh, Agent P, go out there and do the same thing you did last time. Good luck, Agent P. Ah, the world of a field agent, out in the thick of things. Not like me. (Song: Monogram Box Song)  My whole world is this screen   Just four walls of a rectangle   But I can dare to dreamâ  Carl! Oh, sorry, sir. I thought you were done. You want me to turn 'em back on? Nah, forget it. The moment's gone. So the way I see it, the solid fuel rockets kick in at the mall parking lot. Then we release the snakes during the corkscrew around the interstate. I'm gonna go get some snakes. Mom, you've gotta come home, right now. Let me guess. A herd of wild moose are in our living room? No. Besides, it's mooses. No, I think the word moose is already plural. Mom, trust me. It's mooses. Or meese. Do you want me to get a dictionary? Is this what you came down here for? No, Mom! You've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb are doing! They're a building a rollercoaster! Candace, you've already used that one. (Song: Mom Look)  Mom, look!   Don't roll your eyes at me!   Mom, look!   Just come over and see   Mom, look!   It shouldn't be so hard!   Mom, look!   They built it in the backyard   Once they made it winter in June  I didn't see it.  Built a rocket to the moon  I didn't see it.  Mom, they cause me so much pain!  Now, Candace  Once they even gave me Perry's brain!  Oh, for crying out loud!  They built a submarine, a time machine,   A haunted house that made me scream,   Drove cattle through the mall,   Built a giant bowling ball,   Blew me up to fifty feet,   A chariot dragged me down the street,   (La la la la la la la la)   Made their stupid clothes a fashion craze,   Shoelace tips a household phrase,   Shot me through a circus tent,   Always asked where Perry went,   A lava flow destroyed my face,   A giant roller derby race,   Thawed a caveman out of ice,   Built a rollercoaster twice!  Candace, seriously. Isn't Phineas a little young to be a rollercoaster engineer? (Song: Aren't You a Little Young?) Well, yes. Yes, he is.  Aren't you a little young to build a roller coaster?  Yes. Yes, I am.  Well, I must say that I'm really quite impressed   But all your permits are in order   Don't forget the bricks and mortar   And if you need a power loader, be my guest!  But, if I'm pressed  I'd say you look a little young to drive a forklift  Yes. Yes, I am.  It's good to see a younger guy like you   Who's creative and ambitious   A little bigger than his britches   And who's got a fresh, exciting point of view   Yes, it's true!   That you seem a little young to do the things that you do   Even with all the moxie you've got   Yes, you seem a little green to be controlling this machinery   Yeah, I get that a lot!   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated   Where being evil is not debatâ  You know what, I should really write the rest of that someday. Ah, Perry the Platypus, what a surprise. And by surprise, I mean not a surprise at all. Anyway Let me show you what I've been working on. I, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, have covered the entire eastern seaboard in tin foil again. But this time, when I put my giant magnet next to my ingenious Magnetism Magnifinator, I will pull the East in a westerly direction, thereby reversing rotation of the Earth! I-I know I tried this before but that was with a Magnifier, this is a Magnifinator. Iâ I added the suffix -inator. Uh, it's a completely different ball game. I know you're probably expecting some tragic back story, to explain why I want to reverse the rotation of the Earth. But, I'm not gonna go there. You know why? Well, I'll tell ya. (Song: Back in Gimmelshtump)  Back in Gimmelshtump   I always had to keep it real!   'Cause when you grow up in Gimmelshtump   Your childhood is less than ideal!   So I don't dwell on how I crawled my way out of the gutter!   No, I don't!   When people ask me what I mean, I say   ""D-D-D-Do I stutter?""   But I'm no longer a hater   'Cause I got an Inator   And an over-complicated scheme   I get a couple of checks   Every month from my ex   So I can finance my coming regime!   And though my past was a wreck   I won't let it affect   My aspirations to cause mass hysteria   'Cause I'm as sure as can be   That it's my destiny   To be the ruler of the Tri-State Area!   Yeah!  Um So, are we done? 'Cause I gotta pick up my kid from school. One second, just wait 'til it goes to black. All right, now you can go. But, Mom, I'm telling you, they're building it, and it's huge! And Iâm telling you, you've used this story before. Yeah, but this time, it's a musical! ""Phineas and Ferb present the Coolest Coaster Ever, now open""? Mom! Hey, look! The Coolest Coaster Ever! Do you think we'll get in free with this poster? We didn't last time. Maybe we should take it just in case. Hey, if anyone's gonna ride this thing, it's gonna be me. Not one of you lousy extras. Here! Look, look, look, look, look, see? I told you I'm not crazy! I told you! And you're not crazy because? I see your point, Candace. No crazy person would scream at a post like that. I'll be in the dairy section if you wanna come yell at some cheese. Would you like that, honey? Would you like to yell at some cheese? A little. Well, c'mon, then. Oh, I hope Agent P is having good luck like I told him to.  My whole world is this screen   Just fourâ  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages! May I present to you a spectacle most of the morning in the making! Mark your calendars because you will want to tell your grandchildren about the day you rode the Coolest Coaster Ever!

Phineas, are you sure this is safe?  (Rollercoaster, roll, rollercoaster)  Of course.  It's like a leisurely drive around downtown   But it starts with a 3-mile drop straight down!   Yeah, now keep your head and hands and feet inside the ride   Not a written rule but it's strongly implied   Permanecer sentados, por favor!   Scream if you want more!   That's right!

And I'm screaming like a baby who's afraid of a clown!   I'm glad I'm wearing trousers that are already brown!   It'll twist your melon, it'll turn your gut   Man, is this ride sweet or what?   We go   Ah ah ah!   We go   Ah ah ah!   We go   Ah ah ah!   Rollercoaster!   I got the poster!

I can't believe you walked all the way to the service station to get jumper cables, but you didn't bring the battery cart. What did you think, a battery cart was just going to fall out of the sky? Okay What did you think, a million dollars was just going to fall out of the sky? It doesn't work that way. Well, how does it work then? Now, you are too late! Quake in your boots and watch helplessly, as the unimaginable electromagnetic forces, pull the eastern seaboard, thereby reversing rotation of theâ Well That didn't work. And now we have a two-ton ball of tin foil traveling 200 miles an hour directly at us! Quickly, we must separate the magnet from the Magnifinator before it is too late! Is it just me or is this a serious dÃ©jÃ  vu moment? I-I feel like I've totally been here before. Like, you were there, the tin foil was coming, and Iâ ""Quickly, we must separate the magnet"". Huh. Oh, well. Weird. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Man, is she mad at that cheese? Wait a minute. What's going on out there? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Mom! Mom! It's no use! We are doomed! You did it! You saved us, Perry the Platypus! You savedâ Again. Again with the dÃ©jÃ  vu. You were up there, I was saying, ""You saved us."" And thenâ Hm. And then something came fromâ Curse you, dÃ©jÃ  vu! Look, look, look, see? Okay, I give up. What am I supposed to be looking at? No! It's not possible! I'm gonna go get the cart. It was right here, and it was huge! Mom! Time to go. I've got frozens. Okay, so you think that Phineas and Ferb are still under that stupid tree in the backyard, right? Well, yes. That would be my guess. Fine, then. Let's go home! Now! Oh, there you are, Perry. Nice hat, Isabella. Hm. Funny. I don't remember this in the blueprint. And I'm sure this is new. I worry about you sometimes, Candace. You know, if they break into our house, Candace is in charge. Oh, hey, Jeremy. Oh, hey, Phineas. Anyone want any fries? Nah, we're good. Oh, say hi to your sister for me! CrÃªpe Suzette? What do you say, Suzette? You want a crÃªpe? No, thank you. Meap. It was good to see Meap. Okay, we're here. Are you happy now, Candace? Yes! See, Mom? I told you they weren't there! Oh, hi, boys. Hi, Mom. Come on, Candace, help me with the groceries. But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but Let's go. Hey, Phineas, that was great! Way too cool! That was awesome! Can we do it again? Sorry, only one ride per customer. That was great, Phineas. So, what are you gonna do tomorrow? Well, you know what they say. Carpe diem. Excuse me? Carpe diem. It's Latin for seize the day. (Song: Carpe Diem) Or you could say seize the day was English for carpe diem. Yes. Yes, you could.  Well, we hope you all enjoyed the show   Hope it was not anti-climatic   Now there's something we want you to know   And we don't want to sound didactic   But if there's one thing we can say   I know it sounds a bit clichÃ©   There's no such thing as just an ordinary day   And you don't have to build a rollercoaster   To find your own way to make the most of these days of summer   And dance to the beat of a different drummer   Just grab those opportunities when you see 'em   'Cause every day's a brand new day   You gotta carpe diem   Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  Okay, people, that was fabulous! But I wanna work on one thing. Ladies and gentlemen, world renowned choreographer, Kenny Ortega! Thanks, Phineas. All right, everyone, in this last chorus, let's really hit that straight arm, like this. Okay? Straight arm on both sides. Alright now, performance level. Five, six, seven, eight.  And you don't have to build a rollercoaster   To find your own way to make the most of   Every minute   No more waiting for the right time, you're in it   Just grab those opportunities when you see 'em   'Cause every day's a brand new day   Baby, carpe diem   Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.

No, Carl, the moment is gone. Sir I got cut off twice already. But, sir, you're very good. I am? Yes, sir. I've heard you practice. Well, I have been practicing. Yes, sir.

"by ashirogi27 Imagine you're a teenager You place your shiny, hard-earned nickel into the coin slot. Think of it. All your favorite bands playing all their greatest hits at any time you want. You make your selection, guiding your chosen 45-RPM disc onto the magical turning table, center stage. Then, with the gentle noise, an arm holding the needle lowers itself and finds its way into the groove. You turn around, knowing the song you've chosen more than anything else twirls the world what you're all about! (Song: Jammie Lad)  I'm a jammie lad   I've got the smashing bird   And my trousers are mobbed and groovy  Hmm This leads directly to the 1960's. Oh, well, time to get this beaut to the antique shop. Ta, boys! All your favorites bands playing all their greatest hits any time you want. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. We have a situation. The royal Princess Baldegunde from Drusselstein is in town. She's here to give the Drusselsteinian Favorite Son award to Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz during the unveiling of the new Danville Opera House. We assume Dr. Doofenshmirtz will do something to disrupt the ceremony. He's been buying up all the claw machines in the Tri-State Area. We don't know exactly what his plan is, but do the math. Princess, Opera House, claw machines, stuffed animal. You put that together and you get a Claw-Princess-Animal Uh, Stuffed-Claw-Houseâ Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.. Or aâ Or a Singing Animal Clawâ A Singing Claw Clawpera House Clawing Stuffy Stuffness! Clawing House with aâ It's terrifying. You must stop Doofenshmirtz and make sure the princess is safe. We don't actually have a photo of her, but whatever, she's a 15 year-old girl, they all pretty much look alike. Carl, put up a picture of a 15 year-old girl! Uh, now put a crown on her. There! There's your princess. Oh wait, sir, I found a picture of the actual princess. All right, put it up there. Oh! Wow, what are the odds? Well, it is a cartoon, sir. What did I tell you about breaking the fourth wall, Carl? Sorry, sir. At 2 o'clock, you have Gala Ball. At 2:30, you have Premiere Gala. At 3 o'clock, you have Gala-Gala Oxen Free. Yes, yes. But when do we make shopping at fun American mall time? Well, we have eleven minutes until gala gathering, so maybe we make six minutes for American shopping at mall. Oh, thank you, Royal Fake Daddy Chaperone Servant Guiserblint! Ah, Stacy, I tell my mom I'm heading to the mall to get some makeup and she hands me a list of other stuff I have to get. Why do I have to do everything? Shop at the mall, bust my brothers. Technically, you don't have to bust your brothers. Oh, really, Stacy? Well, they're not gonna bust themselves! Oh, great! A sale. Now guess who's gonna have to go in there and try stuff on? Call you later, Stace. Since I have to do everything! You are my doppelgÃ¤nger! Your doppel-who? My mythological exact twin! My double who walks Earth same as me. Whoa! Cool! I wonder if I have a doppelgÃ¤nger, too. Yes, that is me. We are for each other doppelgÃ¤ngers. Wait a second. Does this mean if we accidentally touch, we'll rip apart the very fabric of the universe? Maybe. We live! I am Princess Baldegunde of Drusselstein. And I am Candace of Flynn. We should hang out today and make freaking out on unsuspecting passersby. I'd love to, but I gotta finish shopping and get back to my brothers who are making some impossible thing in the backyard. You make life like American teenage girls on TV! For me, I do nothing, because everything is done for me at clap of hands. Yes, Your Highness? No, no, sorry. You may go. I may go. See? I never get to do anything for myself. And I have to do everything for myself. I got it! Let's go to the laundromat and fill the dryers with cheese! What? No! Let us trade lives. Oh, I thought for sure on same page, we were. Hm. Come, Candace of Flynn. Oh, trade lives! Yeah, good. Wow! Never before has such cheap fabric touched royal skin. This is like I'm wearing a cloud of butter. Say, don't princesses need to know a lot of manners and stuff? Nope. All you need is this. They come! Remember, clap clap. Good luck. Did you enjoy your six minutes in the mall, Your Royal Highness? Yes I am. Bring me a glass of water and a cracker. Okay Bring me an X-ray of a kangaroo with three legs. No, no. The kangaroo has three legs. Ah! There you go. I guess we could send out invitations, but that's the good thing about a giant jukebox. You build it, the party comes to you. Pinnayus and Ferb! Just look at you two! You two are my younger brothers! And of course, I am Candace, your big sister, am I not? Yes Yes is correct! And shall we play together today, yes? Hm, sure. We're gonna construct a giant jukebox here in the backyard. Oh, goody! Giant construction project is my most favorite game! Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? Today, we shall make play here in the backyard as constructor persons. And we shall make a giant-sized jukebox. It is a most joyful way for all of us to make play, is it not? I'm outta here.  Doofenshmirtz in a blimp again  Ah, Perry the Platypus. It's ironic that you look like a stuffed animal in one of those claw machine games. And by ironic I mean totally flat-out ronic. And speaking of claw machines, I've gathered up all the arcade claw machines in the Tri-State Area to make one giant Super Claw inator. My fascination with these started when I was just a little boy. Back in Gimmelshtump, one day, when I was walking through the Claw Machine District, something caught my eye. In this machine that usually just has rocks in it, there was an actual teddy bear! Fortunately, I had with me my allowance, which I'd been saving for a whole year. One three-cent coin. I dropped it into a slot, then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! Odds were against me, but then it happened! The miracle! The claw grabbed the stuffed animal, it was mine! Then, like a knight of yore, I gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother, Roger. I was crushed as I watched Roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. And then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother, claiming both as his own, andâ Effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic. So now, with my giant claw, I will wreak vengeance on my brother, and take away his giant Opera House! So, what's new with you? And where would you like your bucket of gold? Yeah, just put it there at the end. Okay, you can go now. Wow, I've been given all this power and how I've chosen to use it is to run through gold coins barefoot. I'm a genius! Okay, now I hammer. Hammer? Hammer? Your legs do not appear to be broken. You are right! Broken, they are not! I can be fetching hammer for myself, can I not? Here I go! Never so much fun have I had! Wow! Candace really seems to be enjoying herself today. And she seems to have acquired an upper-class Drusselsteinian speech pattern. Yeah. Let's just go with it.  Going to the Opera House   Woot!   Woot!  C'mon, Perry, sing along! W-W-Wait. What are you doing? Whoa! Got to reach controls! Woot! Woot! See? Everything works with the woots. Hey, leâ L-Let go of that! Woot! Woot! See, I'm tellin' you. And the giant jukebox is done! Now all we need to do is fill it with music. Hello, cute blonde boy with guitar. Hey, cute redhead talking funny. See ya after the set. Her Majesty would like to run through gold with no shoes? Nah. Been there, done that. Wow. Absolute power bores absolutely. Hello? Candace? I need to ask you question. How is pronounced the name of cute blond boy with guitar? What cute blond boy? The one with band! Is it Jer-eh-mee or Jer-me? It's pronounced ""stay away from him!"" Hello? Hello?! Okay, that tears it! That's enough princess for today! I want my life back! Your Majesty! City Hall Opera Gala is about to begin! Stay away from Jeremy! Is this a giant jukebox? Have you told Mom yet? I should be telling of the Mother? Wait, stay right here! I'll be right back! Your Highness! Your Highness! Ceremony is about to start! We go now! You're messing up my trajectory! Mom! Mom! Giant jukebox! Come on, come on! You missed it. Giant jukebox, doppelgÃ¤nger, everything, all gone. Cool. To celebrate ze linking of the two cultures and ze lifetime achievements of Roger Doofenshmirtz, vill you please join me in velcoming Princess Baldegunde of Drusselstein! Like Roger Doofenshmirtz, I grew up in a very different country. Perry the Platypus, stop it! I-I have to put down this jukebox so I can pick up the Opera House! I did it! Iâ Not strictly according to plan, but Iâ Still, I have disrupted the ceremony. Woot! Woot! See? Everything works with the woot-woots. It is a jukebox! It is our jukebox! Oh, this is most wonderful! Citizens of Danville, I had been come here today to give you long boring speech, but no longer. Instead, I give to you twenty-five American cents! Time for everybody to make play as happy dancing persons! Here is Cute Blonde Boy with Guitar! (Song: Do Nothing Day) Here we go!  Beautiful, kind and gentle   And loving and softness and sweetness and candy and gum  A giant jukebox!  Peppermint and pink flowers  They built it! Let's bring the party to them!  And bunnies and happy songs we can all hum!  Oh! Oh, no!  Draw a smiley face on the sun  Everyone is enjoying themselves! Even Roger! Oh, my plan has failed!  It's fun  Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  Slow down and look around you   Throw yourâ  Oh, there you are, Perry! I'm glad you weren't in the jukebox, wherever that went."
"by ashirogi27 Well, I think that's it. You have both our cell-phone numbers, all emergency contacts, and the number of the hotel we'll be staying in at the antique shower-head convention. What do you plan on doing tonight? I thought I'd have a few friends over, like Stacy and Jenny. Is that okay? Sure! But no wild parties. Well, I guess I'll have to cancel the death metal band and the fire dancers. I kid! Lawrence, you're not wearing that on the plane. I'm not on the plane yet. We'll be back this time tomorrow. Mom and Dad, your cab is here. Bye, hon! You're in charge. Mind your sister, boys. Bye! Hey, Stace. What are you doing tonight? You and Jenny want to come over and just hang out? Do you need any help with entertaining or snacks? Listen, under no circumstances do I want you to do anything crazy. Or anything at all for that matter. Just go up to your room and out of my hair. Vamoose. You sure? We can make a nacho launcher, or a dip fountain. No. How about a wasabi slide? No. Sorry about that, Stace. Come over aroundâ Oh wait, I have another call. Hello? How about a mustard-go-round? Phineas! Okay. Hey, where's Perry? Come in, Agent P. We've been having trouble with our tubes getting mixed up with the city dump system. We can't be 100% sure where you'll end up. Perry the Platypus? Where are you, Agent P? Great googly moogly! Well, hang tight, I'll give you your mission. Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. He's been seen snooping around the neighborhood apartment building. Around the neighborhood apartment building. Yes, Iâ Yes, I've been doing that. He's also been buying electrical equipment, Buying electrical equipmentâ Uh checking and checking movie starting times online. movie starting times online! Let me tell it! I wanna tell it! I want to tell it! Doofenshmirtz La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. There isâ Waitâ Uh Ugh! So, get him, Agent P! And good luck. Thank you. Not you. Too late, I'm lucky now. You like that? I call it a trap-a-lounger, because it's loungy and trappy all at the same time. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Hoo! I took the liberty of bringing some DVDs for our party viewing pleasure. Uh, it's not a party. For our not-a-party viewing pleasure. Candace, this is my cousin, Sara. Hello. She's visiting for the weekend. Is it okay if she hangs out with us, too? Well, my mom said I could have a couple people over. Sure, come on in. Hey, aren't you Phineas and Ferb's sister? That must be awesome for you. Yeah. You'd think so, wouldn't ya? So my mom told me to clean up my room and I didn't have any shoes on, so I started picking stuff up with my feet, and I turned it into a game with myself, like, ""Can I Clean Up My Whole Room With My Feet?"" And I did. Oh, it's Coltrane. Hello? Coltrane and Jeremy's gig got cancelled. Can they come over? Over here? Uh, Coltrane and Jeremy? Hey, what's two more? Bring it! Awesome! So, let me tell you my evil scheme. Not too long ago, I used to sit right over there and watch free movies on the drive-in movie screen across the street. 'Course, I didn't get the sound, so I'd make up my own dialogue. It was fun. ""Sheila, I love you, but now I have to defuse this bomb."" See? Good stuff! Gripping! But, now look! They built a giant condominium blocking my view. I tried to make up dialogue for it. ""I'm a condominium. I'm just standing there."" See? T-Thereâ Where's the fun in that? It's always the same. ""I'm a building."" There's no story. And I know what you're thinking, why not just move my chair over to that window over there with the unblocked view? Well, then I'd have to move this little table, too, and theâ And the lamp, and this is the only electrical outlet. Itâ It seems easier to get rid of the building. So, that is why I invented this the Go-Away-inator! One blast of this ray, and that building and everyone in it, will instantly be transported somewhere else. Here on this wheel, I've written many undesirable locations. With one pull of this string, a site is randomly chosen, and good-bye low-rent condo, hello Hollywood high-budgets! Hey, Candace. Thanks for having us over to your party. Oh, it's not a party, and I'm glad you and your entire band could make it over. We wrote a new song. I'd love to test it out on you guys. Oh Ooh Uh A-As long as we agree that it's just a test. This isn't a party with a band playing. It's just a small get together, and you're just gonna lightly strum a test song. (Song: Breath)  It's funny how words   Are never what's heard  Hey, we were just walking by and heard the music.  'Cause still I don't know what you're thinking  Isn't this Phineas and Ferb's house? Well, yes, butâ Awesome!  We park and we talk  Hey, Phineas and Ferb are having a party!  We talk and we talk  But, but, butâ Hold on  And I get this feeling I'm sinking  I-It's just an intimate get together. Hey, Phineas and Ferb! Hey, guys!  Press play and record at the same time  A party! It's not a party.  And capture us both so uneasy  This is awesome! Hey  But all in good time  When we get our own place, it'll be like this everyday.  On eternity's dime  Let's find Candace.  I'll lose this breath I've been holding  No, no!  Yeah  No, keep it down.  Cupid's in knots  Just going to turn it down a little.  All our nerves are shot   La, la, la  I'll lose this breath I've been holding  Hey, Candace. Cool party. It's not a party, it's an intimate get-together. Hey, Candace. Thanks so much for hosting this. Oh, sure. Rock on What are you looking at? If you want to stay down here, sit over there and stay out of the way. Okay. Pork Rinds, coming your way! Uh, snacks should not be airborne! Any minute now, Perry the Platypus, that building will be relocated and I can enjoy my view! It just needs to warm up. Let's savor this moment. Right now, my plan is working, you're trapped, and the Inator is warming up. Yes, these are the good moments, Perry the Platypus. These are the good moments. Is this the Phineas and Ferb party? Sure is. I brought Pork Rinds. More pork rinds! I didn't invite these people. Who are they? Now what? Yeah! Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip! Chip! What's going on here? Yeah! Stop encouraging them! We're just eating chips at the party. Phineas and Ferb parties rule! Yeah! It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. What was that? Put that down. Pardon me. Use a napkin! What's my Science teacher doing here? I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party!

It's not a party, it's an intimate get together! Candace party! Candace party! Shut up! Candace party! Candace party! Lawrence, there's something weird going on at home. I'm afraid we're gonna have to cancel our trip and head right back. Oh Oh, would you like to yank my chain? Yes. Yes, I would. Any minute now, my Inator will be all warmed up. I should've gone solid state, but this has got the tubes. It's old-school, Perry theâ Hey, you've escaped! Everybody, out the back way! Let's go! Out, out, out!

Candace party! Why aren't they leaving? Candace party! Candace party! They're here! It's too late, Perry the Platypus, I've pulled the string! Any second, these condos will disappear, and I will watch free movies. And you can't do a thing about it. The entire party has disappeared! Of course! The same divine intervention that takes things away for you guys took the party away for me! I'm saved! I wonder where the party went. Someplace nice, I hope. Well, obviously, something's amiss. Huh, let's review. The Go-Away-inator which missed the condo, should have zapped whatever it hit to an undesirable location. Let me check my undesirable location wheel. Stonehenge, Burbank my pants? Why would I even write that there? Oh, I see, I got it confused with my dry-cleaning wheel. Oh, okay, but Why do I have a dry-cleaning wheel? ""I am a dry-cleaning wheel. Why do I exist?"" Perry the Platypus, be a mensch and push the reverse button, would you? Mom and Dad are here! Hello, Mother, Father. What are you doing back so soon? I hope everything's okay. Candace party! Candace party! Candace party! There's a party behind me, isn't there? Candace, I trusted you! I can't believe you threw a party! I didn't throw a party! Well, then, whose party is it? Candace party! Candace party! Young lady, you are so busted! Tell your friends to go straight home, and then go straight up to your room! Awww! Oh, man! Hey, everybody, the Candace party is over. Awww! Candace, if it makes you feel any better, you accidentally threw the most outrageous party of the summer! Thanks, guys. I'll see you in a week. Oh, there you are, Perry. You missed Candace's party. Totally, a platypus would have put it over the edge. Oh, Vanessa, thank goodness you're here! A platypus has tied me up in my own pants! How did my life get to the point where that is not a strange sentence to me? ""I'm your daughter. I will stop being sarcastic and untie you.""  Don't spill your drink   Don't drop your food   Don't make the music in the house go boom   Hey, don't use my mom's good scissors   And please stay out of my room   Take your feet off the chair   No running in the house   Put a coaster under that drink   Hey, these tchotchkes aren't for juggling   And that's a toilet, not a sink!

We were going to go for our Desert Trekking patch today, but now it's raining. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! You see, I know Jeremy likes me, but I don't know why he likes me. And if I find out what it is that he likes about me, I can make sure I don't change that about myself. Because what if I stop doing whatever that he likes? And then he stops liking me because I'm not doing it anymore. Well, maybe he just likes hearing you talk. Huh? Hey, where's Perry? It's not like Agent P to missâ Whoop! Carl, play that back!

Well, maybe at a reasonable cost. We I mean, we don't wanna blow the whole budget on this one scheme, do we? Run it again, sir? I'll get the popcorn! Wow, that was fast!

Okay, according to the Fireside Girl handbook, we can find water in cacti. Now, don't make it too easy! Hi, Candace. What do you say to a little picnic? You know, indoors. Neat! We can't let a little rain put a damper on ourâ Wow! I guess your brothers have been busy, huh? Oh, we should have our picnic in there! Um, um E-Excuse me! Urge to bust so strong, but I need time with Jeremy to find out why he likes me! Gotta resist urge to bust! Must not spoil quality time with boyfriend! Uh, picnic in the dangerous, unauthorized, and highly bust-worthy biosphere? Sounds great! So, we've gotten water from a cactus, witnessed a mirage, and learned the difference between sunstroke and heatstroke. Thanks for that, Adyson. Hey The salamanders quit singing Now, we just need to either collect a sand sample, measure the temperature, or milk a camel. You guys! Wow, I set up this whole thing with lasers and flypaper, falling cages, spinning platforms, on the way to a trapdoor And you just come and slip on a chair, and waste a day's worth of work. Eh. But, it's gonna look great on the Christmas party gag reel! 'Course, it'll just be me at the party, uh Yeah. I need a laugh at the holidays. Anyway, gotcha! Go ahead. Try to climb out of it. It's greased! So, now that you're all comfy cozy, I can introduce you to my Rain-inator! I've been using it to pour millions of gallons of water into these clouds, causing it to rain all over the Tri-State Area! I can't believe nobody's noticed it. It's kind of obvious. Yay! We made it across the desert! Say, Phineas, I don't suppose you could help us out with our Rainforest Navigation patch? No problem, ladies. Ferb? Well, this sure beats all that rain. Not too hot, are you? No! No, not at all! I mean, isn't that what you said you liked about me? That I don't overheat? No. The thing I really like about you isâ Wow, this is incredible! Um Uh, what was that you were saying? I said, ""this is incredible!"" No, before that. I said ""Wow!"" Ugh! Pardon. Sure. Hmm Hey, I think I found a new species ofâ Here, Adyson! Catch this! Swift Water Rescue patch! Bonus! Candace! Yes? Check it out. This umbrella makes a sweet raft. You wanna flow down the river with me? Busting. Boyfriend. Busting. Boyfriend. Busting? Boyfriend! Coming! So, I bet you're wondering why did I cause all this rain. You see, while perusing local garage sales, I came upon a big screen TV from 1985. But when I went to turn it on, it was stuck on the Spanish channel! All it played was crazy variety shows and Mexican soap operas. I really got hooked on one of them, though. El Matador de Amor. It has three simultaneous story lines that interconnect. Genius! Anyway, the last episode was a cliffhanger, in which Esmerelda is going to find out why Juan loves her. At least, I think that's what's going to happen. But, the show got preempted by a soccer game! Oh, I hate soccer! It makes no sense whatsoever! The clock runs up instead of counting down, what is that?! So, with the help of my Rain-inator, I-I rained the game out. And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming. Â¡La Esponja Milagroso! Absorbes In 10 minutes, the show is gonna start, and with you trapped and the Rain-inator at work, nothing will interrupt me! Hey, less pounding back there, okay? I mean, you're lucky I sprang for the clear tube, this way, you can watch too! I mean, it's like your hair was genetically engineered to ensnare those giant fruit bats. And you like that about me? It's certainly interesting, but It's not what I like about you. Ooh, what then? Well, let me put it in a song. (Song: Set the Record Straight)  All throughout history men fall in love with women   You want to know why, well, let's start from the beginning   I've come to set the record straight   I've come to set the record straight   From scientific propagation of the species   To poets and philosophers, your Baudelaires and Nietzsches   I've come to set the record straight   I've come to set the record straight   But if you're asking for specifics   Well this isn't hieroglyphics   If you want to know sincerely   Listen up, I'll tell you clearly   What I like about you is  So You were saying? Oh, yeah.  I've come to set the record straight   I see you still don't get it   But you really shouldn't sweat it   I'll say one more time with feeling   Here's the reason you're appealing   What I like about you is   What I like about you is  Not again!  What I like about you is  Hey, guys! Uh-oh, here comes the fun part! Fun part?! Seriously?! Jungle Navigation patch, complete! Anybody up for a little rock-climbing? Behold, Mount Ferbius! Sorry, Adyson. The salamanders are back Who wants a Concussion First Aid patch? Incoming! Ooh! Hey, look, Candace. I'm making snow angels. I'm wet and I'm freezing cold. Ah, it's not so bad. I mean, we're together, aren't we? Well, yeah Whoops! And being together like this makes me realize what I like about you. What? What?! What's that sound? That could've squished us! That's it! I am gonna bust them! Wait, Candace, look! It's just papier-mÃ¢chÃ©! Good job, everyone. I think we've earned our Rock Climbing patches. Congratulations, ladies. How do you feel about Non-Powered Flight patches? Woo-hoo! C'mon! Yeah! Yeah! Ugh! Ooh! Hey, come back here! I'm gonna bust you two if it's the last thing Iâ El Matador de Amor. It's starting! It's starting! Okay, now, Perry the Platypus, shhh. I-I don't wanna miss anything. Oh, Juan Por lo Tanto su manada gemela, ha sido en Venenado Help me! Hold on, Candace, I'll save you! I gotcha, Candace! Oh, man! I love this umbrella! Hey, kids! You know, Candace, what I was trying to say back there, that Well The thing I like about you isâ Wait! Hold that thought! I'll be right back. Mom! Mom! Backyard! Now! Biosphere! He's getting closer. He's looking into her eyes! He's opening his mouth! He's forming his lips and tongue to articulate the syllables! Tell her, Juan! La razÃ³n porque te amo es Tell her why you love her! La razÃ³n porque te amos es Es Es! Â¡Ahi Van la Pelota! What? No!!! It's right here, Mom! Come on, come on, come on! Hi, Candace! Hmm, I've really got to fix the latch on that gate. Um How is this possible? I took every precaution! I had the Rain-inator, I had you trapped in aâ What theâ? Â¡Maldito seas, Perry el Ornitorrinco! Man, this is gonna cost me a fortune on my water bill. So, did you ever find out why Jeremy likes you? Jeremy! Now, please continue your thought. Tell me why you like me! You bet. The reason that I like you is Â¡Viene, le pega! Â¡GOOOOOOOL!"
"by ashirogi27 Oh, Stacy, isn't Jeremy's hair the perfect shade of gold? Uh-huh. And isn't it cute when he gets that little wrinkle on the end of his nose? Uh-huh. And you know when heâ Uh-huh. Stacy! Did you make a digital sound file of yourself saying ""uh-huh"" to fool me into thinking you're listening to me again? Uh-uh. Stacy, pick up! Well, do you blame me? ""Oh, Jeremy and I went to the movies."" ""Jeremy's house smells like gingerbread."" ""Ever notice Jeremy's mole is shaped like an adorable puppy?"" I'm starting to feel like the only reason you hang out with me is to talk about Jeremy! Stacy, Iâ I miss you, Candace! I miss when we would spend time together, just the two of us. And I bet you didn't remember that today is the Danville Street Fair. Stacy, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna cancel with Jeremy today. Meet me at the cafe in a half an hour and we'll hit the Street Fair afterwards. It'll be just the two of us. I promise. Really? Great! But no Jeremy anything! Okay? If I even hear his name I promise I won't break this promise. See you in a bit! Now, to call Jeremy. Wait! Why call him, when I can tell him I can't see him today in person? This is it, Isabella. The day you're going to insist on spending some time alone with Phineas! I can do this! What'cha doin'? Hey, Isabella. We're building a giant robot dog. Like when we made that title sequence! Hmm, I'd rather give a monkey a shower. So, uh Phineas, I was wondering if maybe after this, you'd like to go to the premiere of the new Stumbleberry Finkbat movie. Huh? Oh, sure. Sounds cool. I'd like to go to that. Uh, sorry, Iâ I only have one extra ticket, and It's sold out. So, I thought maybe Phineas and I would goâ Not to necessarily excludeâ Yeah, I can go after we finish up here. Done with the wiring, Ferb? Looking good. Hey, where's Perry? Comfortable, Perry the Platypus? I made that platy-rack so that every limb is accounted for. So, what's it all about? You see, there were only two things that made my miserable childhood bearable. My giant pet cockroach, Hoarfrost and garlic ice cream. I loved these two things so much, I wondered if combining them would exponentially increase my enjoyment of them. So, introducing my Combine-inator! With my Combine-inator, I was finally able to make the Triple Scoop Garlic Roach Cone! So cold Yeah. Ow So, anyway, I remembered this little island timeshare that I bought on a free trip to Vegas. And I realized that if I were to combine my tiny island with the Capital of the Tri-State Area, like so Ta-da! Then, legally, under a local property laws, I would be sovereign ruler of the Tri-State Area! A-As long as I file the appropriate paperwork and get it in by the end of business today. So, I can declare eminent domain before the timeshare revert to the co-owners, making them the veto rulers of the Tri-State Area. It's fool-proof, really. Oh, hello, Candace. Hey, Mrs. Johnson. Is Jeremy in? Come on in. He's right over there. Is he okay? Oh, sure. He was just up all night working the graveyard shift at Slushy Dawg after a full-day shift. Then when he came home, he ate an entire turkey, drank a gallon of warm milk and just passed out on the sofa. Bless him. I'd be surprised if he woke up before next Thursday. Good luck getting any conversation out of him, sweetie. Thanks. Aw, look how cute he is when he's sleeping. Psst. Jeremy? Alright, you asked for it! I hereby dedicate this giant prismâ so, Stacy and I just need a little girl time, and that's someâ Okay That was weird. Uh, so, you'll have to take a rain check, okay? We're attached! Stacy's gonna kill me! Phineas and Ferb! Tail-wag solenoids, check. Slipper-chewing radio controlled by cuspids, check. Hey, Phineas. What'cha still doin'? Just going through a last minute checklist, now that the dog is done. Oh! Does that mean we can, uh go to the movies? Hey, Ferb! Let's fire this puppy up! I don't see why not. Great! We can still catch the matinee! Phineas! What have you done?! Well, we made this giant roboticâ Just look at us! We are fused together! See?! I don't care what kind of freaky project you guys are doing! Just get us unstuck! We could remove you to a sterile environment and get a board certified surgeon to cleanly, and safely perform a gerabotamy. We could tie each of you to a monster truck, and drive in opposite directions. Worst case scenario, someone loses a torso. Or, we can use the molecular separator. That thing you used to separate me from me? Yeah, it worked before. You know, in a completely different set of circumstances. Great! You guys get on it. Heh. Hey, Stacy. Hey, BFF, just checking on your ETA. About thatâ Oh, no! You'd better not be ditching me to hang out with Jeremy again! What? On Street Fair day? Haha! No way, sister! I'll be there, and I'll be there early. Ah-haha, yeah. Alone. Okay? Okay. Oh, crud. Make that molecular whatever and meet me at the coffee shop! Yeah, but the movie almost startedâ And don't be late! This is your fault! I don't know what she's talking about, Ferb. But I do know the next thing we're gonna do today! Let's get started on that separator. So here we are, just the two of us at a stalemate. Each looking for something to turn the tide, but what will it be? Cupcakes? Oop! Watch this! Prepare to face the wrath of Normenshmirtz! You can't get away from me now! Don't you mean us? Hey, don't step on my moment. Phineas and Ferb better find a fix for thisâ Oh! Hey, girlfriend! Oh, hey, Stace! Two iced teas, please. So, Candace. Sorry I was so hard on you before. I know you and Jeremy aren't together all the time. Oh, no, really, i-it's okay. It's nice to have a little space from him. Oh, look, our drinks. Two iced teas. Thanks. So, I hear there's a ton of vintage clothing stalls at the Street Fair this year. Yeah. I'm looking for some really coolâ Wow, this table's really lumpy. Oh, yeah. Lumpy tables. It's the new hip thing. It's so European. Uh Uh  Do the moan, moan!   Yeah, do the moan!  Come on, Stace, don't you love that song?  Do the moan!  Hey, isn't that the guy from that movie? What? Where? I don't see him! What guy?  Lullaby and goodnight   Da-da-da-da  I don't see anyone. That's because he's gone! Candace, why are you acting so nervous? I'm not mad anymore. I'm going to go pay for our drinks. Okay. Ready? Candace, why are you wearing that coat? Brr That iced tea gave me a chill. Okay. Let's go, but you're walking behind me. Okie-doke! Phineas, will you hurry? We're heading to the Street Fair already. I think we're in trouble. Sure. Now it's we. Ta-da! Representing the molecular separator! I can't believe how fast we rebuilt this, Ferb. Of course breaking the immutable laws of physics is always easier the second time around. Great! Does that mean we can go to the movies now? Sure does. The movie theatre is right next to the Street Fair. All we've got to do is get this to Candace, and separate her from Jeremy. Well, what are we waiting for? I believe we're waiting for Rover to put the molecular separator down. Hey! Drop it, boy! This would've never happened if we'd given a monkey a shower. (Song: Just the Two of Us) I'm just sayin'.  I'm so happy whenever   You and I are together   When it's just the two of us hanging around   (Around, around)   Don't need a jazz trio or a string quartet   (String quartet)   'Cause you and I are the perfect duet   (Duet)   When we get together we make such a beautiful sound   Yeah   We don't need nobody else   'Cause we can have fun all by ourselves   It's just the two, it's just the two of us today   It's just the two, it's just the two of us today   It's just the two, it's just the two of us   And I always want it to stay   Just the two of us  Hey! That hurt! He's armed! With my arm! No! Ooh! Balsa wood? It was on sale. It's locked into overload. Would you like a nice, frosty beverage? Hey, that's private! Split up, guys. Maybe we can corner him. A-ha! A-ha! He's coming your way! I'm running out of hiding places. Hey! I found all kinds of cute things! Move over, I'm going to try them on. No! I I can see they fit you perfectly. Candace! Are you karate-chopping me?! What's going on? Here, boy! Go, Ferb! No! No! No! How is everyone doing that? Hey, I can feel my knees again! I'm sorry. So cold Okay, listen, Stacy. There was this blast, and I was sitting next to Jeremy, and somehow we gotâ Jeremy, Jeremy, Jeremy. Tell me later, I want to try this on. Ugh. Stacy, honest. I really wanted to spend the day with you butâ Butâ Butâ? And we wereâ Uh Never mind. Candace? Jeremy! I know this is a weird question, but do you have any idea how I got here? Jeremy, don't worry, I promise I'll explain everything later. But right now you've gotta get out of here. I'll call you later. I mean tomorrow. By the way, the best part was when you used him as a table. Busted! So, we, uh got everything sorted out now. Yeah. Want to catch that movie? Oh, Phineas Okay, bro. I guess I'll see you back at the house. Oh. My. Gosh. Hey! Does this mean we can all go now? Yes. Yes, it does.  We don't need nobody else   'Cause we can have fun all by ourselves   It's just the two, it's just the two of us today   It's just the two, it's just the two of us today   It's just the two, it's just the two of us   And I always want it to stay   Just the two of us"
"by ashirogi27 Today, on the Uncovery Channel, we'll talk about the fastest land animal in the world. Possessed of incredible speed, the cheetah can outrun almost anything alive. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna build fast shoes, so we can run like a cheetah! And I don't care. Because today, I'm going to Jeremy's family picnic in the park. I will be spending the whole day with my boyfriend and his extended family. And they are all going to love me, because today, I am a composed Candace. Confident, cool, and relaxed. Candace Stop judging me! Ready to head to the library? Huh? You volunteered to read to the kids' book club today, while I help reorganize cookbooks. Oh, I forgot all about that! That's so unlike me! I never forget a promise! Hello? Candace! We're about to go on! Where are you?! Candace? Candace? Are you there? Wrong number. We're leaving in fifteen. Heh. Yeah. I-I've got nothing better to do. What about that Jeremy thing? Don't you have a catchphrase to say or something? What is she talking about? Hey, have you seen Perry around? 'Cause I haven't. Good morning, Agent P. It's come to our attention that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has missed a few of his mortgage payments. He must be funneling all that money into something really evil, otherwise, he'd ask his ex-wife for a loan. She's loaded, you know. Ka-ching! So, get over there and find out what's going on. A cheetah's body is built to run at amazing speeds. By carefully analyzing our own bodies' running mechanics, we can now design and build our very own super shoes. Based on the pseudoscience of reflexology, these shoes will trigger pressure points in our feet, making us exponentially faster. I'm double-booked! If you count Stacy, I'm triple-booked! Oh, darn my endlessly giving nature! Woo-hoo! Whaâ? Yeah! Hi, Candace! You know, Ferb, with these super shoes on, we can almost be in two places at one time. Let's go see what these babies can really do. Two places at once? Candace, ready to head to the library? Uh That's okay, Mom. I think I'll walk. Okay. See you there. Or maybe I'll run.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Chocolate chip cookie? They're freshly baked. Get your bids in soon. We don't expect this place to last long. Ooh, are those floors original? So just because I miss a few payments, you're selling my building? A-And where am I supposed to get that much money on short notice? I'm sorry, Mr. Doofschmidt, those are the terms of your loan. The name is Doofenshmirtz! Likeâ Like in Doofenshmirtz! Now what? Oh, it's you. I'm sorry, Perry the Platypus, I'm going to have to take a rain check. You see, I'm having a bit of a financial crisis and I'm afraid I won't have time for our evil scheme today. Yep. Next time we fight, it could be in a cardboard box, 'cause that's where I'll be living. Can't you see I'm trying to wallow? What? That? Oh, it's a nice picture of Charlene, isn't it? Butâ I-I don't think I could get much cash for it. I mean, who wants a pictureâ Oh, you mean call her and ask her for money? Never! You know what she'll say if I call? She'll say, ""I told you so!"" And you know why? Because she told me so! She said, ""Don't get the gargoyles, Heinz!"" But, what does she know? Gargoyles are a good investment. Name a cheap building with gargoyles. No way am I asking her for money! I-I-Iâ I'll just, uh make this place unsellable! Then they'll have to let me stay here no matter how broke I am! Psst! Indian burial ground. True story. Wow! These things are great! Much better than those completely unstable prototypes we made earlier. What a ripoff! These things areâ Well, my daughter was supposed toâ Oh! Kids, this is Candace. Good luck. I'm off to file some cookbooks. Alright, today's book is Smorky the Giant Rabbit's Family Picnic.

Okay, but hurry. The games are the best part of the picnic. It's working! Falooby blib dingo traloopoo-bul. Good. Everything okay, Candace? You know, you really shouldn't have drinks in the library. Yeah, it's all this reading. Makes my throat dry. Oh, that's sweet. I think I'll watch for a while. Oh, you don't have to. ""Smorky knew that it was wrong to steal the pie, but it looked so delicious. He knew his friend had worked hard to make the pie and bake the pie.

She sort of wandered off about 20 years ago. We don't really talk about it much. Annabelle! Wheelbarrows at the ready! Are you sure you wouldn't rather be the legs? You'd be surprised how strong my arms are. Don't hold back. I don't think I can. Hey, we won. You might want to visit the washroom, honey. You've got a little something right there. The washroom! And that's where it goes when you flush. What an active imagination you have, sweetie! Well, I think I'll leave these adorable little ragamuffins in your capable hands, Candace.

"by ashirogi27 Wow, Phineas, it's really beautiful up here! Yes! That was very kind of you to invite us to your grandparents' house. No fair! That almost hit me! Life's not fair. Earlier today I just missed hitting this kid with a basketball. Hey, Candace. What are you up to today? Well, I'll probably try to bust you guys, again! And fail, again! And add another link on my summer-long chain of disappointment and regrets. How about that, Ferb, Candace already knows what she's gonna do today! So, uh How's the antique business? Oh, it's just fine. You know, they have a saying in the antique business. Hm, what is it? What is what? The saying. That you use in the antique business. Oh, I don't use it. But there is one. Hi, Dad! Hi, Grandpa! We're not interrupting, are we? No, no! No, come in, boys. Ferb and I were just talking about the time you build the balloon and won the most famous balloon race in history. Tell us that story again? Well, I went out to the barn, I built a balloon and I won the most famous balloon race in history. Wow! He makes history come alive. Come on, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. If you need us, we'll be out in the barn! Cool! Just look at all this great stuff. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P! After extensive research and computer data analysis, we have concluded that the Tri-State Area is experiencing an unprecedented shortage of eggs. We need you to investigate. Good luck, Agent P. You there! Weren't you listening? Go make some eggs! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop! You might wanna use the sugar, unless you want salty lemonade! Oh, I can't wait to get new contacts. I'm as blind as a bat without them. Here, use my spare set of glasses. Wow, now everything is a different kind of blurry. Hey, stranger. Come on in. Everyone, you remember Glenda? Of course! Candace, Glenda was the first female train conductor in the entire Tri-State Area! But alas, the train is being decommissioned. And today is Glenda's last trip. And you know what? I'm gonna take her up Gearheart Summit. But nobody has ever taken a train up Gearheart Summit. It's too steep! Well, that's what they say, but I'm not one to give up! It's just like when you became a conductor. That's right. They told me to give up! But I never give up! I'm not the kind of person to give up! Well, I'm gonna prove that an old train can make it up those tracks. You guys wanna come with me? We should all go. Sounds like fun! Okay! Train leaves the station at ten sharp! See you there! Isn't she something, Candace? That's a woman who would never give up! Give up! Blah blah! Give up! Blah blah blah blah blah! Give up! Blah blah blah! Give up! It's so simple! I don't know how I didn't think about it before! I'll give up! (Song: Give Up)  It's not bad to have goals per se   When your teacher, coach, and counselor ask   Cold hard reality can get in your way   When you're really not up to the task   Well you've been scheming and spying and screaming and crying   But you know there's still something that you're still not trying   Give up!   You've been trying to sell this so long   Even though there's no one out there buying   Give up!   I know you're tired of the same old song   But it's not really failure if you're not even trying   Give up!   Doo-doo-doo-doo-doot-doo-doo   (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doot-doo-doo)   It's like you're banging your head against the same old wall   Baby, all you got to show is a bruise   (All you got show is a bruise)   Well, it's a crazy thing to do to just keep on repeating   All these actions that will only lead to cranial bleeding   Give up!   It's time for you to throw in the towel   Capitulate and raise the white flag   Give up!   And don't be bitter just because you're a quitter   You can even hold up your head up and brag   That's right, you gave up   She gave up! She gave up!   I gave up!  That's right, I never even suited up, folks!  I gave up!  I threw the baby out with the bathwater!  I gave up!  I forgot the Alamo!  I gave up!  I'm not even going for the bronze!  I gave up!  I'm staying right here, man.  I gave up!  In this hammock. I like it. Aw, it's beautiful, man. Okay, everyone, let's get this race started. Contact! Last one at the top of the mountain is a stinky dish sponge! What'cha doin'? About, five knots. Thought so! I'm doing six! See you at the summit, slowpokes! Hey, we're falling behind! What's happening? Excess weight seems to be hampering our progress. Yeah, we gotta lighten our load. How does dangling me from a rope lighten our load? Eh, it lightens my spirit. Ow! Ow, ow ow! Mountain lion!  Doofenshmirtz vacation condo!  Ah, Perry the Platypus. Well, I guess it serves me right for bringing work on vacation with me. And, there it is. Man, are we in a rut. Anyway, this is my Dodo-Bird-Incubator You know -inator. With this amazing device I can transform any egg to a dodo egg. Once they hatch I will march my terrifying dodo bird army across the Tri-State Area. You know, I-I don't really know what they look like, but they're extinct like dinosaurs, so just imagine! Giant, extinct dinosaur-like monsters laying waste to the city! Ah You know, y-you really picked me up out of my doldrums. Well, we're here and ready to help. What would you like us to do? Just sit back and enjoy the view, the train will do all the work. Do nothing? Got that covered. All aboard! Gearheart Summit, here we come! You'll never make it! You should give up! Yeah, give up! Hoo-hoo! So long boys, and don't forget to clean your rooms! Yes, Mom. It's your fault. Quiet, you! Looks like a dead heat so far. We need to pick up the pace. Alright, I'll get rid of this. I do not know why you even brought the swordfish! It's a marlin. Oh, no. Little help, guys! Ferb. So Candace, you sure seem relaxed. What's up? I'm just taking in the ride and not worrying about what Phineas and Ferb are up to. Well, good for you, honey. 'Cause I've got gin. We're playing Kings Corners. Are we? It's working! It's wonderful! It's amazing! It'sâ It's, uh not quite as terrifying as I'd hoped. How am I supposed to take over the Tri-State Area with a bunch of these? W-Where's the horror, the terror, whereâ Oh, no! Whaâ Y-You'll get to wait in line, Perry the Platypus! First, I gotta deal with this! I mean, this looks like a turkey, it's like Thanksgiving. Oh, no, no! Oh, no, it's exactly like Thanksgiving! Hey, Glenda, how's it going? Mighty fine! You're looking chipper. Oh, yeah. I've been feeling great ever since I decided to heed your advice and give up. Come again? Well, all summer I've been stressing 'bout busting my brothers, but after your speech this morning I've just gave up. And now I'm much more relaxed. So what you got from my speech about how you should never give up is that you should give up? Well, you did say give up a lot. I did say that, didn't I? Uh, Glenda? Glenda! The train is slowing down. So it is. I guess we're out of coal. Oh, well. What? You can't give up! No coal means no steam, and no steam means we can't make up the hill! Eh We gotta do something! We need fuel! Wait! I have an idea that just might work. And don't think I don't know what you're up to. I'll be right back. She's such an active child. Just out of curiosity, what's going to happen to this train after today? It'll be torn apart and sold for scrap. Why? No reason. What are we playing again? Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin' over there? My steering is a little loose, I think thatâ Do you need some help? Well, yeah. Can you hold the wheel while I tighten it? Gladly! Well, that's perfect. Yes. Yes, it is. Check it out! A dodo bird! What's next on the list, Ferb? Frankenstein's brain. Yeah, uh That was in my balloon. Woo-hoo! Yes, we made it! I knew we could, I knew we could, I knew we could! Oh, did you now? Yeah, you can drop the act. I know you didn't forget to bring coal. It's probably on that box you're sitting on. But, lesson learned and as long as I'm no longer giving up, I'm gonna go bust Phineas and Ferb. Thanks! I could have forgot the coal! I'm old! Do you notice anything different here? Oh, yeah! Everything's half off at the gift shop! Here we are! Gearheart Summit. Let's put them down over there, Ferb. Why is it every store sells this outfit? Mom, Mom! Look what Phineas and Ferb are doing! Come quick! Look, look! Right there! You see? You see? Okay, Candace. Oh, hello, boys. What? No! A-ha! Sayonara, dodo! Hey, how did you start that with no opposable thumbs? Mom, look! It's just forced perspective! Look! They're not really here! It's an optical illusion! He's not reallyâ Hi, Candace! How was the train ride? Oh, I give up. Ugh, some vacation this turned out to be. So, you bought a Museum of Biological Oddities, but you didn't get any biological oddities? Huh. What? There it is!"
"by ashirogi27 Another fantastic year older, and this is gonna be the best birthday ever! So, what are we gonna do, Ferb? Ferb? Huh! A note! ""For the celebration of your birthday, just follow these clues to show you the way"". Cool! It's like a birthday adventure. But hey, where's Ferb?  Ferb!  I can't believe it! It's Phineas's birthday, and I still don't know what to get him! What do you get for the boy who can make everything? It's my fault. I should have been thinking about this before, but I've just been so distracted by trying to bust Phineas andâ Wait! What is he up to? TTYL, Stacy! Hey, Ferb! We were just discussing our plans for Phineas's birthday. The circus we ordered won't be arriving until later in the day, but Irving had a great idea for a warm-up. We should make a video compilation of all of Phineas's greatest moments! What? Like on a clip show? Lame. Not where a genius like Phineas is concerned. Watch this. Okay, Ferb. Let's see what we can do about that pesky gravitational pull. After you wrestle the crocodiles, you'll corkscrew through the overpass and free-fall past the flaming high wire to make your last delivery and receive the 50th patch. Wow, a castle! Nice art direction, Ferb. Good thing we had this extra rocket engine, huh? Eat your heart out, Howard Hughes. Behold! A romantic candlelit dinner for two. We're almost finished with our exact replica of the Temple of Angkor Wat. The Phineas-and-Ferb-edge-of-insanity-kiss-your-butt-goodbye-gravity's- a-stone-cold-sucker-nightmare-rail-skate-track-obstacle-course of doom! Will you please tell me what's going on here? We're building an animation studio. That was amazing! The flying car of the future, today, is still pulling a bit to the right. A monster truck! Yeah! Isn't it sweet? The coolest coaster ever! Dun Dun Dun Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun! Why did you not just use the kettle drum? I never learned how to play. Anyway By utilizing my extensive collection of spy cameras, I've got footage of everything Phineas has ever done. But, I haven't had time to edit all of it. Well, withâ You know Filming more. I've divided up all the video into three parts. Each of you take a section, edit your tribute, and we'll meet at the party later. ""This birthday excursion will take you afar, you'll find your next clue where the 2x4s are"". Perry, are you thinking what I'mâ Hey, where's Perry? Okay, now let me to do the talking. Agent P! There's uh something we've been meaning to discuss with you for a while, andâ Well You see, Perry, your job performances recently come up. Butâ But, don't get me wrong, you're doing fine work, it's just that your entrances has been getting a little lackluster lately. We've just come to expect more from you. Uh, roll the footage, Carl! Right away, sir.  You're gonna get a mission   A mission, a mission   A brand-new mission   What's it gonna be?   Go and get your mission   Your mission, your mission   A brand-new mission   We can't wait to see!  What happened to that guy? No pressure, but style counts. Let's, uh Let's give him a few days, and then we should talk to him about his exits. Hi-ya, Isabella. Oh, hi, Candace. What are you doing here? In my house? Oh, just barging around. You know me, big barger. So, what's that? Oh, just a little birthday video I'm editing for Phineas. Then, let's see. We'll be together forever Isabella. But, don't you have anything more, you know, unusual? Of course! Watch this. I saw the best girls of my troop, hungry, patchless, out of uniform. Okay, seriously Whoa. I mean, like Phineas's inventions? Nope, I didn't get any of that footage. Then, you're useless to me. Candace out! Hm I have to talk to her about her exits. Isabella, will you marry me? Ah The magic of digital editing!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  I see you, Perry the Platypus. Now, kick the door Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! I saw you coming on my video surveillance system! Huh, if I had a nickel for every time I trapped you. Come here. Made you carry your own trap! Huh. I thought it would be more than that. I guess I could get a candy bar or something. Anyway, I've been studying all my previous schemes and I figured out why they always seem to fail. Let's see if you can figure out what they all have in common. Look! Behold! The Mime-inator! The Mountain-out-of-a-Molehill-inator! The Aerosol-Propelled Ozone-Deplete-inator! The Metal Destruct-inator! Giant Dog Biscuit-inator! Thank you! Thank you for making my point for me! The Gloom-inator 3000 -inator. My Smell-inator! My Blow-Itself-Up-inator! The Monster-Truck-Away-inator. The Atomic Leaf Blower-inator! The Sandwich Suit Remove-inator! I call it my Turn Everything Evil-inator. See? They all have -inator in the name. That is why they failed. Which is why I named my latest creation, The Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-Inator! You see, I added non to the name, because non means not, so it's a not-an-inator, therefore, it can't not fail. Get it? I mean, it can'tâ Can't fail It'sâ Okay. Itâ Hi, Mom. Where are you, Candace? You promised you'd help frost the cake after you got Phineas's present. Yeah, well I got a little sidetracked preparing the bust of the century. Later today, I'm going to show you something you won't believe! If I have a nickel for every time I've heard that. Mom, you've gotta see this. Mom, they're driving a herd of cattle right through downtown. See, Mom? There! Mom? Mom! Dad! Look at what Phineas and Ferb did to the backyard! See? It's a submarine! Mom! Mom! Mom! Come on, come on! You've gotta see this. Candace, will youâ Mom, you've gotta come home, right away. Phineas and Ferb have T-They build aâ Theâ A thing that That Oh, what's the use? Mom! Look at this! Look at me! Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom! Mom! Giant building! Come on, come on, come on! Mom, you've gotta see this! It's about your car! Mom! Mom! Quick! Mom, look! Before it disappears! Now, where's this giant animation studio? It got up, and it danced away. It what? It got up, and it danced away. Hmm. I guess I can buy a candy bar. Tri-State Plank & Board. Some of our best structures were born here. Phineas Flynn. Is that the birthday boy I hear? Yep. In the flesh. Oh, you and your helmet. Have you seen Ferb today? No But, I did see a guy in a robotic bird-themed super suit shooting eggs out of his wrist. and that was Ferb, wasn't it? It's a safe bet. We used a robotic bird-themed super suit to save City Hall this summer. Aren't you a little young toâ If I had a nickel for every time I've heard that. Aren't you a little young to be a rollercoaster engineer? Aren't you a little young to be a landscape contractor? Aren't you a bit young to be toy designers? Aren't you a little young to be pop stars? Aren't you a little young to be detectives? Aren't you boys a little young to man a fishing vessel? Aren't you a little young to be working in a museum? Aren't you a little young to order all this? Yes. Yes, he is. Sorry, Phineas. He's new. Aren't you kids a little young to be discovering Atlantis? Aren't you a little young to be fans of Love HÃ¤ndel? Aren't you a little young to know about all these old detective shows? Aren't you boys a little young to be restoring a national monument? Yes. Yes, we are. Was I supposed to see something just now? Nah, I was just thinking to myself. It's a clip show. So, where'd you see Ferb? He was right over here. That suit really holds a lot of eggs. Huh. A visual clue! Is that a Slushy Dawg on a stick? Yep, and a fine example of the lost art of egg-rendering. Almost done. You! Step away from the computer! I want to see that video. But Play it! Okay, okay! Phineas and Ferb, I've got you now!  Why do my nostrils whisper to me?  I voted for you, Kevin. Ki-ki-ki-ki-ki! Ki-ki-ki-ki-ki! Ki-ki-ki-ki-ki! We are the Ba-dink-a-dinks! What the heck was that? That is what I said! Sure, give the weird stuff to Baljeet! Who cares if it does not work out of context? Where's the rest? This is all they gave me! Ugh, that leaves Buford. I need better clips. Ah, ""trapped Perry the Platypus."" It's my favorite show! But, you know what, my least favorite show is this. Culture. Square-jawed. Danville Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz. Profiled on, ""Younger Brothers of the Useless."" It's a 12-part mini-series running all day long, nothing but propaganda. He can't really fly, they did that with wires. So that's why I invented the Video-Beam-Hijack-Non-inator Non-inator, mind you, for reasons we've already discussed. With this, I will preempt the biography of my brother so he can't rely on that 14-karat smile and his freakish ability to not be despised. I mean, look at this city, look at all that urban blight that, uh That isn't there anymore, and theâ A-And the public transportation, all Uh, clean and efficient and Huh running on timeâ Ehâ Okay, let's just say I'm gonna let Roger warm up the room for me, then I'll preempt his ridiculous documentary with live video of me announcing my take-over of the Tri-State Area. A-And maybe I'll put on these glasses like he wears. I don't know! What am I, gonna throw away my best stuff on a clip show? Forget it. Now let's light this pop stand. Huh. Could take a while, though. It's gottaâ It's gotta warm up vacuum tubes. This is it. All I need to do is get Buford away from that computer andâ Buford, honey, come over here! Coming, Ma! Ooh, lucky break. Okay, let's see. Howdy, Candace. Enjoying the rodeo? Well, here's the foyer, all-imported marble, by the way. You can stop laughing and pointing, because now it's time forâ Oops.  A-G-L-E-T  Wow! We're really tiny! Here's the bowling alley, pool, telescope Ferb? What do you mean, maze? Hey look, a cloud angel! terracotta army room, JET ENGINE WIND TUNNEL! and, scoring stage with 40-piece orchestra. Buford's first!  Summer, I love summer   Give me that summertime  Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom It's so beautiful! I got it! Today, I will bust my brothers! And this time, I mean it! I've heard that before! Every day the same thing. Is that that girl again? You'll see! Googolplex Mall, home of the original Slushy Dawg. Hey, Jeremy! Want a Slushy Dawg? Sure. Supersuit-generated egg renderings always make me a bit peckish. I bet that's the first time anybody's ever said that. By the way, Ferb left this clue for you. Thanks. I bet you guys have heard a lot of strange sentences over the course of the summer. Boy, I'll say. Can you think of any examples? Nope, not offhand. See ya! Happy birthday! Wait a minute! I just remembered some! Nothing says mother's love like a giant robotic platypus butt. Why am I wearing a turtle on my head? I wanna float around! Like men. Am I sweating milk? Gotta go, Stacy. Good luck with that llama legislation. Run for your lives! It's Gnome-ageddon! Stickiness is the most underrated of all the -nesses I knew I should've gotten the down payment on the elephants. It looks a little like a rhesus monkey wearing a powdered wig. Oh, no. You did not just tell me to hench. What, you think we should have more Bulgarian folk-related elements? I'll be in the dairy section if you want to come yell at some cheese. Dad, you might want to wipe the queen off your face. I, too, feel a certain element of kebab-ism. Definitely the giant floating baby head. I am to metaphor cheese as metaphor cheese is to transitive verb crackers. I just discovered why cows and frogs don't date. Lawn gnome beach party of taffeta. Make a note of that. I'm calling Mom. And I am not using the banana this time! Couldn't see any of that, though, could you? Not a bit. It's a clip show thing. ""I hope you had fun on this scavenger hunt, now head back to the place where we plan all our stunts."" Home, it is! Oh, yeah, we're gettin' there now! Soon I will preempt my brother's documentary marathon with my own live video! And there's not a thing you can do about it, likeâ L-Like all those other times. It's funny, now, I can't make up my mindâ I can't believe you fell for that all fake window trick. How did you get out of that double knot? Hey! That's not itâ it turns you visible agaâ Ow! Oh, well that came out of nowhere. Oh, great. Now I have to make an Outside-In-inator. Perry the Platypus, how did you escape? What's that? Oh! Well, it's already 4:30, I think I'm going to bed. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I shouldn't dwell on it, i-it's just too painful. But I gotta stop living in the past. What? Why did I put that button on theâ Oh, I guess aesthetically, itâ You may have escaped my TV trap, Perry the Platypus, but I'm still going to change your channel! Oh, that one shoots too? Whoo! Who knew? Well, all roads lead to home, I guess. I can't wait to see what they haâ Happy birthday, Phineas! You're the best! Phineas Flynn, welcome to your birthday! Just a few more blocks and I'm gonna bust my brothers for all the stuff that's on this DVD! I got ya! Oh, great. Now it's pointing in the wrong direction. The wrong direction! Ooh, a dollar! Welcome to Danville's new on-the-job video training program. When installing pipes, always make sure the arrows are pointing the wrong direction! The wrong direction! The wrong direction, I tell you! Huh. Huh? I made it! Birds?! What is happening?! That's it! I made it! Iâ Oh, no! A circus? What theâ? Can I have your autograph? Oh, yeah, baby, it's happenin'. Oh, now look what you made me do 40 seconds ago, Perry the Platypus. Now I'm going to have to even out the legs! But first, I'm going to get even with you! I, uhâ Oh, Iâ I-I seem to be out of batteries. Could you wait while I go get the, um Uhâ Perry the Platypus, no! Nowâ Okay, maybe the -inator name wasn't the problem. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! I just feel so bad we missed the video presentation while we were at the bakery. Well, we couldn't very well serve that cake, the way those wild penguins tore it apart, could we? And to think that they were carried away by a freak tornado! Mom! Mom! Mom! Candace, you missed half the party! Triangular bubbles? How'd they ever do that? That's okay, cause this is it-it-it! This is what, Candace? The day I finally win. The day I get what I've been after all summer long! Oh, that. Because today, I have this! What's that? This? Oh, this is only Thank you, thank you, everyone! Hold on, honey. I think Phineas is going to speak. I just have to say, I'm a lucky guy. I mean, so far, this has been a rockin' great summer! I've sure had plenty of fun. But it's not about satisfying your personal desires. It's about all of you. Being surrounded by the best family and the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. All the people I love, Ah and who love me right back. Oh Today was a great day. The best day ever! I can't do it! Not on his birthday! Oh, what kind of person am I? Oh, Candace. You're a great person! Why, if I had a nickel for every time you did something nice for me Well, I wouldn't know what to do with that much money! But I didn't even get you aâ Wait a minute. Is that? It is! A left-handed flange tuner! I've been looking for one of those forever! You've beenâ Huh? They're impossible to find!

"by ashirogi27 Oh, rapture! This is my favorite part of the Danville Harbor Day's festival! The annual shark reenactment. Let's checketh it out. ""Checketh it out?"" Really? I stand by my Old English. Oh, look, they're doing the song! (Song: Shark of Danville Harbor)  Won't you gather round and hear a tale of the shark of Danville harbor   Who terrorized our people   Can you just imagine this?   If it's sharks you want to know about   You're bound to end up smarter   'Cause though technically a vertebrate   They're cartilaginous   The monster came upon us   And its eyes were black as coal   His jaws so big that we could see his molars and incisors   He came at us and of our bladders   We did lose control   Then he ate a politician and a curriculum adviser   He cornered us in Miller's Cove   We thought that we were dead   We've never seen his like, remember   This was way before TV   We lost control again, there were a long line for the head  Open up!  But the woman folk banged pots and pans and drove him out to sea   Yes, the woman folk banged pots and pans and drove him out to sea!  And that is why we celebrate Harbor Day every year with a reenactment. Here cometh the shark. Look at me, I'm a shark! I can poop in the ocean! But you are not going to, right? Keep pushing, dweeb. Wow. They really should put more effort into the shark. Ferb, I knoweth what we're going to doeth today! Hey, whereth is Perry? Happy Harbor Day, Agent P! In honor of the occasion, we've flooded your headquarters. Hope you like it. Actually, our plumbing just backed up. Just trying to put a happy face on it, Carl. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted on a boat. Go check it out. Brother, these Harbor Day's festivals are so lame. I can't wait to see this year's lame-o replica of the great white shark of Danville Harbor! It's always so feeble. Yeah. What's that? Okay. Let 'er drop! Right Okay, now how did that only hit me? Look at that! Let's go, Ferb! We're gonna give this Harbor Day's reenactment the best shark ever! Ugh! Come on, Stacy. We've got a shark to bust! So I says, ""Keep your hands off my poop deck, then we'll keelhaul the scurvy!"" Yo ho, Captain Kidd, we need your ship. My brothers are in that shark! 'Tis the same beast that swallowed my leg Yeah, yeah, that's fascinating. Tell me after we shove off! Ah, that shark's a mean one, alright. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Took me leg just to pick his teeth on. Yeah. Uh-huh. He drives alone in the carpool lane. Sure. Uh-huh. He threw poor Timmy down the well. Huh. Huh? And he won't give up his seat for little old ladies on the bus! Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, I know, he sounds like a bad guy. Oh, you think? Okay, Ferb. Let's see what this baby can do! Looks like everything's shark-shape! Make a left. Let's get our cartilaginous vertebrate on!  Doofenshmirtz on a crab boat!  Perry the Platypus! So what am I doing out here? Well, I'll tell you. One day, while I was perusing my collection of 19th-century almanacs, I learned that the leading cause of tooth decay is saltwater taffy! And that's why I invented the Saltwater Taffy-inator! Y-You can't see it from here, I built it on the bottom of the ocean where I have an unlimited supply of salt water for free. I-I'm going to make the sweetest, gooiest, stickiest saltwater taffy, in the world! In the world. Enough to give cavities to every kid in the Tri-State Area! Now, where's my wetsuit? Where are they? All I need is a metal shark and a mom to bust her by! That one's got some wind in her sails. You have no idea. So, did a shark really eat your leg? Arr, probably. But he definitely chewed on my arm. Uh, that's just a birthmark. I'm tired of this conversation. Thar she blows! I see you, Mister Beast! Can't this tug go any faster? There be only one captain on this ship. Looks like the reenactment has started! Let's give 'em a run for their money, Ferb! They're still on our tail! He be toying with us. Aye! Cannonball, Ferb. Well, at least we'll all get wet. Really? Really?! Arr! It's the octopus that ate me pancreas! Thank you. Get back here, beast! Whoa! Wow, six skips! Nice going. Here we go. Ow! Oh, okay, that hurt. All right, better just, uh Okay, I'm good. Now, I will activate my Saltwater Taffy-inator. At last! Now, nothing can prevent me from promoting tooth decay! Aw, I fogged up my mask again! Perry the Platypus? How did you get out? Ha! I grabbed you while you were flashing back to your escape! Yikes! I've caught many a fish with this lure. Take the pole and I'll man the wheel! Whoa! Come on, Stacy, pull!  She bought me coat and the mermaid brought my boots  Tug on this, beast. Whoa! Suppertime! Bullseye! Rubber ducks? Are you serious? Does a penguin fly? No. Ugh, now I'm tired of this conversation too! The ducks are back! I'll harpoon the beast! That's a plunger. I didn't buy this ship for its plumbing! Yah! Swim for your life! Come to Papa, beast. Well, I-I ain't really a papa, I-I never had kids of my own, see, andâ If I did they probably wouldn't be sharks. Butâ You know what I mean! Oh-hoh! Oh! Candace, he reaches! We're gonna need a bigger captain. Cheese and sausage? So, this is what the inside of a shark looks like? I always thought it would be more stomach-y. I think maybe it's time we just call it quits. Stacy, I'm tired of this conversation! I still have the upper hand! Well, actually you may at this particular moâ Chew first, Perry the Platâ Ah! Hoist the mainsail! Swab the poop deck! Watch that jib, sailor. Now, take the helm! I've got a date with destiny, and it ain't gonna end with a kiss! You've vexed me for too long. Too long! Full speed ahead, Stacy, get me in close! Aye aye, Candace! Captain! Captain! Yikes, what is it about that hat? From Danville Harbor I stab at thee, for busting's sake I spit my last spit at thee! Uh! Head for shore, Stacy! We've got him! Say, whoever's on that boat has the story wrong. They're supposed to drive us out to sea, not drag us into shore! Looks like we're gonna need a bigger shark. Now I wish I'd made that OFF button more accessible from the taffy itself. I wonder how this is affecting the surface water. Is that the best you've got? I found more harpoons! And I'm gonna pretend these have never been used! Load the cannon! Stand clear! Yep. I know you be in there! I'm a-get this outta here, boys. We need more power, Ferb! Hard to starboard, Stacy! Okay, that's port, but whatever! Arr! Arr! You know, it's such a shame the reenactment can't be this exciting. Free at last! Thanks for me new leg, boys! Mom! Mom! Look, Mom! Look, Mom! Look at the shark! Mom! What? Oh, that? They get cheesier every year. Roar! You cannot attack me, I am the tail! Shark wedgie! That's not what I meant! It never is, honey. Who wants blood pudding? Me! You know, this much I could've predicted, but I'm having a hard time explaining the giant metal shark. Well, at least we'll go together, Perry the Platypus. Oh, sure, I reach out to you and then you use the emergency face plate ejector thing. Curse you, Perry the Pla ..typus!"
"by ashirogi27 Hey, Candace, what're you doing out here? Hey, Stacy. I've got a lot that I wanna do today, so I figured I'd bust Phineas and Ferb early. You know, just to get it off my plate. How long have you been out here? Since last night. Yeah, well Who are those guys? I don't know. Who are you guys? I thought you were waiting in line for concert tickets. This is my backyard! There's always some kind of concert going on back here, I just thouâ Get out of my yard! Not a morning person. So, what's this big thing you wanted to do? Well, remember when Jeremy made that romantic dinner for me? Candace, he microwaved you a pizza. Yeah, a pizza for two. Uh, yes. So, I want to reciprocate and make him a romantic dinner. Are you sure? Candace, I don't know a lot about cooking. Well, neither do I, but I figure we'll use what you know and what I know and between the two of us we can figure it out, right? Hm, why not? Now, where's the cooking room? It's in the kitchen, that's where we keep all those cooking tools. Hey, Candace! We're going to the moon! The moon? Wait a minute. Why are you going to the moon? Kind of a step backward considering you've already been to Mars. Do you remember that old nursery rhyme, The Cat and the Fiddle? Vaguely. Apparently, there was a last verse that was lost to history, until Ferb and I found it in the Dead Sea. It's a little wet and salty, but I'll read it. ""Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon. Due to the moonâs low gravity, the moon jumping cows' milk produced the best tasting ice cream ever!"" That last verse didn't rhyme, so they left it out of most versions. Ferb and I are going to the moon to see if it's true! Don't you need some cows for that? We do indeed. Cows, get on the ship. Okay, that's the dumbest thing Iâ Phineas and Ferb, I'm going to countdown backwards from 10, and when I'm done, you better be down here so I can bust you! Ten Nine Eight Oh! Seven Let us get to our stations. Six Five Four Three Two One. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. Our sources tell us that Doof is up to something. We need you to infiltrate Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated and have a little look-see. To make it easier for you to get in, we have one of our operatives installing a Central Access Threshold, or, CAT door. So, let's get out there and, good luck! So, now I'm an operative? We're still not paying you, Carl. Remember, everyone, the moon's gravity is 83.3% less than Earth. So, what? So, what? So, let's bounce! Whee! No, no, Buford! Please do not drop me! Iâ Oh! Ooh, well this is not so bad. Yeah? Give it a second. Oh! How is it possible you are actually heavier on the moon?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus! What? Oh, yes, the green? I can explain. It started two days ago when I was watering my plant. I noticed a beautiful garden on my neighbor's balcony. Ooh, I got so jealous. So the guy at the store told me, among other things, that my plant wouldn't grow because I didn't have a green thumb. A-And that I should stop bothering with all these plant questions and that my mere presence in the store was destroying his plants. So, I got a big bucket of green paint, and I poured it on myself. Then I was green everywhere, except strangely my thumbs, I think it was the way I was holding the bucket. Anyhoo, I came up with another great idea. I created the Moisture Suck-Inator! See? See? I don't know why I built it here when I was going to use it on the balcony That wasn'tâ Anyhoo, this device will suck all the moisture out of my neighbor's plants, which will turn them brown, making my plants look greener by comparison. And I will finally have a green thumb! You know, not actually Metaphorically! Iâll have a greeâ Oh, it's a metaphor! And I wasted all that money on green paint. Okay, nice job everyone! Now the cows have a place to live. But, what will the cows eat? Ah, not to worry. After scientists discovered the existence of frozen water on the moon, Ferb and I began shooting seeds up here. Then we shot up hundreds of these pocket warmers to melt the ice in the ground. But Phineas, there's no oxygen here! That's alright, the grass will create its own oxygen through photosynthesis! Yes, but you would still need soâ Ooh. Or not. We got our grass, Ferb. Let's get the herd fed. Cows, lunchtime. Oh, my gosh, Stacy. Your cooking hat looks so cute! Yours too! Mission control to Moon Farm. What's that? Come in, Moon Farm. This is Moon Farm, come back. Oh. Oh, this is mission control. Your transmission's a little garbled, but still understandable, over! Hey! Just what do you think you're doing? Is that Candace? Yes, she was just sâ Oh, just give me that! Phineas, you are so busted! Oh, hi, Candace. How's the cooking for Jeremy going? Hey, ask him what we should cook! Roger that, Stacy. Ferb suggests lamb cobbler on account of Jeremy's British background. We don't have that recipe. That's okay. Ferb knows it by heart! You and Stacy go to the kitchen and we'll relay the recipe step by step through mission control. Alright. But, I'm still busting you! I'm still busting them. Ferb says the first thing you'll need is a big bowl, over. Roger, mission control out. A big bow? Hmm. Well, I guess that'll make it look pretty. I got it. Oh, man, why didn't I put wheels on this thing? There. I'll just aim it Ah, there, perfect. Now, you will witness the dehydrating effect of my Moisture Suck-Inator on my neighbor's garden! And, fire! Oh, thatâ That doesn't seem to be working. Let me try it on something else. Hmm This is gonna hurt you more than it's gonna hurt me, Perry the Platypus. Fire!  Do bee do bee do baa  Oh, look at you! You're Pruny the Dehydra-pus. Hm. I wonder why it didn't do that to the neighbor's plants. Maybe it's too far away. Maybeâ Ugh. Just aâ I gotta try it again. I'm not gonna let that guy make me look like a nincompâ Oh, poop. I'm going to go get a glass of water. You want one, Perry the Platypus? This doesn't seem right, Candace. I mean, four eggs bleated, a big bow, one pound of lamp I mean, that's not even food. Trust me, Stacy. As annoying as Phineas and Ferb are, they're usually right. Phineas and Ferb sayâ N-Not in the house! Phineas and Ferb say, three cups of self-righteous flowers. You see? That's what I'm talking about. Self-righteous flowers? What are self-righteous flowers? Well, roses always seemed stuck up to me. Okay, so let's go pick some roses. Moon! Moo-na. Two syllables, cow. Two. Moo-na. Man, these cows are dumb. Ah, that's much better. I was parched, how about you? We should do this more often, this was nice. Now if you excuse me, I'm going to jet-pack over to my neighbor's balcony and see what's going on with those plants. Right after I change my pants. So, what's next, Irving? Phineas and Ferb say, bake at 350 for one hour. Serves two. Speaking of serves two, I was thinking, you know, after you girls are done here maybe we couldâ Okay, that's golden. Uh, we'll just put a pin in it for now. Stacy, what are we going to do? Jeremy will be here in five minutes! Relax Candace, it's simple math. Instead of 350 for one hour, we'll just cook this for five minutes at 9000 degrees. What could go wrong? Okay everyone, ice cream's ready. Let's dig in. Hmm. This is the best ice cream I've ever had! (Song: Moon Farm)  Oh, dat's right!   Houston, we've got a situation   Better stan' by de phone!   It's a brand new lunar taste sensation   Served on a waffle cone!   We got chocolate, vanilla   But we don't have rocky road!   It's not that we don' like it!   We left de marshmallows at home   I blame Baljeet!  Hey, what do you mean you blame Baljeet? Well, it was clearly your responsibility. Where are you getting your information from, disembodied reggae space voice? Hey, I have a name, you know. Oh, yeah? What is it? Wellâ Itâ It's Disembodied Reggae Space Voice, but that's just a coincidence, you didn't know that! Oh, look who's sensitive! Besides, Buford could have brought the marshmallows. Hey, leave me out of this! Guys, guys, we have limited time here! Baljeet, could you please stop arguing with the soundtrack? He started it. Hey, you, I got a question for you. How do you get your plantsâ What? Plastic! Is there some I can help you with, rocket man? Yeah, what's with all the plastic plants? And thatâ And the plastic man? I like plastic. Oh, so you're just trying to make me look like a fool. Well, I don't need youâ That'sâ Iâll just take the stairs. I don't know, Stacy, I've got a bad feeling about this. What am I going to do if it isn't even edible? Well, technically it is English food. Well, here it goes. Lamb cobbler! And it's beautiful! How could that be? We didn't even put lamb in it! Phineas and Ferb, what's going on out here? Hi, Candace, we brought you some moon cow ice cream! I don't care if you brought me ice cream from the moon. When Mom sees this spaceship in the yard, you two will be so busted! Huh. So, how do you think our cows will do on the moon? Well, photosynthesis will start creating oxygen and eventually an atmosphere. Our bovine friends will be fine. Cool. We know where to go for ice cream. It's all dried out! Hey, everybody! Jeremy! Iâ Uh You're here! Hey, Candace. It's really nice of you to make something for me. I can't wait to see what you've come up with. Oh Uh Yeah I'll bet it's great. Um Here's the thing. It's, uh Iâ I-I just don't know if you'll like it. Ooh, ice cream. What? Oh. Yeah. Ice cream for two. Uh, Perry the Platypus? Yeah, I'm, uh I'm over here. Yeah, I, uh I forgot my keys, so I thought that, uh You know, I could just fit through the, uh Oh, good, you're gonnaâ You're gonna go get the building super, maybeâ Tell them that I'm up here, and Waitâ What's that? That better not be a ""do not disturb"" sign. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! This is the best ice cream I've ever had!  Oh, dat's right!   Houston, we've got a situation   Better stan' by de phone!   It's a brand new lunar taste sensation   Served on a waffle cone!   We got chocolate, vanilla   But we don't have rocky road!   It's not that we don' like it!   We left de marshmallows at home   I blame Baljeet!  Hey, I thought we discussed this earlier! It's in de lyrics, man."
"by ashirogi27 Hey, boys. Want some fat-free whole-grain granola bars? They're still warm from the oven. Whole-grain and fat-free? You know us so well. Yes. Yes, I do. You know, Mom's always doing nice things for us. I think it's time that we did something nice for Mom! Let's see We couldâ No Orâ Uh-uh. Huh Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? We're trying to think of a nice thing that we can do for Mom. Any ideas? You can clean up the whole house for her! Or, you can get her a classic wooden slide rule from Analog Emporium. How do I know what adults like? What am I, a computer? That's it! I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna make a super computer! What? Your mom wants a super computer? What is she? Some kind of nerd? No, we're gonna ask the computer what to do for Mom. Slide rule! I gave it to you on a silver platter! Okay, I'm going out. I've got a coupon for a free hair styling from this new salon. I'm gonna freshen up my look. Granola bars are in the kitchen! Ugh. Maybe I'll feed mine to Perry. Hey, where is Perry? Good morning, Agent P. The entire Tri-State Area's becoming riddled with holes. Also, numerous light beams have been shot from Doofenshmirtz's building. Either he's having some sort of a rave, or he's the one behind all those holes. Investigate at once! Good luck, Agent P! (Song: Buildin' a Supercomputer)  We're buildin' a supercomputer in the backyard   And singing about it in G   We worked up the plans so it can't be that hard   To make a trillion-terabyte memory   Our song is synchronic, not the least bit ironic   What you hear is exactly what you see   We're buildin' a supercomputer   And singing just what we're doin'   Which is buildin' a supercomputer   And over-explainin' just what you're viewin'   All the panels are screwed in   As our song is concludin'   What you hear is exactly what you see  And that's the story of how you made me. He's cute! That's not it That's not it. That's not it That is not it. That's not it. Welcome, Perry the Platypus. How do you like your trap? That's super quick drying cement. See? Solid as a, uh I dunno, some rock-like substance. Cement, maybe! Now, with you safely trapped, I introduce you to the Metal-Unearth-inator! All right, gang, it's ready to go. We just need to perform an initial scan of the Tri-State Area so it has enough data to work with. Scanning, Tri-State-Area. Between that and the random laser drills, this is like the second best mid-day scrapyard rave ever! Hold still and Hello, Hospital Workers Union. Get out of my mind! Gathering data from all objects and habitants. Computing logical outcome of all events. Done. Okay, computer. Are you ready to answer any question? Yes, my data is complete. My logic, infallible. What's 2 + 2? Four. Perhaps you should just count on your fingers. Sorry. What's the square root of 72,361? Try something more unusual. What are the names of the girls in my Fireside Girls troop? Gretchen, Adyson, Holly, Katie, Milly, and Ginger. Wow, he's good! On a multi-valve engine with variable timing, how can I isolate an exhaust valve leak at the stem seal without removing the can shaft? Coat the engine with tomato paste and the leak will reveal itself. He's right! Uh What size pants do I wear? Boys, husky, extra large. He's right! Impressive! Well, you seem to be working perfectly, so Computer, what is the nicest thing we can do for Mom today? Computing Done. Get a gallon of industrial marking dye and a leaf blower. Tie balloons onto them. Then, go to the top of Danville Hill, and at 2:37 p.m., release them into the wind. Really? Nothing could make your mother happier today. You turned down slide rule for this? I don't know, Baljeet. From what we've seen so far, I think a little blind faith is called for. You know nothing about women. Dude, it's over. Okay, there must be something bustable going on out hereâ What is that? I am a super computer. I can answer any question that you could possibly ask. Did my brothers make you? Yes. Yes, they did. Okay. So, let me think of a question. Hmm How many states in the United States? Fifty. What goes on top of pancakes? Butter and syrup. How do you pronounce the ""J"" in ""JalapeÃ±o""? It makes the ""H"" sound. I knew that. How many fingers behind my back? Two. Okay, that's just freaky. And, bustable! All I gotta do is But it never works! No matter what I try, whatever the boys do just disappears before Mom looks! If only there was some way to guarantee Mom would see what the boys have done? What? Another one? Why are there so many helmets buried in the Tri-State Area? Ah, onto the pile you go. So, Perry the Platypus, I hope you didn't come here because of all the holes, because the Metal-Unearth-inator is not even my final plan. May I present to you my real plan? The All-Purpose-inator! You've heard of a man's man? Well, this is an inator's inator. It does everything! Of course, once I activate it, it will make all my other inators obsolete, but, uh I guess that's progress. Unfortunately, I ran into a little snag. After putting all the final touches on my All-Purpose-inator, I took a step back to admire my handiwork. Victory was finally within my grasp. All I needed to do is turn the thing on. Then, fate made a cruel joke. The ignition key fell off my balcony! Nooooooo!!!!! Finally spotted it when I could tell he was laughing. You know, that way gophers do. And there was no way I was going to go all the way down there to get the key. I've got a schedule to keep. So, I decided to build the Metal-Unearth-inator to track down and dig up the key so I can fire up my All-Purpose-inator so I can take over the Tri-State Area. Somehow. You know, you can put the red king onâ Hey, you're not even listening. But then, when I bring Mom into the backyard, it's gone and Mom never sees it. So here's my question, Mr. Supercomputer. How can I get my Mom to see what my brothers have done? Elementary. You must build a device that makes your Mom see what your brothers have done. What kind of device? Follow my instructions to the letter and when you have finished, I am 100% certain that your Mom will see what your brothers have done. Okay. Where do I start? You are going to need a toaster, a number two screwdriver, some electrical tape Helmet Helmet Another helmet What happened here? A chisel? Well, it's no key but at least we're getting closer in size. A hammer? Why would someone bury a hammer? Well, onto the pile you go. I'm closing in on the key. I can feel it. Perry the Platypus, how did you get out? Well, two can play at that game. Uh, wait a second. Hold on. Not this, not this. There was a whole bunch of 'em just a couple of minutes ago. A-ha! Jackpot! Now, Perry the Platypus, meet your doom! Keep up, Buford, it's almost 2:37. Hey, I don't have balloons to lighten my load. I would have walked. Three, two, one Liftoff! There they go. Industrial orange marker dye and a leaf blower. Guaranteed happiness for Mom. Somehow. Let's follow and see what happens. This way, everybody! Sure, now you put me down. There, finished. Did I put it together right? You built it perfectly, Candace. Your Mom will definitely see what the boys have done. And you finished it just in time, because in two seconds your Mom is going to pull up. Wow! You're right about everything! I can't lose! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mo Uh. I'm having a bad day. Uh, never mind. Come on, come on, come on! So, not so tough without your mace. Now, I have the upper hand. Prepare to meet your doomâ Eh. You throw your helmet at me? That's so lame, Perry theâ Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Precisely on schedule. Hello, gopher! It's over here! It's over here! See? Hi, Candace! You know, Candace most days, this is just a little disturbing. But today, with the free coupon, and this whole awful thing with my hair And the gopher lets go now. If only I hadâ Huh? My hair looks so cute! I guess it just needed some time to settle. But, but, butâ Buuuuuu It's so great when something nice happens to you, especially when you weren't expecting it. What just happened? We did something nice for Mom. We fixed her bad hairdo. Apparently. You did that? Yup. You, did that? That's right. With a little supercomputer help. So, when Mom looked in the mirror on that thing I built, she saw what you had done? That's right. And by the way, nice use of the accordion arm. Oh! I hate computers! Hey, where'd the computer go? Ooh, the key detection alarm! I forgot I installed that. Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, hereâ Wait! I knew this was going to happen. Uh-oh. Well, at least I found the key to theâ Nice! Curse you, Perry theâ Oh, why does everything explode so easily? Yeah I knew that was gonna happen."
"by ashirogi27 Hello, Tri-State Area. This is Al Reynolds reporting from the Danville Zoo. I'm here with Tykera Kwok and the zoo's latest acquisition. Tykera, what is this thing?

Really? Who cares? I'm too cool for those losers. Say, you're cute. Say, you're cute. There used to be a lamp post there. So, what am I gonna do with the Least-Likely-inator, you ask? Make my daughter obey me? Make my father love me? No. And double no! Well, maybe later. But first, I'm gonna aim this bad boy at City Hall and zap my brother, the mayor. And he'll make a fool of himself in front of the legislature, which is the least likely thing he'd ever do. And the city will be forced to give the Tri-State Area to me, his next of kin!

Maybe I can make some sort of Inator that would pick her up for me! Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? We made Candace the best phone ever! What we've done here is revolutionized modern technology. We put all kinds of cool features on it. My favorite is the voice-activated phone transporter app. Show 'em, Ferb. You just say the words, ""go to"", and then specify the name or place you're trying to reach, and the phone will take you there.

It's Dr. Doof-degree-purchased- on-the-Internet-with-my-wife's-money-enshmirtz. Well, I must say it's good to hear your voice again, too, after so long! I just came down here to get some parts for a new Inator. Hey, take me with you. I haven't seen you blow yourself up for a long time. All right, Mr. Smarty-pants. Come on, let's go. Hey, on the way, let's swing by the store and get you some deodorant. Quiet, you! Yeah. So, like, then I had to go whole like, 38 minutes without a phone, So, like, then I had to go whole like, 38 minutes without a phone, and I was like, ""You guys better fix it, or else!"" and they were like, ""Candace, you're the best big sister we've ever had!"" and I was like ""Yeah"" and they were like ""Oh, yeah!"" Candace, I'd love to hear more, and I'm sure I will, Candace, I'd love to hear more, and I'm sure I will, but right now I'm trying to finish this documentary on Easter Island. Man, I wish I could go.

PHINEAS AND FERB! I've really got to hand it to myself, Norm's Old Head. I'm a genius! Oh, is that what you see? 'Cause I'm looking at a lab coat filled with doonkleberries on top of which someone has strategically placed a cabbage. This is my new Inator. I call it the Pick-'Em-Up inator. Hm-mm. So, what's this one do and where can I hide when it doesn't do it and blows up? All I have to do is enter the coordinates and launch. Ugh. I should've known Dad would be late. Oh, what is this? Curse you, unknown rocket-helmet-transportation thing! Oh, sweet. I'm home. Never mind, unknown rocket-helmet-transportation thing! Hey, look, Old Norm Head. It worked. It functioned properly! Vanessa's all picked up and taken home, with three minutes to spare. Vanessa's all picked up and taken home, with three minutes to spare. That's great. We can spend the rest of the day working on your personality. Hey, this time let's try to bump it up to a C minus. Y'know, I'm starting to remember why I replaced you and put you in storage. Perry the Platypus? What? I didn't do anything wrong today. I just built an Inator to pick up my daughter. But, hey, as long as you're here, why don't you join me for my evil exercise show? I've got a spare headband.

Easter Island? Who makes an app that sends people to Easter Island? Hey, come back here! I need that to get home! Oh, that was close. Talk about a cliffhanger. Can I get you a sports drink, Perry the Platypus? No? All right. Suit yourself. Say, as long as you're tied up, I'll tell you the evil plan I just thought of while we were working out. See, I figured my Pick-'Em-Up-Inator works so well, I could mass produce them and pick up everyone in the Tri-State Area! Then, they would have to do what I tell them. Then, they would have to do what I tell them. Man, what is in this stuff? Okay, bird! You better give me my phone or I'm gonna rock you to sleep, with a real rock! You better give me my phone or I'm gonna rock you to sleep, with a real rock! Ugh! Yes? What is it, Agent T? Oh, no! That's Candace Flynn of the Flynn-Fletcher family. Phineas!

Man, you tie a guy up and he gets all foot-stompy on you for no reason! Hey, Perry the Platypus, can you do me a favor and leave that remote here? Ugh. There, I'm better. There, I'm better. Waitâ Perry the Platypus, that's it? You're just gonna thwart and run? Curse you, Perry the Hello? Oh, hi, Vanessa. Yes, that was my Inator. Listen, honey, I'm in the middle of something, hold on one second. Platypus! So, how was class? So, how was class? Oh, give me that phone, bird! Ow! Oh, give me a break! Well, you were right, Ferb. The most interesting thing we ever built was very tall and very heavy. And that guy from the museum seemed very appreciative. I still can't believe it fit in his truck. Hey, Candace. Buford was just talking about you. You guys are so busted! I'm calling Mom, right now. I'm calling Mom, right now. Oh, no. I don't have the phone! That's Mom! When she finds out I lost it, my life is ruined! Relax, Candace. We made two, just in case. You did that for me? Well, sure. Well, sure. Thank you. You do realize I'm still gonna have to bust you for making me go to Timbuktu? Timbuktu, located. Timbuktu, located. Meap. She's gonna miss pie. PHINEAS AND FERB! Finally, a place where a head can be a head. When's the bunny get here with all the eggs? Huh? Yeah, Easter Island? Yeah, Easter Island? Huh? Huh?

What's it for, you ask? I'll tell you on the way. It began in Gimmelshtump when I was a callow youth yearning for a career in fine art. I quickly discovered that although I loved painting, my muse was sometimes inaccessible. I quickly discovered that although I loved painting, my muse was sometimes inaccessible. I quickly discovered that although I loved painting, my muse was sometimes inaccessible. Then one day, just as I was about to give up in frustration, inspiration struck. Then one day, just as I was about to give up in frustration, inspiration struck. I was up for three days straight gripped in glorious, artistic fever. And finally, my masterpiece! And finally, my masterpiece! I rushed across the street to get my brother, Roger. He was in the middle of his favorite meal. A sloppy joe, greasy french fries with ketchup, grape juice, coffee, and chocolate pudding. A sloppy joe, greasy french fries with ketchup, grape juice, coffee, and chocolate pudding. A sloppy joe, greasy french fries with ketchup, grape juice, coffee, and chocolate pudding. A sloppy joe, greasy french fries with ketchup, grape juice, coffee, and chocolate pudding. But I insisted he come at once. That day, I made a solemn vow that Roger would pay for what he'd done. That day, I made a solemn vow that Roger would pay for what he'd done. The next morning, I had the solemn vow notarized. But today, I will finally get my revenge! You see, my brother, the honorable mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz, will be unveiling a new piece of art for the lobby of City Hall. You see, my brother, the honorable mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz, will be unveiling a new piece of art for the lobby of City Hall. You see, my brother, the honorable mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz, will be unveiling a new piece of art for the lobby of City Hall. Hence, the Stain-inator, hence, revenge, hence, uh No more hencing. That's about it. I say, boys, you can barely feel the road! It corners like a dream! Pinhead Pierre, eat your heart out! Pinhead Pierre, eat your heart out! What do you say we take the gang for a spin? Wow! (Song: Aerial Area Rug)  You can't see much of the skyline   It looks like more of a grid   It's a viable variation of view   But it's something I'm sure we'll be glad that we did   It's not like the world that we see from the ground   I guess the main difference is we're looking down   So climb on our aerial area rug   It's certain to keep us aloft   Its aerodynamics are highly advanced   And its weave is so tight and so soft   Though this vista's diverse   Is it better or worse?   If you'll ask, I'll just give you a shrug   But you can vary your view of the area   From our aerial area rug   It's a brand new perspective   Literally   We can see the tops of buildings   Come along with me   You can vary your view of the area   From our aerial area rug   You can vary your view of the area   From our aerial area rug!  Ah, thank you, boys. This was lovely. And does anyone else want to be ""king of the world""? Ah, keep it, bro. It suits you. Okay, here we go. ""You choose the path that few others dare travel."" Done and done. Come on, Stace! Follow me! Really, Candace? What do you hope to accomplish by this? Everything! Don't you see? All the problems in my life can be solved through concrete knowledge of the future! Right. As you create a whole new set of problems. Oh, stop being so close-minded. For instance, what's my biggest problem? You believe fortune cookies are real? I mean, besides that. You're totally obsessed with busting your brothers! Exactly! And with infallible fortune cookie guidance, I can accomplish that easily. Watch. ""If something seems fishy, maybe it's a fish!"" ""If something seems fishy, maybe it's a fish!"" Genius. Hey all, catch it now! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish! What do you have to say now, Doubty McNonbelief? Why am I suddenly Irish? To the fish market!

A perfect day for ruining a City Hall lobby art dedication. You know, if you're into that kind of thing. You know, if you're into that kind of thing. Which I am! Either way, it's nice to get out of the lab for a change and, you know, try to destroy art in the fresh air. Like a field trip! To the death! Thank you! I'm sure if I thought about it, I could come up with some emotionally-scarring back stories that are more outdoors-yâ What does this look like to you? That. Well, it's great to finally meet you in person! So, when can I see you again? So, when can I see you again? Wow, not only does this thing work, it has a sense of irony! Wow, not only does this thing work, it has a sense of irony! Ow! Thank you, friends, and welcome. Thank you, friends, and welcome. Right on time. It fills me with great pride to contribute today to the cultural enrichment of the Tri-State Area. I've always been a great lover of the arts. Liar, liar, pantalones del fuego. You again? There. Auto-fire in 30 seconds. Nothing can stop it now. You see, the greatest painting I ever saw was made by my brother Heinz. You see, the greatest painting I ever saw was made by my brother Heinz. You'd better believe it! Art killer. And I, in an extraordinary act of clumsiness, destroyed it, denying him the accolades he so greatly deserved. And I, in an extraordinary act of clumsiness, destroyed it, denying him the accolades he so greatly deserved. And I, in an extraordinary act of clumsiness, destroyed it, denying him the accolades he so greatly deserved. And I, in an extraordinary act of clumsiness, destroyed it, denying him the accolades he so craved and deserved. And here comes the payback! And that's why I've spent the last two decades restoring it to its former glory. What? Huh, what? No, no! No, no! No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no No, no, no, no, no, no Nooo!!! Ladies and gentlemen, my brother's painting! Nooo!!!

It's a shame we couldn't get that message to Sergei. I'll try calling his cell. Hello, I'm unavailable because I'm hurtling through time, and evolving past our human limitations. So, don't bother leaving a message after the beep. I guess we'll never be able to wish him a happy birthday. Well, never say never. What the Happy birthday! They did remember. Such nice boys."
"Hey, Dad! It says on this map that America's largest sport sock is just three miles down the road. Are we gonna stop there? I'm sorry, boys, but we only have 'till sundown to return this RV to the rental place. We'll have to do it on our next road trip, okay? I'm ready for this trip to be over. I'm tired of being in mobile lock-down, where I can't even call my friends because of spotty cell service! That, combined with the refrigerator door opening every time we make a left and sharing a bathroom the size of a postage stamp! The only consolation for this whole rigmarole, besides the fact we didn't stop at one of those greasy spoon road stop diners, is the fact that you two haven't done anything bustable for a whole week! Seven solid days Are you even listening to me? Well, we were at first, but then you got all echoey and far away. Oh, I'm gonna go take a nap. Ferb, Candace is right. Ferb, Candace is right. We didn't get a chance to stop at the classic, all-American roadside truck stop diner! You know, the juke boxes, the sassy waitresses the little bowl of mints by the cash register. Too bad you can't build one. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Hey! There's Perry! Ah, Agent P. We're sorry, we know you're on vacation, but Doofenshmirtz is driving a big rig not far from your current location. We need you to reroute your family and catch up to him. Find out what he's up to and put a stop to it. Oh, I envy you. The romance of the open road. The tire chunks all up and down the shoulder and that ever-mysterious single shoe. Turn left at next exit. Hmm, that's odd, but I never argue with a lady. Hey, what's that? Hey, what's that? That's a CB radio. I can talk to truckers on it. Talk to truckers? Do it! Okay. Uh, breaker, breaker, 1-9. This is Cheeky Monkey. Anybody got their flappers on out there? Cheeky Monkey? Oh, that's me. It's my my handle. How do you know how to use a CB radio? Simple, I studied this. ""Truck Drivin' Hits. 1975-1975"". Yes, yes, yes, handle it carefully, dear. Hello? Cheeky Monkey? Oh! Oh! You got someone. Yes, yes, this is Cheeky Monkey. You're shaking the windows. What's your handle, good buddy? Come back. A handle? Handle, handle. Oh, my name! Uh, yeah, you got Misfortune here. Well, hello, Miss. No, no! It's not Miss, it-it's Misfortune. Like like one word. It's like It means bad luck. It's like It means bad luck. One word. So, uh, where are you? Oh, we're running a double nickel on a dime. Double nickel on aâ Oh, yes. Very clever. Well, let's see. I'm eastbound with a smoky on my 20, on a cab over Louie with I'm eastbound with a smoky on my 20, on a cab over Louie with You know, I'm gonna level with you. I don't know where I am or what I'm saying, really. IsâIs there a code for that? IsâIs there a code for that? No worries, Miss. Just keep your metal up and your rubber down. Metal up? What kind ofâ Hey! Cheeky Monkey, I-I'm gonna have to call you back. I'm gone. You know, you just scored some big man points in my book for that. Woo-hoo! You just lost them again. Perry the Platypus, don't start anything because I'm driving and it's really unsafe. Quit goofing around and sit down! Besides, you should really have your seat belts on! Yeah! Ah, you're probably wondering what I'm doing driving this big rig. As you know, every Inator of mine has a self-destruct feature, all of which rely on a little formula top scientists refer to as Boom Juice. I found a cheap deal on a whole truckload of the stuff out here in the sticks. But I had to drive it home myself because, well, the shipment's a little old and unstable. Oh, pay no attention to that. That's just the mandatory early warning explosion alert. I'll just turn down the sound so we can talk. Now I can tell you some of my truck driving tales. Ready? Mom. Phineas and Ferb. Bust. Look. And one little orphan boy looked up at me with tears in his eyes He said, ""Mr. Trucker Man, you done saved Christmas!"" Oh, that's good. Mom. Bust. Boys. Oh, Lawrence, look. Candace is sleep-busting again! Aww, that's adorable. Hon, go back to your nap now. Go on. Mom. Bust. Boys. Oh, go on. Play track three! It's the one where a group of truckers take down a corrupt police force using only their trucks and their saucy colloquialisms. Delivery! Hey, aren't you two a little young to be receiving a seasoned grill, 300 pounds of coffee, 200 pounds of fatback, four tons of lumber and assorted wheat, rye and pumpernickel breads? Hey, aren't you two a little young to be receiving a seasoned grill, 300 pounds of coffee, 200 pounds of fatback, four tons of lumber and assorted wheat, rye and pumpernickel breads? Think about it. Age isn't really the issue here, right? You got a point, kid. So, then I say to him ""That's not a penguin. It's a throw pillow."" And so he throws it at me. Turns out it was a penguin and its beak went right into my mouth. And I'm all, ""Egh! Their beak is their nose!"" Ugh! True story.  He's a mobile mammal and I bet you a fiver   He's eatin' hush puppies and cornâ  Perry the Platypus, I can't fight you and drive at the same timâ It's a good thing I installed my Hitch-a-ride-inator. Aha! Voila, we are locked together. They do all the driving and I don't have to. Now, where were weâ Wait. Hey! Where'd you go? Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! No! Hey! Hey, what the heck, man? Oh, my word, there's a truck-driving pharmacist and he's pressing his face up against his windshield. Oh, that's what I love about you Americans. Y-You're like big, fun children. Y-You're like big, fun children. Yes. Yes, we are. Well, how about that! D-Did you ever notice that the hood ornament here is a little dog? Hmm Right there! Red barn! Bingo! Mom, have you seen Phineas and Ferb? Oh, honey, you're still sleep-busting. Oh, honey, you're still sleep-busting. Go back and lie down, Candace. Oh, but the boys! Go on, you're sleeping. Phineas? Ferb? Hello?! Hey, is that music? Hey, is that music? What?! Hey, Candace! Welcome to the No Stop Truck Stop. It's like a little bit of home, on the road! Phineas, my last peaceful hours of vacation, and you build this?! More coffee, Miss? This is unbelievable! When Mom, sees this one, she's gonna completely flip! Miss, I'd like the breakfast special. Honestly, you can't close your eyes for one second around you boys. Hash browns or fruit? Hash browns! You're having fruit! Oh You are so busted! Hey, some orange juice over here. Yeah, hold your horses. I mean, it's bad enough in our own backyard, but at least that's stationary. Does the eggs southwest have bacon in them? Ferb, bacon in the southwest? There's bacon. Is the bacon good? It's bacon. Okay. Then, uh I'll take, uh Not getting any younger here. (Song: Little Bit of Home on the Road)  This is our ""No Stop Truck Stop""   Come on in, take a break from hauling that load   We got coffee that's hot and ice that's not   It's a little bit of home on the road   We got lots of gravy to fill up all our pans   And restrooms out in back if you have to wash your hands   If an armadillo is your pillow and your cab is your abode   Then come on in for a little bit of home on the road   Enjoy the view while you're slurping homemade stew   And when you're finish you can sit and chat  Do you want pie? Oh, yeah!  Our juke plays latest hits from 1966   We may not know where we're going but we sure know where it's at   There's chicken fried steak and devil's food cake as we whirl through another zip code   There's butter that's real and butter that's fake   Just a little bit of home on the road   Just sit right down, you look like a hungry gent   Our biscuits and gravy go down like wet cement   So, if you're looking for home cooking or you want to see a three-headed toad   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road!  Oh, what am I doing?! That's it, Perry the Platypus! There's nowhere left to run! You have officially overstayed your welcome! Hey! Hey, no fair! Ow! Left in 100 feet. Uh, okay. This seems to have a little more corn than most shortcuts. I'm outta here! Oh, great! Turn right to avoid plunging 5,000 feet into Cactus Gorge. Well, yes, all right, might as well. Oh, no! My Boom Juice! Heading for Cactus Gorge! Ah. Oh, what do you know? My Boom Juice isn't as volatile as I hadâ Uh Miss, I ordered some pie. Really? By banding together, the truckers saved Christmas? Cool. Oh, you're coming with me! Yeah, I-I still never got my pie. I think I'll go check on the kids. Oh, look at you guys. Wait! No, Mom! The boys! They built a truck stop! On the roof! Seriously, a whole restaurant! Climb up and see! Hon Mom! Go! Look! Go! Look! Okay Here we go. It's always about you! I have dreams, too, you know. I've always wanted to own a little truck stop diner. There you go. How do you do that? I don't get it. What am I supposed to see? What?! NOOO!!! So, what are we looking at? Oh. Oh, right! Yep. Gonna need some new pants. Well I fail to see how this day could get any worse. Flaming cactus. Yeah, that ought to do it!  Just sit right down, you look like a hungry gent   Our biscuits and gravy go down like wet cement   So, if you're looking for home cooking or you want to see a three-headed toad   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road   Just come on in for a little bit of home on the road!"
"You were right, Ferb. It is more fun to mount the race track on the ceiling. Hey, guys. Care to join us for an upside-down slot bike race? No, thank you. I am not a big fan of bicycle racing. Oh, come on! Everyone loves a good bike race. Not me. You see, I come from a long line of bicycle race losers. In 1903, my great-grandfather was leading a bicycle race, when he fell into a tiger pit. Years later, my grandfather skillfully avoided the tiger pit, but sadly not the tiger. Then, my father was confident he had outsmarted the tiger. But, he was wrong. My point is, none of them finished in the top ten. You know, tiger attacks are comparatively rare in Danville since we installed that tiger excluder on city hall. Ferb, I know what Baljeet's gonna do today! Hey, Candace. I was just heading out to Margie's baby shower and look what I found on the stoop. My new camcorder! Sport edition. For bustin' on the go. Yeah. Well, gotta run. Margie won't stay pregnant forever. Don't forget to feed Perry. Where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. We've been monitoring Doofenshmirtz's internet traffic and we think it'sâ What in blazes? A pop-up ad? Can you still see me, Agent P? What, another? Agent P, over here! Oh, this is getting ridiculous! I give up! You know the drill. Monogram out. Here it is. The route of the 1st annual Tour de Ferb bike race. Featuring jumps, obstacles, rickety staircases, and here's where you start the second stretch of the underwaterâ Wait. Underwater? We tricked the bikes out a little. Just press the button on your handle bars when you encounter any unusual terrain. How about tiger attacks? Technically, that's not a terrain. Isabella was kind enough to enlist the help of the Fireside Girls to make the course guide us, and help out along the way. More racey, less talky. Sweet! Race it to the front-line! You're on! Hey, Baljeet. Don't let a little thing like all your male ancestors getting mauled by tigers during a bike race get you down. Well, it does seem to indicate a pattern. Just remember you have something that they didn't have. Greg LeMond! I'm back here! Hi, Baljeet. I'm Greg LeMond, the first American cyclist to win the Tour de France. Three times, actually. So, like recently? That's not the point. The point is, I see a kid who needs inspiration. Oh, you mean me, right? That's right, Baljeet. Don't let anything stop you. There's nothing in this world that you can't do. Actually, I can think of many things I cannot do. Flying comes to mind. Also putting my foot behind my head, but it occurs to me that you're speaking hyperbolically. So point taken, Greg LeMond! I am going to win this race! That's the spirit! U-S-A! U-S-A! I am from India! Ready Set. Losers! Go! What theâ? No fair! You've got that aerodynamic head! India! India! Oh, Phineas? Ferb? Tour de Ferb? Oh, baby! (Song: Bust is in the Bag)  Bust is in the bag   The bust is in the bag   The bust is in the bag!   Video b-b-bust   Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Welcome, Perry the Platypus. I knew you'd fall for the old kickstand trap. Of course, I didn't know exactly where you've parked, so I really got to watch my step around here. But as you see, you're trapped in a pile of old computer cables. I started throwing them in a drawer years ago, and I-I'm sure there's probably one wire you can pull like a like a load-bearing wire that would just make the whole thing unravel. But how'd you find it? I figured it's just easier to use it as a trap, so I did. See? Recycling. Uh-oh! Big round wet thing comin' up! Press your buttons, everybody! Awesome! I can feel my competitive spirit breaking free! Don't give up, Baljeet! Never! Baljeet, you're not quitting, are you? No, sir, Mr. LeMond. I came to win! I know things are tough. There's a little voice telling you to quit. I hear no voice. But you can't quit. But I do not want to quit! Hey, true story. Hunting accident. My brother-in-law thought I was a turkey. Kaboom! But I recovered, and you can too. Wow. I have no idea how to respond to that. I think I will be continuing with the race now. Dropping out seems like an easy way, but years from now I don't want you to look back and wonder ""What if?"". Out of my way, turkey! Why does everybody think I'm a turkey? So, Perry the Platypus, let me tell you about my latest scheme. The other day, I was perusing the Internet, when I came upon an online auction for a Super Multi-inator. The other day, I was perusing the Internet, when I came upon an online auction for a Super Multi-inator. I wasn't even sure what it did, but you know ZupermÃ¼hltienatÃ r  was my grandmother's maiden name. It was a sign. I had to have it, but then something terrible happened. A pop-up ad kept me from hitting the ""bid now"" button. It really hit me where I lived too. You see, I always hated advertising ever since the early '80s when I did a little product modeling to finance my first Inator. That's it. Hold the wombat closer to your face. Closer. A little closer. I don't want to talk about it. But then I realized, I could use pop-up ads to serve my own evil ends. So I've come up with a whole slew of products and services that I could advertise and my Pop-up-inator would put pop-up ads virtually everywhere! I'll make millions! (Song: Tour de Ferb)  I've got the wind in my hair, I've got the bugs in my teeth   My wheels are spinning   I got the road underneath   It's a competition but a wonderful ride   The road may be limited grade but it's a beautiful day   The sun is shining   Our path is lighting away   We can make it   As long as you're by my side   The vista's more inviting   Than it was in the brochure   And even though we're riding past a truck filled with manure   (We'll just stick to the curb)   It's the Tour de Ferb!  Right on schedule and fully documented. The best part is pop-up ads would never go away. There's a little button that says ""click here to close"", but guess what? It just opens another pop-up ad! Pop-up ad. Best idea ever. Analyzing pile Locating load-bearing wire. What? Perry the Platypus, how did you get out? Hey, not fair! Okay, no more Mr. Nice Guy! Come back here, you littleâ Uh-oh. See, I told you I got to watch my step in here. I know what you're thinking, but this is neither ironic nor funny. Are youâ Are you still there? Hello, mother. Have a nice time at the baby shower? Well Margie's got morning sickness, so there was a little incident. Ew. But now I'm clean, so no harm done. And I can see that you're dying to tell me something. Uh Not really. It's just. Mom, take a look at this. Mom, take a look at this. Okâ Your camera gets pop-up ads? What?! Nooooo!!! But it doesn't matter. I knew where the last obstacle is. Whoa! Whoa! Candace, I'm not even dressed! Sorry Mom, it's an emergency! Luckily, I've picked today to wear my bike helmet into the shower. Ah! There it is! The finish line, right on the other side of Danville Chasm. I am going to win this! Not if I can't help it! Candace, my towel! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get ready to see something really terrifying! That's better. Huh. I guess that is pretty scary. That guy should not be holding that wombat so close to his face.

Get it? Wire? 'C-'Cause, I mean wire? Ah, come on. Now, I know I'm defeated, but at least I got a good joke out of it. Show me some love. Nothing? Really? Just gonna leave me hanging here? Ha ha ha! Loser! ""Ha ha"" yourself. I am going to win this race! Ooh! The impending victory! It is as sweet asâ Greg LeMond? I thought you were supposed to be motivating me? It worked so well, that I even motivated myself. Finish line, here Iâ They need to change the battery on the tiger excluder. Boy, I'll say. I did it! I won a bike race! Thanks to Greg LeMond inspiring me. And then, you know, getting attacked by that tiger. By the way, I hope he is okay. Oh, man. I got to call my brother-in-law and tell him that his tiger got out.  We pass a couple gas stations   And a defunct flower shop   And as we're passing by this farm, the pigs all look up from their slop   (We don't mean to disturb)   Yeah   It's just the Tour de Ferb!"
"Ahh  (Song: Skiddley Whiffers)  Hey, what's the new game that your friends all wanna play?   (Skiddley Whiffers!)   Totally over when you hear somebody say   (Skiddley Whiffers!)

Double kings, baby! 'Scuse me. And here comes the big finish. Bing! Bing! Bing! Victory bell! I've broken winning streak. Oh, that feels good! But you wouldn't know about that 'cause you lost! I am the Queen of Skiddley Whiffers! Who is the Queen? I am the Queen! It sure is nice to see Candace happy. What kind of Queen? Skiddley Whiffers Queen! I mean, seriously, we've been playing this game for what? Six years? And look! I've won 19 out of 24 games this year. The last 12, in a row. It's like Skiddley Whiffers wants me to win. And consequently, you two lose! Over, and over, and over again. Skiddley Whiffers is too easy! I need to move on to a bigger challenge. A bigger challenge? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? Happy 999th lair entrance, Agent P! To commemorate this joyous occasion, we like to present you with this souvenir t-shirt. I made it myself! I'm gonna go print up some more! Just wear it for the day, i-it's good for his self-esteem. Uh, Doofenshmirtz has been spotted en route to Danville National Park. So, I guess for you it'll be a walk in the park. 'Cause you're going to the park. Where Doof is.  Doofenshmirtz's minibus camping van!  Alright everyone, we're here. Let's unpack so we can get a head start. We? Shouldn't you be off playing with your little platypus friend? What? Andâ And leave my little girl all alone in the wilderness? No way! Dad, I'm not your little girl anymore. Look at me, I'm sixteen years old! Sixteen! That's practically an adult! But, you still treat me like I'm a little kid! I just need some space, that's all. A-Are you even listening to me?! But Vanessa, what if there were a blizzard or an earthquake and-andâ You have no one to take care of you, not even kindly ocelots, like I had. Dad?! Uh, I-I could be at that campsite right overâ Go home! Okay, pumpkin. Stay safe. But what ifâ GO! I suppose you're wondering why we called all of you here today. Yeah. Actually, we were. Ferb? Ta-da! That's not clearing anything up for me. I don't care what it is. The hairdryer is mine. Alright! Nobody move! You two! You think you can just make giant thingys for all the world to see? Well, no, sir! I'm gonna put the bust on you, but good. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! So in this giant version of the classic game Skiddley Whiffers Hey, Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making some giantâ Wait. Did you say, ""Skiddley Whiffers""? Giant Skiddley Whiffers, yes. Giant Skiddley Whiffers?! That is so bustable! And yet, so tempting. And yet, so bustable! And yet, so tempting. Wanna play? Yes! I'm the sneaker! I get dibs on the truck! Boo-ya! I claim the fedora, and Ferb picks the nose! You know, real unicorns are pink. I am just saying. Our gameboard today will be Danville itself, where rich architectural heritage and natural wonders will provide the thrills. And the first player back home wins. And we don't even have to do any work, just roll a number on this electronic die and the game pieces will automatically move that many spaces across Danville. Yeah, yeah, let's get this party started! Lob it over! Six! So long, losers. One, two One, two When do I get to go? Oh! Ugh. It is going to be a long day.  Nature is our mother!  (Song: Poison Sumac)  Yeah, the trees are great!  Hey, groovy dudes and dudettes. How's it hangin'? Wanna try my seven-layer bars? Man? Uh Uh, hey there, strange man I've never met. Uh, hey there, strange man I've never met. What brings you to our campsite? And how soon can you leave? Oh, I was just passin' by, you know communing with nature and all, likeâ You know us Us hippies do it A-And I thought, you dudes might wanna few groovy pointers from an old pro. Actually, we're doing just fine. Hey! Man! You know, fire is the leading cause of fire. Whoa, whoa! Is that a Puttmaster 3000? I love these babies, they'reâ They're so far out. They almost never collapse and suffocate you while you sleep. But you know, the Tri-State Almanac says, they should be at least twenty feet from running water, and yours is an inch too close, man. Seriously? Oh, a-and you need to tie up your food or you're gonna attract bears which would make it extremely difficult to, hang loose and, be groovy. I-I've got lots of other righteous camping tips, but first, I need to get some life vests out of my van. Whoa, that guy was totally freakstyle. You have no idea. Yeah! My third favorite number! Seven trade, baby! Feel the breeze! Only because I ruled leg irons! Spoken like a true lose-ah! Next suck-ah! Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Hey, guys. How much longer do I wear the beard? Until you roll a ""shave"". Awesome! But, what's with the monocle? It's an affectation. Leave it alone. Let's see, bandages, bug spray, shoulder pads Oh, hey man, nice threads. Sorry, no scheme today, I'm just here secretly overprotecting my daughter while she's camping with some friends. It's dangerous out here, Perry the Platypus, and I should know. You see, back in Gimmelshtump in my youth When I was camping, I had this incident with a swarm of bees. I only got one sting, but it did a lot of damage. I still have a hydrant stuck in my leg, see? I'd have it removed, but the doctors say it's too close to an artery to operate. That kind of thing happens all the time in the woods! All right, maybe I'm overreacting. Actually, it's really just a beautiful pastoral setting. There's probably nothing toâ Woo-hoo! Sorry! Huh? You see? You see how dangerous it is out here? You've got to help me overprotect my daughter. Please? Please? Please? Oh, great! I know just what you can do!  Poison sumac!   Oi! Oi! Oi!  Hey, brothers and sisters, I'm back with this industrial size first aid kit, and this state of the art security system. Not to mentionâ Too sharp! Righteous. Quarantined! Acorn helmets. Better safe than sorry! Uh He's a little excitable, isn't he? Yes. Yes, he is. You have to leave! It's not safe here for little kids. I mean for practically adults. Flee! Back to the city, away from danger! Like what? Like that! See? All right, that's enough! Really, Perry? Really?! I expect more from you. A-And you, Dad! But, how did youâ Oh, please. You come out here jumping around with your costume, and your lame book, and it's It's just humiliating, Dad. I'm not a little girl anymore. Well, you're my little girl. I know, I know, but all I want to do is have a good time with my friends, and you just keep popping up. It's like you don't trust me. You're right. I'm sorry I got in your way. Iâ Y'know, I know you can handle yourself, Vanessa. C'mon, Perry the Platypus. Maybe there's still time for a scheme today. You know I-I won't even trap you. You can just start beating me up right away. Wait, I thought your dad was a pharmacist. She's right, Perry the Platypus, I've been smothering her. You know, it's just so hard to let go, as a parent. But I'm going to turn over new leaf though, I can tell you that. No more worrying, no more disguises no more rules! We're almost at the finish! Well, most of us. She'll never win now! They're right. I could lose. But I can't give up now! I'm the queen of Skiddley Whiffers. And I'm not gonna let anything break my streak. Now toss me that dice! The singular is ""die""! Wow. That was uncalled for. Wow! Twice in one day! Skiddley Whiffers is a cruel mistress. Cold and unforgiving. Woo-hoo! Take that, losers! Huh, you know, I tried to be a good parent, but sometimes it'sâ Vanessa! Anybody else allergic to bees? Me. I am. All of us? What are the odds? YOU LEAVE MY BABY GIRL ALONE! Dad, what are you doing here? It's dangerous! Really? I hadn't noticed! All right, bees. You like honey, don't ya? Come and get it! Come on! Dad! Excuse me, Perry the Platypus! Wow. Your dad is totally psychotic. Yes. Yes, he is. Woo! Thirteen wins in a row! Yeah, baby! Ding, ding, ding! A victory bell! Nice game, Candace! Yeah, for me! Woo! I totally creamed you guys in that game. And now, I'm gonna bust you for it. Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom! Hey, look what Phineas and Ferb built! You're right, Candace. Call the authorities. It's a cube! No time for sarcasm, move! Candace, watch where you're going! Whoaa! All players advance. Skiddley Whiffers, the game that keeps on playing.  Skiddley Whiffers!  Look! And I'm supposed to see But, but, but, but But, but, but, but But, but, but, but But, but, but, but So boys, do anything special today? We played Skiddley Whiffers, and Candace played with us. Oh, how sweet. Candace, did you have fun with your brothers today? Yes. Yes, I did. Thanks for pulling me out of the water, Perry the Platypus. But This shirt's a little snug, are you sure you don't have anything bigger? Nothing? Hm? Be careful with those marshmallows though, seriously. D-Do you know how many s'more related accidents happen each year in this country alone? Do you? Uh, I-I don't, but I bet it's a lot. Dad"
"So, Ferb, your cousins from England are here visiting. No, I mean your cousins from England are here visiting. Look, boys, it's your cousins visiting from England! They're here to see the exhibition football match between Danville and their beloved Snifferton Nostrils. Ooh! Nose goal! So, the Nostrils are here in the States? Yes, they've already landed and they're probably on the team bus even as we speak! (Song: Nostrils on the Bus)  Nostrils on the bus!  Ha! Fabulous! Anyway, Phineas, this is Uncle Adrian, Ady for short. Aunt Lucy Hello! and their kids, Beckham, Beckham, Pele, Beckham, Pele, and Eliza. Well, her middle name is Beckham. Hi, guys! Good heavens, Ferb! What a fine young man you've grown into. Good to know you, Phineas. I hear about you all the time. Oh, so you've been reading my newsletter? Oh, heavens no. I read Ferb's blog. Well, at least you've learned to read. Ouch! Why don't we go inside and continue our good natured sibling rivalry there. Yes, that way you won't be humiliated in front of the children. Oh, sibling rivalry is so attractive. Ady has such a healthy competitive spirit. Eliza, honey, why don't you come along? Candace is up in her room. So, cousin Ferb, you've lived in America longer than you lived in England. You haven't gone Yank on us, have you? Oh, don't worry, guys. Ferb is as British as ever! Hi, guys. What'cha doin'? Oh, hi, Isabella. Hello, everyone. I was just cleaning my room and I thought I would return some of the things Ferb lent me. Your cowboy hat, your baseball mitt, your banjo CDs, your American flag unitard Oh, and here is your bald eagle. Oh! And Phineas, here is your sack. Awesome! Come to papa! Oh, yes. Very British. What's going on? Oh, it's silly. Ferb's cousins think Ferb has lost his Britishness. Ferb's British? Apparently not. I bet you don't even play football anymore. You dweebs, that's a soccer ball. This is a football! Actually, there's no one who loves soccer more than my brother Ferb! Ferb got all of us into playing, and we've gotten pretty good if I do say so myself. But Ferb, he's the real master. Yeah, I once saw Ferb playing an entire game of soccer using a pumpkin! And he didn't even break it! To this day, his motivation for doing so remains shrouded in mystery. Well, if you are all such crackin' footballers, then we challenge you and your friends to a football match. So, what do you say? Playground rules? How about Football X-7 rules? Football X-7? That's only theoretical! Only for another couple of hours, because I know what we're gonna do today. Hey, maybe Perry wants to be on our team. Who's Perry? I apologize, Agent P. I'm a little under the weather today. First, I was convinced that Carl got me sick, you know, that all knee-jerk-blame-Carl thing but then Then we received this, this morning. Uh Hello, Major Monogram, this is Heinz, it's 7:45 on Tuesday, I'm really sick. So, I won't be able to do evil today. Anywayâ Can you believe this? He had the nerve to call in sick? I'm here, Carl's here. Don't you think I'd rather be at home, watching Ducky Momo? Agent P, you've got to get in there andâ I don't know, get him better. Stop him from stopping the things for whichâ You have to stop him Before (Song: Not as Much)  But not as much as you thought you needed me too  Brilliant! Thanks. Most of my favorite bands are British. I guess I'm kind of an Anglophile. Anglophile? I thought your family is from Wisconsin. I mean, just Candace, it just means that he likes songs that are British. Oh. I knew that. Oh, man. I gotta get home and help my mom. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Splendid! Coolness! Nice to meet you, Eliza. And you as well, Jeremy. Oh, by the way, cool accent. Cool accent? Cool accent? He's never complimented me on my accent! Now, to be fair I'm not all Britishy and sophisticated?! Oh, Candace, don't be silly. It's obvious Jeremy likes you just the way you are. Don't talk crazy! You gotta teach me how to be all Anglowishy and ladylike and proper! But Candâ Obviously my relationship with Jeremy depends on it! So, you'll help me? Yeah, all right. Hah! I've given you a sound thrashing I have! Yes, yes, you always did have more wind than I. That's my Adrian. So talented. I don't know if I would be bragging about holding my breath for 13 seconds. Well, at least Lawrence is always so gracious in defeat. Hors-d'oeuvres, anyone? I'll bet I can make myself sick eating prawny puffs before you can. Carnival ride sick or emergency room sick? Sweaty Men Playing Games Network presents Football X-7. Theoretical Speculative Conjecture or Not That What We Just Said, with the Conjecture thing? Football. Sometimes called soccer, footy, association football or the beautiful game. But, in 1952, a British theoretical physicist and football enthusiast, Professor Ross Eforp, hoped to heighten the football experience by creating the most thrilling and challenging version of soccer imaginable, which still allowed the players to survive. He called it Football X-7. He proposed building an immense gyroscopic, gravity-low stadium, creating an omnidirectional pitch allowing teams to play in 3 dimensions. After several attempts to build a Football X-7 stadium ended in disaster, most scientists, engineers and defensive mid-fielders agreed that Professor Ross Eforp's ultimate football game could never become a reality. The final blow came when it was discovered that Professor Ross Eforp's name is spelled the same forwards as it was backwards, and in the highly-charged anti-palindrome atmosphere in the mid-1950s, Professor Eforp was forced into hiding. As for Football X-7, is it possible perhaps one day, someone, some young dreamer with remarkable building and creative skills might just make Professor Ross Eforp's dream come true? No! Not a chance. Don't be ridiculous. It's impossible. Impossible?! The only thing that's impossible is impossibility. Now Ferb and I believe we figured out where Professor Eforp went wrong. Oi. Are you actually saying you're gonna build that here? Yes. We are gonna do what no one has ever done before. Play the biggest, baddest, onliest game of Football X-7 ever! Now, who's with me? We are, of course. Completely mad, the lot of them. Let's get started. Come on Ferb. We need toâ Ferb? Ferb? Ferb?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus? W-What are you doing here? Did you get my messâ Oh, is that chicken soup? What? Oh, that? I-Iâ I planned to do evil today but look at me. I-I don't think it's gonna happen. Oh, man, 103, seriously? If I was a hot tub, people would be getting out of me. They'd be all like ""Wow, Heinz Doofenshmirtz is way too hot. We should get out of him."" Anyway, since you're here, I-I taped my rehearsal. I'll just play it for you. That will be just as good. I shot this yesterday when I was feeling considerably better then. Lalalalala. Topeka, Kansas. Topeka, Kansas. Okay. So, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering why I trapped you in this soundproof capsule? Wait. Wait. If it's soundproof he won't be able to hear me Ugh! For generations, philosophers have asked ""If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" The answer, by the way obviously is, ""Of course it does."" I mean, duh! Right? Philosophers. Get a job, thinky-boy! Now, see, the question they should be asking is ""What sound does the falling tree make?"" Behold! The If-a-Tree-Fell-In-The-Forest-Inator! Dun, dun, dun! One blast from this puppy will knock over a tree or anything else for that matter, and the sound it will make will be Doofenshmirtz I will have eternal fame as the answer to that one philosophical question! I'm also working on a Sound-of-One-Hand-Clapping-Inator. Doo-Fen-Shmirtz. I'll corner the markets! And speaking of markets, I'm out of vitamins. I should really get some before they close But, eh. So I skipped my Vitamin C for one day. What's the worst that could happen? Not one word, Perry the Platypus. You have to at least give me a chance to do my thing, okay? Good, here we go. Where is it? Here we go. There. I trapped you. Okay, so what's next? I activate my -inator, okay. Give me a head start here. I'll get there, don't worry! Oh, man. That thing is gonna be huge! I'm gonna go get my mom! Er, Candace, did you know that tattling is not very ladylike? It's not? Afraid not, no. I've five little brothers myself, so you can imagine the discipline it takes. No busting?! You asked me to teach you how to be proper and sophisticated for Jeremy. But, but But, but Ugh! Right. I can do this. Good girl. The first lesson for a lady-in-training is about posture. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why this is, but from birth, all proper ladies are warned that they must stand and sit completely vertically straight, and even the tiniest bend or deviation on one side will lead directly to a life of horror and destitution. Makes sense.  It's frightfully terribly hard to be a lady  (Song: Lady Song)  There's so many Ps and Qs you have to mind   But the rewards I guarantee are rich and varied   And worth all of the effort, you will find   Your posture must be perfect   And your diction crisp and clear   Your speaking voice mellifluous and pleasing to the ear   Your legs are crossed when seated   Your toes are pointed so   Your pinkies raised while drinking   But that's not all you need to know   You mustn't curse or spit or tattle, never gossip   A lady never scratches, sweats, or burps   She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when   And if soup is served it's impolite to slurp   It's always ""please and thank you, sir or madam""   Never brash or loud or putting on a show   A lady is demure, reserved and proper   And that is really all you need to know!  I don't get it. What, do polite people not have bookshelves in your country? Lady and gentlemen, I give you the Football X-7 stadium! Whoa! That's brilliant! I'm totally gobsmacked! Yeah, I guess I could smack a little gob myself. Now it all comes down to the game. Are you ready? Well, yeah! How about you, Ferb? Oh, no! I was afraid something like this would happen. What will we do? We'll be right back. Ferb's soccer problem started a few months ago, right before summer began. Um, actually, that's a little early in the day. Okay, closer. A little later than that. Whoa, what is that, night? Back it up to about the middle of the third quarter. Like, there! Right there. Thank you. So anyway, we were having a great game. Ferb, as always, was in top form. Little did I know it would be Ferb's last game. Late in the second period, the other team had kicked the ball out-of-bounds, and Ferb grabbed it. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, a herd of emu ran onto the field and carried off our assistant coach. Ferb simply put the ball down and walked off the field. That was it. Ferb hasn't played football since. I don't blame him, poor fellow. It's the Emu Curse. The Emu Curse? It goes like this. If you're holding the ball, and a herd of emus carries off your assistant coach, then you're cursed to never be on a winning team again. Wow. British curses are really specific. Well, no wonder he disappeared. We're gonna have to break that curse! Good luck, mate. To break the Emu Curse, a boy wearing a Sunday bonnet must sing the note Eâ­ above high C in front of the cursed one. Eâ­ above high C? Whoa! Wait a second, who's got a piccolo? Buford? Ugh! One day somebody's gonna ask me for some obscure musical instrument, and it ain't gonna be there. What's gonna happen then? What is that ringing? I-Is that Eâ­ above high C? Oh, for crying out loud, Perry the Platypus, really? Really, you're thwarting the ill? Here it is! The Football X-7 stadium! Complete with omnidirectional hover goals and observation deck/high tea room! Wow It's designed so that the ground hugs your feet, making it possible to literally walk on walls! So the goals can be scored from any angle. Brilliant. Let's play. I wish we could. Yeah, we don't have a team without Ferb. Yeah. He was our quarterback. You still do not know what game we are playing, do you? You do realize without a full team you forfeit the match? Don't worry, you guys. If I know my brother, he'll come through for us! Ferb? Hi, guys! I brought some dry ice! Aww. Oh, and I brought Ferb, too. Ferb! Ferb, you came to play! As long as my team will have me, curse and all. Of course we will! It's not about winning, it's about the joy of the game! Actually, it's about winning. (Song: Football X-7)  Oh yeah!   In 1959, soccer was sublime   And one man was looking for something more nifty   But Eforp's dream was way too extreme   For the palindrome-fearing people of the 50s   A number and a letter it don't get any better than Football X-7   Football X-7   Call it soccer or football or the beautiful game   But it just got a brand new name   Yeah, Football X-7   Football X-7   Football X-7   Football X-7   Yeah!  Why, Jeremy! How delightful it is to see you again! Hey, Candace. You look great? Do come in! Okay. So, what do you think? High tea andâ Whoa, cool! What're they doin'? Some sort of silly game. As a lady, I'm not terribly interested in such foolishness. I'm much more interested in curtsying and other dainty pursuits. Hi, Jeremy! Doesn't Candace look lovely? Yeah. I can't say I've seen better posture. Would you care to stack books on my head? No, I'm cool. Well, why don't you two sit and chat while I fetch tea? That sounds divine! Shall we? Of course! Have you noticed my extended pinkies? I was just about to comment on them. They're really up there. Why, thank you. You know, it's a little unusual. Here we are sitting in the very heart of a giant soccer stadium your brothers built in your yard and you haven't once shown any desire to bust them. Oh, dear boy. No, no. A lady never tattles. Just one more Just one more Just one more Oh, can't do it! Oh, darn it. Ha! I'm wearing more shirts than you. Oh, brother. It's hard not to root for him, isn't it? I think I'll manage. Excuse me for a second. Oh, hello, dear. Uh, Lawrence, what's going on here? I've seen you put on more shirts than that. Well, I'll let you in on a little secret. I let him win all these contests. Look how happy it makes him! Yeah, I can see that. But, you know what, honey, as humble and gracious as you are, and I love that about you, next time, destroy him. Pardon? Smear the punk. Annihilate him. Make him cry. he's not. You're awesome, he's not. You're awesome Got it. Oh, hey, Ady, how about one last little event? Keepy-Uppy? Keepy-Uppy? Are you mad? I have never lost a game of Keepy-Uppy in my life. Well, you won't mind humoring me then. I'm going to activate my You know the rest. Doofenshmirtz Whoa, check it out, Perry the Platypus. I'mâ I'm totally beating you inadvertently. And when I say inadvertently, Iâ I mean completely vertently You know, fighting you makes me feel a little better. It's a It's a good feeling. Like a comfy old sweater or something Like an old friend. Yes Like a comfy old big woolen friend named Joy C. Terrific from the hinterlands. I'm literally just blathering now.  Nostrils on the bus!

Lawrence, stop showing off, or you're gonna blow it. Don't worry, darling, I've got thiâ Oh, whoops. Well, Lawrence, it looks like you've lost again. Yes, it does look that way, doesn't it? However, looks can be deceiving.  Nostrils on the bus!  Is it my imagination, or is that a Football X-7 stadium? It's your imagination. That's just a mailbox. But there is one on this side of the bus. Candace, I can't help but notice your accent there. Candace, I can't help but notice your accent there. Why, yes. Do you like it? I thought an Anglophile such as yourself might appreciate the soothing lilt of the Queen's English. An Anglophile such as myself? Oh, ha! I get it. Well, yes. I could listen to you speak like that all day. Really? I like it so much better than how you were before. I like it so much better than how you were before. You do? Of course. I'm so glad you finally decided to change everything about yourself. What?! You didn't like how I was before? But isn't that why you changed? So I would like you better? Well, yeah, but This isn't really Oh, wait. You're totally messing with me. Yes, I am totally messing with you. Now, would you please knock off the phony British stuff and go back to being my girl? You got it, bub. So, how are we doing over here? Turns out Jeremy liked me how I was before. Um, shocker. Now if you two will excuse me, I've got some brothers to bust. There's my girl. Phineas and Ferb! You are so busted! Well, I don't need this goofy thing anymore. Pass me the ball! Ferb! The Eâ­ above high C! From a boy in a Sunday bonnet! The curse, it's broken! We can actually win this thing! Pass it to Ferb, pass it to Ferb! I am kinda in the middle of something here! I got it! No! Yes! Run! Ha, it missed the goal by a mile. What happened? I guess the curse wasn't broken. No, it's broken. Sometimes, you just miss. Hello! It's the Snifferton Nostrils! Ooh! Nose goal! What a beautiful kick! But he missed the goal! It's not whether you score the goal. It's how good you look while kicking the ball. A-Actually, i-it is about making goals. I'm awesome, you're not. I'm awesome, you're not Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Just a second, Candace. I'm awesome, you're not. Your father's doing his victory dance! I'm awesome, you're not. I'm awesome, you're not. So, you're just gonna give us this X-7 stadium? Sure, we do that kind of thing all the time! Yes! Once they gave a monster truck arena to Buck Buckerson! Was that you? Thank you, Phineas. That's very generous of you. Hey, everyone! Yes, Nostrils? See this thing? Do you mean the Football X-7 stadium? Would you all help us load this on the bus? We would all like that very much, what you just said. I'm awesome, you're not. I'm awesome, you're not. Is that a Football X-7 stadium? I knew it could be done! Professor Ross Eforp can finally come out of hiding! Mummy, that man's name is a palindrome. Look away, Johnny, look away. Man, you can get these fans to do anything. Thanks again, Phineas and Ferb!  Nostrils on the bus!  You see, Mom? Absolutely nothing. Oh, I'm thinking some very unladylike things right now. That's our girl! Oi. Cousin Ferb, we're dreadfully sorry for giving you such a hard time. You're a brilliant footballer, an all-around good chap and a Brit through and through. Actually lads, I'm not a Brit or a Yank. I'm just Ferb.  Nostrils on the bus!   It's not public transport   It's a sports-themed charter   Association football   Nobody's rockin' harder   When you think about it   All you need to know about us is that   We are the Nostrils and we're on this bus!

Our sources tell us the members of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., the League Of Villainous Evildoers Maniacally United For Frightening Investments in Naughtiness, are about to gather to elect their new leader. But we don't know where or how. See if you can gain access, and we'll survey the situation remotely through your wrist communicator. Mom, you've gotta see what Phineas and Ferb made. I don't know what it is, but it looks horrible. I'll be home right after I finish my errands. But you gotta come home now before it disappears! What's that? You're breaking up! Wait, Mom! Ugh! I hate when she does But it doesn't matter. I'm not going anywhere. Right in there. You've heard of a ship in a bottle? Well, you're a Perry the Platypus in a bottle.

Welcome to the first annual L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Pageant of Evil where these three gentlemen will vie for the chance to tell you what's what. I thought I was already confirmed. Prepared my speech and everything. In addition to gaining total control of the iron hand of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., our contestants will each receive a commemorative flashlight Agent P, it's come to our attention that Lawrence Fletcher, from your host family, has somehow entered the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Supreme Ruler Pageant. Of course, considering his genial nature, a win for him would really stretch my suspension of disbelief. But just in case, you better sit tight and just observe. Remember, points will be awarded by the audience, so get out your voting boxes. Our first evil event, the mechanical mother. Show us how you treat the old lady, Larry! Wish me luck, boys. Hello, old dear, so lovely to see you. I've brought you some peonies. Oh, such a nice boy. I didn't think anyone could be more incompetent at being evil than you. Me neither. And now, he's serving her tea without a trace of irony! Remember to keep that foot elevated. What a lovely, old girl. Prepare yourself for a stunning display of filial beastliness. Yeah, knock yourself out, Rodney. Hello, Mother. I've brought you something special! For me? You're such a goodâ Ooh! Dirty laundry! And there go the waterworks. Yeah, that's how it's done, boys. Oh! My baby still needs me! Oh, no! Tears of joy? Zero points for that move! Ooh, you monster. Watch and learn, Rodney. I am getting married again. Audience, get your votes in, please. I don't know how you did it! I didn't even think I understood the event, but good show! And we're back with everyone's favorite, the swimwear competition! Here comes Lawrence Fletcher, wearing swim attire inspired by the legendary Klimpaloon, the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas! Watch out for that Yeti, Larry! Next up is Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Wait, I thought this was the talent competition! It won't stop flushing! And last is Rodney in his Oh, my gosh! Technically, it is a swimsuit. Meat? What possible functionality could that have? Oh, come on, Rodney, the last event's about toâ What? Wait, that's my Make-Everything-Evil-inator! No, Doofy, it's my Make-Everything-Evil-izer.

You quitâ You broke my Izer! Inator! Inator! Inator! Inator! Shut it! No, you shut it! Have you seen these flashlightsâ Uh-oh. Excuse us. We're here to take, uh This thing away. What? No! Sorry, kid. We got a work order right here. No! Nooooo! And now the final event where each of our three contestants will attempt to intimidate the others with only the force of his evil glare. Contestants, take your marks. Get set. And begin! The voting has started! Look at those fingers go! Rodney is off to an early lead. It's the pointy-ear advantage! But, wait! What's this? Fletcher has his eyes covered. He's not even trying! This could be a real opportunity for Doofenshmirtz! He leers at Rodney. Rodney returns it. With a point! A classic gambit! The scores are really ticking up now and Wait! There's a stirring in the Fletcher corner. Something's happening Such evil! Oh, my eyes! And the crowd is going wild! Fletcher's numbers are skyrocketing! Agent P, our sensors reveal that Lawrence Fletcher has been shot with a Make-Everything-Evil-izer. If he should become the supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., we will have no choice but to reassign you. You must find a way to snap him out of it. Remind him of his true, good nature. Remind him who he used to be! This is the one, Bro. I can feel it. I now present to you, the new supreme leader of L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N Lawrence Fletcher! Today, Danville! Tomorrow, the world! We have term limits in L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N., right? Nope! Bullseye! I think that's Dad. What was the topic of his lecture again? Hi, Dad! Phineas! Ferb! What are you doing here? Brilliant shot, by the way. Ah, it's all about little adjustments. Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! It's mine! Ooh, I hate you! So, how'd it go, Dad? I'm not absolutely sure, boys, but I think I just became King of the Pharmacists. Awesome! Oh, there you are, Perry. Ugh! No! Not until Mom has seen it. Sorry, miss, I-I got a job to do.

Yes, we can!  Why?  'Cause we're evil   Evil   Evil tonight!"
"Trick or treat! Well, now, would you look at this, Martha? We've got Frankenstein, Count Dracula, and some kind of Igor, or something. And if it isn't little Candace Flynn! Where's your costume? ""Where's your costume""?! I haven't worn my hair like this in 2 years! Get with the Halloween spirit, Candace! Please. Trick-or-Treating is for kids. I'm like, way more mature than that. I'm walking with you until we get to Jeremy's, and then I am outta here. There they are. I thought we'd never catch up. Goin' old school this year, I see. Sweet. No costume, huh, Candace? Ugh! Nice fairy princess costume! Where'd you get it? Actually, I'm not wearing a costume. Oh, okay. I got it at the Googolplex Mall. What kind of person hands out these weird, orange peanuts? We gotta find a better neighborhood. That's strange. I've never seen this place before. You'd think we would've noticed it. I'm gonna give those orange peanuts a second look. What's that? Hi, I'm Russell. I live here. Oh, rustle, like the leaves. What are you trying to do, scare us? No. Hiding in the leaves makes me feel warm and secure. Relatively speaking. Why do you not just go inside? In there? It's haunted! Cool! No, not cool! The horrifying screams, moving shadows, floating objects, ghosts, zombies, vampires. It's really freaking me out, man! The light under his chin makes his story pretty convincing. Actually, there is no scientific evidence for the existence of ghosts. What do you know? You're a daffodil! Daisy! Case closed! Maybe we can help you, Russell. Got anything for ghosts, Ferb? Whoa. Looks like we're in business! Let's bust us some ghosts! Hold it there, fella! Nobody's doin' any busting around here without me! Sure, we'll all go! Coming, Russell? If I have to. Oh, please. Oh, this always happens. Don't panic, anyone! How can I panic when I'm holding your hand? I think that's my hand. Ew! Hey! Where is Perry? Quit it, Baljeet! Hello, Agent P. Welcome to the Company Halloween Party. Try the punch, it's wicked good. Just be sure to use a coaster. Certain people can be downright persnickety. Psst. Agent P, it's me, Carl! Had you fooled, didn't I? I've got the monobrow, the whiskery mustache, but I couldn't get both my eyes on the same side of my nose. He's like a Picasso, or something. Where is your coaster, Carl? Sorry, sir. What do you think? Nice costume, huh? My lip feels so naked. Sorry to interrupt the festivities, but we've been receiving some weird intelligence. The Danville Golf Course's chewed down to bare dirt, strange howling to the moon, graffiti at every leather shop at the Tri-State Area. And, we don't know what to make of this crop circle. Get to the bottom of it, Agent P! ""Get to the bottom of it, Agent P!"" That's not how I sound, Carl! ""That's not how I sound, Carl!"" Come on, most of the ghosts are this way. Good, let's bust them and hit the road. I'm missing Jeremy's party! Ghosts. There is no such thing. Look! My EMF readings are 3 milligauss. Normal background radiation. And when we point it at the room, it is also Well, that cannot be right. Did we even make these things with double digit displays? Um Aren't you a little young to be hunting ghosts? Yes! Yes, we are! It's totally like this all the time!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, Perry the Platypus, I was hoping you would come. Wh-Whatâ This? Yeah, I had to place myself in restraints. There's a perfectly good explanation though. It all started a couple of days ago, when I declared war on grass. I-It's not a point why exactly. L-Let's just say, grass got on my bad side. Grass and me, we're on the outs, big time So I got myself a cow, the natural predator of grass. It was slow-going. What I needed was a cow that was motivated not by hunger, but by a powerful hatred of grass likeâ Like my own. Burning antipathy, so I invented the Mind-transfer-inator to give that cow a piece of my mind! And as it turned out, cow brain, not a lot of room in there for new ideas. That would have been it, but I started having these gaps in my memory. I had a strange craving to lick salt and I found myself watching the nightly farm report and the Pasture Channel way more than usual. I-I began to get a sense that I was not quite, human anymore which isâ Which is why I'm in the restraints andâ Actually, it stinks 'cause tonight's Halloween, you know, that's totally my thing, you know, the only holiday to celebrate evil, and here I am in theseâ Wait. Oh, no! Oh, no! It's happening again! It's happening toâ! Three more years till the pension kicks in, and I am so outta here! There are no monsters in America. What a genius. (Song: Were-Cow)  Get ready for udder terror   'Cause you're just some cud that he's gonna chew   And you never had steak any rarer   So you better beware of the Moo!   'Cause we got a were-cow   Were-cow on the rampage!   You know I think this warning should suffice   Were-cow   Were-cow on the rampage!   Oh look out, he's gonna chew you twice!   Were-cow   Were-cow on the rampage!  Open up! Come on, open up! It won't budge! Quickly! At least it was only a 78 on the meter, right? How could this be worse? Well, sometimes the floor gives out. I gotta say, this is a really non-traditional use of interior space. Don't all houses have this? I am a tremulous voice! I like to play. And that's scary I'm not a ghost I'm a sheet, that lives! This could be related to your problem. I'm not alive anymore. Across the river, we'll be safe in that house! River?! How big is this basement? This is really the wrong color and viscosity for water! Don't pop my bubble, man! Brains! Spleen! Pancreas-es! Did I mention the zombies? Let's get out, let's get out! Kidneys! I don't care for organs, but I do enjoy a cucumber sandwich. Dash it all, they broke my saucer. Danville meadows, where yesterday, thousands of layers of grass were scentously cut down in their prime. Officials believe the responsibility for this pasture massacre lies with the were-cow. And locals are advised to stay off their lawns. Forget that! I say we get him! Yeah! Wait a minute. You brought a torch on our date? Hello?! Pitchfork?! Whaâ Whatâ Whatâ Whaâ Whatâ Whatâ Whaâ Whatâ Whatâ Wherâ Wait, where am I? How didâ? What's that awful taste in my mouth? And when did I do all this beautiful landscaping? Oh, no! Oh, Perry the Platypus, thank goodness you're here! Quickly, we have to get me back to my lab before I moo again! Or mow, 'cause, you know, see, it's grass and you mow grassâ There he is! Let's get him!  Well they've got pitchforks and other implements of farming   I don't think they're in a planting mood   And if they catch up to you, it's gonna be alarming  He could be hiding behind any one of these poles! Look, we're in luck! Over there!  So you'd better hoof it out of there, dude!   Yeah, we got a were-cow   Were-cow on the run!   And they look like they got a score to settle!   Were-cow   Were-cow on the run!   They're gonna poke you with some rusty metal!   Were-cow!  First, take three cups of flour Dead end! Relax and stay awhile. Stay forever! ""Nobody busts but me"" Smart! Wait a minute. If you're a ghost, and you have a pumpkin head, what did that make you when you were alive? The probability of a humanoid vegetable hybrid is exceedingly remote. Look! Sparks! It was a ghost robot? No. Just a regular one. I think there's something strange not going on here. Ah, darn serval motors. You guys really gave us a heck of a workout. Us? I'm Russell's dad, Waylon. And I'm his mom, Mona. Russell, Waylon and Mona? They're like, theme for Halloween or something! But our equipment! How did youâ? Ta-da! A frequency emitter! You sly dog, Russ. We've got them all over the place. Hey, what's that in your ear? How did you do that? Sorry. That's a trade secret! Wow! This is one of the best Halloween tricks ever! Yeah. Blah, blah, blah, lovefest. Some of us have somewhere to be! Yeah, but before we go, how about one more trick? Well, um Wow! A mob of angry ghosts chasing a were-cow! How do you do it? Um smoke? And mirrors! Ugh Good night, Phineas. Good night Ferb. Good night, Russel! Good night! Good night! Happy Halloween! Good night, kids! Good night! Good night, Phineas! Good night, Ferb! Good night, kids! You know, for a minute there, I thought that there really were ghosts. The old house! It's gone! We're just, uh, packing it up for the season. Isn't this the moment in one of these things when someone really turns into a ghost? Dude, that's it! Oh, okay. See you next year!"
"You can't fly away from us, Jared! Ha! Now you're trapped! He's bent the gate! His vampire strength won't save him this time. Wow, super vampire strength. And he's super cute. Shh! Oh, look! He has no reflection in that mirror. I can't see my hair! Oh, look, Stacy! He's cornered. Now he's really stuck. Shh! Speaking of 'stuck', what's up with this floor? Jared, Michael! Don't do this! It's the end of the line, Jared. I'd expect this from your kind, Michael. Football players, I mean. But Kristen, we were both moody outcasts. We.. We loved each other! Yes. Yes, we did. We did, and Wait a minute. Wasn't he just wearing a shirt? You'll no longer drink the blood of those you love. Wait, those drapes were a gift from myâ The hideous light of the day star! Where did that wind come from? Oops, sorry. I opened the window. It was getting stuffy in here. That was the best movie ever. Yeah, I know. Imagine if you had to choose between a blood-thirsty undead walking corpse and a slobbering hairy-lupine manbys for a boyfriend. What could possibly be cooler? Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Careful with that promotional bat, it's rented. Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! You really rented a bat? Yeah I know, it seemed like a good idea at the time. Oh, no, I think it's really paying off here. get off me! Get off me! Get off me! get off me! Get off me! Get off me! get off me! Get off me! Get off me! I know what you mean, Ferb. It does seem like more than 104 days. Boys, I'm off to Bobbi's. If you need anything, your father's inside watching television. Well, this isn't much of a horror movie. Where are the rock-and-roll musical numbers? Oh, and Ferb, you left your pen on the kitchen table. Have fun today. I'll be back later. Bye, Mom! I was wondering where that went. Okay, Ferb, let's have a look through our blueprints. Cookie-powered jet car, haunted office building ride with temp-ghosts, a reenactment of the battle of Danville? Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? Trying to pick something to do today. What's that? This is Bambina, my bamboo. Only, she's not doing so well. She needs help. The poor girl probably just needs some sunlight. Ferb and I can rake up a super growth lamp in no time. You'd do that for me? Sure! Ferb, I know what we'reâ Hey! How come you guys are making something special for her? What about me? And me? It's a nerd carrier. I had a heck of a time getting him in. Scratched me all up! I'd like something, too! How long have you been there? I'm not sure. What's today? Ferb, I know what we're doing today. Taking requests. Hey, where's Perry? Oh. Oh, Agent P! How long have you been sitting there? Guess I'd better get started. We received a weird message from Dr. Doofenshmirtz this morning, claiming that he will no longer seek to take over the Tri-State Area. And he used a very unusual method for conveying his message. Carl? He wrote a letter by hand, then put it in an envelope and sent it through the regular mail with a stamp and everything! Who does that? And it's scented. Hmm Milbank Nights. One of the better perfumes to come out of South Dakota. When an evil scientist sends fragrant letters, wrongdoing can't be far behind. Dismissed, Agent P! Carl! Let me uh smell that letter again, would you? You know, Candace, you're just lucky that bat didn't bite you. I mean, what if it was a vampire bat? Me, a vampire? Don't be silly, Stacy. It would be cool to have super strength though. And be able to fly. Yeah, but you'd never be able to see yourself in the mirror again. How would you put on your makeup?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Perry the Platypus, didn't you get my letter? Oh, of course not. Here, I-I'll read it to you. ""Dear Perry the Platypus. I know Major Monogram will ignore my letter and send you to stop me. That's why you are now trapped. Best wishes, your nemesis, Heinz."" Come to think of it, it wouldn't have made much sense until now, it's probably good that you didn't get it earlier. It would have just been confusing, and I would have been stuck with having to explain it to you. Speaking of stuck, you've landed on a square of the stickiest surface known to man. It's a tile from the floor of the Danville Multiplex. I discovered it when I went to go see that teen vampire movie. Loved it! And now Behold, the Gimmelshtump-inator! See, Perry the Platypus, I've been setting my sights too high, I think. Trying to subdue a modern city, I need to conquer a backward land where people are superstitious. That's why I'm going to turn the Tri-State Area into a reasonable flexibility of Gimmelshtump. The buildings, the clothing, the more easily conquered backward mindset. Here's a sample, look. My beautiful modern state-of-the-art bathroom is changed into a Gimmelshtumpian potter room. Ah, that takes me back. Well, I gotta get home, Stacy. Jeremy's supposed to drop off my MP3 player this afternoon on his way to work. Well, don't attack him, Ms. Undead! Right. As if. Jeremy won't be here for another couple minutes. That gives me just enough to time to bust Phineas and Ferb. Okay, you guys are so Hey, they're not here. What's this? This stuff's way below their usually bustable level. I wonder what they're doing out here with Dad's old barbells. Hey, I've never been able toâ Super strength. What if there really was a vampire bat? Candace, get a hold of yourself. I mean, it's not like I can fly. Oh, my gosh! Okay, there's only one way to know for sure. A mirror. Oh, no! No reflection! Two minutes earlier Okay, Ferb, let's run through the list. To fulfill Isabella's request, we've rigged a super bright grow-light to imminently go on and off as Bambina needs it. Next, Baljeet's request to lift heavy objects accomplished by using gravity-counter acting barbells. Check. I am so happy. I have just torn my roti-cal curve. Buford's request to float in the air using levitation air jets in the lawn. Now I can look down on everyone. Last up is Irving's request to be invisible. Accomplished with this mirror-shape live video playback and effects screen. Sweet! Two and a half minutes later Is it possible? Am I a vampire? The hideous light of the day star! I am a vampire. I must hide myself! Now, what's gonna be the first part of the Tri-State Area to get the Gimmelshtump makeover? Oh, yeah? Take that! Oh, not theâ Not the forehead, not the forheâ I don't know if you noticed or not but I was a boxing champion in my middle-school back in Gimmelshtump, and I got a few moves inâ Candace? I brought your MP3 player withâ Don't look at me! I have to get away from you, Jeremy! For your own protection. Oh, hey, Mr. Fletcher. Oh! Candace! Hey! I have to find Phineas and Ferb! They'll know how to change me back. Did Candace just jump over that fence? You had to take her to the vampire movie, didn't you? (Song: Vampire Song)  It's not romantic or that cool   To live forever more!   Or when you have to buy your undead things   From Danville's one Goth store!   I'm a grim and lonely vampire teen   Living in a brightly lit suburban dream   I should sleep, sleep, sleep 'til the day is done   But I'm a lost little vampire in the sun!  Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Quit it! Yeah, my dad said I could drive it, just as long as I didn't get a scratch on it. Oh, my dad's gonna kill me! Why, dude? It's not scratched. Jeremy! Oh, hey, Candace! Did you come to pick up your MP3 player? Huh? Noâ No! Have you seen my brothers? Sure. Yeah, they were just here. They went home to look for you. Oh, no! Villagers! Vhat about your music box, mitt ze Tiny Cowboy? Oh, no! More villagers! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! Gotta get home! You don't stand a chance with that tile still stuck to your feet. My knee again, really?! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Time, time, time! I need a bathroom break. I'll be right back, okay? Don't do anything until I get back, okay? Don't touch a thing. I'll be rightâ Uh Oh What was that? Well, now it's scratched. Curse you, Perry the Platâ Oh. Never mind! Phineas, open the door! Open the door, open the door. Open the door, open the door. There's angry villagers out here. Open the door! Hey, Candace, what's wrong? There's a bunch of villagers and they're after me. You mean those guys? Candace, I think they prefer to be called marathoners. Why would marathoners be following anyone? Besides, you know, three guys from Kenya. Because I'm a vampire, Phineas. What makes you think you're a vampire? Well, I can lift heavy objects and I can levitate and and I can't see my reflection in the mirror. It sounds like a vampire to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come here Ferb, come here. I think I know what's going on here. Candace, when you discovered that you had these powers, were you in the backyard? Yeah, why? Oh, Candace, that was just some stuff we made for our friends. You're not a vampire, look, I'll prove it. See? The sun has absolutely no effect on you. Ferb, we're gonna need a dustpan and some glue.  When you have to buy your undead things   From Danville's one Goth store!   I'm a grim and lonely vampire teen   Living in a brightly lit suburban dream   I should sleep, sleep, sleep 'til the day is done   But I'm a lost little vampire in the sun!"
"Nice to see you boys down here at the shop! Wow! What's that thing? Oh, this? It's an escape chamber from an old vaudeville show. In the old days, men would go into these things and pretend to be locked inside and then they would escape to the amazement of the crowd. Here, let me show you. You see, all you need to do is just Underneath itâ Andâ And, uh Um You need a little help, Dad? Look, um Wellâ No, I know. I justâ No, no. I just need toâ Oh! Thank yâ Hah! There we go. Thanks, son. Well, I've got bottle caps to polish. Dude! I know what we're gonna do today! Oh, no. I'm late for my Introduction to Ice Sculpture. I suppose there's no need to wake her. Where's Perry? And the salad fork is the one on the outside. And you're certain of thatâ Ah, Agent P! As you may know, this is International Good Manners Day. Perhaps, not ironically, Dr. Doofenshmirtz has chosen this very week to create a device that causes rampant rudeness. Go take care of it. If you please. I bet he calls it the Rude-inator. What does that make you? Nostradamus? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls! My brother and I are here today to give you a thrilling display of escapement arts as we attempt to extricate ourselves from this the most complicated trap ever devised by man or child! A computer-controlled tower so fiendishly clever that its blueprints had to be viewed in a smoked mirror to avoid driving its creators insane! Wow, he's really selling it hard. But, if you designed the tower, will you not know every way to get out? We programmed it to learn as it goes, so it's conceivable we could be trapped in there forever. Coming with? Yes! No! I mean, no. No! No. It sounds ill-advised. That's okay. You guys can stay out here and be the cheering section with Candace. Must bust Phineas and Ferb. But, what if you do not come out? If we're not out in 15 minutes, you can smash the machine and rescue us, just like in the old days. Sounds like a party. Ferb? Start the timer, please! Women and children and the faint of heart may wish to leave now. So, we bid you adieu! Goodbye! Auf wiedersehen! Farewell, friends! And we'll see you in a few minutes! Or not at all! Legally speaking, what is our liability here?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  A-ha! I-I wanted to say something clever about ""cat got your tongue"", but I haven't worked it out. You see, when we were small children, my brother Roger was always better at the whole manners and etiquette thing. Sweet Aunt Effie, you have always been my favorite! Roger, so polite. Heinz? That's some mole! It takes a long time to clean out a chicken coop with a spoon. And I still don't see how that was rude. I mean, that thing was gargantuan. If anything, I was showing restraint. Anyway, today, it is International Good Manners Day, and we've got a visiting dignitary. She's the Ambassador from England! Only the most etiquette-y country in the whole world, hello? And when Roger's introducing her, I'm going to zap him with my Rude-inator! That's what I'm calling it. It makes whoever it zaps intolerably rude! He'll cause an international incident and in all the confusion, I'll just waltz in and take over! So, why the catsuit? Well, we're going to be at City Hall to watch the fireworks, you and me, and I figured a platypus in a fedora might attract too much attention! Smart, huh? See, me. Always thinking. Good day to you, Tower. We're ready to begin. Welcome, boys. We're going to have so much fun together. Put on your coats and stay a while. Strait-jackets. Classic. Ready? Okay, shake me out. Awesome! This is gonna be fun. I don't know, Ferb. I think we should file this under Dungeon Escape. Well, here we are! Right up close! You sit here, Perry the Catypus. I just came up with that. That totally makes up for missing the ""cat got your tongue"" thing from before. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to City Hall on this fine first day of National Etiquette Week. I do love proper etiquette! Hmm. Big keys, tiny doors. We're not fitting through any of those, but maybe that one! Ferb, you're a genius! Nice warm up, boys. But, can you escape the relentless pull of gravity? It's the Bottomless Pit Trap! It would be terrible if they did not come out! I know! I'm countin' on it. And to speak further on this topic, it is my great pleasure to introduce the Ambassador from England, the most etiquette-y country in the world Told ya! and my personal friend, this unbelievable windbag right here. Oh, man! On and on and on in the limo over here. ""Manners are so important."" Can you believe this, Perry theâ Oh, for Pete's sake, Perry the Platypus. I told you to go before we left. Well, he better bring back some popcorn, that's all I can say. what a pompous know-it-all you are. That's it, I want a recall. Recall! Recall! Recall! Recall! Recall! Recall! It's working! Recall! Recall! Recall! Wait! I've got it. Give me your hands. Come on, Tower! Is that the best you can can throw at us? Ooh-hoo-hoo, so special. I don't give a flying buttress. Tower, are you feeling okay? Oh, what's it to you? Oh, nothing, nothing. I thought we programmed you to be more polite than this. You think you're so sharp, don't you? I'm gonna show you something sharper. I think there may be something wrong with the Tower. I'm taking suggestions here. Okay, dude, don't show off. (Song: Breakin' Out)  I used to get stuck on the simplest of things   I never tried flying or spreading my wings   What I want to convey is that I'm getting away   'Cause tonight I'm breaking out!   (He's breaking out)   I went from park to neutral now I'm shifting to drive   'Cause you gotta depart if you want to arrive   No more biding my time with these eternal rhymes   'Cause tonight I'm breaking out!   (I'm breaking out)   From the things that were holding me back   (I'm breaking out)   In every wall if you look there's a crack   (I'm breaking out)   In the end that's what life's all about   When the wall's closing in, you know it's time to begin   Breaking out!  Oh, my gosh! It is almost time. What if they can't get out? How come you guys didn't tell me about this before? Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma. Made it! Boy, that was close! Was it scary? Was it hard? Do I still get to smash the tower? I ain't done with you yet. Wow! I thought I had a bad attitude. Recall! Recall! and so's your sister! Wow, such rudeness! This is working better than I ever imagined. Miss High-and-Mighty English Manners Person, I have got one thing to say to you. And only one thing. That's some show we just put on, isn't it, Madam Mayor? What theâ You see, your wonderful Mayor and I agreed in the limousine to put on this little play for your edification. No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Indeed, what would we be without manners? Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Four more years! Curse you, Perry the Platypus. I didn't even get my popcorn. Wait. It they were faking it, what did my ray hit? Ooh, it looks like you two losers are still trapped. Might as well change your address, 'cause you're gonna be receiving your pension in here. Oopsie, activated my vacuum circuits. You dummies don't need air, do you? I'm feeling such an odd mixture of pride and mortal terror. Don't worry, I'll get you out in just a sec. You guys are on your own. Well, thanks for trying, I guess. No problem. What are friends for? Friends? I've been programmed to trap you and your friends. Oh, yeah Do me a favor. Next time you want to make a fiendishly clever computer-controlled contraption, call one of your other friends. Hey! That's it! Tower, you were programmed to trap Ferb and me and our friends. But we've got friends all over Danville. Is that so? In fact, we have friends all over the Tri-State Area. Well, aren't we popular? Plus there was that small matter of circumnavigating the globe. You're right. Tokyo, Paris, Nepal. We have friends all over the Earth. Look at me, I've got friends all over the Earth. All right then. In fact, we even have an alien friend named Meap. He's from another planet. So, really, we have friends all over the galaxy. A small matter for one such as me. You will never escape! Never! That works for me. Well, they only make mallets so big. See ya. So, the entire galaxy. That enough elbow room for ya? Well, for today. At last, after two millennia, we finally reached the Milky Way Galaxy. Battle stations! We begin our assault in three, two Oh! Uh Anybody got a mallet?"
"Thanks for helping me set up for the Latke Festival this year, guys! It'll really go a long way toward helping me get that Golden Years Assistant patch. Hi, Nana Shapiro. Can't wait for the latkes, darling. Nobody's had a bite to eat all day! We can start cooking as soon as Baljeet gets back with the potatoes. No! No, you cannot! We looked all over the place, but there are no potatoes in the entire Tri-State Area! And I'm down to my last potato chip! Better make this bad boy last What am I going to do? Have you ever seen senior citizens riot? It's like a slow gray tornado of canes and false teeth! Buford, let me see that potato chip. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna use the DNA in this potato chip to clone our own potatoes! Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P! We recently learned that Doofenshmirtz has fallen behind on his electrical bills. This seems odd considering his generous alimony package. His ex-wife, Charlene, is loaded! And, I might add, quite a handsome woman. No, notâ Not that I've given that a great deal of thought. Investigate at once. Monogram out! Summer is boring! I am so-oh-oh-oh bored Why don't you call Jeremy? He's working. What about Stacy? Grounded. Jenny? Protesting. What about busting your brothers? Well, it's nice of you to take an interest, but they're not even in the backyard. Well, you can't sit inside on a gorgeous day like today. So, Missy, grab that pink bike! We're gonna get out and about! I don't think so. Oh, come on. It'll be fun. Whoo-hoo, hooray.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  So, Perry the Platypus, do you like your trap? It's called the stocks! I read about it in this book, Ten Greatest Historical Traps of All Time. Look, it's a pop-up! It also came with this bonus pamphlet, The Ten Greatest Historical Armies of All Time. And according to this, the Spartan Army was fierce, unstoppable, and followed every order without hesitation. Which is why I got this! Huh? It's a Spartan General costume. Yeah, it must have been warmer in Ancient Greece. Anyway, once the Spartan Army sees me in this, they'll obey my every command! And help me take over the Tri-State Area! And how will I acquire the Spartan Army, gone lo these many millennia? With my Historical-Army-Retrieve-inator! I-It's potato-powered because I spent this month's alimony check on my last Inator. You remember that, the Made-of-Gold-inator. And you know, I wore out three pairs of shoes buying up all these potatoes, but On the good side, it smells like French fries in here. Ladies and gentlemen, behold the wonder that is the Spuds-a-lot! Buford, the potato sample. Okay, Ferb. Start her up. It's working! Oh, thank goodness! Now I canâ Uh, Phineas Those potatoes have eyes. All potatoes have eyes. Yeah, but these eyes blink! Buford, you didn't put that chip in your mouth, did you? And if I did, would that be actionable? I think the DNA from Buford's saliva must have combined with the potato's DNA to make some sort of Buford potato hybrid! Let's get outta here! Oh, look at the little guys, they're like little bullies! I am both proud and ready to soil my pants in terror. I like my tacos spicy. We should probably do something about them before they do, um, whatever mutant Buford potatoes would do. But what about the party? Right! Baljeet, you and Buford go stall the seniors while the rest of us simultaneously round up the spud spawn. Hey, wait. Ferb, isn't ""simultaneously"" on our list of S-words seldom used by kids? Awesome! See? Isn't this fun? Thrilling. What? Mom! Look! Potato, uh gremlins! And Phineas and Ferb! Potato gremlins? Candace, are you okay? Never better. Come on, Mom, let's step it up! I'm glad you're finally getting in the spirit. And now, to summon the Spartan Army! Ooh! Here they come! Here they come! They're coming! Huh? Whatâ Wait, whatâ A Mongol army? Really? Huh, I must have had the dial set for ""Hun"". Oh, well, you don't look a gift horde in the mouth, so Hello! H-Hi, there. Me, yeah. Welcome to the future, my ruthless Mongol Army. I realize you can't understand what I'm saying, and you're probably confused a bit by the Spartan General's uniform, uh But together, we will rule the Tri-State Areaâ Hey, what are youâ Oh, you're hungry! I-I guess it has been 1,200 years since you've eaten. Well, I suppose we could call outâ Oh, you ruined my helmet. Now I've gotta get a new costumâ Wait a second, that's it! I'm in the wrong outfit! All I have to do is hit the costume shop, then round up my Mongols, and the Tri-State Area will be mine! We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes! Where's my nosh? We want latkes! We want latkes! We want latkes! I don't have to put up with this. I'm part of the greatest generation! Buford, what are we going to do? Phineas wants us to stall. We gotta think of something! Uh Wait a minute. I got an idea. Hello, folks! I'm Mr. Sock! Hey! Who turned out the lights? Thanks! You stink! Well, that wasn't very nice! Technically, we are socks. Hey, Mr. Other Sock! What are you doing here? Just looking! For what? My sole mate! You both stink! I think we have to take it up a notch. (Song: Frenemies)  We look good in hats   Long tails and spats   When we hit the town together, baby, we know where it's ats  You are pluralizing ""at""? Work with me, brain boy. Well, this is a mess. How are we going to round them all up? Yes! If we reverse the backup engine on the Spuds-a-lot and attach those hoses, we can suck the potatoes into that soothing hot tub we built into the bulkhead. Hot tub? Why on earth would you build a hot tub on this thing? I'd like to think the real question is why wouldn't we? Time to round up some spuds!  If I were dangling from a ledge   He'd surely save me with a wedgie   I'm smart, perhaps a bit refined   And I'm a bit more edgy   'Cause we're frenemies   We like disliking one another   Yes, we're frenemies   He's like my least favorite brother  Uh-oh! I like my tacos spicy! Pull up alongside! I got three more. How're we doing? Cannonball! It's working! Yee-haw! Spicy. French fry! Spicy! French fry! Spicy! Wow, Buford had Mongolian barbecue for breakfast? I don't think those are ours. Costume shop! Follow that horde! Ha-ha! We've finally caught up to 'em! Mom, keep up! WaitupCandace. WaitupCandace. WaitupCandace. But they're right around the corner! I'm notas youngas I used to be! I'm notas youngas I used to be! I'm notas youngas I used to be! Fine! Whoa! ""I'm not as young as I used to be."" Whoaa! One Genghis Khan costume. Will that be cash or credit? I'm kind of low on funds right now. Do you take potatoes in trade?  I like complex calculations   I like physical confrontations   We both have our roles   This is a symbiotic relationship   This is a symbiotic relationship   'Cause we're frenemies   We like disliking one another   Yes, we're frenemies   He's like my least favorite brother   You and I, we're not enemies or friends   We're just frenemies to the end!  Stop! My brothers! Andothers. Andothers. Uh, gaze at last, upon my appropriately Mongolian military regalia. And know that you must now obey my every command! Oh, no! The Latke Festival is ruined. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Potato gremlins! Andothers! Andothers! Look! I'm trying, honey! These classifieds just go on and on. Now, we can rule the Tri-State Aâ Ooh, coupon! Now, what am I looking at? Butbutbut Butbutbut Butbutbut I think you had enough fun for today. Noo!!! Oh, Nana, I'm sorry we ruined the festival. Ruined? Ha! That was the best time we've had since they cancelled Three-Bean-Salad Tuesdays. The floor show was fantastic! Really? The ending was a bit out there, but trust me, they had us at sock puppets! Form a line, people. Form a line. Well, it's too bad we couldn't get the potatoes for the latkes. But I'd say everything worked out fine. What's Perry doing in a pillory? Actually, those are stocks. A pillory forces the wearer to remain upright, exposing them to poking and prodding from passers-by. Wow. I'd expect that kind of esoteric knowledge to come from someone a little older, 50 or 60. Or perhaps, a septuagenarian. This is it. No one has seen this for a thousand years. The legend tells of an epic battle between the Mongol Army and potato gremlin creatures, while a, uhpharmacist from the future worked in vain to return to his time, crying out while a, uhpharmacist from the future worked in vain to return to his time, crying out ""Curse you, Perry the Platypus""? I swear! I majored in this in college."
"Goodbye boys, have a great day, I'm off to work. Goodbye, Dad! Have fun buying from auctions and private sales, performing minor refurbishments to the purchase items, marking up the price and then selling them to your customers! Our dad sells antiques. You know Ferb, it's strange how we wave our hands when we say goodbye. It seems so arbitrary. Why don't people jump up and down or stick out their tongues, or slap their thighs? Well, if by that you mean we should create a whole new form of communication, then I couldn't agree more! That was some nice gesturing, Ferb. Do some more! Ah. Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Iknowwhatwe'regoingto dospatula! Oh. Today I really should have known that from the context. Oh, here's another one! Heywhere'sspatula! Heywhere'sspatula! Heywhere'sspatula! Oh, context again. Ah, Agent P. Sorry, I'm running a little late this morning. Our satellites haven't picked up any Inator activity coming from Doofenshmirtz, but that's no indication that he isn't up to something. We want you to get down there and have a little look-see. Good hunting, Agent P. Finally, when someone sneezes, rather than say ""gesundheit"", just play flugelhorn and give him your left shoe. I think we nailed down the non-verbal cues. Now let's look at the syntax! Candace? What's wrong, honey? Mom! They're doing stuff out there! Candace, they're just writing on a whiteboard. Yes, that's it, they're plotting. And you know what that leads to. Implementing-uh! Implementing-uh! Candace, you need to lighten up a little. Take it easy. Do you know what I do to relax? You eat some pie and then laid down on that old sensory deprivation tank we keep in the basement. That's right! Would you like to try it? Um, I'm gonna go with no, but thank you. Well, you should still try to relax. Mom, I don't need to relax, I need to bust Phineas and Ferb. Well, listen sweetie. You said so yourself, they're just plotting, right? That gives you plenty of time to go to the mall before they start implementing-uh. That gives you plenty of time to go to the mall before they start implementing-uh. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! Maybeâ Hey, wait a second, are you making fun of me? Maybe just a little. She's right, I probably have plenty of time to go to the mall! Okay, Ferb, let's start implementing!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Just one more bolt right behindâ  Perry!  So, Perry the Platypus, we meet again! But this time, the advantage is mine! Hey, what are you waiting for, Norm? We rehearsed this like a thousand times! When I say ""Ah, Perry the Platypus, we meet again, only this time the advantage is mine"", you go and get him! Going and getting! Note to self. Consider pulling off and replacing Norm's head. Ooh, okay. Much better, this is a good look for you! Hi, guys. What'cha doin'? Erb-Ferb Atin-Lerb! (Ferb Latin!) Oh, creating a whole new form of communication today, are we? Yeah, what do you think? Sounds fun! What do you call it? Ferb Latin! Where you take the first letter of every word, you move it to the end, and then you say erb! So Ferb becomes Erb-ferb, and Latin becomes Atin-lerb! Two letter words stay the same, like or stays or. All the fun of Pig Latin, and it's safe for vegetarians to use! Oh, Phineas, I think your new language is onderful-werb (wonderful)! By Jove, I think she's got it! But there's also a lot of non-verbal cues! For example, if you wanna say ""okay"", you reach for the sky! Yeah, and when you're hungry, you crack your knuckles! Oh, baby, that's good. And if you smell something bad, you do jazz hands! Stop looking at me! I am not going to do jazz hands! Even though you have totally earned it. How do you say goodbye? When you say goodbye, you blow a raspberry! Let's all do it! I bet you're wondering where my Inator is, right? C'mon, guess? Guess, no? No? You're not gonna playâ All right, all right. Fine! Don't play. It's Norm! Let's hope there's no self-destruct button on this one! You've always had one, Norm. I just never told you where it was so you wouldn't pick at it! And stop interrupting me! Anyway, I've done a lot of research for the past You know, a few hours, and Iâ And I found that that most people will believe anything they read! And I know it's true, 'cause you know, Iâ I read it online somewhere. And I know it's true, 'cause you know, Iâ I read it online somewhere. So, my new weapon to take over the Tri-State Area is propaganda! So, my new weapon to take over the Tri-State Area is propaganda! Propaganda consists of messages that dishonestly attempt to influence the attitude of a community! Thanks for that, Mr. Norm-It-All. I've installed a switch back here that prints out propaganda leaflets. All I have to do is speak my evil messages into this microphone Uh, let's see, uh ""Slap yourself""! Push this button and whatever I say comes printed out on a leaflet. It's gonna work! It's bold and it has a lot of serifs! Serifs are semi-structural details thatâ Oh, for crying out loud, Norm! Listen, here's a buck, why don't you go get out of here and get a haircut or something? Out I go! Uh, Norm, take the dollar, leave the platypus. And when you come back use the door! He gets that from you, you know. Anyway, my plan is to fly Norm all over the Tri-State Area and drop leaflets, then everyone will do my bidding! Hi, kids! What'll it be? Ocolate-cherb. (Chocolate.) Awberry-strerb. (Strawberry.) Anilla-verb. (Vanilla.) Emon-lerb. (Lemon.) Erry-cherb. (Cherry.) Are you kids from outta town? No, no. We're speaking Ferb Latin! You move the first letter to the end of the word then add -erb! One and two letter words stay the same. Oh, I get it! Ocolate-cherb is chocolate, and anilla-verb is vanilla! Ooh At's-therb ute-cerb. (That's cute.) Did that mean goodbye? I'm gonna go with it. Are you having trouble relaxing? A little. Try our new liquid massage. This isn't your mother's sensory deprivation tank. A few minutes in here will change your world! All right, strap me in! Ice-nerb air-herb. (Nice hair.) Es-yerb, it is. (Yes, it is.) Say, what's that language they're speaking? That is Ferb Latin! I like it and intend to use it whenever I can. Tell me how it works. Hey, I hear you kids have invented a new language. Tell us all about it! Sure, follow me! (Song: Ferb Latin)  You take the first letter of every word   You move it to the end and then say '-erb'   It's like we're adding a phonetic caboose to it   Don't get confused, just get used to it   Whenever someone sneezes   You no longer say ""bless you""   Instead you play a flugelhorn   And give him your left shoe   Whenever you meet someone on the street   Don't shake their hand, just stomp your feet   And your conversation won't be complete   Until you give him a big slab of meat   Whenever someone sneezes   You take the first letter of every word   You no longer say ""bless you""   You move it to the end and then say ""-erb""   It's like we're adding a phonetic caboose to it   Instead you play a flugelhorn   And give him your left shoe   Don't get confused, just get used to it   So those are the rules and we hope you enjoy them   We're sure to be adding a few   As new customs evolve, well, we hope you employ them   But for right now here's what you should do   Whenever someone sneezes   Whenever you meet someone on the street   You take the first letter of every word   You no longer say ""bless you""   You move it to the end and then say ""-erb""   Don't shake their hand, just stomp your feet   It's like we're adding a phonetic caboose to it   And your conversation won't be complete   Instead you play a flugelhorn   And give him your left shoe   Until you give him a big slab of meat   Don't get confused, just get used to it  I'm ack-berb! (I'm back!) Oh, great. Nice haircut, by the way. Where's my change? You're a weird robot, Norm. Ank-therb ou-yerb! (Thank you!) What was that, Swedish? You better not be broken, Norm. You still have to fly around the city to distribute leaflets. I guess as long as you remember the code for take-off, we'll begin. Aunch-lerb? (Launch?) No, it's not ""aunch-lerb"". Talk normal. It's launch! Launch! OH, NO! NOT YET! NOT YET! Oh I must have fallen asleep. Wow, am I relaxed. I wonder how long I was out? Excuse me, do you have time? Ee-threrb enty-twerb. (Three twenty.) Uh, what? Ee-threrb enty-twerb. (Three twenty.) My ears must be over-relaxed. O-derb ou-yerb ave-herb any ibling-serb? (Do you have any sibling?) Es-yerb, I ave-herb a ister-serb.

And how did this latest cultural craze gets started? We talk to the creators. This whole town has gone crazy! Ferb Latin isn't just a language, it's a way of life! Ferb Latin? I should have known Phineas and Ferb were behind this! You are so usted-berb (busted)! What is it, Candace? No, I don't know what Ferb Latin is. Give me fifteen minutes. Uh, dear, as long as you're getting up, uh, could you get me some more pie? Flies hate you, hunk of junk! Perry the Platypus, how did you getâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus! E're-werb oing-gerb own-derb! (We're going down!) Knock it off with the babble talk, I can't stand it! Talk normal! Oh, great. That was not the message that I wanted to deliver to the people of the Tri-State Area! ""Talk normal."" Hm. Yeah, okay, I'm convinced. Mom, Mom, Mom! Come with me! Phineas and Ferb created a new language and everybody's speaking it, and now we can't understand anybody! Watch this! What time is it? Twenty minutes since the last time you asked me. What? You there! Talk! I don't think we have anything to say to each other! Not after the jazz hands! Not after the jazz hands! Wow, he must really hate jazz hands. I don't get it! Everybody was blowing raspberries and speaking this crazy language! Look who's here. Phineas and Ferb! All right, you two. What do you have to say for yourselves? Look at that! Mom! Theyâ I meanâ Um Remember that whole stress relief thing I mentioned earlier? You might wanna look into that. Well That could've gone better. Not funny, Norm."
"Ah, summer. Sunny, warm, some might say hot It sure would be nice to cool off for a bit. Any ideas? Well, while a visit to Antarctica does sound cool, I was thinking of a traditional family Christmas special. All right, people, let's move it in. Move it in! All right, lights, camera, sweaters. Can't have Christmas without sweaters! And cue snow! And cue snow! That's more like it! Hit it, fellas! Ladies and gentlemen, it's the 12th annual Phineas and Ferb Family Christmas! Brought to you by Wintobreath toothpaste! Now with more inert ingredients. Tonight, celebrate the holidays with Phineas, Ferb, and the whole Flynn-Fletcher family! With Isabella! Buford and Baljeet! Famous singer, Kelly Clarkson! And now your hosts, Phineas and Ferb! And now your hosts, Phineas and Ferb! Happy holidays, everybody! Welcome to our Family Christmas Special. Come on in, put on a sweater, grab a hot cup of cocoa, and have a seat by one of those extras as we celebrate the holidays. Who could that be? What'cha doin'? Why, it's Isabella! You know what I love best about this time of year? No. Tell us! It's the music. Like this little number, Let it Snow. Like this little number, Let it Snow. (Song: Let it Snow, Let it Snow, Let it Snow)  La, la la la, la la la   La la la, la la la, la la la   Oh, the weather outside is frightful   But the fire is so delightful   And since we've no place to go   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!   It doesn't show signs of stopping   And I've bought some corn for popping   The lights are turned way down low   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!   When we finally kiss goodnight   How I'll hate going out in the storm   But if you'll really hold me tight   All the way home I'll be warm   Well, the fire is slowly dying   And, my dear, we're still good-bying   But as long as you love me so   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow   (Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow)   Let it snow!  What is all this? Ugh! Fake snow, fake house, and who are these people? Extras! Not me, I've got a speaking part. But it's just this line. So it's pretty much over now. And where did you get those ugly sweaters? Hey! It's Christmas, Candace! It's the middle of summer. Well, no sense waiting 'till the last minute. Wait, are you guys taping this? Actually, we're live. This is on TV right now? Yup. I have to make a phone call. Candace Flynn, everyone! Up next is our good friend Hey, where is Perry? I'm sorry, Agent P. Carl's an extra in some Christmas show, and I don't know what Doof is doing today. You know what, I'm just gonna send you over there blind. Good luck!  Perry!  Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making Christmas in July. Well, isn't that cute. Do you happen to be standing near a television? I think there's a whole wall of them behind me. Would you turn around and look at the TVs? Okay. Tonight's special is brought to you by the good folks at Wintobreath toothpaste! Oh, you're right, Candace. We do need toothpaste. Thanks for reminding me. Oh, wait wait! Noâ Ugh! Oh, how nice! A traditional Christmas special. As my Granddad used to say ""Lung me yellum reek and wits fulgey an'ool bool bay-a!!"" What does that mean? Well, hopefully something festive. You too, Dad? Merry Christmas, everybody! Wait, w-what's going on here? Is it Christmas already? What happened to fall? I'm totally unprepared. Iâ I got to get my yuletide on, and fast! What's wrong, Phineas? You don't look very happy for Christmas Eve. Everyone's come together for the holidays, but Perry's still not here. He knows it's not really Christmas, right? Every family Christmas special needs a little false drama. Ah Who could that be? It's famous singer Kelly Clarkson! Happy holidays, everyone! Oh, Kelly Clarkson, can you sing us a song? Oh, you guys don't wanna hear me sing. Yeah! Yeah, we do! We do! Of course! Well, I don't really have anything prepared Oh, that's too bad. Well, have a seat. We'll have someone else sing. Oh O-Okay.  Oh, Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated   Oh, righty tighty, lefty loosey   Oh, my decorations are almost done  Perry the Platypus! How noel-y of you! For some reason, Christmas seemed to have snuck up on me this year, and I'm a bit behind on my shopping. But, I have a solution. The Transport-inator! To instantly transport me to the stores while everyone else is circling around looking for a parking spot. I-It's not exactly evil, but it's slightly unfair. Let the last minute shopping begin! Hey! Who's that coming down the chimney? Could it be? Oh! I am sorry, Phineas. I seem to have broken your fire. It's Baljeet! As long as you're here, how about a song? Well, it was going to be a duet, but  Good King Wenceslas looked out  (Song: Good King Wenceslas)  On the Feast of Stephen  Sorry, I'm late! I was busy doing some rewrites. Rewrites? I've highlighted your parts. Now sing along!  Santa Claus and all his elves are making gifts for Buford!   I don't think that's how it goes   Nobody's asking you, nerd!  Buford! You're completely disrespecting this classic song. You're ignoring the historical context! King Wenceslas was a great man. You have no idea what this song is about! I know all about this song!  The words were by an English guy, the music's Scandinavian   Wenceslas was five-foot-six, he kept his face unshaven   Though just a duke throughout his life, he always ruled so justly   His kingly title was conferred upon him posthumously  Well, I stand corrected. You seem to have a lot of information. But if you know so much about it, why do you not sing the original song? I like my version better. It's about me!  Buford should get lots of gifts every Christmas season   When I see presents just for me, it always is so pleasin'   That is why I changed the words, to make this song more edgy   If you don't like the way I sing, you'll get a Christmas wedgie!  You know, if you guys want me to sing, I could certainly No, sit down. Relax. Don't worry about it. Are you guys sure? 'Cause it wouldn't be No! We wouldn't want you to have to work on Christmas Eve! Oh Uh, okay. I had one line earlier. And now you have two. Ooh! Whew! Hey, what's with the total lack of Christmas decorations this year? A-Are you guys just being lazy or what? A-Are you guys just being lazy or what? Wait, whaâ Wait, my packages! Customer vaporization in aisle 4. A reverse button? Really? I guess you think you're pretty clever. Not fruitcake! Now, where did he go? Well, still no sign of Perry, but we're running out of time! Perhaps we should open our presents. Hey, look, everybody! It's Perry! We're all together after all. This is the best Christmas ever! (Song: We Wish You A Merry Christmas)  We wish you a merry Christmas   We wish you a merry Christmas   We wish you a merry Christmas   And a happy New Year   We wish you the best day ever   And hope all your Christmas endeavors   Are super-fun, amazing, and clever   And that your New Year's rocks too   Oh, come tell me what'cha doin'   All my relatives just flew in   From Mexico and Jerusalem   For the holidays   Both Christmas trees and menorahs   It can be confusing for us   When we break into a chorus   Of ""olÃ©""   (Â¡OlÃ©!)   And ""oy vey""   (Oy vey!)   Good missions I'll give   To Agents A through Z   Carl, get away from that punch bowl!   I'm saving that for me   We wish you a Perry Christmas   We wish you a Perry Christmas   We wish you a Perry Christmas   And aâ New Year   And aâ New Year   I wish for a calculator-   Slash-Hindi-English translator   To find a common denominator   In both of my tongues   Good wedgies I'll give   To all of you nerds   That's how I say ""Merry Christmas""   I ain't good with words   I wish you would let me rule you   In evil I'm going to school you   I won't sugarcoat or fool you   Your New Year's looks grim   We wish your every endeavor   Makes this the best Christmas ever   And we're all so glad that we have never   Mentioned figgy pudding  Ugh. How come the reverse switch works for Perry the Platypus, but not me? Hey, boys. I heard you were doing Christmas in July. Yes! Yes, they were! Andâ And i-it was actually really sweet. And i-it was actually really sweet. Wait. Aren'tâ Aren't you Kelly Clarkson? Why, yes. Yes, I am. You're standing on my hand. Oh, sorry! No, no, it was a huge honor. Hey, since you're here, you wanna sing a song? Uh, you know I would love to. Wait. What's that? Oh, that's my Inator. It's probably just gonna blow up. I'm outta here! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And to a lesser extent, Kelly Clarkson, although I do love her work.  It doesn't show signs of stopping   And I've bought some corn for popping   The lights are turned way down low   Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!   (La, la la la, la la la)   Ah   (La la la, la la la, la la la)   Let it snow!   (Let it snow)   Oh   (Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!)  Let it snow!"
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Soâ So, they're just gonna be talking in ""cave-talk""? Yeah, and I think Doofenshmirtz is just gonna grunt. Ohâ How are people gonna know what's going on? Ohâ Periodically, we just cut to you and me explaining it just like this in this sort of photo-animation. Why don't we just, uh, film it? Live action? Nah, it's not the budget. Eh. Yeah How are the kids gonna know who we are? Oh, that's nice. Okay, uh But where's Perry? Ah! You know what? I-I think you're right. This was a bad idea. No, no, no, no T-This is starting to work. This is really good. Really? Yeah. Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Getâ Get up! G-Get out of the way! G-Give me the pen. So, Phinabunk and Gerb have already invented the wheel and are getting ready to show their friends Oh, so Doof's gonna poke the mammoths with his Stick-inator and they'll stampede Roger and his friends away from their home and Doof can live there. Now, wasn't that clear? No. Well, it's a good thing we're doing this then. I guess we should wait until tomorrow before we tell them about our new language. Yes. Yes, we should. Eh, all right, I'll buy that, but it still feels like it's missing something. The song! Okay, how about something like  Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!  Do it again. (Song: Zubada)  Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   (Ooooh)   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   (Yaiiii, yai yai yai yai yai yai yai yai yaaiioh!)   Zupa, daya!   Zupa, daya!   Ooga ooga ooga ooga   Ooh chaka ooh chaka!   Kay garna mana hoo   (Hey!)   Ya ya ya!   Gunga larga mungo   Zooga ooga chunga!   Bee-boppa zapadu!   Chaka lakka moo eetchie she-ma goo   Chaka lakka moo eetchie she-ma goo   Chaka lakka moo eetchie   Eetchie she-ma ooga!   Ooga!   Ooga!   Ooga ooga ooga ooga!   Chaka lakka moo eetchie she-ma goo!"
"Aw, nuts! I'm standing on Baljeet's shoulders and I still can't see anything! This is not how it works! Relax, everyone. Ferb and I devised a solution. Hop on. Phineas and Ferb! With technology that's slightly more advanced than what we have today. Mom! You are doing it again! It helps my arches! Look, guys! It's Regent Monogram! And that girl must be Princess Isabella! And that girl must be Princess Isabella! Regent Monogram? When can I meet some of the local children? Princess, I'm afraid it's just not safe for you out in the wide world what with Doofus Khan on the loose. Doofus Khan! He has been a plague on our land for far too long! I promise once his forces have been defeated, we'll throw you the biggest party money can buy. Of course it won't cost you anything because you're a hereditary monarch. Mom, wait till you see what Phineas and Ferb have done now! Look! Look! Acrobats! Acrobats? I love acrobats. No, Mom, over therâ Oh, no! Doofus Khan's warriors! He's going after the royal thingy! He's going after the royal thingy! It is called a jaou. Now, you see, this is exactly what I wasâ The Princess!!! Buford, get us down there! Quick! The Princess! The Princess! The Princess! The Princess! Doofus Khan! Why, that impertinentâ A taunting scroll? How uncouth! Shall I order the final attack, sir? No, no, General Carl. A full-scale attack now would put the Princess at risk. Oh, if only Master Perry had not given up the way of the warrior and gone to live a contemplative life on the Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness, he could retrieve the Princess. Oh, if only someone could reach him and tell him of our plight! Guys, I know what we're gonna do today!  Doofus Khan's multi-level yurt!  Doofus Khan, Regent Monogram will have your head! Regent Monogram will never attack as long as I have his Princess. Which should buy me all the time I need to complete my secret weapon and take over the Tri-Province Area! Meanwhile, I'm putting you in the penthouse dungeon. You'll love the view. Of course, I've planted booby traps all along the way and I alone know how to avoid them. Must have forgot that one. Oops! Oh, that's right. You're supposed to skip this step. Ah, it's under control, justâ testing the system. Oh, yeah, it works. Yeahâ Anyway, here you are. You'll have a nice rack to sleep on and some rats to keep you company. So, while you're here, enjoy your stay. Ta-ta, Princess! I'll see youâ There it is. The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness. You know what I hate about The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness? Just to get there you have to cross the Uncrossable River of Uncrossableness. Who named all these things? That guy over there. The Redundant Scribe of Redundantness. Hi, there! Greetings! Okay Ferb, do we have anything for uncrossable rivers? What are they up to now? Oh, that'll do. Ugh! Look, a Chinese eviscerating fish. Though I suppose here in China, we just call them eviscerating fish. Oh, but here we just call them evisceratingâ So, how do we get up The Unclimbable Mountain of Unclimbableness? No worries, Buford. I think we have just the thing. Oh, come on! Stupid mountain of stupidness! Actually, that was my original name for it! Oops. My bad. Sorry. My apologies. Mea culpa! Master Perry. This is a great honor. Wow. I can't believe he's a platypus. Phineas pulled a jaou with giant mechanical feet out of his backpack and that is what bugs you? Master Perry! Doofus Khan has kidnapped the Princess! Only you can save her! You mean you won't? But why, Master Perry? What made you give up the life of a warrior hero? What's he doing? That's a ripple dissolve. He must be having a flashback. Does he know we can't see it? Should we give him some privacy? I-I don't know the protocol for flashbacks. Is he back? He's back. Well, judging by the time you spent staring off into space, I'm guessing it's something pretty bad. But somebody has to rescue the Princess. If you won't come with us, at least you can train us to do it ourselves. (Song: The Way of the Platypus)  Oh, yeah!   In other circumstances you might fail   'Cause I know you don't have a beaver tail   You're not a platypus but I'm gonna see you sweat   Milk!   We're gonna see how much you can take   I'm gonna work you through your union break   You squeeze a silkworm, what'cha think you're gonna get?   Silk!   But I know a way we can make you a warrior   Even though now you're a wuss   It's the way of the platypus!  But that's just the general information. Here's some of the specific things you can look forward to in your workout!  You're gonna run up a ramp with two buckets of water   Swing over muck for some reason   At some point you'll drop to your knees when it's raining   And look up into the sky-y   You'll stand on a post with your arms out   Hey, these flowers are way out of season   You'll fly to a swamp planet, meet a little green man   And move big, heavy things with your mi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ind   But I know a way we can make you a warrior   Even though now you're a wuss   It's the way of the platypus!   It's the way of the platypus!  Are you sure you won't come with us, Master Perry? The kingdom really needs you back. He's doing it again. Goodbye, Perry. Where are they? You know I can't see anything, right? Follow my lead when we get there. We're going right in the front door! I knew we shouldn't have let Baljeet drive. Never mind that. You two stay here and fend off the guards. Ferb and I will rescue the Princess. We got it covered, just watch out for booby traps. We made it and completely unscathed. Good thing we brought along that yak bladder. Princess Isabella, we've come to rescue you. Stand away from theâ My hero! Don't worry Princess, we'll take the banister down. It's safer. Holy mackerel! How did you guys defeat all these soldiers? We're okay. There was nothing to it. No time for flashbacks! We have to go! What flashback? I'm just rippling! It relaxes me. Well, would you look at that? A bunch of kids running away with the Princessâ R-Running away with the Princess?! Oh, time to take matters into my own hands! What the heck is that? It must be Doofus Khan's secret weapon. It's heading for the castle! What are we gonna do? I've got an idea! Great googly moogly! Amazing what you can do with a little bamboo and rice paper, huh? Doofus Khan! What have you done with Princess Isabella? T-That's none of your business! But there's no way she escaped, forcing me to move up my plans. I can tell you that! You barbarian! I know I am, but what are you? Nyaa! You like that? The tongue set me back a week, but totally worth it. Carl, duck! No, actually sir, I think it's a draâ Oh, that kind of duck. A diabolical remodeling! We can't take much more of this! What should we do? Surrender! Oh, what now? A giant terracotta warrior? Roughly the same size as my dragon? Left leg! Right leg! What could he possibly want? Oh, look he's doing that ""crane"" thing. You know, four centuries from now, that move is gonna be real clichÃ©. Of course, being terracotta you would be fire-proof. All right. Mono on mono, then. That's not your mono! Man, they would love this in Japan! What theâ? Phineas and Ferb! Mom! Mom! Oh, slapsies! I hate slapsies! Gotcha! He has the key to our defeat! You make puns when the other guy's down, dumbbell! Aww, poor babies feeling tired, huh? Allow me to put you to sleep! Ew, who puts armpit hair on a mechanical dragon? Next time, don't put your wind-up key in such an obvious place. I cleverly hid mine in a spot only an ancient warrior would dare to go. No! Perry the Platypus?! Hey, careful with the soft palette there! Ferb, the key! Uh-oh! Eject, everybody! Look! A giant mechanical terracotta warrior? Really, Candace? Wouldn't that be slightly more advanced that what we have today? Well, that would've been the point! Regent Monogram! Princess! Party now? You betcha! Great! Ah, well, back to the drawing board. Compliments of Regent Monogram. Oh, I hate these things! Insult to injury. Well, all's well that ends well. Perhaps, one day we'll devise a way to keep our fair lands safe from barbarian invaders. You know, I think these blocks would make a great wall. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do tomorrow! Well, that took longer than expected. But, it is a great wall. Yeah. So What do you wanna do tomorrow? What? I kid. We can rest. How about a game of mahjong?  These flowers are way out of season   You'll fly to a swamp planet, meet a little green man   And move big, heavy things with your mi-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ind   But I know a way we can make you a warrior   Even though now you're a wuss   It's the way of the platypus!   It's the way of the platypus!"
"Well, how are we doing today, Major? Feeling better? Carl? What are you doing here? Your wife said it'd be okay if I came up here and kept you company. Would that be all right? I brought a book! What kind of book? It's a fantasy adventure with wizards and knights! Are there woodland sprites? Well, there's water sprites. Go ahead. ""Devote your mind to this tale of the distant past, and the adventures that did befall the most noble of knights. Where stood the cottage of the humble antique dealer"" Cheerio, dear! I'm off to hide these common objects for a couple'a hundred years, until they become valuable. Don't forget to put hay in the ox! Candavere! I need you to fetch me some more water! Candavere! Oh! Where is that maid? ""Stachilda, news have I upon this evening. At the harvest bonfire I shall be on the arm of Jeremiad. Signed, Candavere."" There! And now to send off this missive. The time has come to do your duty, my stout-winged messenger! That should catalyze it. We'll add it to our inventory of magical elixirs. What say we try a couple of these out? Cool, a cyclops! My turn! A manticore! With a lion's head. A cockatrice!  Oh, yeah, getting some water, andâ  Yack!  Gonna have a great Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire's Eve  Good morrow, Phineas!  with Jeremiad.  Good morrow, Ferbalot! Ugh! What flaxen homespun have we swaggering here?! Careful, Candavere. Better not look at Ferbalot, or you'll turn to stone. This is the most inopportune time for your infernal hijinks, and for once our sad sweet mother will be heralded to your inpropriâ Ugh! I can't talk like this anymore! You guys are so busted! Mom! Yack! I don't know about you, Ferbalot, but I didn't get any of that. Hey. There's something fishy about this rain. It's It's unearthly. It's It's unearthly. Come on. We better get inside. Behold! I am the Lady of the Puddle! Don't you mean the Lady of the Lake? No, that's my mom. Hey, kids! You're getting a little quest of your own. Oh, that's so nice. Anyway Ferbalot, you and Phineas must find the legendary sword Excaliferb Ferbalot, you and Phineas must find the legendary sword Excaliferb and use it to stop the evil sorcerer Malifishmertz, who is behind this unearthly rain. Yeah, Ferb and I were just talking about the rain. Unearthly, that'sâ Isn't that the word I usedâ? Yeah, I usedâ I justâ I will send the magical water sprite, Isabel, to guide you on your quest. Great! Can't wait to meet her. And to you, Ferbalot and Phineas, I bid thee good fortune! Wow. Good thing she wasn't ""Lady of the Hot Coffee."" Mom! Ferb and I are going on a quest. Don't forget to goad the geese on your way out! Sure thing, Mom. Get in there, Gertrude! Whoa! This must be the sprite, Isabel! What art thou doin'? Apparently you're going to guide us on a quest. Yes. You must first cross the Raging River of Uncertainty by way of the Bridge of Comprehension. Then you must brave the Swamp of Spit-Poor Attitudes. Then it's snack time. I brought along some apples. After that, you will enter the Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters, where the sword Excaliferb can be found. Ferb, only a warrior with a true heart may draw it from the stone and wield it in battle against the evil sorcerer, Malifishmertz. Yeah, okay, I'm down with that. Do you have any questions? Yeah. Where's Parable? Good morning, Sir P. The tempest we're experiencing was conjured up by the evil Malifishmertz. We need you to fly up to his fortress and put the kibosh on his evil machinations. I really like that character. Is there gonna be more about him? I'm sorry, sir, he just comes in at the beginning. Shall I continue? Huh? Okay. ""Meanwhile, back at the cottage of the humble antique dealer"" Mom, I'm telling you. They're gallivanting around out there conjuring things with magical elixirs. Candavere, I've never seen them gallivant. Oh! When are you gonna believe me? What if I got you some proof? I'd rather you got me some more grulewood. Fine. ""Candavere, fetch me grulewood."" ""Candavere, rake the roof-thatch."" ""Candavere, go accuse the neighbors of witchcraft."" If only I had some proof! If only I had some proof! All I have to do is grab a couple of these to show Mom andâ Oof! Ugh. What is this stuff? Stupid potion! I know. Maybe this will get rid of it. That didn't work. I'm gonna go tell Mom. Oh, great, a tail! Phineas and Ferbalot, you are so buâ I can't go to the Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire like this. What will Jeremiad think? I'm just gonna have to find Phineas and Ferbalot and make them tell me which one of these elixirs will change me back. Ah-oh! Oh, this is not Oh, no. Oh. Oh, there's aâ Oh, no. Oh  Malifishmertz Evil Incorporated   But not really a corporation because corporations haven't been invented yet so it's more like a guild or a tradesmen association!  Ah-ha! Parable the Dragonpus, welcome to your doom! Heyâ Hey, whaâ What's the matter with this thing? H-Hey, Gnorme. Can you come out and give me a hand? Of course! Do you like him, Parable the Dragonpus? I call him a Lawn Gnorme. He protects my garden from witches spells and wood trolls. I'm gonna make small versions of him and sell them all overâ Anyway, let me tell you about my plan for seizing control of the Tri-Kingdom Area. You see, I was bullfrog hunting down by the rat catcher's shack and came across a the biggest raspberry I've ever seen! It was the size of a cucumber! is what I said because I had a gag over my mouth. and that's why I decided to take over the Tri-Kingdom Area! True story. And now, I know exactly how to do it! You see, I found this ancient text, more of a a pamphlet really. And decided to use it to conjure up the most evil multitude to ever tread the Earth! But to do that, I needed to start with the most hideous substance known to man! Canned meat! Tripe-Henge Brand, only the best! So, earlier today, I placed thousands of cans of canned meat into the largest of my three cauldrons, cast my evil reanimation spell, and ta-da! Yeah, don't say it, I know. They'reâ They're a little small, but that's why the rain, see? They absorb water, and they will grow, and when they get bigger, I'm hoping their attitude will become a little more, you know rampage-y. They absorb water, and they will grow, and when they get bigger, I'm hoping their attitude will become a little more, you know rampage-y. Isabel, why did you take us to the Inn of the Prancing Platypus? We need allies. There's a lot of mercenaries and thugs to choose from. Plus, they make a great taco salad. Who's that creepy guy? He's been staring at us since we got here. I wonder what he wants. He's coming over! Be cool. I would recommend a little more caution from you, wizardling. Malifishmertz's spies are everywhere. Look at that guy over there. He doesn't look like a spy. He looks more like a shepherd. He's a shepherd spy. They're the worst kind. Are you a mercenary thug? Actually, I'm here for the taco salad. But you guys look like you could do with a little muscle. The name's Bufavulous, the Wind Lord. I can help you on your quest. Welcome aboard! You should also know that I travel with a companion by the name of Baljeetolas, of the Nerdling Realm. Greetings, adventurers! If by my bow, or my vast store of useless knowledge I may aid you Hey, where is my bow? You left it in the booth. Oh. Excuse me. Well, there it is. Has anyone seen my arrows? Bathroom! Now that we're all congregated, we must away! Let everyone now task his thought! That this fair quest may on foot be brought! Whoa! Hey, whoa, hold it. What's with the banjo? Traveling music. Where are they going, Alabama? What do you mean, sir? Well, uh Questing music should have an element of foreboding and mystery, you know. Lots of minor chords and stuff. And, to make it sound more medieval, you throw a major chord in right at the end. Okay. I'll see what I can do. ""And so, the merry band set off on their quest, to the foreboding sounds of minor chords."" Better? Little less sarcasm would be nice. (Song: Questing Song)  A-questing we will go   Into this cursed rain   We're ill-prepared and under-trained   With no practical knowledge of this terrain   A brute, a girl, two brothers, and a brain   Hiking up this inclined plain  What do you know, my shepherd spy tells me that a team of erstwhile heroes bent on defeating me are on their way here right now. Oh, yeah, sure. I-It's just down that way, past the Sally-port on your right. You can't miss it! A bridge. Are not these things guarded in these types of stories? Yeah, like by a troll? Do I look like a troll to you? Do not answer truthfully. It will only enrage her. In order to cross my Bridge of Comprehension, you must first answer three questions. The questions will fall into three categories. Arts and sciences, social studies, and what's hot and what's not. Uh, hey, guys? It is not really that deep down here. The answer must be given in haiku form. If it's all the same to you, we'll just go around. It's not all the same to me. Just for the record, the answer to your riddle is an egg. Bye, now! Come back! You can't juâ Wait a minute! Just-for-the-rec-ord The-an-swer-to-your-rid-dle is-an-egg-bye-now. Just-for-the-rec-ord The-an-swer-to-your-rid-dle is-an-egg-bye-now. Just-for-the-rec-ord The-an-swer-to-your-rid-dle is-an-egg-bye-now. Hmm. What do you know, that was a haiku. The time has come, my little meat gamejos. Rain down on my enemies, and stop them from advancing. And bring me back a newspaper. You too. Go. Uh-oh. Doesn't look good. Whoa. This is where that crazy old bat should have built her bridge. This is the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore. Why must everything have such long names? We're going to have to turn around and find another way across this gorge. Oh, no! Canned meat! Now we're in trouble. But they're so cute. They're getting bigger! And more rampage-y! Are quests usually this short? We're not gonna go without a fight! Phineas! I want all of you to jump. Uh You know that it's called the Rocky, Shallow River of Nevermore for a reason, right? I have a plan, just trust me! I don't know. How 'bout you, Ferb? Should we Ferb? He's right. Come on! Mother always told me, if all the other kids are jumping off a cliff, I should, too. Your mother said that? She was not a nurturer. Let's go! Isabel, if you're gonna do something, now would be a nice time! Carl! Y-You stopped! I think we need to take a little break. Wow, bad time for that. You totally left me hanging in that cliff scene. That's kinda the point, sir. Oh. I see. Very clever. Geesh, Carl, whatâ What took so long? Sorry, sir. I was just down in your beautiful kitchen and your wife was making two sandwiches. And I got to tell you, they were de-lish! Did she make one for me? Oh Huh. How about we get back to the book? Carl, did you eat my sandwich? ""As our heroes fell, doubt swept through themâ"" Carl, you ate my sandwich! Do you want to hear this or not, sir? Okay. ""As our heroes fell, doubt swept through them."" Isabel! If you're gonna do something, now would be a nice time! Sisters! Hear my summons, beckon through the rain, carry thy waters to me now, and fill the river once again. Nice work, girls! See you at Tuesday's brunch. That was cool! A slide made out of water! What would you call a thing like that? I don't know. Oh, good, another customer for my bridge. In order to cross my Bridge of Com Com Com Have you seen my brothers? Com Com Com Com prehension. Com prehension. Well, I think that went well. We're getting close. This must be the Swamp of Spit-Poor Attitudes! Why is it called that? Legend has it, that in order to get across this swampy marsh, you have to have a good attitude. This swamp was made for me! Come on, Ferbalot! Come on, Bufavulous. What is the holdup? I ain't goin'. Just think good thoughts, and you'll be fine! You don't know me very well, do you? Hey, guys, I can see Mount Doof from here, we're almost there! I have an idea. I think I have a way to get you across this swamp. I have been working on a way of solving problems by the process of deriving reliable generalizations from observation. I call it logic. I call it logic. Logic? How come I've never heard of this? Because it is the Middle Ages. Oh, is it anything like hysterical hearsay? Yes, in that it is the exact opposite of that. Yeah? Listen, here is how it works. By observing the swamp, logic tells me that it is too big to go around. And by gathering information about it from Isabel, I can logically make assessments about the best way to get across. Are you following me? Absolutely not. Phineas has pie. Out of my way, runt! And that's why the Earth is flat, Parable the Dragonpus. Huh, what's this? Thou hast mail! Mail? Who's it from, let me see? Ooh, a video! Look at that. I don't believe it! How did these miscreants escape my meatlings? Behold, the Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters! Here, you will find the sword Excaliferb. Cool! Looks like you're on, bro. Let's see how they deal with this! Uh-oh! Avalanche! Quick, inside! That should do it. Now where were we, Parable the Dragonpuâ Hey, how did you escape fromâ Oh, right, fire-breathing dragon, wicker cage What do you know, that guy at the pet shop was right. Ah-ha! Man, this thing really does work when you put batteries in it. Ferbalot The object you seek is near. Come this way. Behold! The sword Excaliferb! The instrument that will be Malifishmertz's end. Wow. Look! Ferbalot is modeling this season's latest in magical weaponry, Excaliferb. Ferbalot is modeling this season's latest in magical weaponry, Excaliferb. But, wasn't there something we had to do first? Oh, right. The Cave of Ten Thousand Monsters. Finally! My greatest nemesis vanquished! Now, Parable the Dragonpus, prepare to meet your dim. Now, Parable the Dragonpus, prepare to meet your dim. Doom! I mean doom. Prepare to meet yourâ Man, talk about blowing the moment. Behold, evil wizard Malifishmertz. I hold the sword Excaliferb. This mystical vorpal blade was given to me by the Lady of the Puddle. Get a good look at it for it is the instrument of your demise! Well, uh, okay. So big deal, the end's come off. Looks like we're switching to plan B, everyone! Plan B? Yes, that is where we all attack him with ten thousand monsters. Oh, that plan B. Are you kidding me? I'm not afraid of you kids or your monsters. In fact, I am not afraid of anything! Ha! Except, you know Unicorns, but other than that, nothing! Just unicorns And And whales. And And whales. That's That's a given, everyone's afraid of whales. And squid. Uh, unicorns, whales, and squid! And And Pegasuses. And And Pegasuses. That's it! Pegasuses, whales, unicorns, squid, scorpions, barnaclesâ You know, I should really make a list. A-And girls. I used to be terrified of girls but I sort of got over that. And now, it's justâ You know, like, sort of a mild anxiety. So, to recap, girls, whales, squidâ Hey, what's everyone looking at? Phineas and Ferbalot, you are so busted! Oh, what do you know, it's a uni-whale-scorpio-Pega-squid-icorn- girl. What are the odds. You know, taken all together, it's more ridiculous than scary. I-I guess it doesn't have a cumulative effect. Advance! Meatlings, you advance too. (Song: Epic Monster Battle)  Their battle cries rend the skies asunder   Their massive feet beat the mountains down   Mortal fear combines with wonder   And the titan king will be crowned   Out of the misty swamp they lumber   While the heavens above them thunder  Hey, are you gonna eat your cucumber? What!? I had a light lunch.  It's an epic monster battle   Sound the awesome monster horn   For an evil wizard and the dragonpus   And a uni-whale-scorpio-Pega-squid-icorn   girl  Crashing turns to quiet. And calm sweeps through the land. The battle's been decided. But who had the upper hand? But look, a hero rises from the smoke. Our glory has been regained. A cheer goes up among our army.  But the other guy gets up again!  Now for truth the battle's over. And evil's reign is done. Our hero stands triumphant. No, no, wait, I was wrong.  He's up again!  I feel reasonably sure it's over this time. What do you guys think? Oh, wait!  He's up again!  ""From the top of another hill, a figure appears. A shaft of light shining off his auburn hair. It was Carl, the Red-headed Paladin from the land of Internius. Heâ"" Carl, now you're just getting ridiculous. I don't see why I can't be in this story. Besides, it's totally better this way. I don't care, read it the way it's written. Fine. ""Suddenly, they all found out a way to settle their differences, and it wasn't long before a peace accord was drafted and signed."" Cut it out, Carl! Read what it really says. That's what it says. Look, see for yourself. Hmm. ""Both contracting parties, undertake to maintain peaceful and friendly relations between them, in the mutualâ"" Oh! Come on, Carl! Whatever happened to Candavere, what about Jeremiad? Well, I suppose I could just skip to the epilogue, sir. Hmm. ""Having signed the peace accord, the happy wanderers returned to their village as heroes. The rain stopped, and Candavere kept her date with Jeremiad. As they danced, she was as happy as a young girl could be. Especially as she was now back to normal. Well, almost. But even as the heroes recalled their tales of glory, the evil Malifishmertz slipped away, bent on laying the groundwork for a sequel. But for now, all was right with the world, and everyone in the village agreed that it was the best Midsummer Woad-Gathering Harvest Bonfire's Eve ever. Certainly the first one to have ten thousand monsters. The End."" How was that, sir? Okay, I guess. Well, I guess I'd better get going. Carl? Yes, sir? Maybe you could come back and read to me tomorrow? Uh, we kind of have to work tomorrow. Oh, fine. Now for truth the battle's over. And evil's reign is done. Our hero stands triumphant. No, no, wait, I was wrong.  He's up again!  I feel reasonably sure it's over this time. What do you guys think? Oh, wait!  He's up again!  ""From the top of another hill, a figure appears. A shaft of light shining off his auburn hair."" Carl! Sir, you're crushing my spirit. Yes. Yes, I am."
"This is it. Giant Cannibal Cave! According to the map, Beserk Magurk stashed it here. No one ever saw him again. This way! Up these Giant Cannibal Stairs! There it is. The Amulet of Juatchadoon! And that must be Magurk, down there on that Giant Cannibal Dining Set! How much rope do you have? As always, you are prepared. So, the markings on this amulet should lead us to the lost Temple of Juatchadoon! Who wants cocoa? Hey, let us go, you big galute! Doofenshmirtz. Well, well, well. Ohio Flynn and Rhode Island Fletcher. What are you doing here? That depends. Why are you slow clapping? Ah, I don't know, I thought it would make my entrance more dramatic. And it totally worked! You know, he's right. It was more dramatic. Now, hand over that amulet! No way! We retrieved it, fair and square! Tell it to the abominable snowman! Well, that's a weird expression. No, I mean tell him right now. Look! I'll just run ahead! Maybe the Giant Cannibal thing was a mislead! I think the dining set was his! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Oh, mama! Way too soon for a callback, Norm. Hello, gents! What's your fancy? Well, fame, glory, money, and the preservation of semi-mystical historical treasures. But, we'll settle for hot fudge sundaes! They're here! Daily Tableaux? Chief! Who do you think just showed up in Panama? If you're gonna try and sell me another fairy tale about Ohio Flynn and Rhode Island Fletâ There's a scoop here, and I can smell it! Or they haven't invented deodorant soap yet, but there's still a scoop! Fine. But, I wanna see pictures! I won't let you down! Someone around here is bound to know something about the lost Temple of Juatchadoon! Juatchadoon? Exactly. We don't even know if it really exists! Oh, it exists all right! And I know where to find it! Go on Isabella Garcia-Shapiro. Femme fatale, ingenue, amateur archeologist, and licensed tile and grout installer. A girl has to earn a living! Pleased to meet you! Do you know anything about this? Do you know anything about this? The Amulet of Juatchadoon! The legend says it can awaken an evil corn colossus with the power to destroy the world! Makes you wonder why ancient people were always making stuff like that. I mean, what's the upside? My mother, New Hampshire Garcia-Shapiro, was searching for the Temple when she disappeared! I'm afraid something terrible has happened to her! You've just gotta help me! I'm also a certified Damsel in Distress. Well, we don't normally go searching after other archaeologists slash adventurers, but I guess we can make an exception. Now if we only knew which way she went. Would this map she sent me help? Yes. Yes, it would. We're gonna need transportation. Rhode Island Fletcher, I know what we're gonna dig up today! Gentlemen, please! There simply are no more maraschino cherries! There you are, Agent P! Welcome to the meeting of the Secret Order of the Knights Without a Cool Acronym or SOKWACA. As you know, it is our duty toâ Hey! You're not wearing your fez. Better go to the fez dispenser. As I was saying, Doofenshmirtz is dangerously close to laying his mitts on the lost Idol of Juatchadoon. If he were to get hold of it, it would be blood-sucking-Chupacabra-brain-eating-zombie-ancient-Mayan- Gods-come-to-life-weird-voodoo-curses-with-goat-heads and what not bad. Now, get out there and stop him, Agent P. Why are we wearing a fez in the middle of Central America anyway? You mean we're not in Egypt? I thought those pyramids were kind of stair-steppy. Last stop! I'm afraid there is no way to get to the East Coast by boat unless you go all the way around South America. Nothing but jungle from here on out. Care to come with us? And spoil my carefully calculated air of selfishness and unconcern? Not until the last second, thank you very much! Wow. Authentic riverboat gibberish. This way, gang! It's sweet of you to help us find my mom, Ms Candace. And are you kidding? I've been trying to get a good scoop all summer long! Well, it's a lucky thing you accidentally hammered yourself into that crate marked temple expedition supplies then, isn't it? Boy, I'll say! We've found it! It's the fabled Temple of Juatchadoon! ""If you choose to go further, you'll wish you weren't born. The road to destruction is paved with corn."" Cheery! There must be some trick to opening this case. A latch, or somewhere to twist it orâ Or, we could hit it with a rock. Yeah, that works. (Song: Don't Look Down)  Adventure's quite a pleasure, we're not in it for the treasure   We'll amble at our leisure, but don't look down!   Gotta keep on your toes   And follow your nose   You never know where the tunnel goes   Just don't look down!   Lots of snakes and spiders, wish this tunnel was wider   Wish we had a guide here, just don't look down!

Yeah, that whole subtle thing wasn't working out for me as you know. Now, hand over that amulet. You fiend! You think we're just gonna give it to you? Yes. Yes, I do. Sorry, boys. Whaâ? Here you go! Isabella, you dirty double crosser! I forgot to give you this one. Okay. I've kept up my end of the bargain. Now, where'sâ Isabella! Mom! Oh, balita, you came! Are you okay? Oh, she's fine, but she could use a little company! Now, if you don't mind I've got a little ceremony to conduct. Let's see, probably instructions on the back or you rub it or twist it Okay, okay! Getting used to it, getting used to it! And I'm good. This is it! Now, I have the power to bla, bla, bla, supernatural, bla, bla, et cetera, et cetera. But first I'm going to New York.

Agent P!  Perry the Platypus, you totally one-upped my entrance. But doesn't matter, 'cause look what I got. We've got to lead the Corn Colossus away from those backup singers! OMG! Coolest sentence ever! Somebody write that down! Hey, Corny! What do you think of this? Enrage the all powerful Corn Colossus. Good thinking! You go smash the kids, then we'll take over the world later. As long as I still have thisâ Quick, across this incredibly fragile rope bridge! Get ready for some popcorn! Wow, he was a lot easier to defeat than I thought he would be. Great, now he's on fire! Yeah, this is much better! I thought he would pop! I mean, corn pops, right? Was I totally out of line? Down the stairs, everybody! Or up the stairs! Or up the stairs! Gee, you think? Running out of steps here! Ah-ha! You just wait till I connect with one of these. Then you'll wish you'd never been corned! Get it? 'Cause it rhymes withâ Hey, what's with the fez anyway, we're not even in Egypt! You're a real spoilsport, you know that? Okay, thoughts? The amulet! Ooh, we can use the amulet to control the Corn Colossus! We have to figure out how to activate it! Or we could hit it with a rock. Oh, now he pops! How does that make any sense? Oh, terrific. The temple is falling apart. Are you happy? Probably my face will melt now, and for what? That's the last one. That was very smooth of you rescuing us at the last moment. That is just how I'm playing it, babe. Well, we found the amulet, defeated the corn monster, apparently created a much needed canal across Panama, and saved the world! And I've got the proof. Ugh. Sorry about the betrayal, guys. That's okay, Isabella. We understand. By the way, does anyone else find it weird that we were saved by an anthropomorphic platypus? The world holds many mysteries, but what seems strange to one maybe commonplace to another. The fez was weird though, I mean, we're not in Egypt.  (Dooby dooby doo-bah)   (Perry!)   He's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying mammal of action!   (In a fez!)   He's got more than just mad skill!   He's got a beaver tail and a bill!   (And a fez!)   He's Perry!   Perry the Platypus!

No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! Almost got it Woo-hoo! The Danville clean water flush-off! A million gallons right to the ocean! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me! Jeremy will be heartbroken when he finds out I lost my gift! Phineas and Ferb! Hey. What are you guys doing? We built a mind machine to enter Baljeet's subconscious in order to cure his fear of contractions. You're amputating two perfectly good words and stitching them together. They are the Frankenstein monsters of grammar. We've already cured Irving's fear of the color lavender. It can't hurt me anymore. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't care about any of that! I lost the gift Jeremy made for me, and you guys have to make an exact duplicate before he comes over! We'd love to. What'd it look like? Well, it kinda had this bolty screw thing going on, and this wrapped wire like Oh, I know what it looks like. But I don't know how to describe it! No problem. We can use the mind machine to enter your subconscious and retrieve your memory of what the gift looked like. You don't mind if we fix Candace's problem first, do you, Baljeet? No, I don't. Chills! Chills! Hey, where'sâ Where is Perry?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Eating cereal looks like this!  Ah, Perry the Platypus! You're early. And I'm in my underwear. And I'm in my underwear. Oh, this is so embarrassing. And it'sâ It's the pair of underwear you never want anyone to see you in too. You know the ones. They're faded and frayed, and the elastic is so worn out you have to hold them up while you're  walking around the house. And then you roll the waist band, which makes your pants look all lumpy. Andâ And yet when you take them off, you find yourself mysteriously putting them in the hamper rather than the garbage. Whyâ Why do you do that? Hey, where are you going Perry the Platypus? You know, when you came in, despite appearances, I was trying to come up with a perfect evil plan to thwart today's Tri-State Area Summit and Weenie Roast, and you just gave me a great idea! What is a man most afraid of? It's being in public and suddenly realizing he's in his underwear! So, I shall construct an Underwear-inator! One blast at the summit, and everyone will be so paralyzed with fear and embarrassment, I can just waltz in and take over. Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Thank you very much! All right, Candace. You're all wired up. We're ready to go in. Wait a minute. Why is that dweeb going into my subconscious? Because this dweeb spent two weeks in psychology camp last summer. So, how'd that make you feel? All right, but don't forget about doctor-patient confidentiality. Okay, Irving. We're in your hands now. Close your eyes and count backwards from four. Three Two One. Three Two One. Three Two One. Where are we? We're inside your subconscious. Okay, everyone take off your shoes. I don't want you tracking mud in here, metaphorically speaking. Mindmaster calling Deep Divers. How you guys doing? We're doing fine, Irving. Remember, you got 45 minutes to retrieve the memory before the boyfriend arrives. Copy that, Mindmaster. We need to get to the Forest of Memory. So, where are we now? Offhand, I'd say the Jeremy Mountains.  Beautiful, kind and gentle  Hmm. Significant. Uh, what was that? Baljeet? Shh! Do not move a muscle. What is it? It is your id. My what? Your id. The embodiment of your deepest, most primal urges. So Fun, right? So Fun, right? Wrong. It is very primitive and aggressive. We do not want to meet it in here. Obviously, you see Phineas and Ferb as some sort of prey. Run! Almost ready, Perry the Platypus, just a few more adjustments. I'm putting an extra ratty setting on the Underwear-inator. So embarrassing! Calling Phineas and Ferb. Come in, Phineas and Ferb. What's your 20? We copy you, Irving. We're just emerging from the Peaks and Valleys of Fickleness. I cannot believe there is a whole valley in there devoted to your love-hate relationship with ambivalence. I have mixed feelings about it. Wow. The Falls of Anxiety. Is my neck to long? Is it okay that I wear the same dress everyday? What's that? It is all of Candace's anxieties. There are so many of them. There are so many of them. She has a rich internal life. Yeah. She's really messed up. Buford?! What's he doin'? He just showed up and jacked in! You can't come in here!

(Song: Deep Into Your Mind)  We're going deep into your mind   Never know what we will find   Repression, aggression, your embarrassing obsession   Would make Freud annoyed but don't be paranoid   We're going deep into your mind!   We're going deep into your mind!   Were you traumatized by squirrels?   Or a little girl with curls?   Do you fear the number seven?   Does a zebra call you Kevin?   We're going deep into your mind!   Your psyche will unwind   Was there a monster 'neath your bed?   A fear of moldy bread?   Or just a Giant Floating Baby Head?   Going deep into your mind  Here we are Candace. The Forest of Memory. How'll we find Jeremy's gift? Well, we shouldn't have to walk too far since it's a recent memory. What's the last thing you remember? Hmm The last thing I remember is saying ""How'll we find Jeremy's gift?"" Well, we shouldn't have to walk too far since it's a recent memory. What's the last thing you remember? Oh, I forgot it already. No problem. This should be deep enough. Everybody just feel around. Maybe we can stimulate Candace's memory. That makes my head all buzzy. Waitâ Wait a minute! Wait! I'm remembering! Yes! Yes, I see it! Over there! Through the trees! That's it! That's what? Jeremy? Wait, are you real? Yeah. I stopped by your house to give you your present and Irving told me to jack right in thisâ My present? How could you? I lost it. But I found the memory. It's right over there. That? That's not your present. That's my drain unclogger. I don't know why I carry that around with me. So, I didn't lose yourâ That is the id! Run! And if you follow me now, you'll see Candace's reocurring nightmares. Come on, people. Try to stay with the group. Hey, where are they going? It's ironic, I built my Underwear-inator while actually in my underwear. Ha! Clubby Momo! You all signed the releases, right? Phineas and Ferb! Ow! Ha! You look ridicâ Ugh! Moth holes? Who wants lobster bisque? Get it while it's hot! Irving! Get us out of here, now! Roger, over! Lavender! It had to be lavender! Hello? Irving? Hello? Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Y-You know, thoseâ Those really work for you. I cannot believe I turned down a trip to the community pool for this! She's growing! What do we do? One of us has to wake up and extract the others! I am trying to wake up, but I can't! Oh! I feel a shock! That's it! Let's all shock Baljeet awake with contractions! Isn't! Won't! It's! Don't! Hasn't! Ain't! That is both a contraction and grammatically incorrect! Lavender! Had to be lavender! The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. The wires must pull them out with no muscles. I don't think I can run anymore! Don't give up! Baljeet will save us! I'm getting tired, too! That's it! I'm dead meat! Gretchen is out! Peace! I'm really complicated and weird. That was great! Let's do it again! Not me! I wish I had my camera! Wait until they hear about this at psychology camp! Goodbye, everybody! Wow, I guess that was a lot of trouble to go through for a drain unclogger. Yeah. By the way, here's your real gift. Jeremy, it's beautiful! I really, really love it. Thank you. Wait, hold on. Where's Buford? I don't care what Freud said about your selfish need for satisfaction. You're all right with me."
"So, Candace, you made a teddy bear out of baklava? Yeah, bears like honey. Baklavas made with honey. Oh, so it's like a statement? You think it's weird, don't you? No, not weird, it's justâ Oh, wait, I got a customer, Candace. So, I'll call you later, okay? He thinks it's weird. Why is it that when Phineas and Ferb have an idea, everyone's like ""Oh, wow, you guys are really clever!"" And when I come up with something, everyone goes ""What? Did you say something, Candace?"" ""What? Did you say something, Candace?"" Oh, you know what I'm talking about, baklava bear. Ew! Hey, Candace. Did you just see a chicken wearing a baseball hat run by here? No, why? It was his turn to bat andâ Ooh! Are you still using these ants? Those aren't my ants! Do whatever you want with them. Look, Ferb. Wouldn't it be great to be part of an ant society? They're so efficient and productive. They're like tiny us-es. Hey, speaking of us, where's Perry? Hey, speaking of us, where's Perry? Sorry, Agent P. Your monitor is on the fritz today. Thanks to someone who isn't aware that croquet is an outdoor game. Again, sir, there was nothing on the box to indicateâ Anyway, let's get this show on the road, shall we? Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been collecting some extremely unusual items the last few days. Some of the odd purchases include Carl, where are my inserts? Oh, sorry, sir. Do that last bit again. Some of the odd purchases include biomolecular components simply used to make organic computers, a giant pilgrim hat, and most curious of all, a huge pair of food booties, used on the end of turkey legs for decoration. You know, Carl, I really like working live, it reminds me of my days in the theater group back at The Academy. You know, Carl, I really like working live, it reminds me of my days in the theater group back at The Academy. Francis, you stink! Get off the stage! Anywho, Dr. Doofenshmirtz is up to something sinister. Find out what it is and report back. Monogram, out. Carl, fade out. Man. You can go, Agent P. Okay, Carl, turn on the lights. Carl? Stop it, Carl. That wasn't me. Ladies and gentlemen, gape in awe at the sheer spectacle that is the Antius Maximus! Heh. More like the Anti-Climaximus. Heh? Yes, I got it. Oh, that was just a scale model to get the investors interested. This is the real thing. Whoa! How did we miss that? And right over there is Ferb's Resize-inizer. What does that do? Well, you find an anthill and then you add a scoop of it to the pot. Then, the Ant Resize-inizer will rain enlarging fluid onto the dirt pile, and cause the ants to move towards the large synthostatic light, making them bigger. Then they continue to the Antius Maximus, the perfect place for the larger ants to live. In no time, we should have an ant farm filled with giant ants. Or gi-ants. Nice one! Oh, clever wordsmithing, good sir! Thank you. Oh, fine. And I just get an eye-roll for Anti-Climaximus? Oh, what the heck is that thing? Oh, I'm gonna go tell Mom. In order to move amongst the ants without upsetting them, we need to douse ourselves in ant pheromones. It's sort of like ant cologne, which will make them think that we're one of them. But not too much! We don't want them getting too friendly! Bum, bum, bum! Stop it, Buford. It smells like my grandma's house! Why does your grandmother's house smell like ant pheromone? Have you met my grandma? Let's go see what the ants think of our new cologne. You know what I like about our friends? We say things like, ""We're gonna douse you with ant pheromones"". And they're just like ""okay, whatever"". They're so cool! Ha! Perry the Platypus? There's my guy. Why the Thanksgiving-themed trap, you may ask? You know how you get all tired and lethargic after you eat Thanksgiving dinner? Well, it's not because you're really full and, you know, slightly out of shape but because of all the tryptophan in the turkey. Now imagine, if the turkey were say the size of a car or a building, there would be no resisting the tryptophanicle level of nature's little sleeping potion. Now imagine, if the turkey were say the size of a car or a building, there would be no resisting the tryptophanicle level of nature's little sleeping potion. That is why I created the Turkey-inator! That is why I created the Turkey-inator! Wait, can youâ Can you see it from that little door, or do I have to move the hat, orâ You're good? You're good. With this, I will fly over the city turning things into turkey all willy nilly, then No one will be able to resist all of that perfectly cooked turkey goodness. And once the tryptophan kicks in, I'll take over the Tri-State Area with ease! Won't that be trypto-fun? You know, ""tryptophan"" Tryptoâ You know, ""tryptophan"" Tryptoâ Oh, it'sâ You know, likeâ I'm wasting all this wordsmithing on a platypus. Candace, you know Wednesday is my Famous Statues Life Drawing class. This had better be important. Mom, Phineas and Ferb are building a huge glass and sand thing in the yard, it looks like a giant ant farm, but I don't know what it does! Candace, please Hold still, Linda! Look, Candace. This is just gonna have to wait until I can take a break. But Mom, they're abusing their liberty! Don't you find that ironic? Not enough to act upon right now, dear. Okay, fine. So long, Perry the Platypus! Next time you see me, I will be the indisputable ruler of the Tri-State Area! And when I say indisputable, I mean totally disputable! Wait. No, no, that doesn't work. I mean U-Uh, putable! I-I mean putaâ No. Eh, the moment's gone. Phineas and Ferb, let me in! Ew! What the heck is wrong with this doorbell? Hello? Ow! Oh, it got in my eyes! Helloo?! Ugh. It tastes like Buford's grandmother's house! That is it! When I lay my hands on them A-ha! Phineas and Ferb, you are so. bu. Phineas and Ferb, you are so. bu. Bu Bu Buggy? Bu Buggy? Yeah, you know what? This is the wrong giant ant farm. I'm just gonna head out, okay? But bang up job on the whole digging thing, really. (Song: Ants) Okay? Oh, helloâ Yeah, take it easy.  (Ants)  I-I guess I can stay for a little. No need to crowd, okay?  Livin' in an ant society   (Ants)   With ants much bigger than you and me   (Ants)   Diggin' in tunnels, it's a crazy scene   (Ants)   With soldiers, drones and one big queen  Cool!  (Ants)   Ah   You can spend your lives in here, it's great   We can lift 10 times our body weight   (Ants)   (Ants)   (Ants)  Hey, I wonder where they're going? Probably to see their queen. Good idea! Let's go see the queen!  (Ants)  Wow. Candace? You're a queen? You know, you really should fix that doorbell. I must have pressed it like 10 times, and all it did was squirt sticky stuff on me. The pheromones! Oh, that's why the ants think you're their queen! So, what's it like to have millions of ants at your beck and call? Oh, it's great. Finally, somebody appreciates my ideas. Only, they keep bringing me crumbs and grasshopper legs. I could really go for a salad. And you think, they'd have a fancy queen dress or something. Hey! Where are they going? Hey, get back here! What's the point of being a queen if you're all alone? Say, these bread crumbs aren't bad! Time to start my turkey takeover! Commence random firing! This is great! With Perry the Platypus out of the way, I can finish my sentences without getting punched inâ Candace! You've gotta see what the ants are up to! I think you really made an impression on them. So, what'd they do? Well, you asked for a salad and a queen dress, so first, they evolved from a hunter-gatherer society, to an agrarian society. Look, they mastered farming in less than 10 minutes. Then, they put it all together to make you this salad. There are still grasshopper legs in it, but other than that, it is not bad. Then, three minutes ago, they had an Industrial Revolution. Check it out! They're weaving the fabrics needed to make a dress for you! Wow, Candace, you're probably the most progressive Ant Queen ever! This is so cool! I should call Jeremy and tell him. Oh, there's no service in here. Nice. You there! Make there be cell service for your queen! You think that's a good idea? Oh, like you'd never tamper with the delicately balanced, yet awesome power of nature. Oh, Perry the Platypus, take that! And that! Oh! Oh, man, that's disgusting! Still, it can't be the first time someone's got their head stuck in a turkey. Still, it can't be the first time someone's got their head stuck in a turkey. So, how are my subjects doing? Shouldn't be long now. It looks like they've entered the Information Age. They are really into online gaming now! Hey! Who cast a sleep spell on me and stole all my gold? Ugh! Now that everything is automated, they have more time to devote to fun. Fun?! What about my cell service? Get back to work, you lazy ants! Your queen commands it! Huh, would you look at that? Apparently, they've advanced beyond the need for a monarchy! Motion carried. Fine! If I can't be queen, then it's busting time! Hey, guys. Why is it so quiet in here? The ants have left. They said something about needing to find themselves. Oh, cool! Greetings, Phineas. We have achieved total enlightenment, and have transcended the need for material things like, ant farms. Wow! Good for you! Our new colony will now traverse the galaxy in search of the fabled Picnic Planet. Oh, good, turkey! We can take that with us as an in-flight snack! Goodbye, Phineas and Ferb. Goodbye! Have a good time evolving past the need for physical existence! As you'll see, the ants are the size of humans! Ta-da? Oh, yes. I see. Greetings, human-sized ants. Hi, Mom! No! There were actually ants the size of people! See?! I was their queen! Yeah, Mom. Candace inadvertently caused the ants to evolve. Exactly, and I was their queen! Wow, Candace. Just like on Mars. I wasâ Iâ Oh, forget it. I'm gonna go call Jeremy. Do you think the ants will return some day? Yes. Probably while we're having a picnic. Perry the Platypus, be a dear and help a brother out. Can't seem toâ Oh! Oh, thanks. No! What are you doing?! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Oh, I feel like a giblet.  Livin' in an ant society   (Ants)   With ants much bigger than you and me   (Ants)   Diggin' in tunnels, it's a crazy scene  (Ants)   With soldiers, drones and one big queen  Cool!  (Ants)   Ah  You can spend your lives in here, it's great   We can lift 10 times our body weight"
"Doofenshmirtz in his underwear!  I can't believe it! Just moments away from finally achieving full control of the Tri-State Area! And I owe it all to you, Perry the Platypus, my trusted butler. I won! I won! No! Why didn't you listen?! Why?! Quiet, you! I will not let you ruin this moment of pure joy! Joy located. Oh, my gosh! Everybody, it's Li'l Saul and the Breakingham Palace Crew! Oy, poi, poi and a deetle, deetle, deetle! This party's gonna be off the hook! It's not how it looks! Uh, I think this is your hat. Uh, I think this is your hat. I'll just be leaving now. Well, this day couldn't get any weirder. Well, I'm about to be proven wrong. Hi, Candace. Mom! Mom! The cheese mountain remains, but the people have fled en masse! What are you talking about? What people? Come back! Wait! High five! Hey, don't leave me hanging! Mom! Cheese! Here! Home! Now! High five! What happened to that guy? Sir, I think Agent P is working for Sir? No! Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it! No! We'll have none of that, Mr. Squirrel Man. Besides, you're too late. Ever since Perry the Platypus quit your agency to become my butler, I have been freed up to create my ultimate inator! The Vaporizer-inator! With my mind now clear, I stumbled onto a scientific fact. Every object on Earth, when heated to a certain temperature, evaporates! With this, I'll be able to vaporize things at will, and cause all kinds of mayhem! I'm a genius! For realsies this time. Now, to your station, Perry the Butler! Get ready, boys! When this baby powers up, it's gonna get hot in here! Happy place! Happy place! Happy place! Happy place! Let's find our first target. How about all the sand at the beach! How about all the sand at the beach! Wait. Wait, where is everybody? Wow! I think this is the biggest turn-out we had all summer. Eh, Buford? Yep. It couldn't get any cheddar than this. Oh, bravo. How do you keep coming up with them? Bravo! Showtime, Ferb! Cheesetopia is now open! (Song: Cheesetopia)  My fever starts to climb up above a hundred degrees   When I fly through the breeze with ease upon my cheese trapeze   They know the cheese with ease-box squeeze, that is my expertise   Cheesetopia!   (Cheesetopia)   Your cheese in wildest dreams become realities   Your fantasies of melted cheese up to your knees   Please try some cheddar peas and taste the Gouda cheese   Cheesetopia!  It's like Utopia, with cheese!  (Cheesetopia)   Ahhh!  Cheese? Cheese?! Our cheese eating contest is about to begin!  Cheesetopia!   (Cheesetopia)  Cheese! Sir! Oh, why isn't he answering?  Ahhh!  Oh, Agent P. If only you had your hat. Shoot! (Song: Perry's Hat)  Perry's hat, floats on the wind   I wonder where it is going?   Is there a head, it will anoint?   Is this herring red or a plot point?   Perry's hat  That squirrel man dropped his hat. I should return it. I wonder what he's doing up there. Oh, well. I got to find out what happened to Agent P. Oh, and I just sprayed for squirrel men. Well, now, it appears that fate has dumped our mysterious guest like an immense pile of assorted cheeses onto the lawn of my evil lab. Yeah, I know it's a strange metaphor, but I stand by it. Oh, Agent P. What have you been up to? Very good, Perry the Butler. The trash chute is right down the hall. Hey, wait, you forgotâ Oh, look at this thing, huh? Such memories! All the adventures, the excitement, the pummeling, the thwarting Oh! You know, I'm feeling rather sentimental about it. Oh, well! Man, am I pumped for Squirrel Con! Yeah! With everyone in costume, there will be no baleful looks of judgment. Hey. This is Agent P's hat. There must be something wrong. Major Monogram, we have a problem. Look! Well, that doesn't look good. You can clearly see your zipper in the costume! No! Agent P's hat. Oh, well then. Maybe you should look into it. Me? Like a real agent? Yes, sir! As for me, I'm off to Cheesetopia! It's Utopia, with cheese! Sir, you remember what happens when you eat cheese? Uh, I've been cleared by doctors. Anyways, good luck, Carl. Yes! Squirrel Con will have to wait! Poor guy. I finished my deliveries early so I wouldn't have to miss this! Last delivery of the day! Okay! Just dump it right there like a caged guy in a squirrel costume! What? I stand by that metaphor. All right, Baljeet. I need you to help Ferb with the foundation! I am on it! Isabella, you and the Fireside Girls spread the word! Girls, get ready to get our Flyer Delivery Patches! Again? Is there something you'd like to say, Adyson? And Buford, keep the cheese puns coming! Sounds Gouda to me! Excellent! All right, who cut the cheese? Sorry. And then I typed LOL, but it came out LOP, and Jeremy thought I meantâ What's that smell? I'll call you later, Stacy. Cheese, huh? That warrants a call to Mom! What was that? Ah, cheese. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. Sorry about the extreme close-up. Carl's off today, and for the life of me I can't figure out how to work this thing. Anyway, we have reason to believe Doofenshmirtz is up to no good. Again, since Carl is out, I'll have to do the visual reference myself. He's recently purchased a small tux, a silver tray, and a pair of white gloves. I traced my hand for that one. Ooh, check this out! Look! It's Agent T! What? Too soon? Cheese? Why cheese? 'Cause cheese is cool no matter how you slice it! What, am I provolone on this? No, I guess it's as good an idea as any. Nice cheese puns, by the way. That's nothin'. I've already got a whole list of 'em. Besides, with the change in plans, we had nothing else prepared. Yeah What did happen to your first invention? Mom, wait! Don't leave yet! Li'l Saul and the entire Breakingham Palace Crew are in here! Come on, I know you're in there, Saul! Joy located. Uh Oy, poi, poi, and a deetle, deetle, deetle! Never mind! Have fun running errands! But Saul and his crew were unemployed, and so I finally found them full-time working my celebration-seeking rocket. It hones in on joy, activates, and is guaranteed to kick any party up to an 11! Hey, where'd it go? Now you know how I feel. Well, wherever it landed, I hope they can handle a party of that magnitude. Back to the present. I'm not sure I can handle a party of this magnitude! Either way, we've got enough power for the inator now, Perry the Butler, y-you'd better tend to the guests. Agent P, how could you have turned to the dark side? How could you have forsaken all that's good and right to be that maniac's butler? You don't belong in that uniform! You belong in this hat! See? Perry the Platypus! You have grape juice on your shirt. I can't have my manservant looking like a street urchin. You should go clean up before it sets. Ugh, it's so hard to get good help these days, even when you ride 'em like a bicycle. When my Butler-inator is finished with you, not only will you have a perfectly-tailored uniform and wig, but you'll actually think you are my butler! You won't even remember that you fight evil for a living! You won't even remember that you fight evil for a living! You won't even remember that you fight evil! Man, you really kick this party up to an 11, man! Perry the Platypus, what's gotten into you? ""Thait I live""? Whatâ What's that, someâ Some new band? What's that, someâ Some new band? Oh ""I fight evil""! V-Very clever. You wrote a note to yourself in the future. I would not have predicted that. Mom! Mom! Mom! Cheese! Cheese! Cheese! Candace, you know, we do have a nice backyard. Although, I never noticed that cheese smell before. My inator! Oy, the joy. It drops. Time for us to go already! Oy, poi, poi, and a deetle, deetle, deetle! Well, no Saul, no ball. Let's split. Wait, wait. I-I was just about to break out the bubble machine! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And you, too, large squirrel man creature hybrid thing! Huh. Who would've thought a high-fiving swollen guy would've scared everyone off like that? I don't get it. Cheesetopia was just here! Huh. That's Swiss-picious! Well, I did it! A hundred cheese puns! Oh, and look, there's Perry! And, scene. Cheesetopia is now open!  My fever starts to climb up above a hundred degrees   When I fly through the breeze with ease upon my cheese trapeze   They know the cheese with ease-box squeeze, that is my expertise   Cheesetopia!   (Cheesetopia)   Ahhh!   Cheesetopia!   (Cheesetopia)   Ahhh!   Cheesetopia!  It's like Utopia, with cheese!"
"Phineas? Ferb? Hey, boys. So, what's on the agenda for today? We thought we'd do something classic and take Perry for a walk in the park. He does need the exercise. Well, I'm heading to the store to pick up some things for dinner. I'm thinking spaghetti and meatballs, or a spaghetti-meatball. That's spaghetti and meat mixed up into a big ball. It's less of a choice of food than a choice of shape. Don't forget to bring a doodie bag for Perry! We won't! Hey, where is Perry? You know, Ferb, we should build a Perry. For occasions like this, when we're Perry-less. A giant animatronic Perry with flashing eyes, fiberglass bill and Judo flipping tail action? Ferb, you anticipate my every need.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Morning, Agent P, and welcome to our new Evil Science Readiness Program. You just keep circling Doof's building, and the second Doofenshmirtz is ready to begin his scheme, you'll be there. It doesn't leave a lot of time for friends and family, but we feel the dramatic decrease in response time could well be worth it. What is he doing up there, just flying around in circles? Gives me the creeps! Well, it worked out in my favor anyway because, turn, close latch, I'm finally ready to begin my scheme! Ha! You want to be a bird? Is that what you want? Well, this is what we do with birds, we put them in a cage. Can you speak, little birdy? Hello? Say, ""Hello, Perry want a cracker."" Say, ""Hello, Perry want a cracker."" Ow! Bad bird! That would not have happened to me if I was smarter, which brings me to my new inator. The Duplicate-inator 2! You know what they say about two heads are better than one, right? Well, I will duplicate my head, and become twice as smart! And look, I even did some recycling by using my old microwave oven. Baked potato? Eh, maybe later. All my life I've been a zero, but when I have two heads, I'm gonna be twice that! You'll see! Too steely-eyed, Isabella! Less focus! Whoops! How's this? Perfect! Sure, you get the fun part. If I wanted to oil feet, I could've stayed at home. When we are done with this, what will it do? Unlike a real platypus, which doesn't do much, the Perrytronic 3000's capabilities will be limitless! Keep it up! Don't stop, busy bees! You're busy, busy bees! What are you doing? Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! Work! All right, I'm out of here. You lost it. No, wait! Okay? There is a madness to my method. You've got three seconds. Everything Phineas and Ferb build disappears when they're finished. So if I can keep them from finishing the thing they're building, it will never disappear! I call it Busy Bee Busting. B. B. Busting, for short. You know what? I'll see you, la-la-later. Okay, let's try this. At last, I amâ Don't just stand there, pick me up! Well, hello, handsome! Looks like we're done! What? No! What are you talking about, ""done""? Well, the tail glaze is almost cool, so we just figured we'd test her out and then close the book on this one. Test, yes. Close book, no! Okay, I guess we could consider this a sort of preliminary test before the real test. Sh'ya! Now preliminary test this heap and back to work. And what is this thing, anyway? Don't worry! The theme song will explain everything! Theme song? (Song: Perrytronic)  Tronic!   He's a mutant robot from a kid's backyard   Perrytronic!   His parts are shiny and his metal is hard   Perrytronic!   He can assume any form   Hang on, I'm gonna backpedal   There's one caveat, it must be big and metal   Perrytro-o-o-o-o-onic!   He can't be kitten or a little block of wood   Perrytronic!   Not sure if he wanted to even if he could   Perrytronic!   So let me recap so that this is all settled   He can transform into anything that's big and metal   Perrytro-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-onic!  It tested perfect! Looks like we are done! Oh, no, you're not! Can it bake a pie? Can it train a seal? Can it give change? Wow. She's right, guys. We're not nearly done! All right, you busy bees, you're back on the clock! B. B. Busting. Hello, Mom? Yes, Candace? I just checked out, I'm on my way home now! I don't understand, I really thought two heads were better than one, you know, for the thinking. But I can't think of anything! Maybe we need a break. We keep doing that! I know, it's so funny! Ah! We did it again! And again! Okay, knock it off. Let's play with our inator for a while! Now, this is fun! I know, right? Look! Two more heads. Look at Perry and his little arms, aren't they adorable? You're right, let's make more. Oh, look! A little arm that can move around on its own. I-It's got its own volition. I did not expect that. Wait. You dummkopf, look what you've done! Oh, who's the dummkopf now, dummkopf? Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him! Oh, good idea! Not with the ray, you nincompoop! Oh, point that somewhere else! Like this? How is this helping? I don't understand your logic. Mom? Where are you now? I just pulled up the driveway. You guys are still working, right? Just taking a break before we install the chicken incubator. Mom, look in the backyard, now! Hang on, let me put the groceries away. Don't. Stop. Working. Don't. Stop. Working. Don't. Stop. Working. Mom! Mom, you're not in the kitchen? No, I'm just shutting the front door! I need you in the kitchen. Mom? In the bathroom, putting away soap! How did I just miss you? Mom? Work, work, work! Mom, come out of the bathroom, quick! Nope, I'm in your room! You said you needed tissues. But how did youâ? Okay, I'm on my way. Put that lemonade down! You're not done yet! What theâ? Mom, you're not in my room! I'm back in the kitchen. Okay. Listen very carefully. Look. Out. The window. Look. Out. The window. Look. Out. The window. Oh, my goodness! Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? We really need to paint that fence! What? That's all you have to say?! Hang on, Candace. My other line is ringing! How could she not notice that? Candace, that was the supermarket. I left my pocketbook there. I'm gonna run over and pick it up. Mom, no! Mom! Oh, no, I'm too Too Two houses?! Too Two houses?! Okay, I did not see that coming. Phineas and Ferb. This has to be their work. Uh distract them for me! Uh distract them for me! Yeah, I'll give them a licking they'll never forget! Good one! Thanks! That tickles! Quit it! Noooooooo! Oh, you guys are so annoying. You're kinda cute, though. Get off! Tails? What are they gonna do, wag me into submission? Well, you're too late, Perry the Platypus! Heads, I win, tails, you lose! Really? That's the best you got? Kinda obvious. Juvenile. I liked it. You would! You know, you guys are kind of annoying, too. Get him! You guys get phantom pains? I got a heck of one in my elbow right now. Noooo! What? It just vanished? It just vanished? What's wrong with this thing? Oh, the microwave was on the baked potato setting, so I guess everything is just gonna last for three minutes. My bad! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, get ready to have your eyes opened wide! Just a sec, hon. Look! But but-but-but-but-but But but-but-but-but-but Oh, when are they ever going to build something in that empty lot? Wait! I don't have to ""but-but-but"". I have the Perrytronic 3000! Mom?! Oh, I hate you, you little greenâ Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I don't have to do this anymore. Well, we still have you surrounded, Perry the Platypus. Hey, that disappearing thing's not gonna happen to us, is it? Yeah, a microwave timer. Great idea. Yeah, that's unfortunate. You're telling me! ""Step 4: Insert spaghetti into meat"". Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! This time it's for keeps. Turn around, and look in the yard. But I have to inject the cheese. Just let me finish. No, I can't let you finish! They might be finished! Ugh, I'll just order a pizza! All right, Candace. Let's see what you've got. Not the golf clubs! Not the golf clubs! Not the golf clubs! Not the golf clubs! Save me! There's a pun here, I know it. He looks teed off! That's what it was! Huh? Oh, no! My inator! We've got to do something. You're right. Go get him. Why couldn't I've disappeared before I hit the ground? Curseâ What? Now, I'll never know what he was going to say! Oh, yeah. Yeah, that. Say hello to Perryâ Hello, Perry. Okay, that was a nice change of pace. Who wants pizza? Me! I do! Then, maybe ice cream sandwiches, ice cream cut in the shape of a sandwich. Just pie for me, please. Okay, now I have to ""but-but-but""."
"Well, Perry, as soon as I send in your photo you'll be a contestant in the Totally Tools spokes-animal contest. What do you say, boy? Ready to be a spokes-animal? That's the spirit! And send. Hello? Perry won! Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Stop the Busting Retreat. A one-day seminar to teach us all to use sisterly restraint. And today, we welcome our newest member, Candace Flynn. Candace, this is Anne, Sunisa and Danielle. Yeah, hi. What we like to do now is a little exercise. We'll start with you, Anne. This is a picture of your brother turning your mother's flowerbed into a swimming pool. What do you do? Well, being a non-buster, I'll probably go to the mall and get a mani-pedi. Good! See how it's done, Candace? Think you can do that? Ha! Are you kidding? Just try me. Okay. So, you see your brothers making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You Well being a non-buster, I wouldn't bust them for making a sandwich. But I'd bust them for making a sandwich when it's 5:30 in the afternoon, and we'll all be having supper in a half-hour! They'll ruin their appetites! They are so busted! Okay, who here can tell me where Candace's approach could use a little improving? Candace, put your hand down. Okay, welcome to Totally Tools. Now, where is that contest-winning platypus of yours? Oh, will you look at him. Oh, and he sits up, too! Who says they don't do much? Brilliant! But sitting up isn't enough. He has to say ""Totally Tools"". He has to say ""Totally Tools"". I got nothing. What do you guys think? How about a hat? Brilliant! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna put a hat on Perry. Hang on a minute. Wait, go back two. Brilliant! Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora. Boys, he's got a lot of work to do. Get busy! Come on, Ferb. Those boys are brilliant! Sir, your 10:30 balloon is here. Brilliant! Hmm, hello? Francis! Hi, it's me, Heinz. Have you seen Perry the Platypus? Dr. Doofenshmirtz, that information is highly classified and strictly confidential. You have no idea where he is. Not a clue. Okay, thanks! Oh, hey, hang on. Say, what kind of an evil scheme you got going on there today? Well, it isn't so much an evil scheme as much as a childish prank, but I've invented a A Mustache-inator! It gives people big, bushy, ridiculous-looking mustaches. Because, as we all know, there's nothing sillier than a big, bushyâ All right, uh Uh But hey, you know, it looks good on you! Ladies and gentlemen, today we give you the new face of Totally Tools Perry the Platypus! Yeah! Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora. Boys, this campaign of yours has really put us over the top. What else you got? Well, Ferb came up with an idea for an exploding billboard. Brilliant! Hey, look! It's a Totally Tools publicity stunt. Nothing says Totally Tools like a platypus in a fedora hanging from a blimp! Oh, hello, Agent P. We have a situation. W-With all these new billboards up all over town, you've become too recognizable to be a secret agent. So we had to send Agent S to Doofenshmirtz's in your place. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to go on hiatus until your 15 minutes of fame are up. I gotta tell you, boys, our president, Tom Totally, thinks you're doing such a brilliant job! He wants you to take the rest of the day off. Sounds great. Oh, there you are, Perry. We can spend the rest of the day with you for a change. (Song: Let's Spend Half a Day)  Hey!   I don't wanna sound half-hearted   I think you already know   I couldn't be there when we started   But that was half a day ago   We could share half a cheese sandwich   Or take in half a view   Or we could make it halfway through the zoo!   Oh, baby!   Let's take half a day to be together   Let's make half a day last forever   Let's take half a day to make our dreams come true, yeah!   Let's spend half a day with you!   With you!   (Whoo!)   Yeah you!   (Hey! Hey!)   With you!  Pew! A handlebar. Pew! A pencil thin. Pew! Fu Manchu! Well, now, who could that be? All right, already! This better be important, or you are gonna get such a mustacheâ Wait a minute. Hmm. What do we have here? Oh, no, it'sâ It's Sergei the Snail! Eh. Well, this should be easy. You've fallen for my trap! Huh? You may have survived that trap, but let's see you escape the cage! Oh, for Pete's sake! Will nothing stop you? Okay, this is quite a jump from group affirmations. How is this contraption supposed to help me resist the urge to bust my brothers? It's a positive reinforcement machine. When you ignore your busting impulses, you get a reward. Let's try it out. You go out in your backyard and find that your brothers have built a rocket ship. What do you do? Well, I'm just gonna haveâ I ignore it? Ooh, who's a good girl? You are the good girl. Yes, you are. There! That ought to hold you. Lucky thing Mrs. Thompson had some salt I could borrow. Yeah. Yeah, consider yourself a-salted. Ah, man, I'm writing that one down. And now, to business. See that guy down there with the beard? Pew! Actually, that was kind of a letdown. Fetch the ball, Perry! Agent P, Doof found Agent S's weakness. We need you to drop everything and return to duty. I know we gave you some time off, but-but could you please come back in to work? Please? I can't hold my eyes like this much longer. Now, Candace. Your brothers have issued a gold-based currency which has seriously devalued the euro. What do you do? I do nothing! You are the good girl. Yes, you are! Wow, you were right. This is quite a machine. Where'd you get it, anyway? Phineas and Ferb made it for mâ What did you say? N-N-N-Nothing. Phineas and Ferb! Why do you always build these things? It's impossible to bust you for everything! It's not my job! Not my job! Not my job? Candace, you had your breakthrough! I'm so proud of you. Ha! Did you see that? I just put a mustache on that dog'sâ Perry the Platypus, you're back! What a guy! Not so famous you can stop by to trounce an old nemesis, are you, huh? But you can't! It's against the O.W.C.A. by-laws. And I quote ""No additional agents are allowed to thwart any single evil scientist if said first agent assigned is still well and able to carry out his duties."" And though surrounded by salt, Sergei the Snail is technically still on duty. So as long as I have him trapped, you can't touch me! It's all here in black and whiâ Ow, that snail is dynamite! Well, ladies, thanks for everything. I feel likeâ Uh, Perry? Perry? Perry? Oh, my gosh. The boys have created an enormous ad campaign around our pet platypus! Uh-oh. Sisters, I know what you're thinking, but rest assured, this new Candace that you see before you will not react like the crazed little girl that crawled in here just this morning. Good for you, Candace! For now, I am, and will always be, an older sister who is positive and mature. That's right, Candace! And I am absolutely 100% positive that I have to bust my brothers. I can see it in your eyes! You know I'm right! Sisters, will we bust our brothers? Yes! Yes, we will! Sisters, repeat after me! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust!

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! Bust! What just happened? Y'know, just for the record, Perry the Platypus, I was thwarted by Sergei the Snail, not you! You don't get any credit for this. Hey, what are you doing? Uh, sir, you're playing with your lip again. Oh, I can't help it, Carl. I miss the old duster. What theâ? Hey, Carl! It's back! Look how great itâ Oh. Oh, doggone it! Well, that was interesting. You defaced yourself. Iâ I didn't see that coming. To be honest, you have lost me completely. Hey! Wow, I look just like my grandfather, JosÃ© Doofenshmirtz. I-I mentioned him before. It'sâ It's a weird story. I'll tell you later. You know, after I shave. Hey, what are youâ Oh! Curse you, Perry the Mustachioed Tool Spokespus! But, Mr. Totally, I have no idea who put those mustaches on those posters. I-It wasn't my fault! I want every one of these ads torn down totally! They're mocking me! Yes, sir. Yes, sir, all torn down. Brilliant! Trash can. Oh, they are so busted! Okay, how she missed that one is beyond me. Mom! Mom! Mom! Well, I guess that answered the inflatable legs question. Now, what is it, Candace? Look and see for yourself! You won't believe it! Candace Okay! Now, look up there! I'm astonished. Yes! Finally! ""Nothing Says Totally Tools Like a Snail in a Fedora."" It makes me want to run right out and buy some tools. Now, if you'll excuse me, I had better get back to the attic before your father blows up another pairâ Oops, too late. I'm coming, dear! And I have the patch kit!"
"Hey, Ferb! Wouldn't it be great if there were trampolines everywhere you went? Wouldn't it be great if there were trampolines everywhere you went? Wouldn't it be great if there were trampolines everywhere you went? Wow, Ferb! Incredible hang time! Personal anti-gravity device. That gives me an idea. I know what we're gonna do today! I know what we're gonna do today! Hey Where's Perry? Ah, Agent P. Doofenshmirtz was spotted this morning leaving this building with a shopping list. On the list were four items. Eggs, vitamins, ice and leeks. Innocent enough until you realize, it is a recipe for evil. Innocent enough until you realize, it is a recipe for evil. Get out there and make sure he never serves that dish. Whoa! Did you just feel something? Morning, hon. Hmm, that smells good. I'll get the plates out. Well, put out ten, because I was talking to Jeremy's mom earlier, and we thought it would be fun to get us all together for brunch this morning. Wait. So the whole Johnson family, and our whole family, together? Yeah! Mom! This is the first time both of our families have formally gone together! Honey, relax. It's just a casual brunch. No big deal. No big deal? I'm Jeremy's girlfriend! We have to make a good impression! Breakfast is easy! This is brunch! Brunch! That's so fancy! Mom, what does this frittata say about us as a family? There's nothing wrong with my frittata. And a frozen orange juice? Really? I can't breathe. Where do we keep the paper bags? Hey guys, I know you ate earlier, but you wanna join us for brunch? No! No! No! They'll embarrass me! Aw, we can't, Mom. We're on our way to the hardware store to pick up some extra parts. All right, two less plates then. Good! Is this house even clean enough for this? Let's see. Monster trucks on the bottom, book review on top. That should impress them. Oh, no! No! No! That is hideous! What the heck did they build out here? ""Anti-gravity Maximus"". Oh, I have got to get rid of this thing. No, no! No, nâ Phineas and Ferb! Not today! Not now! If Jeremy's parents see me like this, that's the end of me seeing him. Come on, there's got to be a reverse switch on this thing. Excuse me, sir. Where do you keep the reverse switches? Right behind you. Next to that guy buying self-destruct buttons. Oh, sweet! Fifty cents off with coupon. Oh, my gosh! They're here. Candace, my hands are full. Can you get the door? I'm on it, Mom! Whoaaa! Well, Suzy. Are you excited to see Candace? Yes! I love Candace. I'm coming! Just a few more feet. Jeremy and the whole family! Welcome to our humble dwelling. Good morning, Candace. Where's your mom? She's in the kitchen, Mrs. Johnson. It's right through there. Okay Here we go. Oh, it's just so nice to see you, I just can't stop hugging you! Anytime you're ready, Ferb. Hey, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Hey, Isabella. We're blasting this pile of trampolines with an anti-gravity machine. So we can bounce all over the town. Why not blast ourselves with anti-gravity? Well, then we couldn't bounce. Blast them, Ferb! Come on, guys, follow me! It's so beautiful! Buford, you are crying! No, I'm not! You're crying!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Good morning, Perry the Platypus. I had to step out for a minute, but please, help yourself to some gnosh. Eggs, vitamins, ice, or leeks. I have no idea what you platypuses eat, but whatever you do, don't destroy my new evil inator. A-ha! You're trapped! Sucker! Do you like it, Perry the Platypus? It's my new Tell-the-Truth-inator! One blast from this baby, and people will be forced to tell the truth. It features an Abe Lincoln robot. He doesn't actually serve any functional purpose, he's just a decoration. But he'sâ He's thematically linked to honesty. Y-You know through hisâ His nickname, ""Honest Abe"". Y-You know through hisâ His nickname, ""Honest Abe"". But enough about me. Let me ask you this. Have you ever wondered what it is that holds the fabric of society together? No, it's not cooperation, or trust or any of that stuff hippies want you to believe. It's lies. All the little white lies we tell each other. You see Perry the Platypus (Song: Lies)  Lies are the glue that hold society together   People lie about their mileage   They lie about the weather   They lie to spare each other's feelings   They lie to stay in bed   They lie to feel important, about all the books that they've read  You look good in that hat.  Lies!  I don't think you have too many cats.  Lies!  Your hair looks nice when it's up like that.  Lies!   Lies, lies, lies!  Oh, dear, the house looks great.  Lies!  You haven't put on any weight.  Lies!  Oh, I thought you said eight.  Lies!   Lies, lies, lies!   People say that it's all right   They're only trying to be polite   But even though they're little and white   They're lies   Yes, everyone says it's all right   And I don't want to start a fight   But you know the ties that bind us tight are   Lies!  You hear that high note? That was the A above middle C. Not too shabby. Candace, will you pour the OJ? Sure, Mom. There's gotta be something heavy in here. OJ. Did you now that stood for Orange Juice? 'Cause I didn't. Well, it's not fresh. But it was an impromptu brunch. Brunch. A cross between breakfast and lunch. Makes you wonder what a late night snack would be. A lack? How about a dack? A cross between dinner and snack. Anyway Enjoy! Buford loves this! It's a beautiful day for a ball game! It won't be a beautiful day for long. Not after they all start telling the truth about each other. I'll start with that hot dog guy down there. Wait till the world hears what's in those things. And fire! Hot dogs! Get your hot dogs! There aren't really any hot dogs in here. I just wanted to get in the game for free. Huh, I didn't see that one coming. Well, let's just see what the players have to say. Here comes a fastball! Thanks, pal. And it's out of here! Malfunctioning. Loyalties shifting. Let's see what embarrassing truths that woman who's holding that unusually large hand mirror has to say. Secretly I'm very lonely. Where did that come from?! How about some lemonade? Phineas! There you are! This is all your fault! That machine of yours has made me lighter than air! I just mentioned that. I thought it would be so fun toâ Not a good time for that. I'm trying to make a good impression on Jeremy's parents and I can't even keep my feet on the ground! I guess we should install that reverse button now. We wouldn't want you bouncing off the ceiling during brunch. That would be a little rough on the old frittata. Just hurry before I make an even bigger fool of myself! It is all together fitting and proper that I must destroy Doofenshmirtz. No! Get back! Must destroy Doofenshmirtz. He's gonna John Wilkes my Booth! What? Too soon? Can't be a little too honest here! So, Mrs. Johnson, it's so great to talk to each other like adults. Just me and you talking all adulty and stuff, andâ WHOA! Just doing a little yoga stretch to help this digestion, yep. Good thing she's wearing her skort. Perry the Platypus, do something! He's going to emancipate my proclamation! What's up, Honest Abe? Looks like the old Doofster's a little too smart for yâ Oh Hi, you. Did I ever tell you I'm thinking of taking gymnastics next year? Awesome. Gymnastics? How about aerobatics? Ow! Ow! O-Oh, my gosh. Well, that's uh, enough uh, gymnastics for now. Candace, can you juggle with this? No! Put that down, Suzy. That's my 1984 collectible Ducky Momo plate, where they printed the entire design upside down. It's priceless! Hm-mm. Oh, whoopsie! Noooooo! Candace Flynn, what has gotten into you? I want the truth, and nothing but the truth! The truth? No! No! Get back! Honest Abe Lincoln Smash! Oh, now, look what you've done! We're out of control! Well The truth is I've been trying to make Candace look bad all morning! Suzy! I mean bubble! I mean bubble! Get over here, Suzy. We're guests here, and guests do not behave like that. But Mom, Candace floats! Oh, and now you're telling lies. Ugh. Mrs. Johnson, as much as I hate to admit it, Suzy's not lying. Phineas and Ferb made a ray that makes me weightless. I might as well show you. I couldn't embarrass myself anymore than I already have. Reverse switch, check. Is it aimed at Candace? Close enough. Look! Ta-da! So Dad, what do you think? She's a lot like your mom. Curse you, Honest Abe Lincoln! It looks like it worked, Ferb. Candace is just standing there, talking and pointing. Oh, now it looks like they're coming out here! Hey, let's show them our Anti-gravity Maximus! It's right out here, Mom! It was right here! And what am I looking at, Candace? It was a machine that made me weightless, itâ Itâ Suzy, tell them! Bubble! Ugh. You heard her. Bubble.  People say that it's all right   They're only trying to be polite   But even though they're little and white   They're lies   Yes, everyone says it's all right   And I don't want to start a fight   But you know the ties that bind us tight are   Lies!  Not too shabby."
"Another week's allowance replacing wedgied underwear. If I had anything left, I would invest in the company. Wedgie time! Thanks for savin' my place in line, nerd! Buford, how did you find me? Let's just say the initials are G, P, and S. Next! A pack of Tuff Gum, and this cheese grater. What is the cheese grater for? You'll see. $4.86. Paper or plastic? Plastic. Pay the man, propeller-head. Ugh! That is it! I can put up with noogies, wedgies, wet willies, and even the fact that you apparently placed a tracking device on, or inside my person But I will not tolerate your ignorant decision to take plastic over paper! From this moment on, I am no longer your nerd! Eh! Fine! I was feeling creatively stifled by you anyway! And you! You just cost me a perfectly good nerd! Maybe I'll make you my new nerd! Wow, your pressure tactics are quite developed for a youngster. Yes. Yes, they are. But some people don't appreciate that! But some people don't appreciate that! Y-You may be the most intimidating person I-I've ever met. You better believe it! You could probably bully the entire Tri-State Area! I'm getting tingly! (Song: Free)  Oh, free!   I am so free   Free to be me   It is me, that is free  Hey, Baljeet. You're just in time for what we want to do today. Where's Buford? Who cares? I am finally free to live my own life! I feel like I can do anything! Like climb a mountain! Like climb a mountain! Great! Let's put that energy to work building our nextâ No! I mean literally climb an actual mountain! Danville Mountain! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. We've just received some intel that Doof has hired an assistant, some muscle, if you will. He must be up to something big. You know, I once put in a request for some muscle. Got Carl. And how many attacks since I came on board? Well, none, but wouldn't kill you to at least look the part. You look like a pre-school crossing guard. No need to be hurtful, sir. Good luck, Agent P.  Agent P!  I can see while helping you take over the Tri-State Area will afford me many new bullying opportunities. But what's with the back-story, dude? I mean, who needs a special reason to boss people around? I never thought of it like that. We'll get started as soon as I pick up some fresh lab coats. These have got scorch marks all over 'em. Out of my way, melon-heads! Move it, or never use it! Wow, this kid's always on the clock! Give Dr. Toothenhurtz here his lab coat, Bright Eyes! I'm sorry. We have a line here. You might want to use it. And you might want to rethink that. I mean, it would be a shame if this double-dutch chocolate-mocha-espresso you've been drinking, were to, say I don't know, splishy-splash on all those pristine white lab coats you've got back there? Hold me! You wouldn't dare! Try me. Fine! Take your dry-cleaning and go! Who would've thought that after all these years, all I need to take over the Tri-State Area was a grammar-school goon? A ham-handed half-pint. A knee-high ne'er-do-well. A pint-size palooka. A pushy prepubescent. Are you done? Nah, I got one more. A pipsqueak pugilist. Okay, now I'm done. There it is. Danville Mountain. My quest lies ahead of me like an unpeeled potato. We can help you skin that adventure spud! May we present, the MegaPants! You see, these hydraulic pistons will walkâ No! I need to do this myself. And that means no inventions. What? No gadgets, no gimmicks, just pure achievement! It will be great! Let us go! No inventions. Are you guys gonna be okay? Sure! Why wouldn't we be? I don't know. That rope bridge looks a little rickety. A couple of hydrophilic unicycles wouldâ Not necessary! Fear is for yesterday. Today, we live! New Baljeet rocks! rocked. He made it! Well, with the bridge gone, we could probably use some spring-loaded boots! Or a drilling machine! Or Orâ Or Orâ I'll save you! Who is ready for some free climbing? Me! Dude, what's with the playset? Playset? No, this is a non-scale model of the Tri-State Area. So you play with dolls? Maybe but-but it also helps me visualize my scheme, it doesn't have to be used with dolls. all the time. Maybe but-but it also helps me visualize my scheme, it doesn't have to be used with dolls. all the time. Maybe but-but it also helps me visualize my scheme, it doesn't have to be used with dolls. all the time. A-Anyway, this is our headquarters, larger for the sake of clarity. And this, see this right here? This is my Sculpt-inator. This part will scan my body, and this part will shoot a beam which will then carve Danville Mountain into a lifelike statue of me! Visible for literally miles in every direction! Not scale miles, real miles. Then, when people see this splendid tower of manliness, they will just assume that I should be their leader. Look! Look how it captures the manly thickness of my neck. That's you? Yeah. I think the cut of your lab coat is working against you. I know, right? I've got to talk to my tailor about that. Look, there's Baljeet's house! I'm gonna spit on it. You know, I'm kinda surprised we haven't had a visit from my nemesis yet. I'm sure he'll be along. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he gets a load of you. Hey, Baljeet! You sure you don't need any robotic suction spikes up there? Nope! Or how about mechanical lobster claws? Nope! Or maybe gas-propelled pine cone grappling hooks? Or cybernetically controlled towing spiders? I'm good! Surprise! Matching outfits! It's John Phillips of London Bullywear. Plus, monogrammed jet-packs! Doof and Byoof! We rhyme. Gee, thanks a lot! Wait till my friends get a load of me! Oh, you're not gonna need friends. You're gonna be on top of the heap! Ugh, it's lonely at the top, but, you know, it's the top. So it dulls the ache. Yes!!! I have beat you, Danville Mountain! In your cliff face! I cannot wait to tell Bufâ Oh. That is right. Okay. That's enough triumph for one day. Are we done here, Baljeet? Yes. Phineas, go! Ice chalet!!! If we hadn't been able to invent something soon, I was going to scream. (Song: Big Honkin' Hole in My Heart)  Somewhere out across that skyline   Maybe down some lonely street   There is a boy with anger issues   Without whom I am incomplete   Who will give me wedgies now?   Now that we're so far apart?   I have got to get him back somehow   There is a bully-sized hole   A bully-sized hole   A bully-sized hole in my heart   Who will I give noogies to?   And tease for being so smart?   I just don't know what to do   There's a nerd-shaped hole in my heart   There's a nerd-shaped hole   A bully-sized hole   A big honkin' hole in my heart  Wait a second, you're singing? I-I know what that means, you're leaving, aren't you?! Sorry, Dr. Dooftinasian. But there comes a time when you don't wanna bully everyone. You just wanna bully someone you love. Nice kid. Well, back to the inatorâ Okay! We gotta melt out the inside! You know, you really ought to pace yourself! Mudroom first! Ferb, start carving the bearskin rug! You're gonna get the bends or something. You're too late, Perry the Platypus! Oop, make sure to get my good side! No! Perry the Platypus! Oh, you've ruined it! Where am I gonna get another mountain? Great job on this snow chalet, guys! It's amazing how the cocoa stays hot in these double-walled ice cups. How are you feeling, Phineas? Coming down now. Coming down. I myself am so down. I am in the basement. Buford! As much as I'd like a tearful reunion, we gotta get off this mountain pronto! Why? Let's just say if you want a neck like mine you gotta start lifting young. Before any of us move, I have got one last thing to do. There! I feel much better. Do not you? Wow. I had no idea that was so uncomfortable. I am so sorry. It's been great sharing this mounting moment with you two, but we need to get off this crumbling mountain now! Grab hold of something! Do you ever get used to this? Nope! I am totally gonna wash my hands after this. Twice. Who could've guessed it? It's back to normal. And explosion now Yep, just like that. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Whatever.  Perry!  I am sorry for my outburst earlier. No. I'm sorry for putting the GPS on you. Consider it gone! Oh, yes. This is much less humiliating. Don't worry. I'll get the duct tape. He meant for my pants, right?  I just don't know what to do   There's a nerd-shaped hole in my heart   There's a nerd-shaped hole   A bully-sized hole   A big honkin' hole in my heart  Wait a second, you're singing? I-I know what that means, you're leaving, aren't you?"
"It's coming! We're doomed! The prophecy has come true! We are about to pay for our over-consumption! You created me, Garbage-zilla! And now, puny humans, prepare to be trashed! Knock it off! Candace, I don't know what you kids are doing, but I'm taking an online knitting test in a few minutes, and I need it to be quiet around here. You might not remember quiet. I'm not sure you two ever met. Anyway, I'm putting you on noise patrol. You're in charge. I'm in charge? Woo-hoo! Yeah! Use a muffler. Oh, yeah. Woo-ho! This time I want an air siren, and tap shoes. Phineas, Ferb. Mom put me on noise patrol while she's taking an online test. She needs it to be ABSOLUTELY QUIET! She needs it to be ABSOLUTELY QUIET! Candace, I'm trying to concentrate! Now let's see ""What's the first ingredient in knitting a garment?"" Oh, I know that! It's love. What do you mean, ""wool""? You heard her, right? No noise. I want you silent and invisible. Got it? Silent and invisible? What am I? A ninja? That's it! Gang, I know what we're gonna do today! Speaking of silent and invisible, where's Perry? Agent P, we have a crisis. The Agency was going through Dr. Doofenshmirtz's trash this week when we found this. Defaced magazine cover. Shameful! There were hundreds of similarly defaced photos of good looking men, including this handsome devil gracing the cover of Covert Lifestyles. My interest in this incident is purely professional, but put a stop to it!  Perry!  Why? Wh-h-h-hy?  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Hold on, Perry the Platypus, I'm just getting the mail. Oh, goody! It's my order from the Power Tool and Skeleton Key Warehouse. I was wondering when this was gonnaâ Ugh! Look at this! Every week, the mailman makes the same mistake and I end up getting my neighbor's HS Weekly. Here, hold this, Perry the Platypus, I need to rant. I hate all these good-looking models on the cover of Handsome and Symmetrical magazine, mocking me with their manly perfection. Their perfect hair, their perfect skin, I hate it! And this is why I created the De-Handsome-inator! And this is why I created the De-Handsome-inator! Soon, all these good looking faces will be hideous! Ow! Wait, did you use the skeleton key or was it the power tools? Just for that, I'm not gonna tell you why the apple. Ugh, you know, I don't have the energy for this. It's still early, do you wanna go grab some lunch? Come on. I skipped breakfast this morning. You like eggs? Okay, gang. Ferb and I made these ninja outfits using smart garment technology. Once they're switched on, the outfits are designed to hide the wearer from anyone who's not wearing the suit. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I smell noise! Is that what the black pajamas are for? You gonna have a noise party? Actually, it's the opposite. We're ninjas. Ninjas are renowned for their quiet and concealment. We made an outfit for you, too. You should put it on. Take it from me. Black is slimming. No, thanks. That's okay. We'll leave it here for you in case you change your mind. All right, ninjas! Let's turn on our outfits! Hey! Where'd everyone go? That's so weird. Huh. Oh, I'll find them. That was cool! I didn't have to do anything! The outfit did all the work! Whoa, Phineas, which way are you facing? Good question. Left. Stupid, stealthy ninjas! Candace, keep it down! ""What do you call a clever knitter?"" I know! A knit wit! Is there anything better than knitting humor? I need to stop at the bank, I-I don't have any cash. Ah It's an honor, sir! A real honor! I can't wait to tell my wife! Ooh, are you famous? You look likeâ Like a model, a-are you an actor? You go first. I can wait! Please, I'm just getting some cash to buy medicine for my kids. Yes, uh, hello. I just need to make a withdrawal from my account, please. Here, take this. It's on us. No, no. J-Just enough for lunch. Sparkling sider? Scrambled eggs? That's real lobster in there. Preserve the moment! Can you believe the service in this place, Perry the Platypus? Here you go! All framed. Hey, uh, thank youâ See, this isn't me. This is just the superhumanly attractive male model that came with the frame. I mean, really, look at this guy, right? That's funny, he's wearing a lab coat just like meâ Oh, this is horrible! I can't be handsome! It'sâ It's everything I despise! Don't you understand? Beautiful people, theyâ They just get everything they want in the world. I mean, watch this. Hey, lady, nice baby. You want him? He likes you better. No, I don't want your baby. You see, Perry the Platypus, the unfair advantage good-looking people have? Hey If I ran for Mayor, would you vote for me? Over and over again. No, elections are for ugly people. I'm sure they'd just give him the mayorship. You think? Sure, you've already got a sizeable mob, and I bet we could pick up a couple thousand more on the way. Well, okay, then! On to City Hall! My busting sense is tingling! There's something Phineas and Ferb going on here. Phineas? Ferb? You in here? Phineas? Ferb? Phineas! Phineas! I know you're here! And the whole Tri-State Area knows you're here, Candace! Again, could you please keep it down? I tried to tell you before. A-ha! Uh Uh You'll never be able to see us, unless you wear a ninja outfit yourself. Oh, I'll wear a ninja outfit, all right! Then, I'll bust the whole lot of you.

Where'd you go? I'm right here. On the ceiling. What? I'm right here, under the rug! Young lady Now, I'm on the shelf. I don't know how you're throwing your voice and I understand that you want attention. But I'm really, really busy. It's the outfit! It won't let you see me. But, it apparently has no qualms about letting me hear you. Mom, here it is! Mom! All right, Candace. What am I looking at? These outfits were fun! I've never moved so fast! Oh, that was quite a workout. Hey, it's Candace's ninja outfit! It's hiding! She must've left it switched on. And now, I finally pronounce you Oh, Perry the Platypus, I'm so glad you're here to see this. What's that? My inator remote? You're wasting your time. There's no way you'll get a clear line of fire from my place to here, what with all those commemorative hot air balloons in the way. How do they mass-produce those so fast?

No, not doonkelberry pie. Everybody's out of doonkelberries! You can't find them anywhere lately. Really? Let me check. I'll be berry interested to see what you find. Good one, Mom. We should cast our net a little wider than Danville. Bingo! It looks like there are some in Drusselstein! It looks like there are some in Drusselstein! Drusselstein is a rustic Eastern European country, whose primary export is doonkelberries. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P, and welcome to the field test of our new talking letter. As you can see, it looks like a normal letter, except for this strange gibberish text that no one can read, and the obvious fact that it's got a little talking photo of Actually, this is a silly idea. I mean, we had to mail this last Tuesday. Plus, it's really just dumb-lucked that nobody else picked up the mail first. Well, whatever. Open the box, Agent P. That's right, rumpkinhosen!

You know, I really don't know what we were thinking withâ Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? We're gonna build a trebuchet to shoot ourselves to Europe. Cool! Gravity or tension spring? Well, gravity probaâ Wait. When did you learn trebuchet mechanics? Medieval Siege Engine Patch. It was my first one. I'm looking for a book on scientific investigation and disappearing objects. Got anything? Let's see Um Disappearing Objects: A Scientific Investigation. Um Disappearing Objects: A Scientific Investigation. Sound good? Sh'ya! Oh, it's checked out to a Heinz Doofenshmirtz. Yes? Vanessa? Doofenshmirtz. It's my last name. Heinz is my dad. Doofenshmirtz? What's that, like, Chinese? It's Drusselsteinian. Right, from Drusselsteinia! I'm heading over to my dad's house if you want to look for your book. Cool.  Drusselstein Department of Motor Vehicles and Goat Registration!  And this is it, right here. Thanks for the ride! Keep the change! What change? You've been hitchhiking! It's an expression! Hm. Perry the Platypus? Wow, rumpkinhosen. Five seconds and you've already gone native. Well, don't worry, I'm not doing anything evil today, I'm just here to renew my driver's license. Say, as long as you're here, why don't you stay and keep me company? Please? It's so boring. You know, traditionally, these things don't have much range. Yeah, it's a bit of a cheat to use a warp generator to bend the fabric of space, but I'm sure they would've done it in olden times if the technology were available. If the trebuchet can't go to Drusselstein, bring Drusselstein to the trebuchet! Baljeet? Bending! Hmm! Rustic! Here it is! This may be the only place in the world to get doonkelberries right now. That's because I have my own doonkelberry field. So when I need more, I pick more. But, what about exports? Well, the canning facilities shut down after the shaft stopped working. The shaft? All of Drusselstein runs off of central shaft. Or at least it used to. Or at least it used to. Drusselstein's a long narrow land, the only country in the world where a central shaft makes any sense, except for maybe Chile. At the end of the shaft was an exercise wheel powered by thousands of rabbits. The rabbits turned the wheel, the wheel turned the shaft, and the shaft turned everything else. A miracle of 16th century science, today! It powered our washing machines, our blenders, our schwingel presses, and of course, it ran all the country's doonkelberry processing plants. The rabbits couldn't keep up, so we decided to upgrade from rabbits to a more powerful source of energy goats. So we set up a differential on each side of the shaft, that the goats might walk upon the ground. But, the Leftsiders sent their goats walking clockwise, and the Rightsiders sent their goats walking counterclockwise. So the shaft couldn't turn. But the solution is so obvious! Just have one side turn their goats around. Yes, but we are a proud people. In our culture, turning your goats around is the mark of a coward! Neither side will back down. So it is, such as it has ever been, in Drusselstein, Land of the Shaft! So it is, such as it has ever been, in Drusselstein, Land of the Shaft! I am done, now. Uh-oh. Time for the 5 o'clock demonstrations. Counterclockwise forever! Turn around! We cannot be swayed! You're turning the wrong way! Rightsiders go home! Rightsiders go home! Rightsiders go home! Rightsiders go home! Filthy clockwisers! Your mama! Isabella, how would you like a Conflict Resolution patch? Fill out this form and take it to line 26. NEXT! Yes? I want to renew my driver's license, please. Hmm ""Hmm""? What do you mean ""Hmm""? I'm afraid you will have to be re-certified! I'm afraid you will have to be re-certified! Re-certified? No! But that means Yes! No! You will have to take Don't say it! the driving test! B-But t-there must be some mistake! Your instructor will meet you out back! I alâ NEXT! Hold my hand, Perry the Platypus! I'm scared!  Lookin' for books at my dad's place!  Why are you singing that? It's just something we do. Hey, swanky! It's all like science-y in here. Yeah, my dad's kind of an amateur inventor. I think I saw some books over here. Oh, here we go. Uh, we can just put his other stuff anywhere. What's the name of the book again? Uh Disappearing Objects: A Scientific Investigation. Uh Disappearing Objects: A Scientific Investigation. Disappearing objects? You mean, like socks? Like rollercoasters, building to the moon, stampeding cows Stuff like that just disappears. Does that happen often? Oh, you would not believe. So, let's recap. You Leftsiders won't turn your goats around? I believe we have made our position clear. And you Righsiders won't turn your goats around, either. This point is non-negotiable! There is only one point! There is only one point! There is only one point! There is only one point! We will never turn! We will never stop! Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I think we can solve this, but we're gonna need a certain tool. Wow, this place is just made for scientific inquiry. Hey, cool telescope! I bet I can see my house from here. Oh, cool, it's pointed right at it! What the heck is that? Oh, my gosh. It's another stupid invention. Thank you, Mr. Scientific Instrument. Thanks for coming along, Perry the Platypus. You know, having you around just makes me feel You know, safer. In this circumstance. Back home is exactly the opposite. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, do you attest that you take this driving test of your own free will? Yes. You may go! Oh, wait, wait, I-I'm not ready. Letâ Let me psych myself up. Just a few breathing exercises, then I'll go, okay, right? We have a choker! (Song: Drusselstein Driving Test Waltz)  Turn! Yield! Halt!   If you fail you'll know who's at fault   Avoid vehicular assault   As you're doing the Drusselstein Driving Test Waltz   Gas! Shift! Brake!   Drinking coffee's a big mistake   Try not to plunge into the lake   When you're doing the Drusselstein Driving Test Waltz  I'm okay!  Use two hands when you steer her   Then check in the mirror   What you see may be nearer   Don't lay on the horn!   See the traffic cop bossing   Pedestrians crossing   Never drive when you're flossing   You'll wish you weren't born!   Belt yourself   Only way to protect your health   Leave your friends all your hard-earned wealth   If you croak when you're boldly embarking   And parallel parking   And acing the written   Look out for that kitten!   No time for high-fiving   You're barely surviving   The dangerous Drusselstein Driving Test Waltz!  I think I did okay. Ladies and gentlemen, after careful consideration, we have come up with a solution that we believe will satisfy everyone. We will not be satisfied! No compromise! No compromise! No compromise! No compromise! Ferb? I did not think it was possible! The shaft is turning in both directions! The science is far beyond us! The viking is right! By separating the shaft, you have united the country! Your goats may walk in any direction you choose, Father! Yours too, my son! It's like a fluganoff miracle! You all have brought peace to our land. Surely there's something we can do for you? Yes. Yes, there is. Fresh doonkleberries! Thanks! Okay, Baljeet! I guess it's lucky that they had a trebuchet in Drusselstein, huh? Henceforth we shall call this day, Phineas and Ferb Day! Henceforth we shall call this day, Phineas and Ferb Day! You mean Ferb and Phineas Day! Phineas and Ferb Day! Ferb and Phineas Day! By descending order of height! Everybody knows that! Hello, Mom! I bet you can't guess why I'm calling! I don't know. Did the boys build a giant amusement park for leprechauns? I don't know if that's what it is! But if you simply look in the backyard, you'll see it! All right, Candace. I'm looking. And surprise, there's nothing there. Huh? What do you mean, nothing?! But but but But but but But but but Thanks, Vanessa. What about the scientific method? It's flawed. Thanks for everything, Perry the Platypus. And don't worry, Iâ I'll pay for the dry-cleaning on your rumpkinhosen. All right, see you back home! I'm taking the trebuchet. More pie, anyone? No, thanks, Mom. Delicious, but I'm stuffed. Me, too! I think it's gonna rain. It's really overcast out there. Nah. That's just Drusselstein. Baljeet? Oh! Sorry! I should always travel like this! This is greaâ Curse you, conceptual elasticity of space-time!"
"A long time ago in a studio in Burbank, California, a ragtag group of animators made a fake trailer for a Meap sequel they never intended to make. Unfortunately, everyone wanted to see that episode, so the animators were forced to write it and incorporate all these seemingly unrelated scenes. Aren't you a little young to save the universe? Yes. Yes, I am. I want your hat on my desk! Balloony! Colin! What? Jeremy's going to be there? Meap! I guess the joke was on them. We now present Meapless in Seattle. Ready to go? Sure. So, you're okay with not, you know busting your brothers first? So, you're okay with not, you know busting your brothers first? Yeah, I've been spending all my time worrying about Phineas and Ferb. I used to have other things to worry about. Like What? Jeremy's going to be there? I just need to broaden my anxieties. Yeah, I guess if you're gonna have an unhealthy mind frame, it might as well benefit me. Now, the mall is waiting. Now, the mall is waiting. Yeah, and no more worrying about Phineas and Ferb. I mean, if I did half the things they do, I'd get so busted. I mean, if I did half the things they do, I'd get so busted. Uh-oh. I just lost you, didn't I? Stacy, if I do what Phineas and Ferb are doing, I would get busted, and them along with me! A sacrificial bust! I almost got you I can take the hint out the door but they'll never see it coming. to the mall. OÃ¹ est la. OÃ¹ est la. Mom, if you need me, I'll be outside with Phineas and Ferb. And when you get a break from your French lesson, feel free to pop outside and check out what we're doing, okay? Okay, Candace, honey. Oh, would you take the garbage out, it's over by the door. Sure thing, Mom. Okay, Phineas and Ferb, what are we gonna do today? Okay, Phineas and Ferb, what are we gonna do today? Oh, sorry, Candace. We're having a giant pillow fight. Giant pillow fight? Perfect! Move over and give me a try. Sure, Candace. This ought to get Mom out here. You know who else would love this? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do that. Say, ""where's Perry""? Well, I was gonna say Buford, but where is Perry? Morning Agent P. Dr. Doofenshmirtz is on the move. We've tracked him to northwestern Washington. We need you to get up there and see what he's up to Oww! Oh! My back! Carl, crack! Cracking, sir. By the way, I want your hat on my desk! By the way, I want your hat on my desk! Because it rains a lot in Seattle, and I'd like to spray it with this cool new water-proofing treatment. Which reminds me, we've installed new unbreakable glass in your lair monitor. Go ahead, try it out. Hm. Better order that unbreakable chair too, Carl.  Perry!  Oh, look, Mom! We are having so much dangerous fun with these massive pillows. It's Meap! Meap! What's wrong? Meap! Wow! Cool ship. Is that yours? Meap! Say what now? Run! Hi, Phineas Run! Wait! Candace! Mom?! Come on out and see all the fun we're having! Okay Candace, what did you want me to see? I'm going back for Candace. What's going on? Run! Meap! Oh, no, Meap! You lost your translation mustache. The spaceship is right behind you. Le vaisseau spatial est juste derriÃ¨re vous. Hey look, there's Mom! Your children are climbing in the spaceship now. Hi, Mom! Vos enfants monter maintenant dont vaisseau spatial. We're going to outer space! Oh, for the love of, would you turn around? See ya! Oh pour l'amour de, vous de serait tournez? Well, when is that ever gonna come up in conversation? Hi, Mom! Check me out! I'm flying away in an alien spaceship with Phineas and Ferb! I am so busted! Autopilot engaged. Emergency Translation Mustache activated. I beg your pardon for all the hustle and bustle, kids. It's just that my planet needs your help! We'd do anything for you, Meap. In a rather large nutshell, here's my problem. You see, where I come from cuteness is valued above all else and the source of our planets cuteness is a very rare element called cutonium. And a very long time ago, back in the days of yore, a gentleman by the name of Zachariah Yore discovered a hidden underground vein of pure cutonium. Yore used this highly concentrated cutonium to turn himself into a being so dadgum cute that no one could refuse him anything he desired. But as we all know, absolute cuteness corrupts absolutely. Yore quickly became a greedy, evil tyrant, who after a great war was eventually removed. Afterwards, pure cutonium was deemed too dangerous, and the last of it was gathered up in a special container, and blasted off the planet into deep space. However, a week ago, scientists discovered a long, long dormant trail of cuteness, leading away from our planet in the direction of Earth. Children, and Candace, I need your help. Children, and Candace, I need your help. Someone else wants to lay his hands on the cutonium, and we have to find it first. No problem. Ferb and I can build another cute-tracker with these parts. Of course this time we'll have to adjust the settings to ignore Meap's cuteness. Oh, and yours too, Isabella! I don't need your charity. So how bad is this guy we're up against? I think you're already acquainted with the scoundrel in question. Ha! Those kids will lead me right to it! Just as I planned! What? W-What's that look? That was my plan. Yes, e-even destroying the pod walker was part of the plan! You know, I can deactivate the both of you, and two more just like you will take your place. That's better. Now, let's get after those kids, before they get too far ahead of us.  He's Mitch   But some people call him Big Mitch  I don't get it, Meap. Did Big Mitch escape from prison? Well, we come from a cute-based society. By law, the harshest judicial sentence we can pass down is a time-out. Nice work, Ferb. The cute-tracker 2.0 is up and running. So, where are we headed? It says that the cutonium is somewhere in Seattle. It says that the cutonium is somewhere in Seattle. How will we know when we get to Seattle? We're here. According to this, the cutonium is buried somewhere around these abandoned coffee houses. Well, it looks like the Unearthing Ancient Container patch I earned is finally gonna come in handy. Great. Let's find us some cutonium. The sooner we get started, the sooner we get busted. Look, Mom! We're digging up the entire northwest United States! You okay with that? Ah, Seattle. My home away from home. And to think, Perry the Platypus has no idea. He'sâ He's completely clueless about my little excursions up here. That poor, blind, trusting pla I'm not here! You are not seeing me! Oh, Perry the Platypus, h-how long have you beenâ Andâ And look at that, it'sâ It's Peter the Panda, my ex-nemesis, what a coincidence, huh? I mean what is he doing here, in Seattle, his hometown? I mean what is he doing here, in Seattle, his hometown? And look, he's got He's got two coffees, one of which for sure, is not for me. It's not mine, because mine's right here! It's not mine, because mine's right here! Look. See? Oh. Ugh! That is not coffee. That's just great. What kind of a world are we living in, where a guy can't down the contents of a mysterious urn found in a trench, without undergoing major physical transmogrification? Really? At last the cutonium isâ Oh, no, empty! Hey, dude! You're standing on my lab coat! Oh, no! No, no, no! Did you actually drink the cutonium? Oh, is that what that was? I totally cannot recommend it. Well, you're cute alright, but you should have become completely irresistible. How homely were you before? Hey, I know you! You're that Mitch guy, from space! Put me down, you best friend stealer! Well, I suppose one container of cutonium is as good as any other. Want to go for a ride? Won't that be fun? Yes, it will. Destroy them. Wow, you're strict! The cute signal's emanating from over there. And Big Mitch has it! My word! Something must be done, y'all! Soon, the whole world will be mine! If you don't let me down, I'llâ What? Oh, he's so cute! Yep, he's definitely the source of the signal. Let's get to the ship. Hi, Mom, check us out! To the ship! Gotcha! Come on, punch it, Meap. Let's get out of here! Oh, no, you don't! Mitch is gaining! I have you right where I want you. Hi, Mom! Look, I'm in mortal danger! Say hi, Ferb. My word! A tractor beam! Hold on, children, this ship is jumpin' like a June-bug on a hot chicken! Well, my little friend, it looks like we're about to meet our untimely demise. Yeah, speak for yourself. I'm gonna try to land on you, so you'll break my fall. My word, we've been fallin' for a long time! Oh, a joke about the commercial break. Yeah, that's how I want to spend my last few seconds. Meap! Oh, look, his mustache fell off, andâ And I didn't think today could get any weirder! Oh, look, his mustache fell off, andâ And I didn't think today could get any weirder!  Peter and Perry!  Nice try, butâ The mustache thing was still weirder. I'll take that, thank you very much. Meap! Meap! We lost him. Hop in! Big Mitch grabbed the cutonium. Do you know where he's going? Meap! He's heading back to my home planet. I must warn them! Red Alert! Red Alert! Red Alert! Red Alert! Mitch has the cutonium, and he's on his way there. You must rally the troops, and head him off at the evil fortress. This is war! Meap? Oop, pardon, forgot I have this silly thing on. Meap! Meap! Meap. Meap! Meap! Meap. Meap! Meap! Meap! Meap! Meap! (Song: Wee Wee Wee)  We we we we   (Whee!)   Are going to war   (We're going to war!)   We're going to war   (We're going to war!)   We we we we   (Whee!)   Are going to war   (We're going to war!)   We're going to war   (We're going to war!)   De- de- de- de- de- de- de-   Destroy our enemies!   La- la- la- la- la- la- la-   Let's bring them to their knees!  Meap.  We we we we   (Whee!)   Are going to war   (We're going to war!)   We're going to war   (We're going to war!)   We we we we   (Whee!)  Meap, meap!  Are going to war   (We're going to war!)   We're going to war!  There it is. My home world. Meap, your planet's so cute! Except, I guess, for that evil-looking fortress under that ominous cloud. Unfortunately, that's where we are going. So, uh Do we have a plan, or are we just going to go all willy-nilly and barge into that bad, scary place? You know, willy-nilly barging is a plan of sorts. Here we are. The extraction chamber. Seriously? Y-You have an entire chamber reserved just for extracting things? Thatâ That really comes up that often in your life? The extraction of things from other things. Look, I don't have to justify my life choices to you. You know you can drop the whole ""bad guy"" spiel. I'm actually willingly going along with this, in case you hadn't noticed, butâ Yeah. Okay, you're a bad dude. Cool, whatever, I get it. When the extraction is over, then you will see just how bad a dude I reallyâ Put it out! Put it Out! Put it out! Put it out! Put it Out! Put it out! Put it out! Put it Out! Put it out! Okay, now that was embarrassing. Okay, now that was embarrassing. I-I'm going up to prepare the machine, while you two finish up here. Personally, I hate the smell of extraction. Wait, what does it smell like? Meap, why are you taking the mirrors? Better safe than sorry. Okay I don't know, Phineas. That door looks pretty solid. Are you gonna try to hack the locking mechanism or crack the code sequence? Yes. Yes, I am. I think the sequence is push the big red button. I think the sequence is push the big red button. Back to my old self. Thatâ You know, that wasn't so bad. In fact, I rather enjoyed large portions of that process. Hmm. Extraction. Who knew? Peter the Panda! And Perry the Platypus! You're working together to rescue me? Oh, that's really nice of youâ Uh-oh. Uh, hey, guys? A little help here. This is some rescue. Yes! My machine is fully-charged with cutonium. Hold it right there, Mitch. Meap! How did you get here? With the help of Team Phineas. I never agreed to that name. You're too late. Not even you can stop me from becoming the cutest being in the universe. I didn't know he could do that. Neither did I. Don't just stand there. Get them! Boy, are you going to get it now, when No! On your right! The ramp on your right! Your other right! Yeah, when he eventually arrives up there, you are in big trouble. Yeah, when he eventually arrives up there, you are in big trouble. In the meantime, behold the creation of the most adorable creature in the universe. Me! Oh, no! He's done it! Whatever you do, don't look upon him in that state. You'll become transfixed by his cuteness and he'll gain complete control over you. Aww I just realized something about myself. Apparently, I run faster than a panda bear but not quite as fast as a platypus. Eh, who knew? You really do learn things about yourself in times of crisis. Wait, wait, turn left up here. That door must be the way out. Balloony, it's you! Oh, boy, am I glad to see you. Uh, chill, guys, Balloony and I go way back. So, Balloony, it's a good thingâ Well, it's been nice catching up, but uh Run! I think I misjudged his devotion!  We we we we   (Whee!)   Are going to war   (We're going to war!)   We're going to war!  Aww Look at the little guy. What's the fastest way I can transfer all my assets into his name? Mom, things look pretty bleak. We may not be back after all. Phineas is in a cute-trance. Mitch turned himself really adorable and defeated the entire Meap Army. There's no one left toâ Meap! Aww, they're blasting away at each other with really cute death rays. Balloony, please help me. Balloony! Oh, don't let me go like I did with you. Balloony! What ever happened to us? Balloony! I knew deep down inside you were still my best friend. Think of all the good times we can have, now that weâ Nooo! No! Balloony. Stay with me, Iâ I'm not gonna let you go a second time. Balloony! I can feel my heart popping. I can feel my heart popping. Oh, no! Meap needs our help! Phineas! Phineas! Come on, Phineas, snap out of it! Phineas, Meap is down, he's been out-cuted. What are we gonna do? Phineas! IsâIsabella. IsâIsabella. Hey, wait a minute. Isabella, we've had a secret cute weapon all this time. You! Me? Don't you see? You can take him. He's only cute on the outside, but your cuteness goes right to your core. So, what you're saying is, you think I'm cute? It's a scientific fact. I had to put an 8000-ohm resistor on the cute-tracker just to keep you from burning it out. Close enough. I'm on it. You can do it, Isabella, just be yourself! Hey, Mitch. What'cha doin'? Meap!!! Ow. Children, you did it. You saved not only my planet, but the entire galaxy from Mitch's adorable yet evil plan. On behalf of my people, I thank you. It was our pleasure, Meap. And I've got it all right here on my phone. Meap. Hey, he'sâ Oh, no! Uh Um.. Uh Oh, no, you don't! Meap. Good work, Candace. He's gonna get a serious time-out now. Fifteen, sixteen minutes. Well, it sure is great to be home. Thanks for the ride, Meap. Friends, I can never thank you enough for helping me save my planet. Our pleasure. And I think we all learned a valuable lesson today. But we all know what it is, so why waste our time restating it? Bye, Meap! Farewell, my friends! Goodbye! Goodbye! Bye, Meap! Candace, I thought I told you to take that garbage out. You are so busted, young lady. Of course, I am. Hey! Where's Perry? Oh, Perry the Platypus, I'm sorry there's nothing to foil, I'mâ I'm still down aboutâ Balloony! And now, a trailer for an episode we also have no plan to make. Pay attention up there! Jerry the Platypus? Ferb, aren't those extinct? As a matter of fact, I object to this union. Yes!  I'm just a guy who's a sucker for the sounds of mass transit  The Chronicles of Meap. Episode 42. Meap! Meap Me in St. Louis. Hey, wasn't that Suzy stuff supposed to be in this one?"

We're hungry and we wanna  So at this point, I can grab Mom in her hair appointment and bring her over where I think the boys are heading. I'm calculating they'll go by that weird looking building downtown, at exactly 4.59 pm. Candace, I'd really like to help you with your latest busting endeavor, but I have customers waiting.  We're hungry and we wanna eat!  Hey, Dad. I'm just stopping for lunch. He says we have another delivery for Heinz Doofenshmirtz. We gotta go back to headquarters and pick it up.  We'll take that to go, with extra dipping sauce!  Honey barbeque! You know, they fixed the elevator. Delivery, again. Oh, goody, it's arrived. One last part for my Juice-inator. Oh, right, you're still on that juice thing. Yeah, my Juice-inator, my giant menacing machine that I build that will turn City Hall into juice completely discrediting and embarrassing my brother the Mayor at his 5 pm media event. Step One, in my evil scheme to take over The Tri-State Area! Wow. You got a rich fancy life, don't cha? I've been told so. Do you have a pen? Yes, I do. Oh, I remember this baby. You know, if I had a clip like that on my pen, I'd never lose it. I think your little, uh What is that, a dachshund? Platypus. Looks like he doesn't wanna be in that cage. Oh, him? No, no, he likes it. Here you go. I'll take that. Thanks for everything. See ya. Hmm Why don't you use the elevator? Got a song for that? Actually, we do!  We just climbed up sixty-five flights!  The last delivery of the day. OWCA, the Organization Without a Cool Acronym. Boy, they aren't kidding.  Sliding down a tube, yeah   Sliding down a tube   Sliding, sliding down a tube  Great googly moogly! A distress signal! Agent P is really trapped! Why won't he use the bevy of tools and weapons conveniently located in his hat? Delivery! Um, I'm gonna sign for the package. Carl, your voice just got squeaky! I know that squeaking! Uh, where do I sign? Carl, what are you not telling me? Sir, Agent P doesn't have his hat tools. I took them out to clean and repair them. Something inside me just broke. I have the tools right here. What good are they to him here? Poor Agent P, he's just a platypus trapped in a cage. Wearing a tiny hat, a little fedora  A platypus in a fedora  trapped by an evil scientist  In a weird looking building  intent on juicing City Hall.  Hey, you know that guy!  Hey, I know that guy! I've seen your friend!  It took you long enough!  All of our other agents are busy out in the field. Ifâ If only there was a way to get these tools to Agent P. Yeah, before Doofenshmirtz juices City Hall in seven minutes!  Seven minutes!  Hightail just happens to have a seven-minute delivery! I can get those tools to your friend! I've never used it, but here's the 237 form. Sign at the bottom here, here's a pen, initial this on page two.  Sign on the bottom!  Put those tools in here! I've got the regulation box!  It's a regulation box!  And you keep pink copy, blue copy's mine! Good luck, young man! We could use someone like him at the Agency. Carl, why don't we have a soundtrack band?  Here's our card!  Schedule's gotta wait, Dad! I have a special delivery to make!  Paul's on his way to deliver some tools to a platypus in a fedora   He's on his way   He's gotta save the day   He's only got seven minutes!   Wishes he had more-a!   He's on his way and we're singing what he's doing   So it looks like we might have a new career before us!   He's on his way! I guess we are, too!   From a pop-metal band to a rockin' Greek chorus!  Rush hour! Tape yourselves together, boys! I've got an idea! Hey, Paul! Hey, kids! Just hitchin' a ride! Right here's good. Thanks, guys! See you, Paul! Here you go, dude! Sign here. And Hey! Perry the Platypus? Take that! You won't get out of there in time to stop me! Whatâ? What are you doing up there? Just wrapping up a few loose ends! Wow, metaphorical and literal!

What do you know about this? Excellent work, young man! Excellent! You know, it's unprecedented, uh, you being a human, but I'd like to offer you a job at the Agency. What do you say, son? You wanna fight evil? Thanks, but no thanks. I've found how I can contribute to the world. By being a mobile logistics technician! That's a delivery guy, sir. I know what it is! Huh, nice pen."
"So I said, ""You're not getting me up into the mountains on a day like this. I'm staying right here, with my beautiful air conditioning."" I'm just gonna chillax right through this one. Thanks for letting us host the French Fireside Girls at your cabin this afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Flynn. This will be a great place for them to get their North American Tracking patches. What did I do again? The French Fireside Girls, or le filles Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de feu, as they're known in their country of origin, are going for their North American Tracking patches. And you're helping us help them. I put a sticky note on your shirt. Aww. And you wrote ""love"". I knew it was there. Why do you play senile? I love your notes! They're here! The French Fireside Girls!  Alouette, gentille alouette  Or le filles Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de feu, as they're known in their country of origin.  Alouette, je te plumerai  Bonjour, le filles Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de feu. (Hello, the Fireside Girls) (My name is Isabel.) Je m'appelle Isabel. Whoa, whoa! Stop, stoppee! That's all the French I've got. I am Brigitte, and these are Josette and Collette. Bonjour! (Hello!) And this isâ Phineas et Ferb! (Phineas and Ferb!) We read your column in Le filles Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de feu Gazette. I'm syndicated. Everyone, please. Stand back! Keep your fingers and berets away from the bars. Le filles Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de feu, to earn your North American Tracking patch, you'll have to capture the most dangerous of creatures the vicious, American grizzly bear. the vicious, American grizzly bear. He has not been fed. My friend has graciously agreed to be the bear for today's hunt. Excuse me. What is up? Get in here! I know that girl out there! You do? Yeah. We met in Paris. It was a year ago and I was taking in some of the local color when I saw her, Brigitte. She was a beautiful French girl, and I was an ugly American. Which of course holds a certain mystique. With her, I completely forgot myself. I read poetry, I wept at beauty, I clipped my toenails. For Brigitte, I even learned to speak the language of love, French talk. For Brigitte, I even learned to speak the language of love, French talk. Oh That is why you are fluent in French. It was easy actually. A lot of the root words are the same in Latin. But I can't let anyone know I have a heart, it'll ruin my tough-guy image. And believe me, the irony is not lost on me in this suit. Aw, man, don't you see? If I get all gushy now, I'll be totally exposed! I can't stand it! There he goes. Let the tracking begin. Wait a minute, you speak Latin?! Go get 'em, girls! You'll never catch me running around in a fuzzy bear suit in this heat. You'll never catch me running around in a fuzzy bear suit in this heat. It is a tad sweltering. A little fun with water might be in order. Way ahead of ya', kiddo. You're on the right track, Grandpa. Mind if we kick it up a notch? I was hoping you might. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. I'd tell you what Doofenshmirtz is up to but the screen isn't big enough for the little box thingy over my shoulder but I'm sure you'll figure it out when you get there. Good luck, Agent P.  Oh give me a home, where the buffaloâ Moth! Moth! Moth! Moth! Of all the clearings, and all the woods in all the world, she had to walk into mine. Tell me she was deported! Buford, what are you doing? The forest is crawlin' with patch-crazed Europeans and I'm a bear in the woods! What do you think I'm doing? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I know! Am I on speaker phone? Get me off speaker phone! This way, I see a score! They're comin'! How's he doing, Baljeet? I want his fuzzy fent on my wall! Ha. Well You want to help us make a super-sprinkler? Yes. Yes, I do.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Aw, Perry the Platypus, are you feeling tired? Take a rest! I figured you'd be exhausted after breaking on all those doors. I even put aâ A mint on your pillow, and everything, though I guess it's probably just stuck to the back of your head now. Sorry about that. So, let's talk about pretzels. You see Perry the Platypus, when I was younger, I did a summer internship at Master Drakkenblad's Pretzel Palace. He was the biggest pretzel wizard in Drusselstein. His disproportionately delicate hands, could turn any dough into a masterpiece. But even after months, my pretzel still lacked polish. But even after months, my pretzel still lacked polish. No matter how hard I tried, my work was never good enough. Iâ I don't know why he was such a stickler, I mean it's a knot. What difference does it make as long as you can't untie it? It's a knot! Anyway, I was declared unworthy! So, now I despise pretzels. And any pretzel-related entertainment. And now Danville is having its own Pretzel Festival! Can you even imagine how angry that makes me? Can you imagine? No? Angry enough to create the De-Twist-inator! We'll see how festive they feel after I turn all those stupid pretzels into boring straight tubes of baked dough, likeâ Like breadsticks, which I also have a problem with, but I'm dealing with one neurosis at a time. And then, when I've straightened all their precious pretzels, I will waltz in, and take over the Tri-State Area. Y-Yeah, I know it doesn't quite follow. I mean I even made a venn diagram. See, theâ The pretzels are here in this circle, and we're talking about taking over the Tri-State Area here, and Yeah No intersection, nothing. Hmm. But I'm gonna work it out, you'll see. You see here, these tracks indicated he went in that direction. Great! Come on, let's check it out! But The weight was on the balls of his feet instead of the heels. He retraced his steps to here! He retraced his steps to here! VoilÃ ! The footprints continue here. This way, the hunt is on! (Song: Runnin' from Love (In a Bear Suit)) Pursue! She's good.  I've got no time for conversation, 'cause I'm runnin' from love!   Don't need no complication, 'cause I'm runnin' from love!   Wish I had better transportation but I'm runnin' from love   'Cause I'm runnin', runnin' from love   In a bear suit   Runnin', runnin', runnin' from love!   (Runnin')   (Runnin')   (Runnin' from love!)   Runnin', runnin', runnin' from love!   (Runnin')   (Runnin')   How about a giraffe suit?   Afraid I'll hit my head   How about a reindeer suit?   I can't pull that sled!   How about a lemming suit?   Afraid where I'd be led!   I guess I should feel lucky cause if you find yourself runnin' from love in an animal-themed costume   You could do a whole lot worse than a bear suit   Runnin', runnin', runnin' from love!   (Runnin')   (Runnin')   (Runnin' from love!)   Runnin', runnin', runnin' from love!   (Runnin')   (Runnin')   (Oh, runnin' from love!)  Runnin', runnin', runnin' from love!   (Runnin')   (Runnin')   In a bear suit!  Fireside Girls, goggles on. He has gone completely animal. He smells us. Pursue! and when the chickens hatch, that's when the marshmallows kick in. Oh! Oh, boy, this one really taxed my brain. And I-I am telling you, I am pooped. Anyway, forget the details, the circles are touching so the plan can't miss. Now, I've got a pretzel problem, and I'm about to straighten it out. You see, 'cause they'reâ They're pretzels, they're twisted, they're not straight. It'sâ You like that one, Perry the Platypus? I've been saving it up. Hey, Buford, what do you think of our super-sprinkler? We used low turbulence mechanics, and specific gravity to make the water hold its shape while in motion. You had me at super-sprinkler. There he is! Get 'em, girls! You cannot escape! You think I am afraid of a little water, bear? Think again! What theâ Aw, man. She is really serious about getting this patch. Oui. (Yes.) Where have you been? Dude, it is not my problem. Ferb, did you order a bear? Oh, man! That would have been so funny without the snorkel. Move it or lose it! It just stops? How is that possible? There is nowhere left to run, bear! No! No, don't look at me! Buford? See? Another reason to hate twisting. Curse you, Perry the Platypus. Buford! No! I'm not me! I'm somebody else! Buford, I know it is you, but why would you hide from me? Oh, Brigitte. I've spent years building up my tough-guy street cred. I can bounce back from the fuzzy bear suit, but being in love with a beautiful, sweet, exotic girl like yourself If people found out about that, my image would be fini. (finished) If people found out about that, my image would be fini. Oh, Buford, you silly boy. I'm a well-bred, refined European. I would never let the Fireside Girls know that I was vaguely interested in a brute such as you. In fact Au revoir. (Goodbye.) You okay, buddy? She said she was vaguely interested in me.  I've got no time for conversation, 'cause I'm runnin' from love!   Don't need no complication, 'cause I'm runnin' from love!

"Okay, Stace. I'm all set up. Nothing could get in between me and some good old-fashioned vitamin D! What about busting your brothers? Don't worry. I can do both! I've got a perfect view of them from where I'm sitting. Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I'm all up in their grill and they don't have a clue! Hi, Candace. Hey, don't you know it's rude to sneak up on someone who is trying to spy on you? Sorry. What are you guys doing? Well, you know how we do something new everyday? No! Oh, well We try to build some big project or do somethingâ I'm aware of the concept, Phineas. I was just being sarcastic. Really? Hey, that was pretty good. Wow, I totally fell for it. Ferb, I totally fell for it, do youâ Anyway Oh, right. Anyway, Ferb and I decided that today, we're gonna let you pick what we're gonna do today! Let me get this straight. You are going to allow me to pick what you are gonna build today? That's about the size of it, Candace. Size! That's it! It's gotta be huge. No, wait. You built a skyscraper to the moon and Who knows where that went. No, if this summer's taught me anything, it's not the size of the project that's important. What matters is proximity. Mom's proximity. Think, Candace, think. This could be the most important decision of your entire summer. Something that will make Mom come and see what you are building. Hmm, what will that be? Uh A Mom Attractor! Cool! You mean, like, a big tractor mother with all its little baby tractors? No, I mean, a Mom Attractor. A big contraption that will attract Mom so that she will come home and see what you guys built. Well, you heard the lady. Ferb, she knows what we're gonna do today. How can I help? Well, we're gonna need a list of things that Mom likes. Oh, hey, Dad! You know Mom pretty well. Oh, yes. I'd like to think so, yes. I'm trying to think of things that Mom likes. Oh, so many things, really. Music, hobbies, you kids. Ooh! You know what she really likes is my famous rhubarb crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. I used to make it for her all the time when we were dating. Oh, it made her so happy. You know, I should get out my toque and blowtorch and make one for her today. What a good idea, Candace. Thank you. Candace? Well, all right then. Ah, there you are, Agent P. Well, let's get down to brass tacks or whatever it is tacks are made of these days. It seems that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying up all the polyethylene in town. It's a substance apparently used in disposable baby diapers. It could be an evil scheme or it could just be neutral. Get out there and absorb the situation. Now, since your hovercraft is in the shop, Carl has had to arrange last minute alternative transportation for you. Yes. Hello, Agent P. So, yeah, go ahead and put on that fruit hat. Ooh!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Gonna mallet, mallet, mallet in the morning   Mallet, mallet, mallet all day  What is this? Some sort of Latin gorilla cha-cha gram? Hola. (Hello.) Â¡Ay caramba! Perry the cha-cha gram? I mean, Platyâ O-Obviously, uh Perry the Platypus. And I wasâ Use the door! Yeah, that was, uh Hmm Not Not, uh good. Not, uh good. Oh, well. There, that's better! I much prefer you trussed up in my happy Jump-inator! Which goes with the theme of my new scheme. The Baby-Cry-inator! I know what you're saying. ""But, Heinz, you've already done a baby-themed evil plot."" But this time, I've really nailed it. Let me explain. You remember my goody two-shoes brother, Roger, the Mayor? It is a well-known fact that no politician can pass up kissing a baby for fear of alienating the electorate. This can be risky, though, because if the baby cries, you can alienate the electorate even worse than if you refuse to kiss the baby in the first place. This has never really been a problem for Roger, though. Everybody loves Roger! Babies, voters, dogs, cats, guys with shovels, giant squid, you name it. But this little baby, and by ""little baby"", I mean enormous baby, is gonna change all of that! Today, when my brother is campaigning, every time he kisses a baby, I will uncork the Baby-Cry-inator! releasing such a wail that the voters will think he is universally hated by babies, and therefore, untrustworthy. I know it sounds complicated but I've thought this one through. Babies cry, everyone's unhappy, and I somehow take over. Babies cry, everyone's unhappy, and I somehow take over. It's foolproof! Hey, Candace. Check it out. Oh My Mom! Oh My Mom! Oh My Mom! That is so cool! Yep. The Attractor will extract the essence of things that Mom loves, and use it to attract Mom! Things like, Mom's Love HÃ¤ndel albums, an assortment of her favorite chocolate and scented candles, and of course, Mom's lucky Viking helmet. Why does she have one of those? Women are a mystery. That's gotta be one of the coolest things you've ever built. Yes. Yes, it is. Let's try it out. Hey, uh, I don't hear anything! That's 'cause you're not Mom. Hi, Mom. What? You feel a sudden and inexplicable urge to come home? It's working! It's functioning properly. Bye, ladies. I have a sudden and inexplicable urge to go home. I am awesome!  Awesome, awesome, awesome!   Awesome, awesome, awesome!   Awesome, awesome, awesome!   Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Candace is awesome.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!   Awesomeâ   Gonna mallet, mallet, mallet in the morning   Mallet, mallet, mallet all day!  I don't know when I learned this mallet song, but it's really catcâ I wouldn'tâ I wouldn't do that if I wereâ Come on, come on! Yes! Mom's coming! I just wanna remember this moment. Relish it. Revel in it. Bask in the sunlight of pure, busting bliss! What is all that racket? Huh? Wait! Mom! Phineas and Ferb, why is it not working? Oh, it's working, Candace. It's just that nothing attracts moms more than the sound of a baby crying! Must soothe baby! Well, apparently, the Mom Attractor has become self-aware. Cool! Wait, Mom! (Song: We Are the Moms)  Mom mom, mom ma-mom mom mom mom   Mom mom, mom ma-mom mom mom mom   We're leaving our work, we're closing our laptops, and responding to the cry   We gotta make sure the baby's fed and, more importantly, they're dry   We're professional nose-wipers and know every brand of diaper   But you have to pay the piper, don't you ever call us gripers   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah   We are the moms and we can't resist the calling   We are the moms and we hear a baby bawling   We are the moms and everything you've heard is all quite true   'Cause moms will always come through   Moms will always come through   Ooh, yeah!   We are the moms who get you into your pajamas   We are the moms and we could do without the drama   We are the moms and we'll always do what mamas do   'Cause moms will always come through   'Cause moms will always come through   'Cause moms will always come through!   'Cause moms will always come through!   'Cause moms will always come through  Hey, wait! There's too many mommies! Do something! Must soothe baby. What am I doing here? My goodness! I better get back to pitching my board. How did I get here? I need to pick up Will from soccer. Ladies and gentlemen, Mayor Roger Doofenshmirtz. What happened to that giant crying baby? Roger Doofenshmirtz came and it just stopped. Babies love him! Four more years! Four more years! Oh, no! I left a pie in the oven. Who's watching my classroom? My watermelon! Wow, this place has never looked neater than this! Oh, no! I-I just had the place cleaned. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And your destructive, fruit-loving simian friend who doesn't know how to use the door! Curse him, too! Candace, let go! Mom! Phineas and Ferb made a Mom Attractor and it's in the backyard! See?! Yes. Yes, there is a Mom Attractor in the backyard. Hello, darling. Look, I made my famous rhubarb crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e. Hmm, eh? Don't mind if I do. Butâ They asked me to pick And I did And it worked! And now it's gone! And now it's gone! Where did it go? Where does it always go?! Mama. There. There. This is too cool! Whose idea was this? Oh, it was Candace's, actually. You, my dear, are pretty awesome.  Awesome, awesome, awesome"
"I've got a feeling that today is the day. Even as we speak, my brothers are planning something dangerous, disguised as playing cards! Well, I'm out. Me, too. Losers. Sorry, I am late. That's okay. Deal him in, Ferb. Who came up with cards anyway? They were invented by ancient Babylonian traders and merchants. Actually, the Babylonians had been defunct as a distinct culture for millennium prior to the introduction of playing cards in India. That is right! Three months of summer vacation and I am losing my edge! Has it only been three months? 'Cause I've been adding up all of the things we built this summer, and we're way over 150! Oh! My brain is atrophied! It needs exercise! Gang, I know what we're gonna do today! And Perry? Who knows? And here, we have a marvelous 16th century wardrobe. We have one just like this when I was a schoolboy. And inside it was another land filled with magical woodland creatures. You English and your fantasy worlds. Uh, can I show you some end tables? Hello, Agent P! Sorry about the trees, they were leftovers from Christmas and we didn't have anywhere else to store 'em. Oh, and uh, also the air-conditioning system is on the fritz, so pardon all the frost. All over the Tri-State Area, keys are disappearing. Businesses can't open, the freeways have ground to a halt, citizens are locked out of their homes, and I, for one, would really like to get into the executive washroom. It's got a waterfall. You know, you wave your hand and the water just sort ofâ Well, it'sâ It's really cool. Stop Doofenshmirtz! Quickly! Look at this! This is my brain during the school year and this is my brain now! They look just the same. I know! But it took me three minutes to remember how to give myself a CAT scan! I am slipping! Not to worry, Baljeet. We've done a bit of cerebro-stimulatory haberdashery since you left. Huh? We made a hat for your brain, slowy. Boy, he is slippin'. Try it on! What does it do? Hold on. It stimulates your brain. Oh, my. An electric bike helmet? Lame! Hey, Stacy. You still wanna go to the pool? So, Baljeet. How many sub-atomic particles do you suppose are in that dandelion? Hmm But I could not tell you the exact location of any of them because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Seems like it works.  Bow, chicka, bow-wow!   That's what my baby says!   Mow-mow-mow!   And a something somethingâ  Perry the Platypus? You know, you could've waited till I put my pants on, that would've at least been polite. And do you know what we do to rude people around here? We put them in a water soluble capsule. And there's not enough platypus spit in the world to get you out of it. Yeah, hop this way, let me show you what I've been up to. Keys, keys, keys! Master keys, skeleton keys, latch keys, skate keys I love keys! And you know, take it from me, once you've accidentally locked yourself in a milk can full of cockroaches for a couple of hours, you'llâ You'll develop a real appreciation. But uh, collecting keys one at a time takes forever! That's why I've invented, the Key-Find-inator! Or the Find-a-Key-inator! I-I haven't quite figured out what I want to call it. Cool, huh? Soon, I will be able to open any door in the Tri-State Area, it'sâ It's brilliant. Uh, but my key chain is enormous. Andâ And it weighs a ton and everyone can hear me coming. What I really need is one key that opens everything! The Key to the City! My pompous brother, the Mayor, is always handing it out to some yokel of dubious qualifications. Well, today, it's going to be this yokel of dubious qualifications. Wow, look at him go. He's like a new man! Ah, he still gets de-pansed one leg at a time. This is great! With my stimulated brain, I am dreaming up all sorts of super smart projects! Great! Picked out a favorite? I have! You see, the greatest impediment to making astronomical observations, is our atmosphere. It is like looking through pea soup! So to make our terrestrial telescopes more effective, I am going to take all of the Earth's atmosphere, and put it on the moon! Uh I don't Um Sounds suffocate-y. Sounds suffocate-y. Ah, I will disintegrate that bridge when I come to it. But Baljeet, if the atmosphere is goneâ And it is so simple! I can use an ion coupling device to attract each atmospheric molecule to the second greatest gravity source, which in this case, is the moon, and after the initial impact, the particles will bounce up into lunar orbit! He is so hard-core! Blue skies on the moon! Imagine that! Hey, Baljeet? Can I talk to you for a second? Of course! I will just use small words! So Oh, we were hoping that we could talk you out of transferring the Earth's atmosphere to the moon. On the eve of my greatest triumph? Well, we were just thinking it would be sort of a hollow victory, you know, with everybody not being able to breathe anymore? Science marches on! Okay, thanks! Brain booster. In retrospect  not such a good idea. In retrospect  not such a good idea. I think Brain Boy's had enough stimulation for one day. Ow! Hey, that hurts! Yes! Yes, it does! This way my work will not be interrupted by creatures who cannot possibly understand it! Like raccoons, or people, for instance. I was so looking forward to Junior High. We're going to have to get into that tower. Any ideas? Yeah, so the, uh, Key to the City ceremony's not starting for a while so, uh We got someâ Oh, you know, I-I just realized that I'mâ I'm wearing a white lab coat and I'm leaning back against a black tire. That'sâ I think I might have to go change. Maybe we could each get a tool, and come at him from four different sides. Baljeet is way too smart to fall for a trick like that. Plot all you want, I have my eye on you! No one will be able to stop me from stripping away the Earth's atmosphere! Oh, the things I will be able to see! He was smart before, but now he's like a super genius! Maybe we should try flattery to win him over. Or, how 'bout a bribe? I don't think we could offer him anything that would satisfy his super intellect. Yeah, he's so amazingly smart now. All right, gang. This is our chance to attack the Atmospheric Device.

That would count as dangerous. But I can't go anywhere until I find my keys. Wow, great mad scientist weather, isn't it, Perry the Platypus? It's so dramatic! Ooh, the ceremony should be starting now. And now, it is my pleasure to present the Key to the City to this great humanitarian and American. Th-Thank you, thank you.

Well, I mean, clearly, it is possible, but highly unlikely. Prepare to beâ Surprise! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, that is so gross! But it's kinda awesome. Something is different. How did you get in here? We tunneled up through the base while you were busy with our jetpack decoys. I do not understand. Well, remember when we all made those life-sized stuffed models of ourselves this morning? No. It pays to show up on time. I will get an alarm clock. Two minutes to Atmospheric Transfer. Oh! It is too late! I do not understand the controls anymore!

At last, I, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, can open any door with this, the Key to the Cityâ You know, I can't believe it's so cartoonish-ly big. It's almost like it's not a real key, but just sort of, symbolic of a key. It'sâ Hey, what are you doing? Yeah, well, whatever, Perry the Platypus. I got what I want!

"Candace, honey, I'm going out to a birthday party. For who? You know Vivian's aunt's sister's landlord's son? Evan? His son. Dexter? Yeah. It's his birthday. Why do they even have parties for two-year-olds? It's not like they're gonna remember anything. Baby parties aren't for the babies, Candace. They're for the moms. The moms? So they can feel rewarded for all the hard work they do. Toddlers are easy. They eat, they poop, they sleep. End of story. You're a laugh riot, Candace. Think you can handle watching Phineas and Ferb today? Piece of cake. Have fun. Hmm. Time to be in charge. So, what you're saying is that we should never cut the red wire first. Okay, you two! I'm in charge and I'm gonna lay down some rules! Okay, shoot. No leaving the yard, no amusement park rides, no robots, no rocket ships, Ferb, are you getting all of this? no time-shift, no remote control llamas, Cool. no first edition issuing of commemorative coins, no asking where Perry is, no astrological planetary alignments.. Surprise! It's me! I've taken over the O.W.C.A.! Oh, no, he hasn't, Agent P. Aw, spoilsport. Doofenshmirtz claims to have given up evil. He even signed this ""I Give Up Evil"" affidavit to apply for work at the Agency. And normally, we could have rejected him because he's not an animal, but it turns out he was adopted by ocelots, making him, in the eyes of the law, an ocelot. Sorry to do this to you, Agent P, but we're making Doofenshmirtz your responsibility during his probation period. Show him the ropes, and, uh, don't let him out of your sight. You're probably wondering why I suddenly decided to quit evil and become a good guy. Well, you see, I'd just built an inator. I called it the Babe-inator! No, it's not what you think. Its purpose was to transform my brother, the Mayor, and all of his cronies into a bunch of crying babies. That way I could take City Hall like babies taking candy away from whatever they take candy, uhâ That way I could take City Hall like babies taking candy away from whatever they take candy, uhâ Oh, you know what I mean. Anyway, the Babe-inator was ready to go, so I took aim at my brother's office and pressed the button, but it didn't work! It didn't work for, like, the hundredth time! My evil plan did not work! And I thought to myself, ""Maybe I'm just not good at being evil."" That's when I had my epiphany. From now on, I'm going to be a good guy! So, here I am! Wow, my own cubicle. How nice! I'm gonna put a poster, right here, a kitten that says, ""Hang in there"". No offense. It's not like I think that's all you guys do, or anything. Oh, great. Now, he's going to Human Resources. Oopsies! Better plug this in! and no invisible paint. Oh, my gosh. I don't know how you two turned yourselves into babies, but that is so bustable! Smile and say, ""Hi, Mom!"" Now, you two are so Where'd they go? Come back here! No, put the power drill down! Ugh! You stay rightâ Ferb! No, you get back here with my phone. Hey, would you look at that! Newton the Gnu is Agent Silent G. Whoo! I have to blog this. Hmm. Must be a coffee break. Find the picture and send. Oh. They used to be so cute. ""Thanks for the old baby picture."" Ugh. Ooh, wait! I need something with today's date on it. I could take a picture of them with one of those old-fashioned things. It's like aâ A web page printed on paper A newspaper! Okay, stop and hold the paper. Ferb, sweetie? Okay, just stand here and No! No, don't run away! Wait! Hold it! No, no, no, no. Get back here. How about if we just sit? Then hold the paper. We don'tâ Weâ No, don't throw it. Wait! Okay, just hold this. Stay. Phineas, no! No throwing. We use ourâ Ew! Ow! Okay, hold this, Ferb. Now, I'll justâ Where's my phone? Okay, fine! Okay, if pictures won't work, I'll just take you to Mom myself! I know we have an old stroller around here somewhere. That's it, go right to sleep. You'll be busted in just a little bit. So then, the duck says, ""Got any grapes?"" Uh-oh, looks like, uh, coffee break is over. Enter. Agent P, we have a situation. Is this about that grape joke? Who told on me? Was it the duck?! That's not why I called you in. Get a look at this. This is Newton the Gnu. He was assigned to Dr. Diminutive, but it seems some bonehead blew his cover on the blogosphere. We still haven't found out who it was. In the meantime, we'll need you to bring him in. Get on it, Agent P, and, uh, take Doofenshmirtz with you. A ride-along? Sweet! I can wear my new fedora! Get out of here! Carl, get in here! When you're done delivering the mail, I want you to wash and wax my car. You know, a little wax on, wax off? It'll teach you karate! No, it won't. I am loving this! We are like partners, now. Likeâ Like Jack and Jill, or Alice and Wonderland! And with a super-cool vehicle! Be careful out there washing my car. Be careful out there washing my car. Don't scratch it. Ooh, look at these buttons! Wh-What does this one do? Whoa! Oh, yeah, this is way cool! Doofenshmirtz! Wait till Mom sees you guys. Shh! I didn't do anything! He's my brother. Just a baby. They cry, you know. I know! Toys! I'll buy you some toys. That's what makes babies stop crying! Oh, thank you. I'll just be a second, okay? Don't go anywhere. Stay! This apartment seems familiar. Hey, would you mind if I kick down the door? Ugh, Doofenshmirtz? Awkward! Why are you wearing a fedora? I'm a good guy now! I believe you've met my partner? Perry the Platypus? Stay away from me! Fools! That was only my hologram! Don't worry. I've got your back, partner. Ha! I trapped you in a particle bubble from my new Photon 2000 Particle Bubble-erator! Oh, brother! Perhaps you'd like to join your friend, Newton the Gnu in his decidedly ordinary acrylic prison. Can you believe it? I was having him over for a friendly dinner, when I read your blog telling me that Newton the Gnu is really Agent Silent G! I can't help it! I blog what I see! I've got some baby stuff! Oh, my gosh! Get back here! Suckers! Oh, my bike. Oh, good, the cops are here! I can report this vandalism to theâ Put your hands up! Oh, that's right. Phineas and Ferb, get back here!  I can crawl around on the ground  (Song: Here's Why It is Great to Be a Baby)  I'm allowed to make obnoxious sounds   I can be asleep both night or day   I ain't got much hair to brush   And there ain't no need for me to flush   And that is why you'll always hear me say   Man, it sure is great to be a baby   You can sit all day and suck your thumb   I can chew my brother's toes   And play with the stuff inside my nose   And the pans in the kitchen cupboard make great drums   Get strolled, carried, burped and cuddled   Wiped, powdered, diapered, swaddled   Hugged, tickled, dried, tossed   Ported, dressed, kissed, washed   Swung, spoiled, peek-a-boo!

As for your request, Heinz, I've decided to let you all go. From 40 storeys up. Just for the record, that's not exactly what I meant. Yeah, I know. What do you guys think? How am I doing so far? Hey, give it back! Uh-oh. Oh, poop. Hang on, boys! I'm gonna bounce us back to headquarters! Yee-haw! Sorry about your car, sir. This is all I could find. Oh, this is just not working out! Hey, Mom! I've found a couple of babies that you need to see! Babies? We'll take good care of them! Let me help! Uh, what are you guys doing here? We're helping Mom's aunt's sister's landlord son. Hi, Candace. Mom, I need to show you something. It's humiliating! I'm stuck in this crummy, little cubicle while my office gets repaired! Anyway, Agent P, due to your quick thinking and decisive action, you were able to rescue Agent Silent G. Doofenshmirtz, you're fired. Is it because I blew up your car? No, it's because I have a list of complaints from Human Resources. So, it was the duck! Let's face it. You've done more harm inside the Agency than you ever did outside. So, what you're saying is that I'm good at being evil after all! Norm, we're back in business! Dust off the inators! Later, chumps! I'll start with this one! Mom, these aren't babies that look like Phineas and Ferb. This is Phineas and Ferb. Okay! I get it. Lesson learned. Toddlers aren't easy! The irony is not lost on me! Little help here? This had better wear off before the next episode."
"Boy. It seems like summer flies by so fast sometimes. Yeah, before we know it, it'll be autumn. Yes! Back to school, baby! Oh, you meant that like a bad thing. There are a lot of great things about the fall. Jumping in giant leaf piles. Perfect example. Yeah, the leaves turn such pretty colors in the fall. I love it. Gourds. Gourds are great! What? I like gourds. I know what we should do today. Remember how we made S'Winter? Let's make S'Fall! Hey, where's S'Perry? Carl. Yes? Did I ever tell you you're like the son I never had? Really, sir?! Yes. It's because you're so unlike the son that I did have! And here he is. Come on over here, Monty! Dad, come on. You know it's embarrassing when you brag about me by belittling others. Right, sorry. Agent P, uh, you remember my son? Yeah, good to see you, Agent P. Monty here just graduated from HSWACA! The High School Without A Cool Acronym. Yes, I hope to follow in my father's footsteps and join you in the battle against evil. You know, son, I've been meaning to tell you something. Sure, Dad, shoot. Well, as you know, my father was in the Agency, and what you don't know is that he pressured me into following in his footsteps. But I always wanted to be an acrobat! So that explainsâ Yes, the constant acrobatic lessons you've been given since birth. You, Monty Monogram, don't have to give up my dream of becoming an acrobat. You can be anything you want to be. But, Dad, I want to fight evil. What? A-After all that money we spent on acrobat training? I never asked for that! Sir, I'll become an acrobat if it'll make you proud of me! Really? Hmm. Oh, yeah, Agent P, uh Stop Doof. A video game is more important than me? That's it! I'm done! We are so over, Johnny! Oh, hello, Vanessa, let me introduce Rodrigo to you. He's starting evil science school in the fall and I'm mentoring him. I'm in mid-ment. Call me Rod. Is that what your friends call you? No one calls me that. It's just that you seem rather unique. So, what's wrong, Vanessa? You seem upset. Nothing. It's just Johnny, he's such a boy. I'm sick of it. No ambition, no depth You always go for the wrong type of guy, these bad-boy types. Dad, perhaps you haven't noticed but you're evil. Hey, there's good evil and then there's bad evil. Am I right, Rodrigo? Huh? Exactly. So, how do we get all the leaves down, anyway? Way ahead of you. Grab an end. Buford, you can't! That's Phineas's tree. That's the tree! Sentimentality or leaves. You can't have both. Au contraire. (On the contrary.) If you would kindly direct your attention to Ferb, who is modeling this S'Fall season's fashion in rapid leaf production accelerators. Ooh la la, Monsieur Fletcher. Anyway, Stacy, so I decided that from now on, I'm gonna stop always interrupting my life with all these stuâ Stacy, I gotta call you back. Oh, I see. So they think they can stop me from seeing whatever giant project they're working on today by plastering leaves all over the door, huh? Well, it's not gonna work! A-ha! Um They've built a big wall of leaves to block the door! Well, I'll just dig in here and, uh Now that's a leaf pile. Backstory! Backstory! Backstory! The backstory is what drives an evil scientist. It is the ""Why does he do what he does?"" of the ""What does he do?"" My point is, at its best, evil science is like undergoing deep Freudian analysis with a theremin constantly playing in the background. Hey, guys, it's such a beautiful day. I thought maybe we could put the top down? Oh, okay. See, you are the bestâ No tattoo. Shoot.  Perry!  Ah, Perry the Platypus! Just in time to be trapped! Just in time to be trapped! Now that's what I call getting the boot! Wow! A real agent! See, now that's a trap! I even made it based on my own daughter's fashion style. Vampire-pilgrim-scuba-diver. What? Is that what you think I look likâ Wait, you made this? What size is it? Excuse me the interrupting, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, but he can get out of there fairly easy, no? Well, duh! The trap only needs to hold him for just enough time for you to get through your evil scheme monologue. At that point, your nemesis escapes and the race is on! Who will win? Good or evil? No one can say, except, of course, if you go by recent statistics which, it's pretty much good who wins every single time. No matter what. But, hey, if it was easy, everyone would take over the Tri-State Area, right? Every single person would be in charge and we'd be forced toâ I don't know, decide the rules together by voting or something. I see. It's just that I took a few advanced trap classes in school and I was hoping to show you, the master a few of my little ideas in the hopes that you could critique them. All right, knock yourself out. Don't worry, little platypus agent. When I'm through here, you'll no longer have to battle this inept loser anymore. Because, you see, I plan to get rid of both of you. Okay. Now we've determined that the sweet spot for entering the pile is right here, at the top. Oh, and I made gourd helmets, by the way. Here. Here. No, wait. Baljeet, this is yours. Phineas. I like to think each individual's gourd helmet captures their unique essence in some way. You know, in gourd. Exactly how does this capture my essence? Right, like that's not obvious. Yeah, come on. Stop kidding around, Isabella. Oh, I think we're over the drop zone. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to S'Fall! (Song: S'Fall)  All the trees are ready for shakin'   Grab a rake if you're into rakin'   Come along, it's ours for the takin'   There's a brand new season we're makin'   All the leaves are gold and red   And the sun's still on our head   Oh, we can have it all when   Summer turns to S'Fall  Huh? What are they up to today? Do they really think they can escape Mom's wrath by hiding in this fun, massive, glorious, autumnal leaf pile? Well, not if I can't help it! Hmm How does it feel, Perry the Platypus? Yeah, I thought so. Wait, you can understand him? Oh, heck no, Iâ I usually just pretend he's talking about recent movies I've seen. So, uh You didn't by any chance make a left-boot trap, did you? A left-boot trap? Whoever heard of such a thing? Uh, Dad? This looks pretty serious. Nonsense. The Zoondilini under swing is child's play. Uh Should both my shoulders be dislocated from their sockets, sir? Using my intimate knowledge of the Tri-State Area, I have installed, in two precise locations, these! Yay! Falafel! Cool. I know, huh? These massive propellers will physically dislodge the entire Tri-State Area from the Earth and raise it up into the sky where I will then pilot it around and you know, run some errands or something, and refuse to return it, until they make me their leader. Hmm. Well, that went well. Extremely well. Is this like aâ A robot hug for a job well done? No. It's a trap! What does that even mean, a robot hug for a job wellâ Who would even consider that a possibility?! I'm taking over your evil scheme, you fool! Dad, look out! Whaâ Oh, you have got to be kidding me! You see, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, I'm going to manipulate your propellers at precise angles and literally tear the Tri-State Area apart! But, hey, dummy! If you destroy the Tri-State Area, what exactly will you have left to take over? Hmm? The world. Take over the world? Thaâ That's crazy! Thatâ That's almost left-boot-trap crazy! Oh, would you get off that? Making matching boots is normal. You with the one boot, that's what's crazy! Join me, Vanessa, and together we will take over the world. I'll let you get a tattoo. I think boots should come in pairs, like people. Join you? I don't work for him. That's my father, you dweeb. Well, yeah, I just thought we had a moment. A moment? Yeah, I know. What a dip, right? No matter. Now, time to say goodbye to your beloved Tri-State Area! Huh? Great googly moogly! Combining fighting evil with acrobatics? Of course! It was right in front of my face the whole time. That's my boy! Gourd helmet! A-ha! I got you now! Oh, you are so busted! I can see that you're eating candy apples. Not something I can bust you for. You want one, Candace? Okay, how about this one? Good. Okay, well, at least I can still go on with my plan. I should go pick up my dry-cleaning before it gets too laâ Kids, I'm home! Mom! Mom! The boys are up to something huge! I just know it! But they've hidden it within a massive pile of leaves in the backyard. Come help me sort through them for a few hours to find it! Wow. Sounds great. No leaves? No nothing? No leaves. No nothing. Do you guys already have snacks? We do, thanks! My work here is done. Nice gourd helmets, though. Well Who's up for Sprummer? Okay. You got it from here, Agent P. But, Vanessa, I thought you liked bad boys? Eh, I'm over it. I think it's time I tried a A good guy.

"All right, Candace, I'm headed out to the zoo to do my volunteer work. Which means I'm in charge. Well, not really, 'cause Dad's here. Right, honey? That's right, dear. And now back to Horse in a Bookcase. (Song: Horse in a Bookcase)  It's a horse in a bookcase   It's a horse in a bookcase   Little horse in a bookcase   It's a horse!  You're in charge. Bye, Mom! Have fun at the zoo! Hello, Candace. Are Phineas and Ferb here? Yes. Yes? Can I see them? Probably not from there. I would like to visit with my friends, Phineas and Ferb. Can I please come in? Well, why didn't you say so? I am sure you would like to know what it is I am holding in my hands. Nope. Well, if you insist. Behold, the Ultimate Phineas and Ferb Digital Scrapbook! UPAFDS for short. Up-a-feds? UPAFDS! Whatevs. It's a digital compilation of Phineas and Ferb's creations! Phineas and Ferb's creations? Yeah, see? It's everything they've done over the summer. It's perfect! Could I just borrow that for aâ Foo-foo-foo-foo-foo! The UPAFDS does not leave my person! Hey, Irving! Is that the UPAFDS? Why, yes. Yes, it is. Cool! Let's see! We interrupt Horse in a Bookcase to bring you this breaking news bulletin. Little Crikey the Crocodile has gone missing. Kids everywhere remember little Crikey the Crocodile from his popular show, Little Crikey the Crocodile. I don't know, I just thought it would be nice for Crikey to take a ride, get some fresh air. Uh, but a couple of speed bumps later, badda-bing, badda-boom, no Crikey! I just hope he's okay. Search parties are looking in the swamp areas in Danville, but nobody's seen any sign of him. They're wasting their time in that swampy marsh. Everyone knows crocodiles head for the sewers. That's where we need to look. Tiny Crikey needs our help. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Ferb, I know what I'm gonna do today, too! Yes, Ferb. I know what I'm gonna take today! I mean borrow. I meanâ Hey, where's Perry? Good morning, Agent P. I know what you're thinking. ""Aren't you Hollywood's Ray Liotta?"" The answer is yes. Yes, I am. I'm sitting in for my good friend, Major Monogram, while he's getting some manscaping done. I mean, mustaches like that, they don't just happen. Besides, I owe him big for that favor he did for me at the Academy. Besides, I owe him big for that favor he did for me at the Academy. Hey, uh, Ray. I just did a favor for ya. Thanks, Francis. I owe you big. Anyway, our web monitors tell us that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been frequenting websites and blogs dedicated to chickens and chicken-related jokes. We don't know what that means, but it's gotta be something foul. We need you to get out there and take him down a peg! Good luck, Agent P! That felt great, Carl! Fighting evil like that, I-I was like zing, wow, yeah! Why did I ever drop out of the Academy to become a big Hollywood star when I'm needed here? Well, to be fair, sir, you do get paid more than we do. Yes. Yes, I do. So tell me exactly how you plan to catch this crocodile. Simple. We'll use the Croco-locator. See that blip straight ahead of us? That's Crikey. What's that other dot? Oh. Well, apparently, there's buried treasure down here. Eh, maybe some other day. This is so exciting! So, Irving Maybe I should keep this safe while weâ Foo-foo-foo-foo! I am sorry, Candace, as much as I have great reverence for you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person EVAH! I am sorry, Candace, as much as I have great reverence for you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person EVAH! Ugh, all I wanna do is show it to Mom! Oh! Well, sure. As soon as we're done with the mission, we can show her to your mother. Really? I can just show her toâ Wait a minute, did you just call it a ""her""? Yeah. Her. See? ""Hi, Candace, I'm the UPAFDS! And I'm a girl!"" Anyway, as soon as we're done finding this little crocodile, it's straight to Mom with the evidence! Come on! Move it, move it, move it! That's the spirit, sis! You guys are going down, down, DOWN!!! You guys are going down, down, DOWN!!!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Who is it? Oh, Perry the Platypus, come on up. A-ha! Okay, I chalk that up to poor planning again. Okay, I chalk that up to poor planning again. Anyhoo, look at this. Can you believe it? My goody two-shoes brother's getting an award for being the best Danville Mayor ever for the second year in a row! And he's only been Mayor for one year! I am going to make sure he never gets that award! Uh, you see, people used to laugh at me all the time. Iâ I know it's hard to believe now, but it's true. They would laugh at me. And would they laugh at my brother? No! Never! Of course not! Well, things are about to change. Thanks to my brand new Chicken-Replace-inator!  Buck buck bawk!  This beautiful device replaces anything it hits with a chicken! How funny will that be? Roger gets handed the award, and suddenly, it's a chicken! And not just any chicken, but the nearest chicken! Which, when you think about it, saves a lot of energy. I mean, why pull some chicken from halfway around the world when, uh, there might be one available right around the corner? Ugh! Ah, this is much better. Anyway, like I was saying, all I have to do is point this at Roger just as they're handing him his award, and zap! He goes from prestigious Mayor with a major award to just some guy holding a chicken. I mean, have you ever seen anyone not laugh at a chicken? Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! I-It's obligatory. The Croco-locator says he should be right here. Maybe there's some other way to track him. Phineas, puh-lease. I'm all the equipment you'll ever need. I mean, hello?! Let us not forget that I wrestled a ferocious alligator. A scrappy little crocodile is nothing for a pro like me. I'n' that right? Oh. Looks like Little Crikey grew up. She must be getting a bigger net. We're gonna need another boat. Isabella, execute Plan B! Roger that, Phineas! We're on our way! Okay, girls, let's light 'em up! (Song: Subterranean Crocodile Apprehension Expedition)  It's a subterranean crocodile apprehension expedition   If you've never apprehended a croc underground   Then you don't know what you're missing   Going through the sewers in a big fanboat   Gonna grab a gator and that's all she wrote   Get him in a net, and then we're gonna gloat for a while   Cause he's a big reptile  Lord, look at the size of that gator! Ha-ha!  Cause he's a prehistoric lizard with a streak of mean   Eyes so black and scales so green   More sharp teeth than you've ever seen in his smile   Yeah, he's a big reptile  Yeah, that's one mean gator. Nice short cut. We're right behind her. Hey, what happened to Buford and Baljeet? Come on! She is getting away! Gimme a second. If I eat nine, the tenth one is free!  It's a subterranean crocodile apprehension expedition   Subterranean crocodile apprehension expedition  Yes. Yes, there he is. The second he takes that award, bazing! There it is. It's chicken time, baby! The net? Again? Really? You know somethin'â What are you doing? Careful with that! Perry the Platypus, you are gonna get such a chickening! Ha! I hope you're noticing this, Perry the Platypus! Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! Chicken, laugh! See, I told ya! Candace, aim your boat for the middle tube! Candace, you did it! Perry the Platypus, come out, come out, wherever you are. You've got an appointment with the nearest chicken. I've got something that I needâ Now, prepare to be turned into aâ Oh, what's that? A rubber chicken? What are you gonna do withâ Actually, that's kinda funny. No matter! Prepare to meet your chicken! What the heck's wrong with this? Oh, boy.  Agent P!  No! No!!! No! No!!! I don't believe it! I go to the store for fifteen minutes and when I get back, I find you've turned our Nearest Chicken Farm into a swap meet! What did you buy, dear? Frozen lasagna. They were on special two for one, so I bought two, I figured we could have one tonight and then we could have the other one when your sister and her husbandâ Ah, don't change the subject! Oh, look, it's chickens! It'sâ I guess chickens aren't as funny as I thought. Wow, Candace! That was fantastic! The way you handled the boat and brought Crikey to safety You are one pretty awesome big sis! Hi, kids! Hey! How did Crikey get here? They must've brought him in while I was at lunch. Candace, why are you sitting on a chicken? Wait right here, Mom! I've got evidence! But why was she sitting on a chicken? I don't know, Mom. It's actually kinda funny. Yes. Yes, it is. Give me that nerd box! I'm tired of being nice! No way! I told you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person, EVER!!! I told you, the UPAFDS does not leave my person, EVER!!! Oh, no! You ate my evidence, you overgrown lizard! There you are, Perry! I just can't believe it's gone! Aw, don't be blue. All we've gotta do is wait a couple of hours andâ Ew, disgusting! What? My brother will be here with my backup. What were you thinkâ Oh That is disgusting."
"Has it come to this? Just standing out in the yard, staring at your brothers, waiting? They're gonna do something bustable, I know it. It's Jeremy! I know who it is! Hi! Hey! Wanna come over today? Uh, yeah, just checking out the situation around here. Uh, Phineas, do you know what you're gonna do today? No. No jetpacks? No volleyball? No""Where's Perry""? No jetpacks? No volleyball? No""Where's Perry""? No jetpacks? No volleyball? No""Where's Perry""? Nope, nothing yet. Yeah, I think I'm free. I'll be right over. Cool! See you in a bit! Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Let's build jetpacks and play volleyball! Oh! Let's build jetpacks and play volleyball! Ohh! Uh, Jeremy, why don't you come over here? Hey, Candace, you've seen Perry? Oh! Ah, Agent P, I want to apologize for my appearance. You see, I was up all night monitoring Doofenshmirtz. It seems thatâ Yeah, I'll have a cake. Sir? up all night, uh, building inators. up all night, uh, building inators. See what he'sâ I think you can go, Agent P.  Agent P!  Ah, yes, now that's bustable behavior. You should tell Mom. Stop telling me what to do. Mom! Mom, Jeremy's on his way over here right now. I've got like 5-10 minutes to get the whole ""Busting-Phineas-and-Ferb"" thing over so I can relax and we can enjoy our Saturday. Yeah, chapter almost done. Front yard or backyard? Back. Kitchen door. Done and done. Hey, Candace! Jetpack volleyball? This is a great idea! You're gonna join us, right? Uh Yeah I'll be up in just a second. I just got something I gotta do. I'm ready for our little charade. Mom can't see this! We don't wanna get Jeremy in trouble! You've gotta keep Mom inside! Oh, Mom! Don't be so silly! You can't go out there until we've, uh Uh unloaded the dishwasher, right? Uh unloaded the dishwasher, right? Right? But they're not dry yet. Oh, they'll dry, Mom. Things dry. Okay  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  You really think I need aluminum siding? Oh, oops, gotta go, I got a guest. Well, Perry the Platypus. Oh, hey, nice landing pose. See, that would kill my knees. You're trapped! Let's talk about what you've been up to, Perry the Platypus. You've been sneaking into my lair secretly and building inators in the middle of the night. Uh Oh-oh, d-don't act all so innocent. Every morning when I wake up, there's a new inator. Look! See? Three of 'em! Reâ Really, youâ You didn't do it? If it wasn't you, then who was it? I mean, you and I are the only ones who are ever here, which is sad in and of itself. B-But I'm not building them in my sleep! Wait, that's it! I'm sleep-inventing! That's fabulous!  I'm unconsciously creating complicated and truly evil inators!  Look at you. So evil. I wonder what you do. L-Let's see. Wait, how is confetti evil? I-I mean, it makes a mess, sure, but isâ Is it really evil? All right, let's try this one. A big cupcake? Well, maybe it tastes evil. Yes. Hmm, yes, chocolate! The most evil flavor inâ Who am I kidding? This is delicious. Let's see what this one does. Oh, Norm! Does someone need their spelling checked? No, I just wanted to do this! How about a hug? A Hug-inator? Unable to resist hugging impulse. No! No! No! No! Noo!!! (Song: Jetpack Volleyball)  Just strap on a jetpack and string up a net, Jack   Gonna serve it to you, so get ready to set back   Whack, smack, thunder crack   Try to hit that ball back!   Dig it, bump it, set it, spike it!   That's the way I really like it   Plenty of fuel so you ain't gonna fall   We're playing jet, jetpack volleyball   We're playing jetpack volleyball   (Jetpack!)   Jetpack volleyball   (Jetpack!)   We're playing jetpack volleyball   (Jetpack!)   Jetpack volleyball   (Jetpack, jet!)   Don't need to be a giant over six feet tall   We're playing jet, jetpack volleyball  See? I told you they would dry. What was that? Oh. Uh So, Mom, do you have everything for dinner tonight? Maybe you ought to go to the grocery store. Nope. Got everything. Oh, it's your bridge day! Better get in the car and go! It's tomorrow. Candace, why don't you go outside and hang out with the boys? Outside! Well, there's no reason to go out there! You know, I don't hear them. Maybe I'll go check. Oh! Ow! Ow, ow! Candace, what is it? I smashed my finger in the thing! I smashed my finger in the thing! Where? Let me see. Here! Let me see! I need a bandage! Okay, there's some rightâ No, no! The glow-in-the-dark ones we keep in the emergency kit! In the basement? Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow Okay. W-Whaâ What does this mean? W-When I'm awake I build evil inators that fail, and when I'm asleep, I build nice inators that work? Ah, what is my subconscious trying to tell me? It's just so exhausting. Ugh, I feel like I've been up all night, which, Iâ I guess I have, building nice inators, apparently. It's just Yeah, I'm getting sleepy. Ripple dissolve imminent. Oh, man, this had better be a dream because I don't like where this is going. Hon, I looked everywhere. I can't find the bandages. That's okay, Mom. It's, um I-It's all better. Great! Then I'm gonna see if the boys want aâ No! Uh Let's play chess. Chess? Candace, I don'tâ We never do anything together, okay? Let's play a nice long game of chess. Oh, man, everything here in dreamland is so distorted and ugly. Say you look familiar. Say you look familiar. I should. I'm the inner you! Inner me? Are you the one that's been making those good inators? I was trying to help you, you nincompoop! Yes, late at night, I was instructing you how to make the ultimate inator! That's enough! Don't overtighten it, like your brain! Now, let's just imagine how it will work. The Cake-O'-Hug-A-Fetti-inator! Fire! What's happening? Dude, is this cake? Ugh, the cake is hugging us! Hey, everybody! It's okay! We can eat our way out! Ugh! Forget about eating it now! It's covered in paper! It's mine! The Tri-State Area's finally mine! Hey-heyâ Hey, wait a minute! Wait! Now, was that a fantasy inside a flashback inside of a dream? Well, let me put it this way. What? What? What?! What? What? What?! What? What? What?! Did you have a nice nap? Ugh, enough with the hugging! Let go! You're the boss! You know, I'm gonna make a plug for you so I can unplug you. Gosh, it's been so long since I've played chess. I can't remember how the knight moves. Do you remember? I'm not really sure. Oh, the boys will know. What? No, no, no! You sit! I'll go ask 'em. Hey, guys! Uh, do you know how the knight moves? ""Uh, yeah, Candace, it moves straight up and then, uh, straight down on the same square."" Oh, hey, yeah, that's great! Thanks! Oh, wait. What was that, Ferb? Oh, yeah, you don't talk! You know what's funny? What's funny? I have this weird desire to go outside. Normally, around this time of day, you're pulling me to go out in the yard and I kind of have a hankering to do it! It's like a Pavlovian go-outside response. Let's go! Oh, Mom, what are you, a robot? You gotta do the same thing every day? Okay, Candace, what's going on out there? What don't you want me to see? Nothing! Nothing, Mom! No, no, no! Candace, let go! Mom, look, look! Checkmate! Candace! Wait! Let's play darts! Oh. Oh, wow, Perry the Platypus, I just had the freakiest dream. You know those dreams that seem logical while you're having them but are total nonsense when you wake up? I think I was some kind of 1940s business beaver, oh, and, uh I might as well get these three useless things out of my lab and push them out onto the balcony andâ Wait a minute! I've seen this before! In my dream! That's right! It's only really effective if I put them all together! H-Hey, Perry the Platyâ I mean it, Candace! You're acting really strange! If I'm gonna go outside, I'm going to go outside! Ugh, there's the phone! Hold that thought! Hello? Uh Please hold for some important information. Well, okay, as long as it's important. Wow! You guys are the best! This was truly an amazing day! It's too bad Candace missed the whole thing. And, Ferb, where did you learn to serve like that? At the Yorkshire Athletic School for In Your Face. I dare you to try that again! Well, I did dare him, I guess. No! No! No! No! A third of my inator! Jeremy? I guess the game is over? Cake. Okay Hey, Norm, a little help, please! Who needs a hug? Norm, what did you do, you big garbage disposal?! Now two of them are ruined! Whyâ Why don't you just throw the third one over? If you insist! Nooooo!!! Well, this has been a weird afternoon. Candace! There you are! What's all this? Well, uh Uh Yeah! It's our two-month, nine-day anniversary! Oh, great! Uh Was I supposed to get her a present? Hon, if you didn't want me to come out and spoil the surprise, you should have said so. But you are going clean up all this confetti, right? Nice going. You busted yourself. Quiet, you! So much for that inator. Ugh, tell me about it! Hey, what are you doing here? This isn't a dream! Oh, isn't it? No. No, it isn't. Oh, crud."
"Good morning, sunshine! What's your plan for today besides, of course padding up my cellphone bill? What's your plan for today besides, of course padding up my cellphone bill? I got nothin'. Every day, I wear myself up, trying to bust the boys and it always blows up in my face. I'm gonna take a day off from exploding face. Today is for me time. I'll believe it when I see it! Wow! I don't remember seeing this before! Cool, isn't it? I was inspired to put it out of storage after my, well my close encounter. Close encounter? Oh, yes. You've heard about the Danville crop circles, I suppose? They've been appearing in fields all over Danville! Some people think they're made by spaceships! I don't believe in spaceships! But, Buford, you've been in a spaceship. Several, actually. I'm a skeptic! As was I, until the other night when my motorcar began behaving oddly. Suddenly, Iâ I saw a terrific flash of light, Iâ I was inexorably drawn to it. Into escaping its irresistible magnetism. What happened then? Well, it turns out, it was the tow truck driver I'd called. He changed my battery and all is off. So, it had nothing to do with crop circles or UFOs? No But I just think that's cool, hence the poster! His words confuse me. Dad can be like that. But, nevertheless I know what we're gonna do today! We're gonna solve the mystery of the Danville crop circles. Hey, where's Perry?  Agent P  (Song: Monogram Rap This Old Man)  Over here   Let us get this thing in gear   There's a big, ol' lump of trouble in town   Awful things are going down   Please go stop Doofenshmirtz   I know this puppet show's the worst   But I never said that I could write a song  Could you just leave? This is really embarrassing.  Perry!  Hi, Candace! No, no, no! No busting today, Candace. It's just gonna blow upon your face. Taking a me day.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Aw, look how cute you are! All snogging in your cozy little trap. Why the chef's hat, you ask? It's the cheapest way I could find to trap you. Hey, times are tough waiting for my alimony check! I have to watch every penny, and the ""37 minutes or free"" deal from the local pizza guy can really make a difference. Just a second! Coming! Almost there Can you believe he made me pay, anyway? I vowed revenge. Cheap revenge. My first plan involved exploding pizza dough. But you know, he turned it into a special! He actually charged more for it! And that is why I created The Dough-Blow-inator! You wear it! You see, this baby generates a powerful curt of air, which can hold pizza dough aloft indefinitely! So now, I will challenge pizza boy to a pie-spinning duel at the Pizza Day Festival in Danville Park, today. I-I'm going to humiliate him in front of tens of people! And you are gonna have a front-row seat. Plus, you really complete the look. If we're going to solve the mystery of the Danville crop circles, we'll need a bird's-eye view. So, why not a hot-air balloon or a helicopter? I like to stay on theme. Oh, good idea. So, Buford, we are literally sitting inside a flying saucer. Do you still not believe in it? I'm stickin' on my guns on this one. It's a matter of principle. Crop circles have been sighted all over the Tri-State Area this summer. Let's get a view of each of them and see if there's a pattern! Oh, I know I wasn't crazy! Oh, yeah? Well, no one asked you, Farm Utensil Bob! There's the next crop circle up ahead! So, you say You know, you can see them too, Buford. My skepticism is boundless. It is the same design as the others! Maybe they're trying to tell us something. That they really like that symbol, apparently! There must be some sort of a pattern. Ferb, let's go to the next one! Flying saucer! It's a flying saucer! Oh, my gosh! You truly are the most remarkable woman I've ever met in my life. Candace. And you are every woman's dream Jeremy. Iâ I love you! We interrupt our regularly scheduled program to go live to correspond at Gordon Gutsofanemu. I'm standing in downtown Danville where the recent rash of crop circles has caused quite a stir! But today, something more. An actual sighting of a UFO! There were these creatures One had this crazy triangle head and the other looked like a sideways ""T""! One had this crazy triangle head and the other looked like a sideways ""T""! Sounds horrifying! It was! They don't look human at all! No. No, they don't. Who are these invaders? What are they doing here? What is the meaning of these crop circles? Why can't I time my barbecue right? I gotta call Mom! They're gonna be so bâ Oh, no, they don't! I'm taking a me day! Hey, everybody, she got-a free pizza? Hey, look-a what you see! It's a dough-osaur! Hey! The Leaning Tower of Pizza, ay? Everyone having a good time? No! No, we're not! We're having a rotten time, you stingy jerk! Why you-a callin' me these bad guy things? Because you cheated me! ""37 minutes or free!"" That was the deal! And 38 minutes later, you welched on it! But I would-a never! Wait-a one second! You are the guy who set up-a the traps to slow me down, yes? Yes, I-I have traps, but th-they weren't necessarily for you, you know, specifically, butâ Look, enough of your excuses! I challenge you to a dough duel! A dough duel, eh? I accept-a your challenge! If you win, I give you-a free pizza for life! But if I win, you no order my pizza ever again! Deal! I don't want your stupid pizza anyway. Don't bother! Chin strap! Well, this is the last one. But we still don't know what it means. Maybe we need to get a fresh take on this. Bring up the crop circle map. That's it! I do not see anything. Exactly! Because there's nothing to see! Right there! Right there! That's the one spot where the aliens haven't been! I'll bet that's their next stop. Let's go! The alien ship has been seen hovering overâ makeup tips, so you can look your best for the impending alien invasion. Candace, did you see the news? That is your brothers, right? Yes, but I'm not busting them. Uh, hello? The ultimate bust just falls in your lap and you're not gonna jump at the chance? What's up with that? Listen, Stacy! Me day! No bust, no blow up in face! FACE! Well, now that you've put it crazy Back to my stories. Taking a me day. (Song: Non Reaction Song)  Gotta keep myself together   No, I'm not even movin'   If I just do nothin', then my attitude's improvin'   La, la, la, la  Resist the urge to move.

So, if you do not believe the flying saucer is real, why did you want to take a turn flying it? Just confirmin' it's not real. Besides, I categorically deny I'm flyin' it. Look out! A little early to be knockin' my pizza down. We haven't even-a started yet! That wasn't me. You W-Wait. Where's my chef's hat? Ugh! You-a ready, fella? Nope. First, I'm gonna do a little pre-gloating. I'm goin' to wipe the floor with you. I'm goin' to make you scream for mercy and there will be none! Men will weep. Children will wail! Whales will wail! Likeâ L-Like this Like they do, except they'll be doing it on your behalf! And women will look away as you walk the hall of shame! Okay, now I'm ready. One-a, two-a, three-a go! Oh, no! Hey, what's-a your deal?! Not at all what I had in mind! Oh! Oh, this really sucks! Literally! Okay! This is really uncomfortable. Boy! That failure was spectacular even for me! That failure was spectacular even for me! You must be a lot of fun at the parties! But, seriously, don't order my pizzas again, okay? All right, deal. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Well, this is the spot. Fan out, gang. Maybe we can find out why this is the only field in Danville with no crop circles. You're wastin' your time. There's nothin' here but grass. Grass and this key! Grass and this key! Ah Oh, that's good. Uh, Phineas? It's the same shape as the crop circles. And I suppose that makes it special? Thank you for returning our key. We left large signs in fields all over the Tri-State Area, but you are the only Earthlings that came to our aid. Oh, no problem. Glad we could help. To return the favor, here is something you lost in 1977. Cool! The Voyager Space Probe! Goodbye and good luck! All right! Goodbye! Take it easy! Wow, that artist rendering on the news was really accurate! Okay, there might be somethin' to this whole UFO thing. Candace, I got the pizza you ordered. Thanks, Mom. I have time to do nice things when I'm not distracted by panicked phone calls. Oh, look! It's the boys in their UFO! And Mom is in the next room! Nope! I've had a lovely day and I'm not gonna ruin it with another failed bust attempt. No way this day is gonna blow up in myâ Oh! So that's what they meant by ""exploding pizza"". It's all the rage with the foodies. Oh, there's Phineas and Ferb. Hi, boys! Yup. Still there. I'm not sayin' a word.  Gotta keep myself together   No, I'm not even movin'   If I just do nothin', then my attitude's improvin'   La, la, la, la  Resist the urge to move.

"Hello, lads! Hi, Dad! What are you boys doing? I was just telling Buford about phone booths. And I'm not buying it! Oh, no, Buford, they were real. They were tiny rooms where you could talk on the phone in private. Yeah, and you'd have to put coins in them to make calls. You guys are blowing my mind! Speaking of coins what's this here? Speaking of coins what's this here? Behind your ear? It's a quarter! How did you do that? A magician never reveals his secrets. Your dad's really great at tricks! Not really. I just keep a bunch of quarters behind my ear 'cause he enjoys it so much. Wanna see what I got behind my ear? It's another ear! Mind flip! What are you doing, Baljeet? I am Buford's hype man. Check him out! Mind flip! That's great! You can be a hype man for all of us. Because I know what we're gonna do today. We're putting on a magic show! Hey, where's Ferb? Ta-da! I switched my body for a dummy of myself, that Ferb climbed into when you looked away. Mind flip! I know you. Didn't I see you flying off my dad's roof? You're gonna have to be more specific, I fly off so many roofs. Really? Nah, just the one. Of course I remember you. You're Vanessa Doofenshmirtz. And you're Monty Monogram. That's right. Should we even be seen in the same room together? I mean, you know, our dads being sworn enemies and all? What can I get for you two? Cappuccino with chocolate powder on top and a ginger scone, please. and two straws, no doubt. Okay, putting aside the fact that our fathers are sworn enemies, want to have those cappuccinos together? Sure, sounds cool. Good morning, Agent P. I guess we're getting a little bit of a late start. Our sources say that Doofenshmirtz is on his way to Steam Noir, the hippest coffee house in town. We need you to get there before he arrives and stop him from doing anything, you know, nefarious. I've got a ""Word a Day"" calendar. Phineas, Ferb, what is this? We're putting on a magic show. Do you wanna be in it? I'm calling Mom right now. Yeah, Mom! She can be in it, too. A cell phone! Perfect! Hey! Watch this trick. Voila! One cell phone transformed into miscellaneous electronic parts! Mind flip! Okay, really amusing. Bring it back. It's not that kind of trick. Ugh! I can still use the landline. The landline? That was my first trick! It's so awesome that we ran into each other. Can you imagine the look on both our dad's faces if they saw us here together? I'm surprised your dad hasn't put some kind of a spy camera on you. You know, where's your dad's Date-Ruin-inator? So, this is a date? Well, isn't it? Maybe. Do you usually have coffee with your dad's sworn enemy's daughters? No, just girls whose roofs I've flown off of. Oh, see, now I feel special. Yeah, I don't just fly off any roof you know. Of course not. I've got standards. It's got to be a building shaped like a Like a An Easter Island head? Oh, my gosh, exactly. What is that all about? I have no idea. Hold that thought, this needs more milk. Perry? Is that you? Listen, Perry, I'd really appreciate it if you didn't let my dad know that I'm here with the son of his sworn enemy. This is going pretty well and I wouldn't want him to spoil it. Can you help me? Thanks, Perry. Steam Noir! Vanessa says the coolest people in town hang out right here. My dad thought I wanted to be an acrobat. I mean it was fun but it wasn't my thing. My dad was the same way with Ah, waiter. You mind if I tell you my evil scheme? Myâ My nemesis didn't show up today and I still have to get it out. I figured since I'm getting nowhere with the older Tri-State population, maybe I should go for the younger demographic. So, behold, The Cool-inator! Well, you can't really behold it, it's out in the car. But trust me, it's behold-worthy. First, I will suck all the cool out of this place, it being the hippest coffee house in town. Then, I will blast myself with the cool concentrate, transforming into such an ""awesome dude"" that you, disaffected youth will have no choice but to follow me blindly and help me, you know, take over the Tri-State Area! Anyway, the Cool-inator is so hip that it only runs on espresso, so let's fill her up. What'd you say, dude? I need ten gallons of espresso. We only serve it in this cup, man. Wow, really? It's espresso, man. Fine. Let's see, this is about a quarter cup, and there's two cups in a pint That would make I'll have nine hundred ninety-nine more of these, please. There are six-hundred and forty quarter cups in ten gallons, man. This is gonna take a lot of trips. Ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the Mind Flip! For centuries, shaman conjured magic for their tribes, and countless magicians practice hocus pocus for their audiences. It is a mind flip! How do we do it? I'll tell you how, if you can keep a secret. It's. A. Trick! It's. A. Trick! It's. A. Trick! Carl's in college, right? He can program the most sophisticated satellite tracking computer in the world, but every time I try to call my dad he cuts me off. Can't even work a landline. You think that's bad? Every time I use the microwave, Norm starts involuntarily rapping. (Song: Won't Keep Us Apart )  I know that you and I   We come from different places   There's no telling why or who your heart embraces   These feelings that we share   There's a reason they're inside us   They're both aware of the list of things that won't divide us   The sun and the stars and the moon and the planets won't keep us apart   A  herd of wild wildebeests, a gaggle of flamin' geese won't keep us apart   (Won't keep us apart)   Duct-taped bungee cords, fiberglass diving boards, won't keep us apart   A device designed specifically to keep us apart won't keep us apart  Hit me again. Hey, do you mind if I use your restroom? I mean, technically I haven't had any coffee here, but I've bought coffee here and I thought that would qualify. I had a lot of coffee earlier this morning. Huh. Okay, TMI. I get it. So I look up, and there he is in front of the whole school Is thisâ finally stepping on the other team's feet as he walks. Well, at least he showed up. I mean, if I had a nickel for every time I got the ""Your father couldn't make it, he's working late."" call. But, I guess that's really your dad's fault. So what exactly do you mean by that? So what exactly do you mean by that? You're out of paper. Through the power of enchantment, and a few nifty dance moves, Ferb and I have conjured the glittered demons and are ready to pull off Phineas and Ferb, you are so busted! What is this thing? Get me out of here! Finito! All right, heads up hipsters! Get ready to lose your cool! Well, what I meant is that my dad spends all his time dealing with your father's schemes. I'll have you know, my father is a misunderstood genius. Genius? I have three words for you. Self. Destruct. Buttons. Self. Destruct. Buttons. Self. Destruct. Buttons. And yet, in spite of all that, there's my dad, free to do it all over again the next day. Whoa, really effective bunch of spies there, Major. At least my dad's spy network isn't funded by monthly alimony checks. You do know that what he calls a ""spy network"" is actually just a petting zoo. With hats! Say goodbye to your street cred, hip-cats! So, I said to him ""Step off my guest list, poser."" You want to hear how my nose whistles? Yeah, man, you know, it's all about my blog, you know. I blog about blogs that blog about other blogs. You want to hear a dream I had about my cat? Can I get some more local, organic water? I can't drink any more iced tea, because when I drink iced tea, I get crazy! Finally, daylight. Phineas and Ferb! That's Mom's car! Mom! Now, to set the inator on ""reverse"" and blast myself with all of the cool! Phineas and Ferb built a really dangerous magic show in the backyard! You've gotta bust them! Really, Candace? Busting? That's so beginning of summer. There's a Luciano Rigatoni festival at the Art House. Let's go. But Rigatoni's work is passionless! With minimal importance! Every piece betrays its own lack of interest in the subject matter! You know, Perry the Platypus, this is very uncool of you. A beanie propeller cap? T-Thaâ Uh All right, I'll give that to you, th-that's kind of cool. Are you cyber? Uh, want to do a sketch in my sketchbook? Where'd you get that gnarly lab coat? No! No! No, you're nerds! Get away from me, I'm not like you! I'mâ I'm cool! Or, I was going to be cool, when I shot myself with the inator, which is now destroyedâ Uhâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus! You know, our fathers are probably right. We shouldn't be talking to each other. This was a huge mistake. Fine. Fine! So, wanna do this again? Call me. Ladies and gentlemen, in our grand finale, we make everything disappear! Ooh! Phineas? Ferb? Oh, there you are, Perry. Where is it? What happened? All gone! You two! Here's your phone. It's totally fine! Okay, this may be an easy enough trick, but how did you make the whole show disappear? A magician never reveals his secrets. That's a little clichÃ©, Ferb, don't you think? Mind flip!"
"Well, here we are, gang! The semi-annual Tri-State Area Antique Show and Swap Meet. Here you can find anything under the sun, literally because it's held outdoors. Anything, Dad? Well, actually there is one thing that you probably won't be able to find here. An 1807 Dorcham and Wesley Boot Scraper, only one of them was ever made, and it's been lost to the mists of time! Oh, if only I could find that, I'd be the envy of the entire antiquing community, especially Worthington Dubois, my antiquing nemesis! You have an antiquing nemesis? You don't know everything about me. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! (Song: Swap Meet)  We got chrome-plated carburetors, calibrated regulators   Tube socks, cuckoo clocks, multi-colored alligators   Taxidermy jackalope, presidential bar of soap   You can find it all at the Swap Meet   You can take it away if you can fit it in your ride   You gotta lower the seat and then you give it a slide   But there's a thing you gotta know when you head to the show   If you add to your stash you gotta do it with cash   Purple padded toilet seat, dolphin made of concrete   Hub caps, mud flaps, food that isn't safe to eat   MacramÃ©, dust mop, curtain made of pop tops   You can find it all at the Swap Meet   You can find it all at the Swap Meet  Dad, I know you said the Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper thing was lost to the mists of time. I did, didn't I? Well, I suppose I get melodramatic when I start talking about antiques. Well, Ferb and I found this in that parchment booth. A Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper's map! But only three of them were ever made, and they were lost to the mists ofâ Oh, I'm doing it again. And we know what we're gonna do today. Hey, where's Perry? A Reno Man, No. 45, that's classic gig, brother. Good morning, Agent P. Look, here's the thing. I don't know what Doof is up to. I've been busy giving each of my friends personalized ringtones. I've one for you  Perry!  and one for Carl.  Carl!  I want to send out a ringtone for when I call my friends, but I don't have a theme song. Anyway, go stop Doofenshmirtz! What an incredible waste of time. I mean, come on. Most of this stuff, if you saw it on the sidewalk, you'd walk around it. Most of this stuff, if you saw it on the sidewalk, you'd walk around it. A Ducky Momo, first edition, green-pupil variant, with a left-handed pull cord! Heavenly light! Angel chorus! I must have it. But I gotta play it cool. So, uh Yeah, a friend needs a paperweight for her, uh, desk, and hmm This little trinket looks about the right size. Please, little girl, this trinket is a Ducky Momo, first edition, green-pupil variant, with a left-handed pull chord. There are only two of these in North America. They're more rare than Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper's maps, but not quite as rare as the Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper. Yeah, mists of time, whatever. What do you want for it? You couldn't afford it. Would you take something in trade? The one thing I want is the one thing I can't have. That! Early twentieth century Abyssinian silver baby rattle. But he won't sell it to me because of that silly French cabinet! You broke the arms off my armoire! Now its just a -oire! If I get you that baby rattle, will you give me the Ducky Momo? Yes, I will. You! How much for that baby rattle? Why, so you can sell it to him? Well, uh, yeah. No sale. Oh, come on! Everybody wants something. Okay, there is something I've always wanted. A Flenco G4-80 crystal radio! if you get me a cane with a cobra on it. Battle of Danville commemorative dentures. Pink gorilla suit. Ducky Momo, first edition figurine, I will have you! Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. Well, as they say in the film business It's a wrap! Get it? 'Cause you're wrapped. In film. Well, as you know, films sway public opinion better than any other medium. So, I have produced a movie that will convince the people of the Tri-State Area to make me their leader. Here's a clip. Make me your leader. It can't miss! Anyhoo, I'm going to enter it in the Danville Film Festival today. There'sâ Th-There's only one small hitch. It turns out it's Danville's Young Filmmakers Festival. You have to be less than fifteen years old, but no matter. Because, behold, my De-Age-inator! With this, I'll turn myself into a fourteen-year-old boy, submit my film to the festival and sit back as the people of Danville are convinced that I must be installed as the leader of the entire Tri-State Area! Cigar box banjo. An old time diving suit. A fur lined telephone. Be right back. Well, the map has led us to Boot Scrapers Hall. Oh, the spirit of Danville, see how his sole gleams, the Boot Scapers took their craft seriously. Hey, look, there's a plaque. But what are these funny symbols? By Harry, that's Boot Scrape! The secret language of the ancient Boot Scapers. ""To gain the world, and halt the wintle, reverse your mind, and mind the lintel."" The lintel? It's the space between two columns. Look! Is that Greek? Well, I know Greek, but I don't recognize some of these symbols. Wait a minute. Reverse your mind. Ferb. ""The disk of fate drops the boot."" The disk of fate? Oh, it's that coat of arms right there. The statue! Guys, look! The statue's boot is not resting on that podium. And the podium has a giant slot in it. Look! It's a big penny! Ferb, pay the man. Just like an old iron penny bank. Stand back, boys! Wow. Yes, the Boot Scrapers were renowned for their elaborate spiral staircases. If that Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper still exists, we'll find it down here. Not if I, Worthington Dubois, have anything to say about it. Oh, this seems to be unplugged. There. Oops. Uh-oh, the film melted into oil. That doesn't make any sense, it's not a Melt-inator. It's aâ Oh, right. Film is made from some petroleum product, and it made it younger, so I guess it makes some sort of ridiculous sense. There is one last setting on the De-Age-inator and ready to fire! Cool, I'm fourteen years old. I totally beat you, dude. Now all I got to do is take this DVD to the Film Festival, and then I'll, like, have a lot of power and stuff. And I'll likeâ No way, dude! You're not the boss of me. What do you want for the 1965 Northern Llama Rancher's Association commemorative creamer? I don't know, a buck? Commemorative creamer for a clear flugelhorn. Clear flugelhorn for a baseball stein. Baseball stein for cyclops santa. Cool! The inner temple. Okay, let's get a move on. Get down, Dad! Cobbler's mallets. Why did it have to be cobbler's mallets? That was close. Yes, the Boot Scrapers were master craftâ The Cavern of Secrets. This entire room was made from materials scraped off the boots of Danville Elders, who were highly creative engineers. Battleship hat. Coffee grinder, pogo stick. Secret letters home! Evil angel suit. Oh, blimey. I had no idea there was such a wide variety of historical boot scrapers. Which one is it, Dad? Well, that's the question, isn't it? Only one of these can be the true Dorcham and Westley. And no doubt a wrong choice will trigger a nasty booby trap. Boot scrapers were famously vengeful people. This could take every ounce of antiquing knowledge that I possess. You can do it, Dad! At last! A hedgehog, of course. This truly is the Dorcham and Westley Boot Scraper of legend. But Worthington, there are no hedgehogs in America! What? Oh, well, that's justâ Wow. He chose poorly. Well, seeing as the place is falling apart, anyway. Pink gorilla suit. Battle of Danville commemorative dentures. A cane with a cobra on it. Dude, chill! It's mine. I don't have to give it to you. Hey, quit it! You're pushing me, dude! You actually got it! Let me see if I can find a box. I-I don't seem to have a box. Oh, well. Wait a second, where's the patina? This is obviously brand new! It's not an antique! No trade! WHY?! Dude, you just totally broke my inator. That's an even closer one. Not so fast, Fletcher. When I fell, I landed in the ruins of the Hall of the Sandal Scrapers. An order of scrapers far more ancient than your miserable Boot Scrapers. And with this, I'll become the most powerful antiques collector the world has ever seen! Perhaps next time we should buy new. Prepare toâ Oh, no! My enemies from beyond space! Hey, look, Ferb, it's Garbog. Hi, Garbog! This is gonna be good. Team Danville, assemble! How dare you! My future wickedness! And that was the winner of this year's Young Filmmakers Contest. Let's have a hand for the directors, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher. Ah, crud. Somebody drive me home? Thank you, everyone. But we couldn't have done this on our own. We'd like to thank our dad, Lawrence Fletcher, for spending all afternoon making this movie with us. I had no idea you were so good with special effects. Oh, yeah, but it was mostly them. And we'd like to introduce the actor responsible for bringing our villain to life. Don't you mean actors? Don't you mean actors? 'Cause there's two of us. Take a bow, guys! Why is there an orchestra pit in a movie theater? Seriously, I need a ride.  La la la la la la la  (Song: Major Monogram Theme Song)  He's Major Monogram!   He appears on a screen   And he wears olive green!   He's Major Monogram!  I like the big finish, sir. I can do without the sarcasm, Carl."
"That's one exotic dragon-fruit smoothie for you and one for you! I'm just saying as a non sequitur, a talking zebra just seems a little Forced? Yeah, forced! Hmm! The sweet taste of an unusual and exotic smoothie! You know, this smoothie isn't really unusual or exotic. It's about as exotic as a staycation with Aunt Meryl! But, Buford, your postcard said that she had a pool. She has a patio. Tomorrow, we should work on Buford's penmanship. Actually, most would consider dragon-fruit to be that exotic, indeed. Known for its dazzling flowers, it is actually the fruit of severalâ What are you doing? Stâ Stop that. Stâ Pâ Paâ Stop that. You know, Buford's kind of right. These smoothies are sort of exotic, but I think we can do better. What do you think, Phineas? What do I think? Don't answer that. Guys, I know what we're gonna do today! I wonder what kind of smoothie Perry would like? Come in. Sit down, Agent P. We have a serious problem. It seems someone, and I'm not saying who, someone has spilled on the couch in the lobby. Sir, Iâ A very expensive couch when we bought it in 1985. Sir, all I did was turn the cushion over. The stain was alreadyâ If the responsible party is present Sir, it was Agent M. He spilled a latte in 1990. Ugh, we were hoping to get him there a couple of years out of that couch. Anyhoo? Uh Anyhoo, our surveillance operatives have been getting some mixed signals from Doofenshmirtz. He was observed at the Danville Library, checking out books on Eastern Australia and hydrostatic cell fusion. We haven't come up with any ideas about what he's up to Maybe he's trying to recreate Pangaea, sir. Like I said, we haven't come up with anything yet. So, we need you to get in there and find out. Good luck, and be careful out there. Okay, everyone! Ferb and I developed a device that can literally turn any solid into liquid, so we can enjoy all sorts of new and unusual flavors. Isabella? Abracapocus! Wow, that was really impressive! I just got my Magic patch. Let's try this again. Behold! The State-of-the-Matter Transfer Device! All right, Buford, is that chicken ready? All set. I-I got ya! There you are. Liquid poultry. Hmm. Tastes like chicken. I think we need to try something a little more Foul? Yeah, fâ No! Exotic!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Well, hello, Perry the Platypus! Over here. No, here. L-Look aâ Look a little more this way. What do you think, huh? I've joined you in the genus Ornithorhynchus. That's right, I am a platypus! That's right, I am a platypus! Yeah, hang on, let me turn off the dramatic lighting. How did this come to be? Well, I'll tell you, since you didn't ask. After years of being bested by your battle, I decided to fight fire with fire. And in both cases, ""fire"" means platypus and ""with"" just means with. It was simple! The best way to beat a platypus was to become a platypus! That way, our skills would be evenly matched. So, after a couple of promising experiments and some intricate designs, I finally created the Platyp-inator! Pretty cool, huh? Now, before I defeat you, I think that I should further level the playing field. There! Now I'm trapped, too. And go! You'reâ Y-You're not struggling, I-I said go. We should both beâ Yeah, like that. Okay. Isabella, you wanna go next? Why, yes. How about a romantic dinner for two? Wanna sip, Phineas? Oh, no, thanks. Oh, okay. I understand. You know, you want to keep yourself open to other drink options. I get it. Actually, I-I didn't want to say anything in front of everybody, but, it'sâ I don't like zucchini. Oh. And that is why we wear white shoes after Labor Day. And I Oh, I knew it. Phineas and Ferb. Not very impressive, but suspicious. Stacy, Iâ I gotta go. Oh, and happy birthday! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Oh, laundry. Sometimes, I feel like our first president, because I'm washing a ton. Ah, yeah. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! You have to come out to the backyard! Oh, hey, Candace. I feel like our first president becauseâ No time for the stand-up routine, Mom. You've gotta come out to the backyard. Okay, I'll be right out. HURRY! (Song: When Platypi Fight)  Let's go!   The time is now, they're gonna do their dance   No room for negotiation   One's got a hat   Neither has pants, but that bears no further explanation   I think you know what's gonna go down   Yeah, there's gonna be a platypus throwdown!   Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight!   It's a fracas, it's a fray   It's a monotreme melee   Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight!   If you're watching at home, there's a seven-second delay   Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight!   It's a duck-billed duel   It's a beaver-tailed battle   Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight!   Gonna smack you so hard that your teeth are gonna rattle   It's a platypus fight!  What is this thing? Some sort of souped-up techno-geek camera? I wonder what itâ Phineas and Ferb! No! Get off! Ew! Well, that's funny. I could've sworn she said backyard. Oh, well. If anyone needs me, I'll be washing a ton. Let's see, we've got horseradish, durians, and turmeric. I've got a mountain yam. I cannot wait to taste liquified sea salt. Hey! Watch where you're steering those sneakers, bub! Candace? You're a smoothie? Phineas, you've gotta fix this! That is so cool! Uh, what does it feel like? It feels like you're in big trouble! Ferb, we're gonna need some sponges and a bucket! Phew! This whole evenly matched thing is exhausting. How about we take a short break? Do you ever get tired of lugging this big tail around? I mean, sure, it's great for fighting, but it's kinda weird for sitting and stuff. I just figure I'd ask you because, you know You would know. U-Uh, sugar or agave syrup? Here. I-I don't know if this is fur or really tiny feathers. I can't tell. It's so warm, but it breathes. Well, back at it, I guess.  Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight   It's a fracas, it's a fray   It's a moâ  Okay. These are the last drops of her. Hurry up and change me before that bird comes back! Sure thing, Candace. We reversed the polarity, and it should do the trick. Now, try not to ripple. This does not feel like the reverse of being a bucket of water. Hmm, so it would seem. I don't know, I kinda like her like that. She looks like Cand-berry sauce. We gotta get her back into the right shape before we solidify her. We're gonna need to adjust the contouringâ Cand-berry sauce.  Fight, fight! There's a platypus fight!   It's a duck-billed duuueeelll  Hang in there, Candace. This mold that Buford brought over should help us put her back together. Tell me again why you have a life-sized mold of Candace. I got life-sized molds of all my friends. I'm not so sure how I feel about that. All set, Candace! Now, wait right there. Ha-ha. Very funny. Okay. Here we go! Candace, come on out! I'm me! Glorious me! You did it! You guys are so o busted! You guys are so o busted! You guys are so o busted! Okay, Perry the Platypus, this isn't working. I need to become something stronger than a platypus. Let's see, what'sâ What's stronger than a platypus? Two platypuses, that's it! I've got just the thing right over here. Behold! My Double-inator! There! Nice and clean. Ha! Now we're both a couple of good-looking dishes. Bah-da-da-duh-duh! Thank you, I'll be here all night. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Candace, watch this. I was just looking at this plate, and I said, ""There, nice and"" Not right now! Candace, my hands are wet. I'll just shoot myself with this baby, and then I will have the advantage because there will be two of meâ Anyone else see that? I wonder what that hit. Whatever it is, there's two of them now. Soon there's gonna be two of me, and then nothing can defeat me! Except maybe a bigger platypus made out of metal. Yeah, like that. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Even though I'm also a platypus at this point, and, uh I hope this wears off soon. The novelty has worn thin. Come on, come on, come on! Oh, hi, Mom! I'm sorry, Mom, but you've got to see this. Feast your eyes on puddles. Feast your eyes on puddles. Yeah, I saw 'em earlier. But, Mom, they had a machine that would turn things into smoothie, andâ I didn't see it, Candace. And Buford had a mold, of me! Buford's got molds of all of us, Candace. Oh, there you are, Perry! Oh, well, I guess at least I'm back to normal. Me, too! Oh, good for youâ Oh, whaâ?!"
"Hi, Phineas! What'cha makin'? Uh, sawdust machine? Nope. Take a look. Oh, they're adorable! What are they? They're nanobots! Nanobots? Can they be programmed? Sure. They can link up in virtually infinite configurations to make just about anything you can imagine. So, impress me. Okay. Yeah, yeah, main title, whatever. But I think I see the potential. Like You could use them to make a giant birthday paddle. Or a telescope. Or a giant birthday paddle and a regular-sized cheese grater. Or a scratching post forâ Hey! I'm way ahead of you, Isabella. Ah, Agent P. Welcome to the best noodle house in Shanghai. Yeah, I know it's a long haul, but the local take-out just wasn't cutting it for my sophisticated palate. I wanna tell you what Doof is up to, but I have no idea. I've been on the plane for 17 hours, and they don't let you use your cell phones till you land, and then I realized I didn't have international coverage, so Anyway, you should probably get back to Danville and check on him, just in case. Don't worry, I'll bring you back some white rice and soy sauce. All right, gang! Let's get techno-mimetic. Let's use technology to mimicâ Why you gotta talk like that? You're right. Nanobots, please. What are you doing? We're making a car. Buford loves that! That's awesome! Helicopter! Helicopter! Helicopter! Helicopter! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! Bigger! Sure! We'll just need to whip up some more nanobots! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom, the boys! Garage! Look! Oh, they're making little models. How cute! You don't understand! It was nothing, and then it was flying and.. They made it out of dust! Oh, Candace, you're not even trying. Okay, I need more information.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Welcome, Perry the Platypus. Would you like a muffin? They're fresh and yummy! Muffins stay warmest in here, close to my heart. You must be here to see Dr. Doofenshmirtz! I'm sorry, he's not in rightâ Whoops, incoming message. Well, hello, Perry the Platypus! Sorry I couldn't be there to capture you personally. I was called in for jury duty. But no big deal! I've got the perfect ""get out of jury duty free"" card! Relax, it's totally legit. Meanwhile, I'm leaving Norm in charge, the big lump. Hey, try to make yourself useful, Norm! Would it kill you to show some initiative? Show some initiative? You never asked me to do that before. Yeah, well, I'm out of your blast radius today, so surprise me, why don't you? Try not to be a complete disappointment. DOOFENSHMIRTZ! Present! Please enjoy your muffin! Sorry for the inconvenience, Perry the Platypus. I'm showing initiative. When I help Dr. D take over the Tri-State Area, he will be so proud of me! Maybe then he will take me out for a game of catch! But how to do it?

This is what I dreamed it would be like with Dr. D! Catch! Thank you, Perry. That was a deeply satisfying, emotional experience. And a well-timed one, coming only thirty seconds before you are destroyed along with the rest of Danville. A simple matter when you employ weapons and not one of those foolish inators.

"Mom, don't forget to water the plants. We'll be back before you know it. It's so exciting! I remember our trip to Africa. That was Arkansas. Oh, that's right. But you have fun in Africa. Ah, my university chummy, Ignatius, has been trying to get us to visit his animal research station for years now. I bet Perry's looking forward to meeting all the wild animals. Oh, there you are, Agent P. We've intercepted a text from Doofenshmirtz and we need you. I'm sorry, Agent P. You know we wouldn't do this if it weren't an emergency. I'm afraid you're going to have to miss your family vacation. Use Host Escape Diversion Technique B-17. Hey! You okay, boy? Oh, no, I think he's sick. Oh, he doesn't sound well enough to travel, hon. Maybe we should leave him at home. Sorry, kids, your Mom's right. The airline forbids transport of animals who are ill. Are you a pilot? No, I'm a dentist. I just like wearing these hats. The dentist is right, boys. Your mother is right. You know, if Perry can't go, then Ferb and I will stay home with him. Don't be silly, sweetie. You enjoy your trip. Grandpa and I will take good care of him. Flight 4311, now boarding. Well, okay. We're sure gonna miss you, little fella. Feel better soon. Eat all your food and get plenty of rest. We'll see you in no time. Hey. Hey, world traveler! Ready to go? No, Jeremy said he would see me off, but he's not here yet. Oh, I'm sure he's got a perfectly good reason. But he said he had something to tell me. Something important! Final call for Flight 4311! Final call for Flight 4311! I heard ya. Well! I still can't believe we got dinner reservations at Chez Afrique. The travel guide says it's the top romantic destination restaurant. Five-star service. Panoramic views. Well, I'm looking at the most amazing view right now. Oh, honey No, no, really. Look how many suitcases they have in that tiny truck. Ooh, that is amazing. Move over! But I got here first. Why should I sit in the middle seatâ There's your reason. You know, you cannot solve every problem with your muscles. Sometimes, you need brains. Yeah, like for dinner. Little bit of garlic, a little bit of butter Brains are delicious. Perry would have loved sitting on the tarmac for no reason. And he would have loved this visual gag, too. I couldn't help but notice your sash. I was a Fireside Girl myself. Enjoy your complimentary orange juice. Thanks. Gentlemen. Networking is everything. Did you know the African chapter of the Fireside Girls has its own special edition survival patches? ""Identifying fauna and flora."" Easy. ""Finding water."" Child's play. And ""Eating a grub""? Little bit of garlic, a little bit a butter Do not worry, Isabella. You do not have to have every patch. I don't have to have everyâ Ugh! Do you even hear the words coming out of your mouth? Jeremy and I are cool. Stacy's right. Uh, there's a good reason why he didn't show up. And he probably wants to tell me he wants us to start wearing matching sweaters or something cute like that. And he probably wants to tell me he wants us to start wearing matching sweaters or something cute like that. Yeah, yeah. It's him! Jeremy? Hello? Jeremy? You wanted to tell me somethinâ Oh, we got cut off. Miss, we're taking off. Please hang up your phone. But, I need to call my boyfriend back. He has something important to tell me. Not until we land, I'm afraid. How long is this flight? Eighteen hours. Ugh! Eighteen hours with no phone. Make sure he's nice and comfortable, Clyde. What do you say when a platypus sneezes? I'll go check my monotreme manners book. You have a book on monotreme manners? You don't know everything about me. Ah, Agent P. Turns out that the text we intercepted from Doofenshmirtz didn't actually warrant you missing your family vacation. My bad. In my defense, his text was written in all caps. But upon further investigation, it looks as though he just hit the caps lock by mistake. Anyway, he's up to something. Go check it out. Jambo, and welcome to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. No, dear. Our daughter's blond. Here she is! Eighteen hours with no texting. T-This one's ours. Welcome to Africa, Candace. We're sorry, your call cannot be completed. Cannot be completed? What is that? Do you have an international calling card? Oh, no, I don't. Give me yours. I do not have one. I got a card. Pick a card, any card. Don't magic me. This is serious. Who's magicin'? I'm just givin' away cards. May I have one? No. Hairy Larry. Hello, old friend. How are you? Hairy Larry? Well, you know how there are no photographs of me from 1976 to 1979? Yeah? Well There you are. Um, I'd like you to me my wife Linda, and our kids and their friends. Everyone, this is Ignatius UkareamÃ¼, my old college chum. Hey, Iggy. How are ya? Well, hello, young lady. I have heardâ So you got a phone at that research station of yours? Candace Ah Teenagers are teenagers anywhere in the world. Of course, they have a phone, Candace. Africa isn't as primitive as you think. Your father's right. Now, come on! The giraffe is waiting outside. I kid you.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, Perry the Platypus! Come in, get trapped, listen to my back-story. When I was a child, I grew flabby, which made me want to make the Fitness-Equipment-Lock-inator. Bum-bum-bum. I just run on this treadmill, and out comes a sonic beam that locks every other piece of fitness equipment in the Tri-State Area. Blah, blah, blah. Everyone's fat and tired. I sprint into City Hall and take over. No! Perry the Platypus! Don't do it. Don't push this self-destruct button. This one right here Oopsie daisies! Pushed it myself. Grr. Boo. Hiss. Grr. Boo. Hiss. Grr. Boo. Hiss. That's right. I'm a loser. All right, go on now, you won fair and square. Curse you, Perry the he's gone. Curse you, Perry the he's gone. I can't believe he fell for that Decoy -inator. Norm? Always a pleasure to see your sooty face, sir. Perry the Platypus is out of the picture. I'm Perry-free for the rest of the day. I'm sans-Perry. I am platypus-less. And now, because I still need to get it out of my system Behold! The Ultimate-Evil-inator! Isn't it ugly? You see, Norm, it occurred to me that fighting underlings like Perry the Platypus is a waste of time. Why not go straight to the top? Why not take out the big boss? Major Monogram? Why not choke off the wellspring from which all O.W.C.A. goodnessâ Major Monogram? Let me just say it, will you? Ugh, you know, Perry the Platypus never interrupts me like this. Just saying. from which all O.W.C.A. goodness flows Major Monogram. from which all O.W.C.A. goodness flows Major Monogram. There, see? See? You ruined it. You ruin everything. Just like I always say. Anyway, with this I'll blast Major Monogram, turning him evil! And then he'll You know, join me as my sidekick and give me access to the O.W.C.A.'s vast computer network. Thus assuring my Tri-State Area domination. Every afternoon at this time, Major Monogram goes up to the O.W.C.A.'s roof to sunbathe. Hey, Carl, does my uvula look unusually large to you? Meap. My neighbor's cat is totally shredding her drapes again. Too bad I can't see the O.W.C.A. from here. But it should be over by now. Pack up the inators, Norm. Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated has a new headquarters! Packing, sir! Remember, lift with your legs. Welcome to the research station. Thank you. Hey, Mr. UkareamÃ¼. What's over there? Oh, scrap metal, power tools, and spare parts left over from building the station. You had me at ""scrap"". You had me at ""scra-"". So when are we going on safari? We just need to refuel the truck, and we will be on our way. Uh, can you point me to the bathroom? Young man, there is a bush over there with your name on it. My name? Really? How did itâ Oh, you mean that figuratively. Phone! Phone! Phone! Phone! Do you have a phone? Well, I do have one, but the cell towers are down for maintenance. Ugh! Does that banana have international coverage? All right, everyone, load up! We are going on a safari! (Song: On the Savannah)  Nine happy campers on the savannah   Across the East African rift   Give the baboon a big banana   And don't cheat the cheetah, if you get my drift   Some sleep in the daylight   And then they hunt by night   Not a single traffic light   Not a fence in sight   And I'm feeling all right   On the savannah   Sailing through the seas of velvety pelt   There's a funky little hippo on the prowl   Put on your safety belt and block your nose   That's how we roll   I'm most struck by the waterbuck   You're compelled by the gazelle   Let's have a feast with the wildebeest   Better keep your eye on the sleeping lion   Gonna be polite, or they just might bite   Still we're feeling all right   On the savannah   On the savannah!  And this, everyone is the uncharted gorge. They call it Haijulikani Wadi. That's beautiful. What's it mean? Uncharted gorge. Wow, they really nailed that name. In order to get down there, you would need a highly unconventional vehicle. A highly unconventional vehicle? Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. All right, everyone, back on the truck. and that is why there are no kangaroos in Africa, Buford. Oh, man! Let's give Iggy a big hand for this marvelous tour. Yes! Woo hoo, that was great. Thank you. Great! You are quite welcome. You folks relax and enjoy the camp. I have to muck out Kalama's pen. It is not all glamor. Mr. UkareamÃ¼? Ferb and I were wondering if we could use some of your scrap metal to build a highly unconventional vehicle. Help yourselves, boys. Thanks. Such imagination. Well, dear, it looks like everybody's found themselves something to do, and uh, Chez Afrique dinner reservation's in an hour. I can't wait. I'm Chez Ah-freaking out! Oh, good one. Doofenshmirtz? What are you doing here? Did you finally come here to surrender? Yeah, right, Francis. Wanna give me a hand with these boxes? Iâ I will do no such thing. Feels good, doesn't it? Being evil, huh? What are you talking about? I'm good. Good and evil, wink-wink. Why are you winking? And you know you don't have to say ""wink"" when you wink. Oh, come on, Francis, you've been zapped by my Ultimate-Evil-inator, right? I mean, if it didn't hit you, then who did it hit? Looks like I got two for one. I'm going to take over the Tri-State Area. And with my administrators access to O.W.C.A.'s supercomputer, and my intimate knowledge of proper photocopying techniques, I'm just the unpaid stooge to do it. Oh, you know what? I think maybe it hit him. Ya think? Yeah. But whose skull is he caressing? Wow, that was fun. Thank you for teaching me the Adumu. And thank you for teaching us the Izzy's Got the Frizzies. My pleasure, Sankei. Well, I should get back to the research center. Goodbye and good luck with that whole grub thing. Thanks. Eat grubs. Yuck, right? I don't remember having to do that when I was a Fireside Girl. What'cha doin? Figuring out which animal attributes to give to our highly unconventional vehicle. Sounds cool. What'd ya have in mind?  We need a cheetah's muscle so we can hustle  (Song: Highly Unconventional Vehicle)  And a couple big gorilla hands  For climbing!  Hope your seat belt's fastened, 'cause the motor's been fashioned   After baboon adrenal glands   We got a rhino's horn in case we run into trouble   A big giraffe neck so our reach can double   The tail was gonna be a snake, I'm glad we used pencil   'Cause a monkey's tail will give us something more prehensile   It's a highly unconventional vehicle   It doesn't have wheels or a carburetor   It doesn't have a windshield, it doesn't have wings   It doesn't have a heater, but we're at the equator   So I guess that's not so apropos   'Cause it wouldn't need a heater even if it wasn't such a   Highly unconventional vehicle   It's a highly unconventional vehicle   It's a highly unconventional vehicle!  Yeah! Oh, Perry, it's a shame you couldn't go to Arkansas with the boys. Lucky for you, you don't know what you're missing. But my intelligence specifically said that you would be sunbathing, it never mentioned an intern. That's because he's not officially an employee. He's unpaid. You don't pay him? He gets college credit. Are you sure you're not evil? Carl! You can't keep us cooped up in here. Though the self-serve smoothie machine is a welcome diversion. I'm evil, not uncivilized. Did you try the Madagascar chocolate? Hmm, you can really taste the Madagascar. Carl, you're a solid B+ student with a promising future. What could you possibly have to gain from all of these? What could I have to gain? Let me tell you, old man. (Song: Evil for Extra Credit)  I used to put up with too much aggravation   But take a look at me now, I got a new vocation   You heard it here first 'cause I'm the one who said it   Yeah, I'm evil  He's evil!  I'm evil for extra credit!   If you're looking for trouble, well, I think you've found it   I park wherever I want, I dare you to impound it   If I'm losing a video game   I just reset it 'cause I'm evil  He's evil!  I'm evil for extra credit, yeah  That's right! I'm evil for extra credit! Tell 'em all about it, girls!  (He'll do anything for good grades)  You know I will!  (He's an evil jack of all trades)  I do it all!  (You want badness then he's got it in spades)  I got a full deck, ladies.  (Looks so good in leather and shades)   You heard it here first, 'cause I'm the one who said it   'Cause I'm evil  He's evil!  I'm evil for extra credit   I'm evil for extra credit!  Heh. You may have some cleverly concealed singing chops, but to me, you'll always be an unpaid intern. Drink your smoothie, mustache man. And you! Go unload my inators. Actually, um I think those inators kinda belong to Quiet, intern! Uh Paid intern? No, that's not how we do things around here. Hmm That gives me an idea. And this time, a good idea. Not like the one I had about theâ Wow, this restaurant is really out of the way. I bet you can see the entire savannah from up there. And tonight our chef is making his signature dish, which The Culinary League of France calls ""Wildebeest Under Glass"". Ooh! Telephone? Telephone? Telephone? I'll never know what Jeremy wants to tell me. This whole continent hates me. That lion, those two circus clowns in the ultra-light, the mysterious object under this tarp. Telephone! Big, weird, wind-up telephone. ""For best reception, place unit in high location with unobstructed views."" Aw, man! You know, I built a Move-A-Bunch-Of-Inators-inator at one point. This would have been really good time to use it. I don't know how that slipped my minâ Enough of you mindless prattle, minion! Show me my inators! Okay, okay, sheesh! Testy. First up is the Disintegrator-inator whichâ Weak. Okay. Uh, then we also have the Galaxy-inator, whichâ Weak. The Derezz-inator? Weak. The Overhang-inatâ Weak. The Upper-deckerâ Weak. The Pickle-Slicerâ Weak. The Stand-Andâ Weak. The Boarâ Weak. Theâ Weak. Thâ Weak. Weak. Oh, come on! I was just inhaling. Agent P! Something terrible has happened. Listen carefully. These straws are about to collapse like a flimsyâ Oh I was going to say ""noodle."" Yes, Danville, U.S.A. D-A-N-Vâ Yeah, D, like in Dantible Varumbie. I-I'll only be a minute. Biometric scan accepted. Security system disabled. Agent P! Over here! Oh, good, you got my message. There's no time to lose. We have toâ Very nice, very nice! Carl, you slow-clapping fiend! I needed Agent P out of the way, so I left you those drinking straws. You realize you could have just called him yourself, you do work here. I'm over my minutes. But, now, with the boundless power of the mighty O.W.C.A. computer, I will bring the Tri-State Area to its knees! I will stop the power stations, de-synchronize all the traffic lights, and yeah! I'll have a vast army of interns do all my bidding, each one of them paid! You're mad! Hey, cool it, man. I think I'm getting a raise. Ooh-ooh! Ooh! Y-You should give the operation a name, like ""Operation: Shared Evil"". Out! Okay, fine. Hmm. How 'bout, ""Operation: Big Old Grouch""? I heard that! I hope so, because I said it. You fool! What have you done? You may have escaped, but you're no match for my evil Flynn-Fletcher robots! This is really weird. Iâ I think I may have gone on a date with that one. I-I had no idea she was a robot at the time. Bravo! He's totally better than Irving. Thanks, Buford. Now the fanfare's over, what say we go down into Haijulikani Wadi? Where should we start? Well, first we'll fly down like a graceful condor landing on that rock outcropping. Then, we'll jump over those vines and brachiate like a monkey with our ape-like arms. Finally, landing on the slope with our cheetah-like grace. Of course, any other path down would mean instant death. That totally sounds doable. Jeremy? Jeremy? Hello? Candace? It's Jeremy. Get that monotreme! Paw print identified. Password accepted. Computer locked. No! He's locked me out of the mainframe! If he gets away, I'll never be able to take over. Wow, this is really exciting! Don't just stand around, you fool! Get him! The inators! You said you had something important to tell me. What is it? Candace what I think I though we should break up. Candace what I think I though we should break up. Candace what I think I though we should break up. Candace what I think I though we should break up. Candace what I think I though we should break up. Candace what I think I though we should break up. What?! Jeremy?! You're breaking up with me?! All right, everyone. Buford, Baljeet, you guys have the legs. Now you'll see how brains are used toâ Move over, nerd! This is a job for brash, unthinking muscle. Ops. Wait. Wait, no, not all the inators at once. Yeah, what did you say? You fool! What did you do? Agent P! Flynn-Fletcher, I am sorry. You have no reservation.  I used to put up with too much aggravation   But take a look at me now, I got a new vocation   You heard it here first 'cause I'm the one who said it   Yeah, I'm evil  He's evil!  I'm evil for extra credit!"
"Well, it took three hours for them to untangle my hair from the gears, but I never lost my grip on that lava lamp. Well, that explains the humming. Yes, but fat lot of good it did me. I mean here we are, thirty years later and they've lost our reservation. Oh, here it is. You were listed under ""Fletcher-Flynn"". My apologies. Ah, here we are. See? It all worked out. You fool! Without Agent P's paw print, I can't unlock the computer. And without the computer, I can't take over the Tri-State Area. Nice recap. Quiet back there! You! Which inator zapped him? You know, uh I really am clueless. About the inator or just in general? I'm not sure I understand the question. Bah! I'll have to untangle this mess myself. The heat signature is wrong on the Disintegrat-inator. The angle is too obtuse for the Derezz-inator. The Julienn-inator isn't plugged in. And the Overhang-inator is just plain dumb. Well, sure, until you wanna hang under something. Then what are you gonna do, smart guy? Continuing. The Smells-Like-Hay-inator No. The Universe-inator just hit this trash can. Nothing left but this smudge. That means it can only be The Smudge-inator! Did you make a Smudge-inator? Eh continuing. Eh continuing. The only inator we haven't ruled out, that we actually have, is the Go-Home-inator. Meaning Perry the Platypus is home! Evil Flynn-Fletcher robots, let's drop by the Flynn-Fletcher house. You can't do this, Carl! You work for the O.W.C.A.! Not anymore, Mono-grampa. Mono-grampa. Iâ Ah, that's good. Iâ Why didn't I think of that? You really think you'll be part of all of this? He's playing you like a penny whistle in a really bad jazz band. No. No, I-I'm part of the team! I am! Well, then, why did he leave you behind? He broke up with me! Of course he broke up with me. I mean, look at me. I'm a bundle of unbridled neuroses! I'm in Africa, surrounded by natural wonders, and all I can think about is finding a cell phone. I'd break up with me, too! Even the tree broke up with me! Are you okay, Mr. Pockets? Jeremy's right. I shouldn't be his girlfriend. I don't belong in society. I don't deserve to be a part of civilization! Candace is out! Peace! I'm going native! Phineas, do something! Phineas, help us! Phineas, please help us! What's wrong with him? I feel like we've been hanging here for weeks. I mean, I got the brawn for it, but it's not like I don't have other stuff to do. The weight of your freakish muscles will only pull you down faster. And why does he just stare off into space like that? Phineas, help us! Phineas, help us! Hey, dinner bell! Help us! Phineas! Phineas! I am slipping! We have to get down there. What? Up, good. Down, bad! Hold on, everyone! Guys, grab on. Baljeet! Buford! Radius times the angle of rotation, taking into account wind velocity and humidity! Brains! Come on, you guys. Perry needs our help! What? Perry? Uh, hello? We left him back home?! Agent P, where are you?! Jeremy. Human boyfriend. Hey, it's me. So, I was trying to tell you before He's not here! Where is he?! How could he be in Africa? Maybe it was a different platypus. Yeah! Afristralia's probably full of 'em! Look, I know it doesn't make any sense, but he was right here! I saw him! He's alone and he needs our help. And I'm gonna find him. I don't get it. How were you able to hold me up? I tied your vine to my own. But how did you fall in slow motion? Eh, it's a brawn thing. Oh, here we go again! Why, hello, Agent P. Just wanted to catch up a bit. We never get any time to talk! In fact, we should totally get together in person. Considering that you're in such a lovely region with one-of-a-kind flowers Let's see. Red petals, three golden pistils Dendrobium uncharticum. Presumed to exist only in uncharted regions in Africa? Presumed to exist only in uncharted regions in Africa? I was sure he was struck with the Go Home-inator. We didn't even have a Go to Africa-inator. No matter. Soon his tiny hand print will be mine, and then the O.W.C.A. will be mine, and then the Tri-State Area will be mine! And then I'm totally getting extra credit. I don't know how I didn't see it before. He wasâ He was using me! Dr. Doofenshmirtz I trusted him and he just cast me aside, like aâ L-Like an old newspaper. H-He didn't even wrap fish in me! Oh, for Pete's sake, Heinz! Evil Carl must be stopped. We have to work together. Not that being tied around a fish is what I imagined for myâ Wait, w-what do you mean ""we""? We have to work together to save Agent P. Oh, no way, JosÃ©! With Perry the Platypus out of the way, I can finally take over the Tri-State Area! Not if Carl takes it over first. Let it sink in. Two Three Two Three Atta boy! Now, come on over here and let me out. We have to follow him. But how? He took your jet! Oh, did he? Carl always changes my radio station when we fly together, so I had this jet build just for me. That's, uh, partly why our budget is so tight now. We can track him through the on-board G.P.S. Now, come on! Let's go. We've got a world to save. Wait a minute, wait a minute. How did you get the sunglasses to go on one side of your face? Who made these, M.C. Escher? He was a family friend. Now get on the plane. We've got a Tri-State Area to save. (Song: Livin' with Monkeys)  Tired of all the games   People play with your emotions   Tired of all the pressures of society   Tired of always feeling like I'm going through the motions   Fed up with all the fretting and anxiety   So I'm leaving it all behind   The house, the car, running water, electricity   Yes, I'm leaving it all behind   No more heartache, pain, and sorrow   No more stressing about tomorrow   'Cause here is my new life   I'm feeling free   And I'm living with monkeys  And admittedly, that's a little strange.  Yeah, I'm living with monkeys   ('Cause I'm living with monkeys)   They accepted me as one of their own   At least that's what I'm assuming   (Yeah, I'm living with monkeys!)   It's not really all that bad   Once you get used to all the grooming   Cause I'm living with monkeys!  Platypuses always head west when they're lost. At least I think they do. And I think this is west. I think. Uh, Phineas? We've been thinking, too, and isn't it time we, you know, find our way back? And stop looking for Perry? Are you kidding? He's our pet! He's more than our pet, he's our friend! And I know he's out there. We are in Africa. Yeah. Pretty much sums it up. Well, has he been wrong before? How wide are we willing to open this up? Wait. Look! Perry's footprints! Come on, gang! Perry's alone and helpless in a strange jungle. We've gotta find him before anything else does. You know, that could be just a duck. Dendrobium uncharticum. Yep, we're in the right place. Fan out and find that platypus. We should be in Africa soon. But I'm running way low on materials. I-I'm gonna have to get a bit creative. Aren't we going to need that? Uh, nah. Just out of curiosity, does this thing have a lifeboat? Uh, we're in a plane. I knew that. I think we're getting close. I can feel it. Our worries are almost over. Candy corn. Candace. Candar. Candace. Love. Jeremy. Candace. Love. Jeremy. Candace. Love. Jeremy. Brains. Brawn. Brains. Brawn! Oh, no. Oh, no! I lost his tracks. I-I don't know which direction to go. Wait! Grubs! Platypuses love grubs! They sure do, like Ferb and haggis. Maybe he came this way for food. Ugh, how am I ever gonna get that grub-eating patch. Perry's fur! He went that-a-way. Let's go! Were we on ""brains"" or ""brawn""? Brains. No, brawn! Brains. That thing's not gonna do us any good if we don't survive the flight. I'm building a Re-Good-inator, solely from parts from this plane. Do you know how many evil scientists could actually accomplish this? I'll be impressed when we don't plummet to Earth on fire. Oh, stop panicking, Francis. I haven't even touched the main stabilizers. You know, yet. Perry must have crossed here. Perry must have crossed here. Maybe there is another way over. Looks pretty rickety. Perry! Hey! Oh! My gosh, you were right. Hey! Hey, it's this way. There he is! Come on, let's go! Perry must be scared. We're coming for you, buddy! Too easy. Sorry about your friends, Agent P. I'm evil, what can I say? Oh, the new robots. Yeah, I had some free time. And now you're gonna give me a hand. Literally. New recruits, huh? I see you want to do this the hard way. Charge! We've gotta get back to Perry somehow! I think we have a problem here. No kidding. Ladies and gentlemen, brains. Give it up, Agent P! This would be quite fun if it wasn't that terrifying! Everybody, get behind me! Hang on. Lucky for us, this quicksand broke our fall. You modified the horn? That's what I needed the stabilizer for. We live! See? See, one day you're gonna look back on this and laugh. I assure you, for the rest of my life, every time I look back on this, I will personally drive over to your house and smack you. Is that thing ready? I-I still need a few parts. No problem. We're surrounded by parts. You know, if you can manage it, I need a ball-joint compressor. Catch! Thanks! Put 'em up, handsome. I know what I am going to destroy today. You're busted. You saved me. Why did you sacrifice yourself? No Jeremy robot for me. Jeremy? Jeremy. Hey, it's me. So I was trying to tell you before, but we kept breaking up. Sorry, I missed you at the airport. I got caught up with my band, but I can't wait for you to hear the song we recorded. I wrote it just for you. Call me when you can. I miss you. Wait. Jeremy didn't break up with me? Call him. Jeremy? Thank you. Jeremy! Oh, it's so good to talk to you. No, I'm so sorry about that. I was just on the top of a tree, and I didn't have any service. And then Iâ Isabella, anything in the Fireside Manual about escaping from quicksand? I'll bring it up at the next meeting. Hey, guys! I landed up here. Should I come down? No! Throw down that vine. No! Just one end. Okay! But I don't know what you're gonna do with half a vine. Is it me? It is him, right? Buford, pull. On the vine. Oops, sorry. It's him. Here we go. Oh, man. I have never been pantsed by a continent before. Don't feel bad! When we got out of here, I was gonna do that to you anyway. Hurry up, Heinz. Okay, I-I just need one more thing. A-A small piece of tape. Tape? Yeah, you know, anyâ Any kind of adhesive, anything. A sticker, adhesive bandage, uh Oh. This will do. That's it, the Re-Good-inator, it's finished. Wait, wait, hold on. Behold, the Re-Goodâ Heinz, just shoot Carl with it! Yeah, see, that's the problem. It's mounted to the deck, and I can't swivel it. A bit of an oversight, I guess. What? Where's it pointed? Uh, right at that X-shaped rock. Wow, that's serendipitous. Great googly-moogly! Heinz, hold down the fort. Wait, we have a fort? What am I doing out here? Agent P, I need you to get evil Carl in front of that ""X"". And yes, I wear a leotard under my Nehru jacket. Quickly, we'll only get one shot. Finish them. Finish them! I will have that paw print! Those digits are mine! You're running out of room, Agent P. Now, let's get this over with. Awaiting paw print. Prehensile tail won't save you now. He's coming into range! Pull, Agent P. Pull! Oops. He backed out of range! All is lost. He wants me to take the shot. What's the point? He's out of range. I'm gonna take it. Game over, man! What? Boo-yah! Yeah, what a marksman! Well, it only points at one place. You can't give me anything, can you? What happened? Carl! How are you feeling, kid? I feel good! I feel good! Oh, I'm glad. Now, clean up this mess you've made. Yes, sir. Oh, and Carl? Yes, Major? Uh, recent events have brought it to my attention that you're a great help to me. And, uh Not quite sure what I'd do without you, in fact. Really? Yes, and And as of this moment, I am officially promoting you to the title of ""Paid Intern"". Th-Thank you, sir. You understand we won't actually be paying you. It's just a title. Of course, sir. Whoo-hoo! Good work, Agent P. You'll come back on the jet with us. Obviously, we can't have youâ Perry! Perry! Go on. You've earned it. Come on, we've got to get out of here. We'll just use the jet's big magnet to pick up all this stuff. Wait, wait, you guys are gonna give me a ride back, aren't you? Sure, Heinz. After all, home is where the prisons are. You're kidding, right? Do you want a ride or not? Not if you're not kidding. We're almost there! There you are, Perry! He's here, guys. He's really here! Hey, guys. Hi, Candace. Nice outfit. Looks like you really embraced Africa. Now we just have to find our way out of the gorge. Chill, guys. I got this. Don't worry, it's just our ride. Great idea, Candace. You're a natural. I know, right? Sir, there's something I still don't get. I'm absolutely positive Agent P got hit with the Go Home-inator. So why did he end up in Africa of all places? His family. Sir? Well, they're here in Africa. Home is where the heart is, Carl. True, sir. Don't touch anything! I didn't! Look at that. Oh, I got to say, Africa is unbelievable. So, wait, how was the restaurant? Eh, not my thing. Nothing to write home about. I guess it takes brawn and brains together to survive in the wild. Whatever, give me your food. All right. Hey, Iggy, these s'mores are great. Yeah. They have my secret ingredient. Grubs. Really? Thank you, Africa! Hey, can I get one of those for Perry? I admit, I have never really studied the platypus, but I am absolutely shocked that this one somehow followed you all the way to Africa. It seems impossible. It seems impossible. Well, ever since George Shaw wrote the first description of the platypus for highly skeptical European scientists in 1798, this unique creature has become synonymous with the word ""impossible"". You know, Ferb's right. Yeah. Really? You're all satisfied with that answer? All right, well, we're turning in. Yeah, me too. 'Night. Seriously? A platypus crosses the Atlantic Ocean, finds you on the vast continent of Africa and no one feels this is worthy of a longer discussion? It's been a long day, Candace. Go to sleep. Yeah, it'll probably all make sense in the morning. Really? That's it? Nobody's with me here?  The house, the car, running water, electricity   Yes, I'm leaving it all behind   No more heartache, pain, and sorrow   No more stressing about tomorrow   'Cause here is my new life   I'm feeling free   And I'm living with monkeys  And admittedly, that's a little strange."
"Okay, give it a chance. We want your honest opinion. We know it's a little weird. Help, help! Is there a doctor in the house? I am a doctor. And yes, I am single. What seems to be the problem here? I think I sprained my ankle. And you want me to take a look at it? No, I want your brain. Brains! Brains! Brains. Shape-shifting alien zombies. Fair enough, but I must tell you that I am kind of using my brain right now. Oh, yeah. And I'm also a ninja. See? Dr. Ninja Baljeet! In color!

"Oopsy-daisy. So, then Jeremy saidâ Ugh! Stacy? Phineas and Ferb, that was important! You guys are so gonna get it!! Mom! Elsewhere, in space.

Candace, do you remember two weeks ago, when we wrote up this contract? The Bust Accord? And do you recall article twelve? Yes. ""I will not attempt to bust my brothers more than once a day."" I remember. Butâ And what happened earlier today? I tried to show you a giant ant farm. Excellent, we have an understanding. Now go to bed. You can try again tomorrow. Fine! I'll just wait till tomorrow. Wait a minute. At midnight, it'll be tomorrow. I can just stay up and bust them. This sleepover is a good idea. How are we all supposed to see through that puny telescope? The telescope is just to find the probe we launched seventeen months ago. Then we can tap into the signal from deep space. And using Dad's old projection screen and some fiber optics to relay the images from the probe, we can view the galaxy in comfort from these lawn chairs. Space probe? Fiber optics? Ooh, I can smell a bust comin' tonight. These joysticks should control the space probe remotely. Come on, already! Let's start lookin' for stuff. Buford, I've never seen you so enthusiastic. I have my reasons. Oh, here we go again. He's going to tell the story of when he was abducted by aliens. It wasn't an abduction, it was an encounter. Encounter? Yeah, I was walkin' out in the woods one night with my lucky tambourine. (Song: Whalemingo)  Float by   Drift through my dreams!   Whalemingo!   (Whalemingo!)   In the sky   Like strawberry cream!   Whalemingo!   (Whalemingo!)   You take a whale   You drop the fla   You keep the mingo, that's how I named it whalemingo!   (Whalemingo!)   If you see a big, pink whale   With feathers and a beak and skinny little legs, then bingo   That's a whalemingo!   (Whalemingo!)   (Whalemingo!)   (Whalemingo!)  I think about you often, whalemingo.  (Whalemingo!)   (Whalemingo!)   (Whalemingo!)  And that's my story! I didn't know you had a lucky tambourine. This whole story is ridiculous. No, it's not! I have proof. Ugh, here comes the picture. See? I named him Tristan. That is just a flamingo. Tristan is not a flamingo, he's from outer space, and he's a whalemingo. But then he had to go home, and I never saw him again. Hey, what are you doin' with your hands? Mocking you. All right. I'd be angry, but I admire your honesty. There you are, Agent P. Sorry to call you in for a second time today but Oh, this? It'sâ It's just an exfoliating mask. I have another ten minutes before I can peel it off, or I get zero of the benefits. Agent P, we just got word that Doof may have fired tomorrow's inator, today. This is a major breach in protocol. So, give yourself a good slap in the face, and get over there.  Perry!  Okay, gang, let's fire this thing up. Zoom in on the swirly thing. My gut tells me, that's where the whalemingos are. Roger that. Hey, it's our milkshake bar! And business seems to be booming. What about over to the left? Okay. Wow. Yeah, wow. It's a whole planet of whalemingos. I do not believe it. Buford was right. They're all so beautiful. Tristan. (Song: Double Dutch)  Volgen nu!   One dutch, two dutch   Queens of the double dutch   We skip better than you by that much   Watch our feet, our moves are sweet   Our double dutchin' won't be beat  Perry the Platypus? How did you get stuck in my double dutch machine? That's not even a trap. Anyway, what are you doing here? Oh, that. T-The beam that I shot through my roof? Well, that was just an accidental misfire from my Sphere-attract-inator. Luckily it was pointed up, so it didn't hit anything. Anyway, I started thinking and realized the true measure of a man is having a world famous roadside attraction. But which one to choose? Which one would be the most spectacular? Then it hit me, nothing brings them in like a big ball of twine. So that's why I built the Sphere-Attract-inator. To steal the world's largest ball of twine! Then all I need is some sort of road to put it beside. Right? I gotta admit Buford, I had my doubts, but whalemingos are truly amazing. Told ya. Hey! Why's everything all fuzzy? I'm not sure. Let me back it up and we'll take a look. It looks like the planet's growing. Planets do that, right? It is not growing, it is getting closer! This sounds serious. Ah! This is catastrophic! Should we not do something? Should no one inform the populous of the impending impact? Calm down, Baljeet. I'm sure the government scientists are already doing something. Duck and cover! My watermelon! Based on my calculations, the planet will be here by midnight! That's great news! Our planets are going to collide! You do know what that means? Sure, it's like when you have two sets of keys. And you keep one in the car. No, it means NO! It means all life is going to be wiped out on both planets! Guys, we've gotta save Tristan! Anything else, Buford? And the Earth. Oh, Perry the Platypus, what do you say we open up the roof and activate the Sphere-Attract-inator? Then I can get a good night's rest before all the crowds arrive to see the world's biggest ball ofâ  Nu!

We could use electro magnets, if only we knew the planet's molecular density. I got a pail of water and a nest to make Tristan comfortable. I figure I can keep him in my garage 'till spring. Spring. Spring! That's it. Guys, I know what we're gonna do tonight!  One dutch, two dutch   Queens of the double dutch  Oh, you sassy.  We skiâ  I knew they'd practically bust themselves, by just waited long enough. You guys are so busted, in like nine minutes. You guys are so busted, in like nine minutes. Oh, hey Candace, glad you're still up. You'll get to see the cool planet coming directly at us. But don't worry, we're building a giant spring to bounce it back into space where it came from. A spring? That's not very scientific. But it is still bustable. Here comes the planet now. I can't wait 'till they get here. Tristan! Finally! It's tomorrow! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! What are you guys doing? Oh, hi, honey. We were just listening to some records. It's what we used to use for music when we were kids. Candace, I thought we had an understanding. Yeah, it's midnight. Tomorrow. Don't worry, it'll be all right. The world's largest ball of twine is on its way! Y-You'd better stand back, i-it's supposed to be huge! It's supposedâ What? That's it? Goodbye, Tristan! Remember me! I got a twine ball bigger than this in my junk drawer. Help me, Perry the Platypus! I'm slipping! Oh, thank you, Perry the Plaâ  Nu!  I mean, curse you, Perry the Platypus!!!  One dutch, two dutch   Queens of the double dutch   We skip better than you byâ  Hurry, let's go! Let's go! Clearly we need a thirteenth amendment to The Bust Accord. Mom?! You kids okay out here? Yeah, we're great! We saw a giant planet filled with whalemingos! Whalemingos, huh? Why don't you all come on in for midnight snack? Wash your hands. Especially you, Buford. Hey, sleepyhead, do you want a snack too?"
"So then the seamstress walks back into the stateroom and says "" 'Titanium'? I thought she said 'cranium'!"" Yeah. Pretty good punch line, huh? Yes. All you need is the first part, and then you will have a whole joke. Hey, look, everyone! Ferb and Perry are back. Hey, Ferb! What'cha doin' back from debate camp so soon? We finished earlier than expected. You're right. Judges, he's right. He's changed my entire world-view. Thank you. It's so beautiful. That kid is in it to win it, dawg. You're just in time for acorn nut muffins made out of the training nuts from yesterday! Training nuts? Okay, what did I miss? It all started simply enough. I'd gotten up early to help Isabella earn her Surf patch. Thanks for helping me earn my Surf patch! And I told her it was no problem. No problem. It was at that point that I decided to stop narrating. My schedule's wide open. Here. Take a look at this. I figured I'd make a few prototypes and once you pick your favorite, we'll design your board to look just like it. Aw, they're so cute and tiny, a squirrel could surf on them. Now, if we only had a box of squirrels. We found a box of squirrels! Yeah, right next to a box of scorpions, which is what I wanted to bring over. Buford, I won Rochambeau fair and square. What's Rochambeau? Rock-paper-scissors! Why didn't he just say that? In what universe would a piece of paper ever beat a rock? Hey, let's see the little guys. Okay, but do not expect too much from them. What's wrong with them? They appear to have been domesticated. They have no squirrel skills. Check it out. Here, little squirrellies. Here is a nut. It's a nut, you eat it. I see what you mean. No squirrel skills. Ferb, Iâ Oh, that's right, he went to debate camp today. Oh, oh! I will be Ferb! I have been practicing! That's pretty good, Baljeet. Wow! It's as if he's right in front of us. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Say ""where's Perry?"" now. I've been practicing. Okay. Where's Perry? I don't know. What are you asking me for? And so, that's how the day began. Hey, where's Perry now? Welcome back, Agent P. We hope you had a pleasant day off. Anyways, there's a crisis brewing in Danville, and it could destroy the very fabric of our existence. There's never been a greater threat. Peaches! Oh, you probably want me to explain theâ There's been a shortage of peaches in Danville lately, and we've traced it to Doofenshmirtz. Go find out what he's up to, and good luck. Go find out what he's up to, and good luck. Wow. Guess he's in a hurry. It was about that time that Candace came up to us and said Phineas and Ferb, I demand to know what it is that you've got planned today! Yeah, that. Exactly like yesterday! Except for the Ferb part. Yeah, yeah, thanks. What are you guys doing? We're talking about what we did yesterday. So, it's like, a confession? Sure. Oh, it's perfect. I'll go get Mom and she can hear everything. Good idea, Canâ Now, don't say another word until we get back. And that goes for you, too. That was ironic, because Ferb doesn't usually talk. Duh! Hello, Perry the Platypus! I take it for granted sometimes what a professional you are, especially after dealing with that guy they sent instead of you yesterday. So, how was debate camp? You're right. Judges, he's right. He's changed my entire world-view. And I thought that British kid was persuasive. You know, if you were flashing back just now, I couldn't see it. I'll bet you're wondering what I'm doing here at the beach at the clam bake with an oven. I'll bet you're wondering what I'm doing here at the beach at the clam bake with an oven. I'll bet you're wondering what I'm doing here at the beach at the clam bake with an oven. And normally, I'd be all about telling you, and it's a really cool plan, too! It involves my latest invention, the Peach Cobbler-inator. But I'm getting way ahead of myself. I have to tell you about yesterday for any of this to make any sense! It all started with an establishing shot at my building.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Yesterday  Huh. Perry the Platypus should be arriving right about now! Perry the Platypus should be arriving right about now! How completely unexpected! And by that I mean, i-it really was actually unexpected. Well, you have a hat, so you must be an agent. I guess that means Perry the Platypus is not coming, so A-ha! Consider yourself trapped. Allow me to explain my diabolical plan. You see, my brother, Roger, the Mayor, is hosting a beauty contest that willâ Hey! For Pete's sake, I'm pontificating here! Sheesh! Okay. Okay, long evil plan short, I wanted to ruin Roger's day. You see, he's officiating at an Everyone's A Winner beauty pageant. Ugh! That's so him. Uh, my scheme involved domesticated squirrels, paper doilies, and those containers that pantyhose used to come in. You know, about this big? But, I couldn't figure out a way to make them all work together because I was distracted by a leaky faucet in the kitchen! Turns out that that was actually the perfect idea. So I ditched the squirrels You know, this isn't really making my evil plan short like I promised. Sorry. Anyway, behold! The A-Leaky-Faucet-inator. I will disgrace and humiliate Roger by dropping one big drop of water andâ Hey, where'd you go? Oh, no! You're getting coffee grounds everywhere! Ugh, this is so much smoother with Perry the Platypus. I'm just saying. Right out here, Mom! Hi, kids! All right, what's this all about? We're telling Ferb the story of what we did yesterday. Oh, I love stories! Oh! Oh, it's not just stories, but full disclosure! Okay. Go ahead. Well, we finally got to the musical part of the story. We all decided it was high time to teach the squirrels how to be squirrels. (Song: Be a Squirrel)  So you've been domesticated   Lost your identity  Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!  Just listen up and you can learn to be the best that you can be   Gather nuts and scurry   And dodge a car or three   If you concentrate you'll graduate and learn to climb a tree   But for now we'll show you how to make every chestnut count   We'll make you sweat, you won't regret   Remember, put them in your mouth   Be a squirrel   (Come along, be a rodent trainee)   Be a squirrel   (And you will finally be free)   Be a squirrel!   (Be at the top of your family tree)   Be a squirrel!   (Be a squirrel, it's your destiny)  Buford, you taught the squirrels to dance? I'm like an onion. Because you have layers? Yeah, that, too. Anyway, after I cleaned up the coffee grounds, I loaded the A-Leaky-Faucet-inator and Agent R, I guess onto my rocket skiff and headed off to Roger's beauty contest. We arrived just in time for the swimsuit competition. Oh, very nice. Twelve meters! We have a new record. There he is, the big show-off. With his big smile and his keys in his pocket and his lumberjack-likeâ Hey! Hey, no. Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here. Goâ Go find another symbiotic relationship! Anyway, now that we'veâ Hey! Hey, what do youâ This actually feels great. Oh, I see why you like it. A-Anyway, and I'm going to power up the inator now. Here we go. Powering up. Yup. You know, uh This is the time where you escape and try to destroy my inator. Oh, for Pete's sake, Iâ There! Now, attack! Start thwarting! Noâ No, no, no, no, don't just walk awaâ I miss Perry the Platypus. Whoa! Wait, wait, wait. Watch out there! And why isn't the water coming off?! It's beautiful! Good job, cadets! Now, back down the tree. No, not like that! Head first! Sheesh! It's like I'm talking to myself here. Let's go, Mom. You got to see this. Wow, look at 'em go! They're doing a pyramid! I didn't even teach them that. Good luck, little guys. I'll think of you whenever I get a rabies shot! Which is often. Thank you, Katie Bogosian, for the whistling belly button performance. You probably should see a doctor. But that concludes our talent competition, unless there are any last-minute drop-ins? It's so beautiful. That pharmacist is in it to win it, dawg! See, I'm actually talking to a dog. That's right. Talkin' to a dawg. And I was crowned King Pretty Pretty Princess. Which, now that I think of it, is a contradiction in terms, but it was the first time I ever won anything. So it's gotten me all obsessed about entering contests. But the only thing I'm good at is baking peach cobbler, so Iâ I invented Oh, yeah. I told you, ""Behold the Peach-Cobbler-inator"" . What it does is it makes everyone want peach cobbler more than anything else in the world. So whether it's a chili cook-off or a dancing competition or a quilting bee, or whatever, th-the judges will be compelled to choose peach cobbler as the winner every time. Plus, it's waterproof, it's shockproof, it's windproof, it'sâ Huh. But it isn't sandproof. Fancy that. I suppose, since I planned to take it to the beach, maybe I should have considered Curse you, Perry the Platypus! And my own poor planning skills! Oh, no! M-My cobbler! Oh! How can this day get any worse? Ow! Does that mean this thing's been flying around since yesterday? So, there you have it! Are you gonna bust them, or what? Wait. Okay, go ahead. Actually, I just love that you kids trained poor, abandoned little squirrels and helped them get back to the wild. I am so proud of you! No, you can't! I want justice! I want peach cobbler. I want peach cobbler. Well, lucky for you, I made peach cobbler. Peach cobbler. I heard you the first time, honey.  Been domesticated   Lost your identity  Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!  Just listen up and you can learn to be the best that you can be   Gather nuts and scurry   And dodge a car or three   If you concentrate you'll graduate and learn to climb a tree   Be a squirrel   (Come along, be a rodent trainee)   Be a squirrel!

"Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! A quilt?! No way! I mean, I know it's been a long summer and you guys are running out of ideas andâ That's okay. Buford. You don't have to hang with us everyday. No, no! I mean, I mean I don't wanna play alone. I'll turn into a cat-kid. What's a cat-kid? It's a kid version of a cat lady. Quick! Somebody say, ""where's Perry?"". Where's Perry? You're always there for me.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, it's you. Yeah, sorry, no time for trap. It's nothing personal, you see, today is the annual L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Summer Stock Festival and I got the title role, so I have to take over the Tri-State Area by 3:30 if I wanna make curtain! Uh, that doesn't leave me much time for, you know, the trapping and the fighting. So instead I built this! The Trip-To-The-Desert-inator! It's going to send you to the desert, and I can get on with my day. Don't bother running, 'cause I've installed a Perry-Track-inator. It's going to follow you no matter where youâ Oh, great! Now I'm in the middle of nowhere! Now I'll never be able to take over the Tri-State Area before. the play. Now I'll never be able to take over the Tri-State Area before. the play. Wait, wait, d-don't leave me here! Uh Perry the Platypus, please! It's important to me! And if this works out, I might give up evil for acting! Won't you give me that chance, to succeed at something that might very well turn my life away from the evil path? Do it for the kids. Do it for the orphans. that I might perform in front of someday if I ever do a show in an orphanage. I don't want to be ungrateful or anything, but is there any way to speed this up? I gotta be in the make-up chair at 4 o'clock. Hey, what about this turbo switch? That oughta shave off some time, huh? Right, yeah? Some pilot you are. Oh, sure, blame the victim. Like you didn't know about my switch-flipping compulsion. Oh, now you're mad, sure. I don't know why I tried to be nice, I should have just trapped you, I could have been out of the hospital and on my way to the theater by now. Instead they'll end up using my understudy. Ugh, I hate that guy! So, if Doofenshmirtz is late, I get to go on? If he's not right in time for his entrance, you can have the part. I guess it is summer and we're in the desert, but I-I feel like it's unseasonably warm out here. I feel warm. Do you feel warm? Why do we always see cow skulls in the desert? And why do you only see the skull? Did the body die somewhere else? I-It makes no sense. Oh, I'm sorry, am I talking too much for you? Fine. I'll be quiet. I can shut up. I donât have to talk all the time. It's not like I have to fill the space. If you want silence, I'll give you silence! You watch! And it's gonna be deafening! Mark my words! Why do they say ""mark my words"" ? I mean, th-they just mean listen to my words, why don't they just say ""listen to my words""? (Song: Heck of a Day)  Nowhere to go, nothing to see   Except sand and sand and sand, and you and me  Hey, look how big the sun is through this magnifying glass. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh!

Two lost nomads who will never be missed   Some might interpret this as just a karmic slap on the wrist   But I've just gotta say it's a heck of a day to be us!   Oh, yeah  I was sure my arm would grow back, but it never did. See? Pure titanium. It's a fact.  It's a heck of a day to not have a car   And just walk and walk and not know where you are  You don't communicate, you know that? Y-You don't share. I know nothing about your private life. You're very closed off. Closed, that's you.  We got no kind of a map   Nothing to show us the way   And it's just talk and talk and talk with nothing to say   It's a heck of a day, a heck of a day to be us!   It's a heck of a day to be us!  So I never touched an iguana again. Actually, that's not entirely true. There was one time, back in aâ Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh! Look, Perry the Platypus, look! Y-You see, up there? Two tires and an axle! Ah, pretty soon we'll be rolling out of here! We're just gottaâ Gotta hop this fence. What do you mean, ""no""?! No trespassing! O-Oh, you gotta be kidding! You know what, Perry the Platypus? I just have my third realization of the day. I had two earlier but I didn't share them with you. I've realized that the thing that's kept me from succeeding all this years isn't my parents not showing up after my birth, it isn't my eight-month sting as an organ grinder monkey, it isn't the time I got my arm stuck under that boulder, also titanium now, see? It isn't any of those things. You know what it is? It's you! You are what's been holding me back all these years. Oh, very clever. Take my accusing finger and point it back at me. Soâ So, you think I'm responsible for my failures, whyâ You're wrong! I can prove it. If you'd just let me try my junkyard scheme without interfering, it will prove to you that you are the source of all my failures! A little boost here, Perry the Platypus? No, no, you're right. You're right, by myself. Okay, all I have to do isâ Okay, okay, okay, just this once I failed and you had nothing to do with it. But did you have to let me trip all three bear traps? I mean, c'mon! Why not here in the hot sun working on ways to get us back to Danville and you've never even offered me so much as a glass of water orâ or a tetanus shot! I-I'm going it alone. As a matter of fact, I'm sick of you and your smug face! I don't wanna see it any more. I'm going to close my eyes and count to three, and when I'm done, you'd better be gone. And it'll be just like when you're here, except you won't be here! One Two Three! Hey, he reallyâ Fine, then! I can find the bus station on my own. When I said I wanted a sea otter for Christmas, they said I have to pick my present from the bottom shelf of the kitchen caustic's aisle at the supermarket soâ So I picked the oven cleaner. I love that oven cleaner. Oven cleaner! Hey, a bus station! Danville and point east! Ticket, please! I-I don't have a ticket for theâ I've got to get to Danville to be in a play, Iâ I've just gotta, I don't have any money, I'm tired and dirty and it's all my fault. I'veâ It's always been my fault! I'm a failure. I'm a failure! I'm a failure. So no ticket? So no ticket? I'm a failure. Two bus tickets? Oh, Perry the Platypus, you're mensch. I-I know I can be testy and unpleasant andâ I know I tend to ramble on and on, to be fair, the burden of conversation is kinda all on me in our relationship. Uh And I-I know that I haven't always given you the respect you deserve. Anyway, I want you to know that you are appreciated, Perry the Platypus. You. Are. Appreciated. You. Are. Appreciated. You. Are. Appreciated. Oh, hey now, check it out. Look, uh, see? A tear. The universal secretion for sincerity. I-I'll just save that for next time. Come on, you can have a window seat. Hold it! No animals allowed! Tough break. Thanks for the ticket though. Sweet! It's air-conditioned in here! It's not like I wanted to go to the desert. Heâ He just jet-packed into me and dragged me along. ""No animals on the bus"", it's not my rule. It'sâ It's company policy. I-It's not my fault. Are you talking to me? And what does he expect, h-he's my nemesis. I'm a stone-cold villain. I'm ruthless. I have no ""ruths"". Still, heâ He looked so sad and pathetic when the bus pulled away, andâ Huh, I should think of something else. Uh Kreplach! Kreplach, Eastern European comfort food. You like kreplach? As a matter of fact, I do. When I was a little girl, my grandmother and I would make kreplach. First, we would roll out thâ Enough of your blabbering on and on! My little nemesis is out there all alone. Iâ I can't believe it! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stopâ What's going on? Hey, what gives? I can't believe it. Enjoying the shade, Perry the Platypus? It's your jetpack! I found it stuck in the mouth of a fiberglass dinosaur. I mean, how often does that happen when you really need it? Climb aboard. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!  Doofy doofy doofy doofy doofy doofy   Doofenshmirtz!  One minute till curtain. Looks like Doofy's a no-show. Perry the Platypus, we're running out of time! We're not gonna make it! Are you trapping me? But we were getting along soâ The turbo switch? Are you kidding? I-I can't control this thing at that speed. O-Okay, Perry the Platypus. If you think so. Oh, well, Doofenshmirtz, the show must go on, without you. And there's my cue. I shall never go hungry again. Pizza delâ Pizza delivery! Oh, my! What an entrance! We got him good! And I couldn't have done it without you. Oh, why, Perry the Platypus See, I knew I'd need it later! That was amazing! I never thought quilting could be so much fun! Think of the possibilities! Needlepoint! Embroidery! Tapestry! I'm headin' down to the fabric store right now! Broquet! Taffeta! Saddle stitch! Actually, I didn't find it all that exciting. Yeah, me either. Never getting that day back. Whew, stinker-roo.

"I think you're right, Stacy. The ocean would be a lot deeper without all those sponges. What is that noise? It is driving me crazy! A-ha! Nice try, Ferb. But you can't psych me out with your dead on celebrity impressions. All right, what is this? Table tennis. Ping pong, for the layman. Yeah, yeah, but is it like laser-activated, nuclear powered, supersonic ping pong? No. Good idea though. Ping pong, huh? I bet. I'll just stay right here until the inevitable weirdness happens. Any minute now. All right, so where's Perry? Monogram to Agent P. Already airborne, I see. I like that! Doofenshmirtz has recently purchased an inordinate number of chairs. Hundreds of them! Far more than necessary for a person with no friends, and only one tooshie. Well, actually I'mâ I'm just sort of assuming about the tooshie. But I'm pretty confident in the no friends thing. You think it'd be the other way around, but the way he's always playing with forbidden science, you can never really be Oh, this is coming out kinda weird, huh. Look, you're going over there anyway, justâ Just take a look, okay? Monogram out. Psst! Perry the Platypus, over here. Hurry! Hurry, it'sâ The show's about to start! Ladies and gentlemen! Someone in our studio audience has a date with history! So come on up, because this is your backstory, Heinz Doofenshmirtz! Me? It's me! It's me, Perry the Platypus! Let's give him a big round of applause! Tonight, we explore the life of a true evil genius. And find out just what makes him thick. But how? I'm glad you asked! With the help of our exciting but potentially lethal memory extraction technology, all of your most deeply suppressed memories will appear right on this screen! It's like a TV clip show fueled by your own brain. Now, let's start our trip down memory strasse on the day of your birth! In beautiful Gimmelshtump, Drusselstein! I don't really remember much about it, I was pretty young at the time, butâ Ooh! Ooh, I can feel it tingling! Something's coming out! Aww, how cute! But where's Mom? She didn't, uh show up for the birth. Remember this voice? When they are born, we slap their bottoms to start them breathing. Here he is, all the way from Gimmelshtump Memorial Hospital, Dr. Mortimer Shlussel. Dr. Shlussel, so good toâ Hey! He is breathing. And I'm sure you can guess who this next voice belongs to. Heinz, my little hobbengusher. Aw, when she says hobbengusher like that, it's easy to forget that it meansâ It's your mother! Mama! Hobbengusher. Yeah, that's the way you normally say it. Why?! Yes. Your relationship with your mother left something to be desired. Why?! Why!? But, what about Dad? Well, yeah, you know, thoâ Those were hard times. The stress of running a family weighed heavily on him. We were so poor that one day our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed. Who would protect our zatzenfruit garden from witches' spells and wood trolls? From a tender age, my father decided that it would be me. Bewegen sie nicht! While the other children played Kick-the-Schtumpel and eat doonkelberries, I would stand for hours. Bewegen sie nicht! All through the cold night as the spitzenhound howled, my only companion was the moon and my neighbor, Kenny. Bewegen sie nicht! What a fascinating life. We'll keep track of the level of emotional pain each backstory causes, on this colorful Gnome-o-Meter! As shown by Vanna, our Gnome-o-Meter spokesmodel. Looks like our gnome has begun his climb! Scale those heights, you bearded, Scandinavian cutie! Perform a segue back to rights of passage! Smooth, Norm. Thank you! Don't break the rhythm, sir. And let me tell you, transitioning to adulthood was painful, but, actually, I guess, a good indicator of things to come. In Gimmelshtump, jumping from the high dive was an important rite of passage. Are you a man or a schnitzel?! I'm a man! I'm a man! I'm a man! I'm a man! Das kind ist ein schnitzel! After that, my father and I became increasingly distant. Zu nah! Whatever, I-I'm so over it. Bewegen sie nicht! And there's another voice you might recognize. What exactly am I here for again? Roger! It's you brother, Roger Doofenshmirtz, beloved Mayor of Danville. Everybody loves him. All right, all right, enough with the cheering! This is my show, not his! Can I help it if Mommy liked me best? Look at all those burbling memory bubbles. Tell us all about it, Dr. D! For a time, I was happy. It was a short time, it was right there. It was a short time, it was right there. It was like five seconds when I was pushing the thing back and forth on the rug. And soon I learned my parents were expecting a brand new baby girl. My mother spent months knitting pretty dresses. U-Unfortunately, the baby turned out to be a boy, and because we were out of material, I was forced to wear those same dresses for an entire year! Drawing mockery and scorn from all of my manly classmates. I wanted to gain my mother's affection somehow, so I went to the claw machine district in hopes of winning her a gift. Fortunately, I had with me my allowance, which I'd been saving for a whole year. One three-cent coin. I dropped it into a slot, then carefully maneuvered the claw toward the beckoning fuzzy grail! Odds were against me, but then it happened! The miracle! The claw grabbed the stuffed animal, it was mine! Then, like a knight of yore, I gallantly gave the prize to my beloved mother who immediately turned around and gave it to my brother, Roger. I was crushed as I watched Roger produce a big red marker and write his name on the toy. And then afterwards proceed to do the same to my mother, claiming both as his own, and effectively shutting me out of the family dynamic. You know, Heinz, there's more than one way to a mother's heart. Kickball. My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickâ Well, I'll just let the song tell you. (Song: Couldn't Kick My Way Into Her Heart)  My mother's love was always inexplicably linked to kickball   And my brother was an expert from the start   But I lacked finesse, so when put to the test   I couldn't kick my way right into her heart  Ladies and gentlemen, Love HÃ¤ndel!  Oh, yeah!  Wait a second. You had Love HÃ¤ndel play your flashback? I know people. Really? No, not really, I told them it was for you. Hm-mm. Well, I've got a city to govern. Don't let your ego hit you on the way out! Although your family life was tough, your social life was How should we say, a soul-shattering void. A painful, but accurate choice of words, Norm. At the age of five, I was forced to throw my own surprise party. Hello, boys andâ Oh. Hmm Awkward. Ten seconds later, they confiscated the cake. Apparently there's a two-person minimum. Ooh! That stings! Do you recall a young lad named Boris? Oh, sure. Big Black Boots Boris the Bully. He was always kicking sand in my face. When I was in the sandbox sand. When I was in the sandbox sand. My first date sand! My first date sand! Balancing my checkbook sand! Balancing my checkbook sand! The beach Oddly enough, nothing. But I couldn't relax, because I kept waiting for it. Well, Boris owns a car dealership now, and declined to appear on this show. But he did send some sand! Well, at least he cared enough to do that. You did have one friend Balloony! When I was a boy, the smell of pork emanating from me was so bad because ofâ W-Well, the reason's unimportant, it was part of a different emotionally-scarring backstory. I'm not getting intoâ Regardless, the smell of pork was so bad that no one would come near me. So one day, the carnival came to town and I needed money because ofâ W-Well, yet another backstory thatâ Basically, my parents disowned me, I was being raised by ocelots. The point is, I had to get a job at the carnival, but the only work was at the dunking booth, and not as the guy who got dunked though, I-I was what they threw to dunk him, w-which is again, a whole other backstoryâ Okay, lookâ Long backstory short, I got a balloon at the carnival, I drew a face on him, I sprayed him with special lifelong-lasting spray I created, and I named him, ""Balloony."" He became my best friend in the whole world. Yadda yadda yadda. Then one tragic day, when I was protecting our garden as a lawn gnome, Balloony started floating away. And then I didn't see him for a long time, it wasn't 'til Well, there was this whole thing with an alien ship, it was really improbable. Well, here he is! Oh, Balloony, I-I've missed you so muâ BALLOONY! Ha-ha-ha! We're just having fun with you! That wasn't the real Balloony! It wasn't? No, of course not! The real Balloony popped three weeks ago! BALLOONY!!! And uncomfortable transition back to the Gnome-o-Meter! Wow, that backstory really had some juice. Now, if you've finished weeping, let's continue! In another misguided attempt to engage in life, you entered one of your inventions in a science fair! That's right. Itâ It was my very first inator! Just as I was about to demonstrate my invention to the judges, a kid with a baking soda volcano stole the show! The next year, I tried again with my even bigger inator. And again, my thunder was stolen by a baking soda volcano! I'd had enough of science. I decided to devote my life to poetry instead. The movies are gray, the TV is black, the horses are running, please bring me some food. Yet, curiously, I still lost to a baking soda volcano! And what's worse, his poetry lacked subtext entirely. Hey, where's Perry? Perry the Platypus, what are you doâ Okay, playtime's over! Norm? Behold, the Backstory-inator! You see, evil is born from pain and loss, but reliving one story at a time was not getting me anywhere! Now with this, I can collect the liquid essence of all my pain and suffering! And when it's all full, I can re-inject it into myself, making me the most powerfully evil person that has ever lived. Then, nothing can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-State Areâ Oh, there's Mama Ocelot. Ironically, she's still more nurturing than my own mother! Ow! Oh, quit it! Any time now, they're going to do something big and bustable. I just know it. And so, Perry the Platypus, to recap what I said mere moments ago before I was so rudely and painfully interrupted, once I have charged my Backstory-inator, the tragedy of it all will be re-injected back into me, and I will be transformed into the ultimate creature of evil! And, look! We're almost there! One more backstory should do it! Let's see Remember the time Hey Dad! Can I have the keys to the car? Oh, sure, Vanessa! Oh, no, no! Good memories flowing! Can't stop pleasant reminiscences! (Song: Not So Bad A Dad)  You were a substandard dad   But the only one I had  Hey, sweetheart. How'd you like to take a ride on a real bike?  I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall  She's sixteen!  But this piece of plastic in my hand makes me finally understand   Maybe you're not so bad a dad   Not so bad a dad after all  It only matters that I think he's cool. She thinks I'm cool! Okay Dad, if you want to hold your head and quiver some more, that's totally okay with me. But can I have the keys? Oh, yeah, right. Here you go. Have fun with your little toys. Aw, look at the Gnome-o-Meter! We're practically starting over. That's okay, sir. You have lots of painful history to explore. Tell us, how did you come to America? Well, it was when I was sixteen, or thereabouts. I had stopped celebrating birthdays at that point for You know, obvious reasons. And then one day, my parents sent me out to the Schtor to get some doozenbratt. And then one day, my parents sent me out to the Schtor to get some doozenbratt. You know, I've always had trouble distinguishing between a schtor and aâ A painting of a schtor, butâ But it started me off on the greatest adventure of my life! I decided to seize the day with both hands! And a mop. I was heading to a golden land of opportunity. I was heading to a golden land of opportunity. A land with a pioneering spirit which welcomed misfits like me! But I ended up in America instead. I just knew that I was home! In the sense that it was familiar. Once in America, you began the human rite of passage known as, high school! Leading to one of the most embarrassing viral videos of all time! Ugh! I thought I deleted that from everyone's memory. I am a superstar! Yeah, yeah, weâ We've all seen this, Norm. T-That's enough. It won'tâ But you haven't seen the digital remix!  I am a superstar! It won't stop flushing!  Oh, this is really surreal.  I am a superstar!  Ugh.  Won't! Won't! It won't stop flushing!  Creeping me out a little, I'll be honest.  Won't! Won't! It won't stop flushing!   Won't! Won't! It won't stop flushing!  Seriously, Norm, that's enough.  Won't! Won't! It won't stop flushing!  Enough now. It's got ten billion hits! And there's only seven billion people on the planet! I'm never going to live that down. And yet, despite a serious lack of coolness, you still managed to date a future pop star! What? Lindana is here? Actually, she didn't remember you! Well, that figures. We only had the one date, but it was eventful. It was at the Danville Drive-In. Okay, the coast is clear! You can come out now! Ew. It's grody back here! Well, on the bright side, you got in for free, so We'll just split the cost of my ticket, right? Right? You know, I could've gotten in the trunk, like, a block away instead of when you first picked me up at my house. Wow, you just love to live in the past, huh? Is that like a thing with you? Whatever. Let's just try to enjoy the rest of the evening. I am a happy robot, likey what I hear. I'm just kidding, that's a thing I do. C'mon, hop in! You were listening to ""That's Wings, You Turkey"" by King of Loud. And here's a new one from Zanzibar, ""What Do It Do?"" Oh, turn it up! I love this song! It's okay, I'd say it's in my top seven, eight favorite songs about reverse engineering. Makes me want to be a pop star! Ha! Yeah, right, and I'm going to rule the world! Well Why not? Yeah, like I could do that. Maybe instead of, you know, the whole world Uh Start small, with the Tri-State Area. Hey, the movie's starting! It was at that point you realized that the only business for you was I'm waiting for you to finish my sentence for me, sir. Oh, of course. Bratwurst! Actually, I was going to say ""evil,"" sir. Yes, but before I was evil, I was a bratwurst street vendor.  Doofenshmirtz quality bratwurst!  How do you know when you're really lame? When you sell bratwurst! Wow. That seemed more painful at the time. Oh, man, it's gonna take forever to get the gnome back up to the top at this rate. Hold your horses, sir. We're just getting to your love life! We're just getting to your love life! Oh, boy. You are the cutest thing I've ever seen. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You know, some people say we look alike. Uh, I don't think so. Not at all. No, not at all. But when I turned the Translator-inator on What a loser that guy up there is! She should dump that pink chimp and go out with a real mammal like me! She left me for that trash-talking 35-ton pile of blubber.  Evil love  I have never been so happy in my entire life! Oh, Heinz I feel nothing. But but but But but but But but but Nothing! And do you recall this voice? Hello, Heinz. I have your alimony check. Charlene! That's right. It's your former wife, Charlene Doofenshmirtz. Delivered in person, like you asked. Ah, what is this, a game show set? Is this what you spend the money on? Well You know, also groceries. Well, at least it's not in my garage. Nice tux, Norm. She's fantastic! Norm, let's bring out the big guns! Failed inators! Well, at least I found the key to theâ Nice. Curse you, Perry theâ Oh Why does everything explode so easily? You know what I'm noticing a lot of? I blow up more than the average guy. I think he's a pharmacist. Do they have blowing-up insurance? I should get some of that. And if they don't have it, I think they should make it, 'cause I would buy some. Oh, baby, what an emotional workout! And one more good trauma should send Arthur over the top! Yeah! Hit me with your best shot! That's just it, sir! The rest are more comical than tragic. What? How are we supposed to go over theâ Oh, curse you, Perry the Platypusâ And by ""curse you"", I mean ""thank you"" ! By humiliating me, you have inadvertently provided me the last tragic backstory I need to put this baby over the top! Remember two seconds ago when you foiled my latest plan? I do! What? How are we supposed to go over theâ How are we supposed to go over theâ And now I can feel myself getting more e-e-evil!! Feel the doom! Nothing can stop me now! Huh? Uh? NOO!!! (Song: My Nemesis)  (My neme, neme, oooo my neme, neme, neme)  Do you ever get tired of lugging this big tail around?  (My neme, neme, oooo my neme, neme, neme)   I used to sit alone doing evil all day  Well, back at it, I guess.  But now I think that someone's gonna get in my way   Yeah, the someone in my life that doesn't want me to exist   (My neme, neme, oooo my neme, neme, neme)  I-I've got an even better best friend!  And I feel fine 'cause I've got a nemesis  It's clear to me now, that my real best friend is Perry the Platâ  (My neme, neme, oooo my neme, neme, neme)   (My neme, neme, oooo my neme, neme, neme)   Now I hate him, and he hates me   What a wonderful animosity   Besides his hat, he wears no clothes  Peter the Panda? And Perry the Platypus? You're working together to rescue me?  Now I have someone to oppose   Doofy doofy doofy, doofy doofy doofy   Doofenshmirtz!   Yes, I have a nemesis!  I want you to know that, you are appreciated, Perry the Platypus. You. Are. Appreciated. You. Are. Appreciated. You. Are. Appreciated. You think I'm evil, right? Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Thank you. No! What have you done, Perry the Platypus? I'm getting less evil! Significantly sooo oooo! Darn it, I really liked that shirt. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Okay, so I-I'll see you tomorrow, right? I'm sending you a bill for the shoes. My boyfriend's a lawyer. All right, Norm, let's get this place cleaned up. Backstory all over the place. Uh, fine, you've bored me into submission. One million five hundred sixty-two thousand nine hundred seventy-two One million five hundred sixty-two thousand nine hundred seventy-eight! We did it! We've stored up enough kinetic energy. The quantum vortex should appear any second now. Mom?"
"I've got you now, Perry the Platypus! This is the most sophisticated trap I have ever invented. In fact, it's so escape-proof thatâ That I couldn't get that guy out. So, I had to build a whole new trap to catch you. And of course, I had to buy a new plastic skeleton for Halloween. It's a pitiable existence I lead, Perry the Platypus. Doâ Do you pity me? You should 'cause I'm pitiable. Everyone should pity me. Eh, you don't have to say pity too many times before it stops sounding like a word. Pity. Pity. Pitâ Pity. Pity. Pitâ Pity. Pity. Pitâ See? That is only like two times and it's already just gobbledygook. Gobbledygook, too. I can'tâ I can't even get through that once. Gobbledyâ Uh, see, I'm not even consider the last syllable and it's alreadyâ Great. Now, I'm forgetting what I was talking about. Which is another reason to pity me! Yeah! Back on topic, baby! You see, I-I figured if I get myself big sad eyes, people would pity me and get me whatever I want. And to that end Behold, the Big-Sad-Eye-inator! You like it? It sums up a lot of juice, so I'm running it at night when the electricity is cheaper. But the nighttime is the right time for a party. A pity party! Here we go! Don't worry about a thing, Mom. Everything's under control. Thanks, Candace. It's been too long since your father and I had a date night. Thirteen days, twenty-two hours, and seventeen minutes. How do you know that? I've got an app on my phone. Don't worry about us. Bye. Parents are weird. Yes. Yes, they are. It takes a while to get warmed up, but we're almost there. Oop! See, I told you it took up a lot of juice. What happened? I think we blew a fuse. Don't get all technical on me, just fix it. Relax, Candace. Ferb and I will check the fuse box. In the meantime, you go find a flashlight. Okay. Find a flashlight. Find a flashlight. Hey, Ferb. Isn't it cool how you can still see people's eyes inâ Ferb? Where'd you go? Oh-ho! You prankster. I know we have a flashlight in here somewhere. Oh, okay, that's a stapler. Ow! Scissors. And What is this, an old banana? Eww. What happened to all the flashlights? Ah-ha! Darn! The batteries are dying. I better conserve them. Phineas? Ferb? Oh, who leaves a chair right next to a table? Looks like the whole town's in a blackout. What'cha doin'? Isabella? Your voice sounds horrible. Fooled ya! It's me, Buford! And my voice isn't horrible, it's raspy! You gotta spend hours screamin' in the closet to get it like this. Hours! Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? There's the original. I'm glad you're here, Isabella. Ferb and I are working on something that will give us all the best blackout ever! Can I help? Sure you can, Baljeet. Hey, Baljeet. Hey, Buford. Your voice is so raspy. It sounds as if sandpaper and a washboard had a baby. See, closet time's paying off. Okay, guys. Let's get to work. Hey, hold it right there. Who else is back here? Roll call! Well, there's Ferb, Isabella, Buford, Baljeet and me. Oh, and there's that kid in the corner with the eyepatch. But is it my left eye, or my right eye? You don't know. Hi, Mom! Yeah, we're okay. In fact, I was just about to call you. I can't see what Phineas and Ferb are making but I'm sure it's bustable. Well, it'll have to wait. Traffic lights are out all over the city. Of course you know I'd like nothing better than to give up my special time with your father, to run home and not see what they may, or may not have done. I can't remember, were you always this sarcastic? Shh. They're using a wench, Mom. They're making something huge, andâ Candace found the wood chipper, guys. My phone! Oh, we got disconnected. Now, who's going to grate on my nerves all night? Oh, so you have always been this sarcastic. Oh, that's right. It's going to be you. You betcha, Duckie. One way or another, I'm gonna see what all you eyeballs are making back here. Sure. I want everyone to see, including Perry. Hey, where's Perry? Hey, where's Perry?  Doofenshmirtz isn't illuminated!  A blackout? Oh, Perry the Platypus, isn't this wonderful? Now people can't see anything but my pitiful eyes. Look at them, Perry the Platypus, don't you feel sorry for me? Don't my sad, lugubrious eyes illicit compassion and mercy? Your secret agent training has taught you to squint well, my nemesis. But you can't fight the power of these pathetic, pleading eyes. I guess you can, 'cause you're heartless, Perry the Platypus. You know that? Where your heart should be, a big empty sack of nothing. But the common man will not be able to. I'm gonna go find someone on the street and test these babies out. And you're coming with me. Here, come on. It's a good thing I put wheels on this trap. Try to keep up. Somebody hand me that wrench. The power transformer is online. It is a good thing that you had this bicycle-powered generator. We like to be prepared for any eventuality. Thanks for pedaling by the way. Buford was supposed to take over half an hour ago. But I cannot find him anywhere! And you're not gonna. Buford, is that you? No. Come on, you stupid thing! Work! There. Now where is it? What theâ Ugh, stupid thing. Ugh! What are you guys building? An anti-gravity device? Nah, that's just the crane. Tighten the servomotor. Aye-aye. Well, I'm gonna feel my way through this. Okay, this feels like, metal. And this is some kind of wooden railing. Ooh, mushy-squishy. We're not using any mushy-squishy stuff. But that's Perry's favorite spot. Ew. Okay, gross. Can you just tell me what you're building? I'd love to. But it's kinda hard to put into words. You really just have to experience it. Fine! Fire it up. Great! Put on this helmet. And this mouthguard. And this lead apron. Arms up and you're ready to go. Arms up and you're ready to go. Okay, okay, this isn't so BAAAAAAD! Okay, okay, this isn't so BAAAAAAD! (Song: What Is This Thing?)  What is this thing that keeps dragging me around?   Is it mechanical, I recognize the sound   And I'd give anything to be back on the ground   What is this thing?   What is this thing, yeah   What is this thing? Is it just a state of mind?   If this is Venice, then I've gone Venetian blind   I think my sanity is starting to unwind   What is this thing?   What is this thing, yeah   What is this thing?   What is this thing, yeah   Is it a car wash or a pair of ankle weights?   Is it a ninja or commemorative plates?   There's a phrase that comes to mind   I'm not sure that it translates   Â¿QuÃ© es esto?   What is this thing, yeah   What is this thing?   What is this thing, yeah  Wow, Candace. We never thought of riding it before. I think I swallowed the mouthguard. Okay, Perry the Platypus, I see someone. You'll understand the power of my sad eyes when you see them in action. You ready? Watch this. Excuse me? Oh, you look so sad. I feelâ I feel so sorry for you. What can I do? Here, take this. There. And as soon as I find my home, I'll come back and bring you more free stuff. You poor, poor thing. You see? And I don't even know what it is. Sir, your eyes, they compel me to help. Let me contribute. Here. Thank you, kind sir. Why is it so warm? Your eyes bring out my mercy. Don't they just? Here, take all I have. Youâ Y-You gave me a wig? No. Here, take this. Ooh, take that. Please take this. Here, have my wallet. My toaster. My watermelon. Oh, let's all go get him some more stuff. Jetpack squad away! Wow, if it worked on that jetpack squad, I bet it'll work on my brother, Roger! Maybe he'll take pity on me, and make me Mayor! And that's just a hop, skip and a jump from having people give me the whole Tri-State Area! Thank goodness your wrist communicator is still working, Agent P. We traced the blackout to the Danville power plant on 5th street. I know you're busy with Doofenshmirtz and you don't normally handle stuff like this, but I was in the middle of microwaving a burrito and the center is still totally frozen. Just figured you were close, and uh Hurry, Agent P, it'sâ It's kind of scary in here, and I'm all alone. C-Carl? Carl, is that you? How can I bust you if I don't know what you've made? Dad's unmistakable, two honk horn signal. They're home! Mom, Dad! You're home! Hi, sweetie. The restaurant was closed because of the blackout. What's all that noise? Phineas and Ferb made a dangerous thing in the backyard, in the dark. Phineas and Ferb made a dangerous thing in the backyard, in the dark. Oh, this stupid fence! Why do we have this stupid fence here? Dad, tear down this fence! What do you think, should we tear down this fence? Oh, that's the sarcasm I like. Seeâ Wait, you can feel what they made. Come on! Candace, my arm! You know, Perry the Platypus, Iâ I didn't realize this trap would be so heavy. City Hall is still like a few blocks away, you don't mind if I just leave you here, do you? Hello? Where's Perry the Platypus? Where's Perry the Platypus? That's all it was? That big red switch over there? You think I would've known that. I mean I got a Ph.D. You work that into every conversation. Okay, can you feel it Mom? Can you feel it? I feel something pointy. I feel something pointy. You're right, Ferb. We're cooler, even in the dark. Hi, boys. Wait! Where is that incredibly huge and dangerous thing that you all built? A bunch of guys on jetpacks came by and asked if they could have it. So we gave it to them. Oh, you boys are so cute. But what was it? What was it?! So why is it that you think I'm going to just hand over my mayorship to you? Oh, because I've got these big sad eyes. Yeah. And they're kind of freaking me out. Yeah, I guess it probably works better in the dark. Oh, look, it's the jetpack squad. Here, sad-eyed man, we brought you this! Oh, I think I swallowed my mouthguard."
"There's roughly 14 days of winter vacation   That fall between Christmas and New Year's   So the winter-time problem for our generation   Is crammin' fun in before the dust clears   Like maybe   Building an igloo that looks like a palace   Or scale a drift that's 80 feet high   Constructing huge snow cones that reach to the moon   Or making snow angels that fly   Creating Northern Lights   Snowboarding upside-down   Or slaloming on your rear-end  That is cold!  Cool winter carnivals   Good old snowball fights and ice dancing with your best friends!  Ice dancing?  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do and we're not gonna stall  Come on, Perry!  So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!  Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making another winter-themed title sequence! Okay, Ferb. Open the floodgates. What do you think? It is like our own miniature Canada! But, of course, without the beavers, moose, and disproportionate number of comedians. Or Canadian bacon. I forgot all about Canadian bacon. You realize it is only ham. Phineas! And Ferb! You are so busted! Hello, boys, splendid job on the hockey rink. Well, that was amusing. Great skating, Dad! Boys, I've got some good news for you. I've arranged for you to play a little exhibition match between periods at the Danville Ice Trays game. Oh, you mean like at halftime? Well, it's three periods, so it's really two-thirds time. Bland sports terms. That's what keeping the Canadians down. If we're going to be the entertainment, then we'd better kick it up a notch. Hockey Z-9? Hockey Z-9. Oh, like Football X-7. What happened to Y-8? Oh, we're saving that for croquet. Ferb, grab your toolbox. We've got work to do. What's the big deal with hockey anyway? Well, it's hard to explain actually, taking the flip pass from the winner, shoulder deking the defense men, and then, tossing it right over the old glove hand. Oh, it just takes hold of you like a fever! Did you play a lot of hockey in England there, Dad? Never once. Hey, Candace. Oh, hi, Jeremy. What a great ice rink. Wouldn't it just be perfect for figure skating? Ice hockey! What? Oh, yeah. Ice hockey. I didn't know that you were a hockey fan, Candace. You betcha! Flipping over win passes, and then shoulder dorkin' the old jazz hands. It's like some kind of disease! Uh Yeah. Say, Jeremy, why don't you join us at the exhibition game today? Sounds like fun. Oh, yeah. Sounds like PRRRRING!! Sounds like PRRRRING!! Oh, hey, I got a phone call from, um a real person. Oh, hey, I got a phone call from, um a real person. Gotta go. Stacy, we have a Code Teal. Locusts? Are you sure? No, wait. I mean Code Periwinkle. Periwinkle. A hockey emergency? I'm on it! Speaking of periwinkle, where is Perry? Carl, I'm freezing. Did you call that repair guy yet? I left him a message, sir. I think he went to Aruba for winter break. Lucky dog. It's cold in Oh! Agent P! Didn't hear you come in. I have no idea what Doofenshmirtz is up to. It seems all of our computers froze. Isn't that right, Carl? Tech support says everything is fine. Well, I'm sure whatever Doof is up to, he's probably much warmer than we are, and that alone should be reason to stop him! Good luck, Agent P! Welcome, hockey hounds, to the hypothermic hippodrome of Danville Mountain Top Winter Arena, where our own Danville Ice Trays will cross sticks with the combative cross-town contenders. Reigning over the skating skirmish tonight as guest referee is Hockey Hall of Famer, Luc Robitaille! Is anyone else cold? Why is it so cold in here? We don't know, Luc Robitaille! Actually, I brought a blanket. So, I'm okay. Here we are. Oh, this is so exciting! I've always wanted to be a hockey mom. Excuse me for a second. System check. Stacy, can you read me? I've got the hockey reference manuals, league website, and official rules up and ready! Stacy, Mom said it's my turn to use the computer! Not now, Ginger. I'm busy. Don't make me open that can of whipped cream on you! Or however that goes.  Doofenshmirtz evil igloo on a mountain top, eh?  Ah, Perry the Platypus! Come in! How do you like my evil igloo hideout up in the Danville Mountains? Would you like some hot cocoa? No? Then, how about a marshmallow? Ha! Trapped you again! I think I figured out why I haven't been able to take over the Tri-State Area. I've been too much of a nice guy. Nice guys can't take over large metropolitan areas, except for Roger. But, we're not talking about Roger. I've got to get mean. I've got to get ugly and possibly hairy. I've got to learn to be more like the abominable snowman. So, I decided to build this! Behold, the Abominable-natâ Theâ The Abominamaâ The A-bom-in-a-ble-i-nat-or. See, I can only say it if I speak slowly. The Abominable inator. The Abominable inator. Oh, look, if Iâ If I separate it, it works. The Abominable Inator! It makes whatever it hits bigger and scarier and hairier. Anyhoo, behold. Okay, I know what you're thinking. ""Why the silly little stocking cap and scarf?"" The truth is, I, uh I had some yarn. And the blare of the buzzer brings down the metaphorical curtain on the scintillating second period of this titanic tussle as the grim, gritty gladiators vacate the frozen field of flailing, fighting flugelhorn to prepare for the third period of this tellican, turf-toes tower as the frosty defibrillators mill the frozen peems of icy Oh, man. I better go lay down. So when all the members of the offending team clear the defensive zone at the same time, the delayed offset call is negated. Wow. You really do know hockey. Are you kidding? Did you know a referee makes most penalty calls while the linesmen may call only obvious technical infractions. Go away! obvious technical infractions. Go away. The player who committed the infraction is No, give me that. No, Ginger, I'm busy. I said, give me that back. If you don't give that back to me right now Candace, gotta go. Now for your entertainment, what we've all been waiting for Little Kids On Ice! This is so exciting! Oh! I forgot to charge the battery. Oh, no! I can't miss this photo op! Where is the gift shop?! Uh, it's way over there, on the other side of the arena. I'll be right back. Behold, Perry the Platypus, as I make myself abominable. Ooh, it's all marshmallow-y and hairy. Not completely unlike summer camp. Apparently, you gotta aim this thing a little better. Whoa! Ow! Hmm Something's not right in the hinterland. Yikes! Oof! Okay, Ferb! Looks like we're on. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be transported to a world where everything you know is changed into a global, glacial dystopia. If you're looking for something fluffy, forget it, pal. Because this is the future, where the only things left are hard, cold, and in most cases pointy. It's a world where the only way to survive is to play hockey while things blow up around you. It's a world of skillful skating and incredible ice ramps. Puck-pushing prowess and savage stone gladiators. Oh, this is so bustable! Mom, d â Where's Mom? She went to the gift shop to buy a disposable camera. What the heck is that? It's a camera, that you send away to get the film part developed, and then you take the non-film camera-only part, and you throw it away. What the heck is film? Would you please just look in the back? This is the harsh, hybrid hockey of your dark, dystopian destiny. Hockey Z-9! Thanks, Dink! Gotta get on the ice! (Song: Hockey Z-9)  Oh, yeah!   Don't turn away, I'm talking to you, sir   'Bout the post-apocalyptic sport of the future   You'll be skating amok, with curved sticks and a puck   Put your doctor on speed dial, 'cause you're gonna need sutures   Shoulder pads and blades, curling stones for sweepin'   Hockey Z-9   Hockey Z-9   It's as far as you can go, alphabetically speakin'   It's a game with a brand new name   Hockey Z-9   Hockey Z-9   Hockey Z-9   Hockey Z-9   Yeah!   Yeah, yeah!   Hockey Z-9!  Oh, my feet! Now, it's working. Hey, not bad. A little hairy, but not bad. Now, to deal with you! Gotcha! Hey, where'd you go? Oh, there you are. Yes? Ow! Oh! Oh, stupid thing! 'Scuse me, I gotta get through here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not allowed out there. But I gotta go get my mom, and this is the shortcut to the gift shop! I'm sorry, you can't go out there. That's for players only. Players, huh? You're gonna go get a uniform and try to get out there, aren't you? Is that a problem? No, as long as we're clear on the concept. Hey, look at that! There was one in our ""disposable stuff from the 80's"" box. Thanks, David. Let me know if you need more things to throw away! Where the heckâ Hey, how'd you get over there? Don't do that! Oh, man! Okay, now you're just showing off! What? Is there something I shouldâ I fail to see how this could get any worse. Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Okay, I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. Mr. Stevens! Mr. Stevens, I'm having trouble with the equipment! Sorry. Excuse me. Yes, you are Number One. Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. All right, all right, allâ Excuse me! Oh, check it out, a monster ice-polishing machine! Okay, everyone, looks like we're done, let's get out of here. Oh, my gosh. That is the cutest thing I've ever seen. Everyone say, ""Canadian bacon!"" Ham! Great job, kids. That was the weirdest game of hockey I've ever seen. Thanks, Mr. Robitaille! Okay, I'm all set to sneak across the ice. Go ahead. Hockey Z-9 is over. What? No! Mom, they had giant dangerous With a It's not fair! It's so not fair! Unsportsmanlike behavior! Fine. Wow, Candace, I had a really good time. You want to get something to eat? Oh, that sounds like fun! But give me two minutes. Oh, there you are Perry."
"Have fun at the party! Thanks for having the boys over tonight, Vivian. Oh, no problem, Linda. I have all the neighborhood kids tonight. C'mon, c'mon, I don't want to be late for my first grown-up party! Huh. Okay, hun. Bye, everyone! Happy New Year! Bye, guys! Goodbye! Happy New Year! We're gonna have so much fun! We've got noisemakers, balloons, confetti And of course, we'll all stay up till midnight and watch the New Year's Eve ball drop! Baljeet's already out! Wake up, will ya! Aw! You're drooling all over my arm! You know, saliva is 98% water and the other 2% is made up of very beneficial electrolytes. It is gross, but it is science. You're lucky the gross factor outweighs the science factor, or you'd have a one-way ticket to wedgie town! Well, it'll be fun to finally see the ball drop. Oh, it's a wonderful tradition! And, of course, there's the other tradition of kissing someone special at midnight. Well then, I know what we're gonna do tonight. Really? Yeah! We're gonna make our own New Year's ball and drop it from outer space! Your mother is right, Phineas. You have such an active imagination! Not active enough. I'm going to make some hot chocolate. You kids come in when you want to warm up. Hey, where's your platypus? Morning, Agent P. Sorry about the cold climate inside your lair, you see, the heating system is on the fritz and we had to call a guy in from Aruba. But I can assure you that we are all in the same boat here. You're not alone in this. We are all sharing the pain, andâ Awkward. Race ya to the wet ski! Um Uh, Doof's doing something in City Hall, and put a stop to whatever it is. Hey, Carl! I get the blue one! Okay, Phineas! We're good to go! Great. Bring her down! How's the soldering going up there? Ferb is almost done. How are you doing, Buford? Why do I have to paint? Painting is for babies and beatniks! That's no ordinary paint. It's a super-sealer that will protect us from the cold, dark vacuum of space! Beatnik talk! Hey, Phineas. Mind if we see the inside? Not at all! Check it out! A multi-level New Year's ball with punch bowl sailing. Ahoy! Balloon room, the bed of a thousand coats, an infinity slide, and through here, the grand ballroom! In other words, a ball within a ball! Whoa! Irving? How do I get out of here?!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Happy New Year! Norm, I told you. You don't celebrate 'til midnight, not all day. What if midnight never comes? Then you've squandered a whole day celebrating. Ever think of that, tough guy? Perry the Platypus? It's a bottle of sparkling cider trap, and you're the cork! Which makes you Perry the Cork-apus! You got a funny name. Anyway, it's New Year's-themed! Happy New Year! Not yet, Norm. And on to my plan. I recently learned that in most of the world, there's a tradition where people decide to change something about their lives in the coming year. And they call it ""a New Year's resolution."" I-I had no idea, you see, back in Drusselstein, change was frowned upon. Any change! Uh, you couldn't change your channel on your TV, you couldn't change your underwear and forget about changing your hairstyle, you'dâ You'd end up in jail. But here in the new world, we embrace change! Apparently. And that's why I came up with the Resolution Changer-inator! Cleverly disguised as a bow tie! When I turn it on at the stroke of midnight, it will make everyone change their resolution from whatever it was, likeâ I don't know, ""I-I'm gonna lose weight""  or ""gain a limb"", or whatever. to, ""I'm going to make Heinz Doofenshmirtz my leader and obey his every command"". That will be their new resolution. All right, Norm. How do I look? Like a pharmacist in a bow tie! Eh, good enough. Time to go. You're squandering, Norm! Ready to get your party on, dear? Do one-legged ducks swim in circles? Wow. First year with the adults! Yep, we're all grown-up now. No more pigtails, dollies, or obsessing over boys. From now on, we obsess over men. And no more busting! Attagirl! Yep, I'm sticking to my resolution and turning over a new leaf. Fifteen whole minutes and I haven't thought of Phineas and Ferb. How they make those things. You know, those big, like, dangerous things they make Candace Sorry! I'm back, I'm back. Resolution kicking in. Resolution kicking in. Oh, look, here come the boys! You mean, men? Ladies. That's us! We're ladies. Carbonation is fun! Hello, Danville! Hey, you there! What's your New Year's resolution? To update my mustache. That's what you think! I don't know. It seemed achievable. This is so great, being here as an adult. Not like my brothers. Who are kids. Who are probably building something Candace Something big Candace Big and bustable Gotta go! Oh, no, you don't! This is gonna be a new year with a new Candace! Remember? Gotta bust. G-G-G-Gotta bu-bu-bu-bust! Bust! It's okay. It's just a temporary relapse. Candace? Stacy told me about your New Year's resolution. I I need a timeout. I'll be right back! Relapse? Relapse. That's what you think! Oh It never stops beingâ  Perry!  Perry the Platypus? You can't come in here, this is a black-tie affair.  Perry again!  Actually, I guess it doesn't really specify pants anywhere, so I guess you're okay. Oh, and another little tidbit about the ancient Egyptians is that both men and women wore makeup. Just like the '80s. Hold it together, girl. You can do this. Hey, I thought your New Year's resolution was to stop eating sandwiches in the bathroom. But it's not midnight yet, so I can still enjoy this. Not midnight yet? That's it! I've actually got an hour left to bust my brothers! I've gotta find out what they're doing! I'll get video. Whoa! Oh! Ooh! Huh, that parkour training actually paid off. All right. Let's start this bash in a ball! Yay! Oh, no, I missed it! And how am I gonna show Mom? No worries! I'm live-blogging the whole event on my podcast! We're trending right now! Right now? Hey, all of you out there in Internet Land! Watch closely because I'm gonna bust Phineas and Ferb. She never busts them. And Internet Land is not a real place! What is this, the coat room? All right, Perry the Platypus, if you really want to fight, here I aâ Ooh, cashmere. Nice. Hey, Candace. I got you a glass of sparkling cider. Rain check! This is my last time to bust! Serious relapse. Come on, Irving. Yes! Everyone, can I have your attention, please? My brothers and their friends will be dropping from outer space in that giant New Year's ball. Oh, my gosh! Oh, amazing! Ooh, that's fantastic! Ooh! No, that's not fantastic! It, uhâ Okay, well, I-I admit it's impressive, but it's still bustable! Mom! If those were my boys, they'd be so busted. Please! Adopt me now! Ugh! Mom! Okay, it's almost midnight, let's go! You'll never get out of that straitjacket. Why would anyone wear that to a New Year's Eve party? I guess maybe if you were a magician, maybe Only one minute 'til midnight! Time to launch my plan! Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Almost done! Mom! It's New Year's! This is no time for kissing! Happy New Year! Now watch this. What is everyone's New Year's resolution? To follow you, Heinz Doofenshmirtz, our new leader! Hmm, so, how does it feel to be a loser, Perry the Platypus? I mean, that's a rhetorical question. Of course, i-if anyone should know how it feels, it should be me, but All right, everyone! Follow me, we're taking over City Hall! Hello? What are you doing? Obey me! Hey, w-what about your resolution? Everyone knows that no one ever keeps their New Year's resolution. That doesn't even make any sense! Why would you make resolutions if you're not ever gonna folâ Did you know about this? You did! You knew about this and you still punched and kicked and pinched me. Ah, I guess you're right. That'sâ That is what we do. Aw, thank you, Perry the Platypus. Happy New Year. (Song: Happy New Year)  You know it hasn't been bad   More happy than sad   But I tell you I'm glad when I think about starting all over again   Yeah, I know what we did   But I don't think about then   That was a moment, but this is another   So I'm not gonna cry when we say goodbye   To the year that is quickly receding   We're not gonna look back   We know we're on the right track   And we all know that time is fleeting   (Time is fleeting)   Time is fleeting   Because you know it's a new year, it's a brand new beginning   Another 365 and the world keeps spinning   It's a new year, it's a time for celebration   The fun has just begun   Yeah, it's gonna be a Happy New Year   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)   Gonna be a Happy New Year   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)   Gonna have a Happy New Year   'Cause you know it's a new year, it's a brand new beginning  What is happening? Is this your doing, bro?  Another 365 and the world keeps spinning  ""Auld Lang Syne"" literally means ""old long ago"", but I'd rather think of New Year's as an unspoiled universe.  It's a new year, it's a time for celebration   The fun has just begun  I sure hope Candace can see the fireworks.  Yes, gonna be a Happy New Year  You know, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to keep this resolution. That's okay. I like you just the way you are. Happy New Year, Candace.  Gonna be a Happy New Year!  Happy New Year, Jeremy.  'Cause you know it's a new year, it's a brand new beginning   Another 365 and the world keeps spinning   It's a new year, it's a time for celebration   The fun has just begun   Yes, gonna be a Happy New Year   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)   Gonna be a Happy New Year   (Gonna be a Happy New Year)  Happy New Year!  Gonna have a Happy New Year!  Mwah!"
"You'll never guess what I'm doing tonight. Well, you might be Going on a big date, but guess with who? Obviously It's Jeremy! But you'll never guess where. I have no idea. Neither do I. He says it's a surprise. Ooh Lucky you. The problem is if I don't know where we're going, I don't know what to wear. Oh! I know! Hair bows. They're all the rage these days. Just don't wear any feather earrings, they're so last Tuesday. Uh, yeah! So last Tuesday. I-I would never wear something so Tuesdayish of last. Well, since the parts didn't arrive for our zombie-robot pool table, anybody have any other suggestions? Hey, remember how we did that super rollercoaster? How 'bout a super-duper rollercoaster? So, you are just adding a ""duper"" then? It's an acceptable suffix. We did a portal to Mars. Maybe a portal to Venus? Maybe a portal to Venus? Hah! Only if they make SPF 12 million. Okay, okay! How 'bout a super-super-duper-duper-duper rollercoaster? What? Too much or not enough? Actually, instead of improving one of our old inventions, we should make something brand new! Something simple. How do you mean? Well, what is summer all about?  Summer is running through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes, andâ  Yeah, we all know the song. But I'm not exactly sure how. Well, hurry up and think of somethin'. I'm gettin' tired of hanging around here. That's it, Buford. You can't get more summer than a tire swing. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. Uh, hatch mosquitoes? No. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P. We have a report that Doofenshmirtz is at the shark. We don't know which shark, but it sounds bad. Ugh! Gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it. Sir, it was a typo. Doof isn't at the shark, he's at the park. Well then, that's a lot lower on my heebie-jeebie scale. So Agent P, uh change of plan. Head over to the park and stop Doof from doing the doings that Doof does do. Head over to the park and stop Doof from doing the doings that Doof does do. You have a heebie-jeebie scale, sir? Yeah. You're on it. An old-fashioned tire swing but huge and powered by jet-engines that can flatten a small village. Baljeet, have you calibrated the ailerons yet? Oh, sure, calibrated the ailerons I'll just stay here and fiddle with stuff, so I look busy. Hey, Buford. What? I didn't take nothing out of nowhere. But, um Just as a hypothetical, uh What do you think would happen if say, you took that goofy doohickey thing out of the thingamawhatsit? Hmm. Good question. Ferb? Well, if we account for the coolness of the jet propulsion circuits this early in the day, and the increased internal humidity while that access port is open, removing the part in question would cause the machine to emit a ray that turns a human into a fly. Really? You'd be surprised how often removing a single component can make the difference between one thing, and a highly complicated totally unrelated other thing. For instance, if you remove this part it will become a sorbet machine. Why do you ask? Oh, no reason. A hair bow? Only Stacy can pull this off. I'm a fly?! How is this possible?! Phineas and Ferb, you are so buzz-ted! Phineas and Ferb, you are so buzz-ted! Mom! Mom, look! Phineas and Ferb invented somethin' that turns people into flies! Ew! Get away, fly! Shoo! Oops, I'm late for my appointment. Mom, it's me! Mom! You need to bust the boys and get them to turn me back into me before Jeremy gets back here! What? Help me! Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you join me for a picnic? Ah! Oh! Oh, my duodenum. Oh! Oh, did you see your face? You were like, ""Ooh, maybe I shouldn't, but then, well, I am hungry"". And then BOOM! And then BOOM! Down you went! And are you hungry, Perry the Platypus? Well, too bad, it's not for you, it's for them! Behold! My Feed-the-Pigeons-inator! Okay, Snobby the Snobapus, I know it doesn't sound like much, but it is technically evil. I'm breaking the law, see? There? There. ""Do not feed the pigeons"". And I am going to feed the pigeons, therefore I am breaking the law. ""Do not feed the pigeoâ"" I-It's aâ It's a metal sign with big red letters on it and that makes it, legally binding. big red letters on it and that makes it, legally binding. Okay, here's the truth. I got evil scientist block, all right? Seriously, I gotâ I got nothing. Iâ I was going to make a Good-Idea-inator, but I thought it would be counterproductive because it already had ""good"" in the title. So then I invented a Bad-Idea-inator, which just gave me this. See where that got me. Ah, I'm telling you, I'm dry, Perry the Platypus. Dry! And the summer just keeps going on and on and it feels like it's been goin' on for like four years! I'm asking you, man to monotreme, can you help me? See? Even my trap design has become lackluster. Lady and gentlemen, may we present a good old-fashioned new-fashioned tire swing! Prepare to engage thrusters! The fully-pressurized cabin is gyroscopically balanced for a perfectly smooth ride. Hmm. Now it just feels like we are watching a movie. True, but we can also go old school! Hang on, everybody! This is great! I have never been so sick to my stomach! Okay, I think I've gleaned from your expression that you are now going to lead me through a series of bizarre and seemingly unrelated exercises that will help me get my groove back. Does that about sum it up? Good. Let's do this thing! You again? Looks like I took you on a little trip. Get back to your family, little fella. Little fella? What about me looks like a little FELLA?! What of me looks like a little FELLA?! (Song: Fly On the Wall)  I don't have to tell you it's a negative situation   Once you're in it   I mean, you have to beat your wings 12,000 times a minute   Yeah   You spit acid on your food 'cause you can't chew   And when you order from the menu, it's always number 2   But baby, you can see it all   Baby, you can see it all   Baby, you can see it all when you're a fly on the wall   You got compound eyes, you got hairy thighs   Yeah, life ain't easy for common houseflies   Flypaper, bug zappers, swatters and sprays   And if you make it through that, you live all of seven days   But baby, you can see it all   Baby, you can see it all   Baby, you can see it all when you're a fly on the wall  This is Jeremy's house! And there's Jeremy! At last, a silver lining! I can find out where we're goin' tonight! A girl's gotta know what a girl's gotta wear. Yeah, it's a total surprise. I'm taking her to the rodeo. The rodeo? I love rodeos! Wait, do I love rodeos or is that because I'm a fly? Oh, hang on, Coltrane, there's a fly in here. Let me get it. There's one! Come on, Fireside Girls! Let's get it! Well, girls, there goes our Lizard-Feeding patch. Could this day get any weirder? Hello. Oh, my gosh, were you turned into a fly, too? Me? No, I was always a fly. I just got shot with a Human-Head-inator and Now I got this thing! It's really uncomfortable. How do you walk around with these? Tell me about it. Be glad you don't have a freakishly long neck! Yes, that was a rush! What a rush! Great! That was the most fun ever! Yeah! Let's restock the snack bar and go again! Now there is something you do not see every day. A fly with orange hair. Orange hair? Uh-oh! Candace has been turned into a fly! Wait, did someone take the doohickeys thing out of the thingamawhatsit? Buford? Uh Oh, no! If I catch the mug what did this Yeah, I'm on it! Okay, if I just pull Whoops! Wrong one! Not that one! Wait, wait! Go back two! Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! I mean, you are so busted! But, thank you! Took a few tries there! If I were thinking, I would've just pushed this ""fly"" button. Oh, it's that kind of fly! Whoa, that is so weird! We're in a space shuttle and the shuttle program ended years ago! I guess that's it. Fun's over. Au contraire. (On the contrary.) Sorbet? This is great! The best inator I've ever made! And you know what, Perry the Platypus? There's no self-destruct button on this, so there's no way you can stop me from taking over the entire Tri-Stateâ Huh. Well, like my Uncle Boris used to say, ""When life's goin' well, a giant tire comes along and smashes your inator."" We all thought he was crazy at the time, but now it seems rather prophetic. I don't get why this stuff is called ""sorbet""? Ain't it just a fancy people word for ""ice cream""? Where ice cream is made from dairy products and turned vigorously with air, sorbet is made entirely out of fancy people. Really? No, not really. Hey, guys! Is Candace around? Hey there, Jeremy! A little bird told me we were goin' to the rodeo! Actually, sir, it is pronounced ""ro-day-o"". Oh, yeah. My mistake. May I take your order, partner? I don't suppose it's ""Dress Like a Cowboy and Get Your Dinner Free"" night? No, madame. That is Tuesdays."
"But, you honor, how could I have robbed that bank if I was already wearing the prison jumpsuit? It just doesn't make anyâ Someday I wanna finish that dream so I can find out if I'm guilty or not. What?! VoilÃ ! Buford, what are you doing? Just trying out my new Tuff Shoo Laysizz! No, I mean what are you doing in our backyard so early? There are two things you should know about the Van Stomms. One, we always set our alarms on time, and two, if we don't, we show up early and take our lumps. We've even got a song about it. That's okay, I do not need to hear the song. Too late! (Song: Wake Up Better)  Well   Van Stomms wake up better   Than anyone else on Earth   It's because we have rules for sleeping   That we seemed to know at birth   Rule One is to set the alarm clock   To precisely the proper hour!  And make sure you've got time to eat breakfast, get dressed, brush your tooth, and maybe a shower   We're careful with our alarm clocks   We're not sloppy like those other chumps   'Cause Rule Two's if you mess up and set it too early, you show up and takes your lumps  Does that answer your question? Oh, yeah. That explains a lot. So that's why I got up early. What's your excuse? I'm just getting an early start on busting my brothers. You know, you should really find a new hobby. You've got no skills! Ha! I'd like to see you keep their contraptions from disappearing at the last second. Is that a challenge? Because you should know that we Van Stomms never back down from a challenge!  Well  Stop, stop, stop! I challenge you. Just as long as you don't sing about it. Her loss. The Van Stomm's Accept a Challenge song has a killer bridge. It goes to an F sharp minor in the key of G! Calling Agent P. Agent P. Wake-y, wake-y, Agent P. Over here. No, not on the computer screen. Though that would have made infinitely more sense. To the right. Down a bit. Over a bit more. That's right. Hi-oh. Carl installed a nano-screen on this trading card a few days ago, disguised as a Flynn-Fletcher family member. Can you guess which one? Can you take that off already, Carl? You're creeping me out, man. Okay Sorry to wake you up so early, Agent P, but evil never rests. And by evil, I mean Doofenshmirtz. It's not even 6 AM, and our surveillance cameras have spotted him at the local caffeination station, ordering the largest, most caffeinated beverage they sell. Nothing good can come from this hideous spurt of energy, so get to it, Agentâ Way to floss, Ferb! Who knew fighting plaque could be so much fun? Ooh! Sounds like your boys are on their way back. Get to it, Agent P! Come to think of it, I know what we're gonna do today, Ferb. Hey, where's Perry? That's strange. I know. We normally do this later in the day. Yes. Yes, we do. Sweet! With Buford as my busting stooge, now I can concentrate on more important things. It's time for ""Girls Freaking Out!"" Ooh, I love this show. It makes me feel so normal. Okay, Candace, I'm off to the beach. Vivian called and said the waves are crankin'. I'll have my cell with me. Oh, that's okay. I'm outsourcing today. Everything will still be here when you get back. Well, I certainly hope so. See you later, hon.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Gotcha! And you don't even know it yet. That's the beauty part. Watch this prolonged unnecessary series of events. Okay, w-watch this. Here it goes. Here it goes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah Yeah! Yes! Ha! I win! I know it's a little over the top, but I was inspired by this board game I love when I was a kid. Well, actually, it was Roger's board game. But I would sneak a peek of it, through the keyhole of his door. You know, it looked like I would love it. But, I borderline backstory. You see, I have so much evil energy from the soy venti latte extra-caf-and-a-half quadruple sugar, blood pressure bomberino. Love it! So, I spent the whole morning building this complex, giant version of the game. Really, I'm surprised you didn't see it flying in. Okay, beholding time! Behold, my Luffa-plex Dill Pickle-inator! What does it do, you ask? Well, it will launch all of my enemies into orbit, and keep them floating there so far into the atmosphere, that they won't bother me anymore. Cool, huh? Yeah, I know the name's a little weird. But hey, I bought it off the internet, and my rights to it expire tomorrow, so I was kinda forced to use it today. I have so much energy from just that one cup of coffee, I just keep rambling and ramblingâ Ooh. You know, that trap was always the lamest part of the game. I always thoughtâ Hey, Buford, you're here early. The early bully catches the nerd, my friends. Hello. And my point is made for me. Hi, guys. I am here also. What'cha doin'? Well, the inspiration for today's activity manifested as we performed our morning ablutions. I love it when Phineas uses unnecessarily long words for common things like brushing your teeth and washing up. Yes, it is gratifyingly erudite. It's not as cute when you do it. I am cognizant of that fact. Introducing the Dental-Hygienosphere. A thrill-packed adventure through the exciting and colossal world of dental hygiene. Now, who's with us? We! Me! Too preachy for my taste, but count me in, too. I'll help with the super structure. Ooh! I will spray on the enamel coating. And I'll sell ballooths. Balloons in the shape of a tooth. Oh, you mean toothalloons. Ballooths? Yeah, that's toothalloons. Where'd you get ballooths from? And I'll lock it all down, and make sure it doesn't move. All right, safety first, I guess. Knock yourself out. Let's see how the rookie's doing on his assignment. Hmm, not bad. I kinda like his style. Toothalloons! Get your toothalloons here! All right, everybody! All aboard the tooth-buggies. Ferb even installed dental floss-themed seat belts. Hmm, minty. Woo-hoo! Not so fast! I knew it! You're giving up and just going on the ride for fun. Not hardly. I swiped this bad boy from the orthodontist's section, to cut off stuff sticking out of the ride that could snag a passing plane as they go along. Listen, this thing getting snagged on a plane is just the tip of the bicuspid. It could shrink down to the size of a real tooth and get lost in the grass. Or turn to ice and melt into nothingness. For all you know it could turn into a giant Ducky Momo and fly away. Are you prepared for all that?  Well  I don't need to hear the We Prepare for Every Eventuality song. Fine! For the record though, it's the Be Prepared for Every Eventuality song. It's in the imperative tense. Wow, the periodontal level was awesome. Hang on to your retainers, everyone! As we travel through the pulp chamber, past the cementoenamel junction, and up, up up, to the apex of the crown. Yeah! Woo-hoo! You know, this is pretty tame compared to other rollercoasters, but when you compare it to other dental-themed rides, it is a rush! Now you see me, now you don't. Now you see me, now you don't. Hey, w-where'd ya go? I've got you now, Perry the Platypus. Ow! I've completely protected their invention from airplane snags, stray balloons, meteorites, flocks of wild gazelles, and giant cracks that form in the crust of the Earth. What if it turns into water? Covered. What if it turns into smoke? Covered. What if it space harpies descend from the sky and have it for breakfast? Aw, come on, really? Totally covered. Really? And how didâ I sprayed it with Space Harpy Repellent. Yeah, okay. Just make sure it's still here when I come back with my mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! If there's one thing us Van Stomms do, we make sure things are still there when people get back with their moms.  Well..  Hold still so I can hit you fair and square! Ow, really? Oh, man! Random green rays from the sky! I forgot about random green rays from the sky! Oh, no! Not on my watch. Oh, man! I've run out of conveniently placed objects. Bingo! Comin' through! My toothaloons! Yeah, they weren't sellin' anyway. Not on my watch! Ah, the helium tank! Actually, it's kind of ironic when you think about it. Not on my watch! Yes, the human shield tactic never fails. Huh? Man, I knew I should've hung on to that laser. Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Let us go again! Maybe not. I guess they ain't called Tuff Shoo Laysizz! for nothing. Prepare to be blitzed by my inexplicable, newfound martial arts mastery! I hate to ask, Perry the Platypus, but have you seen my otherâ Oh, there it is. Oh, yeah, that's what I was planning to do. Perry the Platypus, looks like this is the end for you. Just not nice! Well, I hope that lands in the backyard of a giant who needs a fake tooth. H-Hey did you say You know, I kind of like to sit back and relax after all that manual labour. Uh-oh. I've got a song about how Van Stomms fall from the sky too, but it doesn't end well. That was so much fun. Too bad, Buford missed it all. I wonder where he got to. Hello. Hey, Buford. Are those Tuff Shoo Laysizz! Yes. Yes, they are. Right over here, Mom. Ta-da! Hi, Mom! Hi, Candace! What are you guys up to? Buford, are you okay? Just putting my new laysizz through their paces. Okay, then. Then, I'm going inside. Who wants pie? Ah, yes! I do. I do! Yeah, me too. I always want pie. Buford, explain yourself!  Well  I'm out of here!  If we Van Stomms don't succeed on the very first try  Then, we just give up. Just in case anyone's wondering what happened to old Doofenshmirtz, I'm okay. Yeah, wellâ Okay, well, obviously not now."
"(My sweet ride!)   Forget all your worries   Forget all your cares   (My sweet ride!)   The sun's in myâ  Hey, Mom! Hey, Mrs. Flynn. Mom, why can't I get a car? Candace, you only have your learner's permit. Yeah, but eventually, I'm gonna have my license. I think we should be ready. Right In the meantime, have a cookie! That's hardly the same thing. Why are you dressed like that? Don't you remember? The Doo Wop Hop is tonight. All the neighborhood moms have volunteered to be carhops. Wow, Mrs. Flynn, I really like the wig helmet. Why, thank you, Jeremy. Safety first, you know. I don't know about you, but I'm gonna have another cookie. Aloha, cats! Oh, hey, guys. How are you doin'? Mellow like a cello and solid to boot, daddy-o. We're going to the Doo Wop Hop tonight, so we're dressed like they did in the fifties. You know, when everyone dressed like a sitcom from the seventies? Right, Ferb? Boys, have you seen my welder? Ferb and I were using it to put the finishing touches on his shades. Right, Ferb? Oh, yes, those are very hip. What have you been working on all night out there, Dad? It's a surprise for Candaceâ Oops! Uh Wait, this conversation suddenly interests me. What are you making me? Oh, Lawrence, sounds like you'd better tell her! Well, I wanted it to be a surprise, but I bought you a car! No way. Really, a car?! Oh, yes. It's the same car I had when I was a lad. I figured it would be ready when you were old enough. Uh, what do you mean, ""ready""? Well, uh, it's not fully restored, yet. You think? Hey, Mr. Fletcher, is that a Nedlington Nymph? Why, yes. Yes, it is! Jeremy, you have your license, don't you? You can take Candace for a ride in it when it's finished. Awesome. Ferb and I think it's cool, too. Ferb, tell them what you told me. Right? I'm living in Crazy Town. And Phineas and Ferb are town council. Hey! Where's Perry? What's shakin', bacon? Like the threads? Carl and I are going to cruise over to the Doo Wop Hop tonight. We're going incognito. Maybe do a little reconnaissance while I take in the car show. And he really just wants to spy on Monty to find out what kind of girl he's dating. Wrong! Wrong, Carl! We happen to know that Doofenshmirtz has entered a car in the competition. He must be up to something. And if I should happen to see who my son is dating, well, where's the harm in that? Hmm? Meanwhile, we need you to find out what the heck Doof is building, validate its evilness and destroy it. Good luck, Agent P, and see you later, crocodile.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Ah, sometimes evil just cracks me up. Say, where's that humming coming from?  Do-wah, do-wop, de-do-de-do-do   Do-wah  Vanessa? Is that you? Are you okay? What do you mean, Dad? Well, something's not right. The corners of your mouth are pointing up. Maybe you're running a fever. Relax, will you? I'm just looking forward to the fifties Doo Wop Hop tonight. So who are you going with? Oh, you know, just a friend. Speaking of friends, I think you have a little visitor. Ah, he can wait. So, what friend? Is it that girl with the dark hair who has all those dachshunds? No, it's a different friend. Wait, no, no! Don't open the door. You'll let in Perry the Platypus! You know he'll just blow the door down if you don't open it. Come in, Perry. Toodles! I'm worried about her, Perry the Platypus. Hey, you were going to blow down my door! Ugh. Oh, great. See, this is why I can't have anything nice. Anyway Come on, let me show you what I've been working on. You see, it all started when I was just a small boy back in Gimmelshtump. Friday was always cruise night, and everybody would come out to see the hipsters and their cool cars made from cannibalized parts left over from Drusselstein's many foreign occupations. But for me, the coolest car of all was the Boomshlaka 320-I, Ooh owned by my Uncle Simpkin. Yeah! You go, Uncle Simpkin! You show them how you're more masculine than everyone else. To me, he was the coolest guy on earth. Boo-yah! I saw it first! I saw it first! I saw it first! I saw it first! Unfortunately, the car had one major design flaw. The back bumper was a surplus dynamite plunger and the gas tank sat directly under the driver's seat. And I never saw him again. But I have been able to restore his car. A 1957 Drusselstein Boomshlaka 320-I! Ain't she a honey? I'm sure to win first prize with this and, here's the good part. Trapper cables! I needed to restrain you for this next part because it does get a little bit evil. Just to ensure there's no real competition, I built a little gadget called a Rust-inator. At the push of a button, it will reduce every other car into red dust! Or, rust. Wait. Red dust, rust. Red dust, rust. I wonder if that's where that word came from. I'm gonna go look up its entomology. Yeah, I looked it up. It turns out entomology is the study of insects. Go figure. Anyway Now, in you go. I'll just get in the normal way. How's it going down there? Cozy in your steel cables? Careful with the Rust-inator, Norm. We wouldn't want it to go off inadvertently. No problemo! Boy, Ferb. Dad was right. That muffler sure is making some weird noises. Oh, we'd best leave him be. Ferb, show me the model you've been working on. Were you able to add any extras? Wow, Candace is gonna love that! I mean, except for the exploding part. We should probably fix that. Hola, Candace! Ooh, don't you look lovely! Thank you, Mrs. Garcia-Shapiro. Jeremy will be along in a minute, honey. Is your mother ready? She'll be right out! All set! See you there, Candace. Okay, ladies, here I come! And there I go! Sorry! Can't stop! Follow me! Step on it, Vivian! She's getting away! Hey, Candace! Jeremy? My car broke down. Well, I guess we're riding our bikes to the car show. We can wow them with our irony. You guys are so awesome! You guys are so awesome! Wow, I never thought it'd turn out so beautiful! Right? How's the engine sound? You tell me. Dad did say you could drive it when it was finished. Hey, where is Dad anyway? Hmm. Well, last we saw him, he was working on the muffler. Out of my way, luge boy! Maybe he's already on his way to the hop. Okay, well, maybe we should get going. Hop in, everyone. We're going cruisin'! (Song: My Cruisin' Sweet Ride)  You're gonna love   You're gonna love just what this car can do   We tricked it out   We worked really hard just to trick it out for you   A simple push of a button changes the pattern and the hue   On your sweet ride   My sweet ride  Ooh, look! The visor's a vanity!  And the glove box has real hands!   Shoo-bop, shoo-bop   It steers itself, there's a trophy shelf   And it opens up your cans   And if you need a rocket engine, you'll be the envy of the whole gang   Shoo-bop, shoo-bop  My car has a turret that goes  Boom ba-ba-boom ba-bang-a-bang-bang   Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom ba-bang-a-bang-bang   We're gonna cruise   Cruising with our friends   (Ooh, oo-ooh)  Follow me, we're almost there!  Deploy the chutes!  Let's deploy the chutes, Ferb!  There's romance in the air!   There's nothing I'd rather do   Than take a moonlight drive with you   In your sweet ride   My sweet ride!  Yeah! Ha! This is gonna be a piece of cake. Holy mackerel! I rule! I don't get it, what's the joke? Why is everyone laughing? I can't find Monty. Get up on my shoulders, Carl. See if you can see him. You're not gonna drop me again, are you? Just do it, Carl! And watch the hair. Take these. Now what do you see? There he is! And he's withâ Oh, no. W-Whatâ Carl, what do you see? Someone who owes me big time. They dare to laugh at the Drusselstein Boomshlaka 320-I? Well, we'll just see who has the last laugh. Norm, fire up the Rust-inator! Firing away, sir. Now, how do I set the coordinates? Hmm. Thank you, Perry the Platypus. Very sporting of you. Uh-oh. Well, thank goodness for the plastic gas tank. Hey! Vanessa? Is that you? Hi, Dad. Wait a minute. Who's that boy you're with? He looks vaguely familiar. Say, isn't thatâ Uncle Simpkin? He's looking well. Up next is a late entry. Wow, I don't believe it! Look at this, folks! Is that a Nedlington Nymph? Yes. Yes, it is! And who did this amazing restoration? Well, my dad's been working on it for a while, andâ Oh. Here he is. Hmm? Ooh, oh-ho! Look at that, folks. Working on it up to the last second! I was? Well, I think I speak for all the judges when I say the Nedlington Nymph wins Best in Show! What an honor! Here, Candace. It is your car, after all. A one-of-a-kind car for a one-of-a-kind girl. Aw, you guys Oh, dear, you're rolling away! This really goes to you, you know. Cool! You were right, Ferb. It really did need a trophy shelf. Oh! There you are, Perry. My car has a turret that goes  Boom ba-ba-boom ba-bang-a-bang-bang   Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom ba-bang-a-bang-bang   We're gonna cruise   Cruising with our friends   (Ooh, oo-ooh)  Follow me, we're almost there!  Deploy the chutes!  Let's deploy the chutes, Ferb!  There's romance in the air!   There's nothing I'd rather do   Than take a moonlight drive with you   In your sweet ride   My sweet ride!"
"No, no, no! I-I've been good! Don't put me in your gundersack! Not the gundersack! No! The Kinderlumper! That's it! The Kinderlumper! So, what do you think? I think you look like you just fell off a turnip truck, and then got run over by a rutabaga truck. Yeah, yeah, real funny. This is the official rutabaga regalia for the 100th Running of the Chinchillas from Danville to Badgertown. By wearing this, it will entice the chinchillas to follow me, the Princess! So yeah, I get it. It's a huge honor and everything, but come on, Candace. Why do you really want to be Rutabaga Princess? I get to start the Running of the Chinchillas! Yeah Mom and Dad, and everyone in Danville will be waiting in Badgertown to see me cross the finish line! Yeah I get to be on TV! That's the reason! Stacy, this could be the first step on my way to stardom. And as my best friend, you'll be famous by association. That's my favorite kind of famous! Candace! What is it, Phineas? Look at the cool vehicles we made for you for the Running of the Chinchillas! Baljeet has grown a new super-street of bio-engineer rutabaga! I simply spliced the genetic code of a rutabaga and a giant redwood. And? And fennel. I want it to smell like licorice! You're not getting me into one of those things! I'm not showin' up for my TV debut lookin' like a complete weirdo! What? I said, ""complete"". And now, I must leave. My public awaits. Yeah, and I must go be famous by association. And to think, we knew Stacy before she was famous by association.  Doo bee doo bee dooâ  Dah! I'm supposed to be in Badgertown! Morning, Agent P. I was just doing a little handicapping for this year's Running of the Chinchillas. I think I'm going to box Dryer's Dust with Squeaky Toy. And I'm taking Gerbil Bait to win. You're daft, Carl! Anyway, word has it that Doofenshmirtz plans to attend the ceremony. The odds are he's up to something evil. Better look into it, Agent P. Hmm Gerbil Bait. Heh, talk about your long shots. Dangit, Carl! Good morning, everyone. I'm Mike van Hatofapilgrim here in Danville for the 100th Annual Running of the Chinchillas, and with us today is this year's Rutabaga Princess. And what's your name, young lady? I'm Candace Flynn. And I'm famous by association! That's great. Well, there you have it. A good day for rutabagas, chinchillas, and self-promoting sycophantism. Citizens of Danville, it is now time for your princess, me Citizens of Danville, it is now time for your princess, me to start the Running of the Chinchillas! I now summon my tuber troubadour! I will now play the traditional chinchilla fanfare. What? Butâ Wait. Huh? I see. Not a music lover. My Princess? I will now take a bite of the ceremonial rutabaga. And now I most humbly take my leave, Princess. Yeah, you do that, Sputnik. Chinchillas, let the running begin! Well, there they go! And now, the Running of the Chinchillas is underway! And now, back to you in the studio. There's no one in the studio. It's Sunday. Really? How am I supposed to do a live broadcast when no one is in the studio? We're not live, we're taping this. Fine. Candace, here, let me get your train. Oh, oh, my gosh, sorry! I don't know, Stacy. This is harder than I thought. Oh, sorry! Maybe if we ran in front of them, it'd be a little easier. Okay, now onward to Badgertown! Oh! Oh, my gosh, sorry! That should do it. Excellent. Perry the Platypus? Oh. Sorry you had to see that, it's just that It's one button. Anyway, you are just in time to witness as I activate the Kinderlumper-inator and transform myself into a real live Kinderlumper! What? Don't tell me you've never heard of the Kinderlumper. You know, a gigantic troll with sharp teeth and nose like a broom handle, he grabs children, puts them in a gundersack if theyâ You never heard of this? My mother used to sing me this lovely song about it right before I went to bed. And it goes a little something like this. (Song: Der Kinderlumper)  The Kinderlumper's probably gonna get ya   'Cause you've only ever been an awful kid   Pretty soon he's gonna come and catch ya   Then everyone will know just what you did   Because   If you make some bubbles in the bathtub   If you've got saliva in your mouth   If you ever feel the need to blink your eyeballs   If he finds you breathing in and out   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya   If you ever drink a glass of water   If you turn your head just slightly to the right   If you ever feel the need to use the bathroom   Then the Kinderlumper's gonna strike tonight!   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya!   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya!   He's gonna get you good!   The Kinderlumper's gonna get ya!  So anyway, I got this actual-sized Kinderlumper costume and I'm gonna shoot myself with the Kinderlumper-inator to make me gigantic and trollish so, you know, it will fit. Then, I will go scare my brother, Roger, so badly that he is certain to relinquish control of the Tri-State Area to me! Well, to the Kinderlumper, actually, but when the ray wears off, I'll be me again and I'll already be in control. Stand back, Perry the Platypus. Prepare to do some beholding! Oh! Knock it off, you crazy platyâ It worked! You know, Stacy? This is fun. I could get used to this princess thing. Did you see that? Call in Chopper 4! This is the biggest story of my career! Let's get some! Oh, why did I ever opt for work release? Seriously, Perry the Platypus, was it really necessary to destroy everything? N-Now, t-that's a good trollish gigantic platypus. Ha! Let that be a lesson to you! Never stand on a big cartoony ""X""! And now, I've a little appointment to keep with the Mayor. Everyone have your signs and foam fingers ready to cheer Candace on? Ready! Ready! Buford, you ripped your finger off! Yeah! What about it?! Nothing. Phineas, Phineas, Phineas! And Ferb! You have to help us! We're being chased by monster-sized chinchillas! Monster-sized chinchillas? That's awesome! Here they come! This is amazing! I've never been in a helicopter before! They're gaining on us! And can't this thing go any faster?! I got the fennel pedal all the way to the rutabaga metal! And yes, I know it's a weird sentence. I can't outrun them! Phineas! Isabella! Oh, no! Phineas and Ferb! Oh, those poor innocent kids. I can't watch. It's justâ I-It's justâ I'm gonna step outside where I canâ Whoa! Did you see that?! I almost stepped out of the helicopter! Did you see that? Save yourself, Princess! Run! Run! Run! Run! The chinchillas should be here any minute, Mr. Mayor. Well, I hope they don't ask me to eat any rutabagas like last year. I think we can avoidâ What is that?! I think I know this guy. There's nothing to be afraid of! It's only the Kinderlumper, come to join our celebration! Now, it's a party! I, uh I believe the more appropriate response would be to flee in terror? But, Kinderlumper, why would I ever run away from you? Don't you remember the Kinderlumper song? Remember? Of course I remember! Mother used to sing me the song every night.  The Kinderlumper's always going to love you   And bring you lots of presents while you sleep  N-No, wait! Those are not the words! That's how she sang it to me. And I still have some of the gifts you brought me. Look! Almond brittle! No! Butâ But you don't even like almond brittle! I know. That's why I never ate it. No! Funny, I never thought of the Kinderlumper as such a crybaby. No, it's not fair! Oh, no, the effects are wearing off! Run for your lives! They're coming! The chinchillas! It's too late for me! Save yourselves! Ooh! Ooh. Ooh! Ooh. No, no, no. Stop, stop. Were you this dramatic when you were Rutabaga Princess? Oh, yeah. Stop it! Seriously! Candace, that was so exciting! You're the best Rutabaga Princess yet! Phineas! I thought you were stampeded! We were! It didn't hurt. They were big but they were still fluffy. It's like being run over by cotton candy. But less sticky. That was amazing! We got it all on camera! Wait, really? Did you get Phineas and Ferb and the rutabaga vehicles? Yup. The whole thing! Where's the camera? Oh, it's right over there. No! The biggest story of my career, and it just flew away! Welcome to my world, Mike. Welcome to my world. Oh, there you are, Perry. Get over here, you hairy little beast!"
"Perry!  Hey, you can't do that! Hey, the same thing, but in French! You're out of your jurisdiction, buddy. I'll take it from here, eh? Coming through! Well, there's no catching up to them now. Agent P, we've just received word you're on Canadian soil. We don't have jurisdiction there. Stand down! That's an order! Sorry, Agent P, our hands are tied. Carl, don't interrupt me. Return to Headquarters pronto. Sorry. Good morning, Perry. Ready to start another fun day? Good morning, Perry. Hi, Perry. How are you? Okay, Mom, if you go out into the yard today, and there's nothing there, I'll I'll clean the bathroom. Candace, you were supposed to do that, anyway. So, we have a deal? So what you're sayin' is that it advocates a mixed economy, with significant roles are played by the private sector, and the government? No, it Actually, yes. That is what I was saying. Hey, Perry. Good morning, Perry. What'cha doin'? Agent P, Doofenshmirtz was last seen boarding a train transporting Precious Albert the Moose. Cue the graphic, Carl. Albert the Moose is Canada's prized animal, who represents the unity of the provinces. We need you to make sure that Doof keeps his mitts off that moose. If you fail, the Canada Day celebrations will be ruined, and Canada will break into civil war. Or, since it's Canada, it would be a civil conversation where secession would be the topic of discussion, andâ Carl? Antlers? Sorry, sir. Now, this train runs along the border between the United States and Canada, so you only have jurisdiction on the American side of the train. To help you out on the Canadian side of the train, you'll be teaming up with an Agent from COWCA, the Canadian Organization Without a Cool Acronym, Agent Lyla. You may remember her from that special assignment for our Seattle Bureau we sent you on a couple of months ago. I know that didn't go too well but I expect you to be a professional and put that all behind you. So, get out there and good luck! Carl, can Iâ Can I have those antlers back? Sure, sir. Oh, yeah! I'm rockin' this look! Woo-hoo! Ah, Agent P, we meet again. Aw, look at that face. I know, you work alone. But you'll see, Mr. ""I-can-do-it-all-by-myself"". Having someone to watch your back might be just what you need there. Hey, where are you going? Ah, Perry the Platypus, what an unexpected surprâ Oh, wait, wait, wait! You're trapped by societal convention. You're trapped by societal convention. Look, we're in a fine dinning environment, everyone knows not to throw a scene in a fancy restaurant. That's right. You're trapped. Sit down. Oh, shoot! I see we're trapped by societal convention. Agent Lyla from COWCA? Is this an international team-up? Oh, you must hate that, Perry the Platypus. A loner like you? Oh, come on, he's warming up to the idea. Yes, obviously. Why are you causing trouble in Canada, Doofenshmirtz? Well, you see, I'm part of a USâCanada evil scheme exchange program. I come up with a scheme, and this other Canadian guy comes up with a scheme, andâ And we switch! I do his scheme and he does mine. You gonna eat those fries? Don't touch! Anyway, I've got a little math quiz for the both of you. If a train carrying Precious Albert the Moose left British Columbia at eight o'clock in the morning going eighty miles per hour, what time would it arrive at the Canada Day celebration? Answer? Never! Because I've tied up the conductor and taken control of the train using my remote control Train-Operator-inator! Right now, we are all headed to my scheme exchange partner's secret fortress. Hey, cut it out, those are mine! Serâ Seriously, I can get the waiter over here if you wanna order your own, but please? This evil exchange partner of yours, what's his name? I think his name was Sir Railing, or Doctor Stairway, or something. Professor Bannister! Of course, my archnemesis. Can I put some gravy on those? Seriously, leave my lunch alone. Anyway, after Professor Bannister gets the moose, it's going to ruin Canada Day, or you know, whatever. Crazy, right? You know what's really crazy? How good these fries are. I am not kidding, leave those alone. I-I just don't understand it, why would you take my lunch, when you're in the dining car, you can have your own lunch. Oh, it makes me crazy when people pick at my food. Seriously, why is your hand out like that? Youâ I'm seriously going to lose it. I-I'mâ Oh, now you're both doing it? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Oh, no, not even taking them, but squishâ I can't take it. Waitâ Get your own lunch! That man is causing such a scene in here, it makes me feel free to break up with you in a very loud manner! I can't stand being a waiter! Very clever. You've completely dismantled my societal convention trap. Let's get that inator! It's pronounced ""inator""! You did that on purpose! All right, Doofenshmirtz, end of the line! Oh, train metaphors, so that's how itâ I've got it! Ow! Oh! Mine! Oh, here, let meâ Iâ I know how to use it. Seriously, just give meâ You know, I think I'm with Perry the Platypus on this, I don't like seeing him teamed up either. I don't know, I think he's warming up to it. Wait, P! That's the Canadian side of the train! Ow! You know, I think I""m going back to the Canadian side. I've got this. Oh, no, you don't, I'm on the American side now, you can't touch me. Oh. Canada. Oh. 'Merica. Ow! Oh, it's on now. Ha, take that! This is for William Hull and the War of 1812! Look it up, kids! I've got him P, cuff him. Hold it, hold it. Ooh, sorry. Where is he? Open up, big guy. Occupied. Oh. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize you had to, uh.. You know what they have in here, theyâ They have those tiny soaps. They make my hands look so big, it's like I'm a giant. All set! I can't believe it! He left the seat up! I'm up here, Perry the Platypus! You knew we'd end up up here eventually, right? P? Wait up! He's getting away! Perry! Hey! Help me up! Give me a hand! Oops, sorry. My bad, eh? Hey, look! An old-timey handcar! I've got an idea. Come on! P, what are you doing? This is a handcar, there's a trick to it! Look, if we're going to catch the train, we're going to have to work together. We've gotta get in sync, develop a rhythm. Watch, I'll show you. (Song: Handcar)  Yours goes up when mine goes down   And then we do it the other way around   Don't you give me that sigh, 'cause if we can't see eye to eye   Then our missions will be always filled with strife   'Cause a handcar is a metaphor for life   For life  Don't push up, just push down. I'll push down on my side. That's it! That's right. Here we go! Ah, I see a little platypus smile there! That's right! Now we're cookin' with gas! See, it's better when we work together!  We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   Yeah, we're gettin' in the groove   We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   It's the only way to move   We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   We're like a well-oiled machine   We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   Yeah, we're workin' like a team   We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   We're a real double-header   It's a heavy-handed metaphor for how we work together!   It's a handcar!   (Handcar!)   Yeah, we're on a handcar!   (Handcar!)   We're on a handcar   (Handcar!)   Yeah, we're on a handcar!  Excuse me, conductor? You know, the train doesn't seem to be stopping at any of the scheduled stations. Is that a fact? My apologies, straphanger. Wait, which one was your stop? The next one. Oh, don't be concerned, step right this way. So, your wife's cooking dinner tonight? Oh, yes. We're having asparagus tips. Asparagus tips, very classy. What's the entrÃ©e? Nova Scotia salmon. Hmm-mm. Delish! Well, here's your station! Say hi to your wife for me. Well, someone's home early. The conductor says hi. Hey, fellow commuters, look! It's a lady! And a platypus. On a handcar.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  My cellphone alert says there's a new platypus video online that's trending. Perry the Platypus! And Agent Lyla? On an old-timeyâ Oh! Ha! Bet you can't do that. I learned that in the 80's. I also learned how to back away slowly on a newly installed escape platform! So long, suckers! And now, to watch my evil plan play out from the observatâ Thisâ This is an observation deck? Chairs nailed to a roof? You're blocking my view of Saskatchewan, eh? Saskatchewan is that way, you dolt! Hold it right there, Doofenshmirtz! No, you hold it right there. Because I still have this! The Train-Operator-inator! Without it, the train would be completely Oh, boy. out of control. Hey, where's Perry? All right, so I'm on a runaway train in a tunnel. Afraid of the dark, I probably also afraid of runaway trains, never really given it much thought. Doesn't come up thatâ Okay, let's focus. There's got to be an emergency brake in the engine car. Let's go! Oh, so, uh So, I-I guess I'll go with you then. Wait up, Perry the Platypus, my shoe's untied. Just hang on a second. You can't be too careful when you're running across a moving train. There we go. Oh, wait, wait, on second thought, I-I'll double knot this puppy. Okay, let's go! Oh, gross! Some joker left the seat up. Would you guys mind bringing me some paper towels, or something? Iâ Is that a no? The emergency brake is toast. I'm gonna have to jury-rig the controls. Darn it! If we weren't in the middle of a runaway train crisis, I would totally be giving you a hard time about leaving me in the toilet bowl. Now let me just get the red wire Bingo! Uh, not to burst your bubble, but I don't think we're slowing down. We're not. I just got the hazard lights working. Safety first. The brakes were too far gone to fix. Now we just need to get all the passengers and Precious Albert the Moose into the same car, and we can save them. You're right! The caboose! Let's go! This is why I'd rather not make friends. They find someone else, and bam, you're alone. Attention passengers, there is no need to panic, butâ Pardon the interruption, Precious Albert, Sir, but your tea is ready. Folks, everything is under control, eh? We're gonna separate the caboose from the rest of the train. Oh, you already did it. Nice going, partner. I'm gonna take a pic of this and send it to COWCA. We're saved! We did it! Wait, I-I swear that wasn't me. Bannister! I should've known. You think what I'm thinking? Aw, man, I never have a grappling hook when I need one. And I totally looked at mine this morning when I was getting dressed. Right there on the dresser. I hate it when that happens. Well, well, well. If it isn't COWCA's best agent, the unfortunately named, Lyla Lolliberry. Listen you, I come from a long alliterative line of Lolliberrys. And now you're trapped, miles above solid ground, with nothing but a beaver at your side. He's a platypus, not a beaver. Hi-ya, Banny! Pardon me, official exchange buddy coming through. Yo, bro. Back so soon? My evil plan usually takes all day. How'd you do it so fast? Well, I'll tell you. It went a little something like this. Well, I guess if you've got no one to monologue to Enough backstory. Actually, that's not, uh That's not really a backstory, it's just expositional flashback. It doesn't uh, have any childhood trauma. It doesn't really form who he is. It's notâ It's just flashback, there's a difference. It's subtle, but there's a difference. Anyway, you're not the only productive one. I've taken care of your moose problem. Perfect! No Albert the Moose, no Canada Day. And you call yourself a Canadian! Do I? You think that just because I'm polite, smell like pine needles, and overemphasize my T's, I'm Canadian? Well, you'd be wrong! Because I'm from Greenland! Cool flag. Thanks. Wait! No, it's not! And that's the problem! We have no national pride! I mean, listen to this. Greenland's national anthem. Seriously! Does that inspire you to do anything other than ice-fish? But, Canada? Oh, they've got it all. The maple syrup, the national parks, the medal winning curling team. And the moose. The moose! The symbol of Canada's national pride! Precious Albert the Moose! And what if he were to disappear? Everyone would lapse into a deep malaise. Forgetting what it means to be Canadian. I will then annex Canada to Greenland! Bring back Precious Albert, and reinvigorate the national pride! And I've written a new national anthem.  Oh, Greenland  (Song: Greenland National Anthem)  Home of things that aren't so green   Though we call it Greenland   Shiny Greenland   People are very short there   In Greenland  You're from Greenland? Do you know the punishment for misrepresenting you country of origin to the L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N. Organization? Plus, your scheme is unnecessarily complicated and doesn't even seem like it would work! And that's coming from me! It's the perfect plan! Yes, it will. See, he agrees. Will you stop it? Who is he talking to? Oh, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce Me-Positive and Me-Negative! They're two magnetic robots I created for the purpose of vanquishing my enemies! Magnetic robots? Yes, because it's all about polarity! You can't have two positives or two negatives. Oh, you can have two negatives, justâ Just look at my family. Wait a second. Those robot parts look familiar. Oh, right. I got them from some friends of mine. I think you may have met in Seattle? Wow, those guys have been playing cards really quietly. I remember them. But I knew they would lead me to you, Bannister. That's why I let them escape. Never mind them. Me-Positive and Me-Negative can take care of you. Oh, I get it, we're gonna have an old-fashioned helicopter fight. Oh, a helicopter fight? These can get really nasty. I'mâ I'm just gonna go play cards. (Song Helicopter Fight)  If you're looking for action, better hold on tight   (Helicopter fight, helicopter fight)   L-L-L-looks like we got ourselves a helicopter fight   (Helicopter fight, helicopter fight)   To remove any confusion from ambiguous writing   (Helicopter fight, helicopter fight)   This is people fighting on a helicopter, not two helicopters fighting   (Oh!)   Though that would have been cool   (Oh, yeah?)   It might have been more exciting   (Oh, you think?)   Let's take a look!   No, that looked better in my head   Let's just get back to the action   That was really pretty lame   I apologize for the distraction   This is a helicopter fight!   (People fighting on a helicopter)   This is a helicopter fight!  I win!  (People fighting on a helicopter)   This is a helicopter fight!   (It's not two helicopters fighting, oh, no)   (We saw it, but it was only so-so)   This is people fighting on a helicopter!  What? I have just one thing to say to you, Lyla Loliberry. FarvÃ¤l! What does farvÃ¤l mean? It's Swedish for goodbye. It's one of the languages we speak in Greenland! Jinx you, Lyla Lolliberry! Jinx you! Way to text in the cavalry. Okay, let's get this bird off to Canada Day. We have a guest of honor to deliver. Go Canada! Go, eh? Way to go, Constitution Act of 1864! Right on! Woo! So, now you see why I had to let those guys go, right, P? Well, how was he supposed to know you had a tracker on their truck? He understands how these things are. One minute you're catching a thief, the next you get intel they might be leading you somewhere bigger and better. Oh, and by ""bigger and better"", you obviously mean me, right? Right? Yeah, right. Uh, anyway You've got some serious skills there, P. Oh, stop, you're making me blush. Good work to the both of you. I can see that things went well with our neighbors to the North. Well, now that our mission is done Our mission? maybe we could drop by Niagara Falls. It's so close by, and I've always wanted to see it. Well, I suppose we could swing by on our way back. I wonder how my scheme worked out for Professor Bannister. I'm sure that Cloud Magnitizer-inator was a winner. Mom, Mom, Mom! Hey, Perry. Mom, Mom, Mom! How was it that a cloud was able to carry off our metal superstructure? But, but, but Someone's got a bathroom to clean. Everyone else, there's pie. Oh, there you are, Perry. Ah, a platypus's life is a life of leisure. Yes. Yes, it is. We'd like to apologize on behalf of the show for poking a little fun at Greenland. The Greenland flag is actually verifiably cool. It was designed by Thue Christiansen as part of a flag-designing contest in the 80's Is this actually true, Carl? According to the internet, sir. Well, what do you know? Also we understand that the people of Greenland do have enormous national pride, and are not necessarily short. This was all purely in the interest of comedy and not meant to be taken seriously. Go Greenland!"
"Psst! Agent P! I'm in here! Sorry for the break-in protocol, but this is urgent. Show him the photo, Carl. Yes, sir. Here, Agent P. Notice anything unusual, Agent P? Look closely, it's very subtle. Here, use this. Check out that small cluster of clouds. It spells ""Doof""! And ""Doof"" is short for Doofenshmirtz! That cloud is directly above the Danville Botanical Gardens! Two hundred acres of ecologically diverse natural area. We need you to get out there and find out what Doof is doofing! We need you to get out there and find out what Doof is doofing! Here, take my membership card. You get free parking and you get 15% off at the gift shop. Sir, it says ""non-transferrable"" right at the bottom! Oh, Carl, they never look at the photo. Anyway, get out there, Agent P, and good luck! And make sure you stop and smell the roses! Well He never stops to smell the roses. I know, sir. In fact, it was the ancient Tunisians who actually developed many of the techniques still used today. Wow, Buford. I didn't realize the wedgie had such a rich history. Help! Help, Phineas and Ferb, and to a lesser extent, Buford! I am having an existential emergency! I find myself incapable of making decisions! Is that a fact? You'd better sit down. Okay. Come to think of it, maybe your point would be better made standing up. You are right! But, then again, you look kind of tired. You are right. I'd betterâ Cut it out! How did you get in such a state, Baljeet? Well, I was filling out my college early admission's forms, and Iâ Whoa, Baljeet! College is, like, nine years away! I said ""early"". Anyway, under personal preferences, I could not decide whether to select loop or string theory. I was paralyzed with indecision! Oh, come on, that's easy! Loop! No, string! Noâ Oh. Right? Then I started thinking about how important it is to make the right decision on everything! You see, every choice carries with it its own potential timeline. So, every decision I make effectively nullifies the possible future! I cannot even choose which flavor of ice-cream to order. If I choose vanilla, that may set me on the path to the presidency. But if I have strawberry, I could get hit by a bus! Well, it's simple then. Just don't choose the strawberry. You are missing the point! I do not know that if I chose strawberry I would get hit by a bus, I am just saying that every decision we make has unforeseen repercussions! Actually, ice-cream sounds pretty good. Yeah, it does! If it is okay with you, I have prepared a little presentation to illustrate my point. (Song: Improbably Knot)  Don't know which choice to choose when people ask   Not sure which task to take, or take to task   I don't know which is best, or which is bad   I'm like a question mark, or hanging chad   Even doing nothing is still a choice like I must make   I'm paralyzed by fear that it will all become a big mistake   Everything is probable, nothing is impossible   Choices left to random chance are highly irresponsible  March, my little off-the-shelf 3-D package robots!  Everything is probable, nothing is impossible   Choices left to random chance are highly irresponsible  I do not know what to choose! I do not want to lose!  Everything is probable, nothing is impossible  I am sorry, everyone. It sounded a lot better in my head. Exactly what time did you get up this morning? What if you could make both choices? Would that make you feel better? Yes! And no. I mean, I do not know! Ferb, I know what we'reâ Wait, let me interrupt you! Where's Perry? Wow, I had no idea that smoke signals was so complicated! Perry the Platypus, whatâ Excuse me, you are in clear violation of the garden rules! Docents. So, uh, what seems to be the problem, ladies? You are showing blatant disregard for our signage! It's all good, ladies. I am a card-carrying Danville Botanical Gardens club member. See? Here's my card! And I'm carrying it! Then you should know better, Mr. Doofenshmirtz. Oof! It's notâ It's Dr. Doofenshmirtz, okâ Okay, bye! See how cool I was with them, huh? So, Perry the Platypus, I'll bet you're wondering why I haven't trapped you yet. It's because I've hired someone else to do it for me! Perry the Platypus, meet platypus hunter, Liam O'Cracken! I found him on an evil consultant website. Semi-aquatic egg-laying mammals, I can't stand the sight of 'em. And I'll tell you why. D'you mind? No, you know what? Why don't you do the backstory today? Back in Australia, I had a good life, but platypuses ruined everything. You see When I was young Aww, does he like his boomerang, does he? Oh, my, look at the cute little platypus! Hello, there, little fella! Hold still! That's right. Say musk lily! Say musk lily! And I never saw me mum again. It was on that day that I swore revenge on platypuses. Platypuses? No, no, I know, it sounds wrong, but it's actually right. I always thought it was platypi. That's also acceptable. They're vile creatures, not to be trusted the only mammal with poisonous ankle barbs. You have a poisonous ankle barb? How come I never knew that? But now, I'm prepared. I even have my own poisonous ankle barbs. And a little somethin' else up my sleeve. I'd like you to meet the ladies. This here is Nancy, Barbara, Jill, Lauren In all fairness, Perry the Platypus, there was nothing in his profile about, you know, naming his boomerangs. Even I find that a little creepy. Scheherezade. Hey, Phineas! What'cha doin'? You're just in time, Isabella! In order to help Baljeet with his decision-making crisis, we've built the infinite probability generator. Once Baljeet's been through the machine's infinite imprinter, he'll be fundamentally altered at the probable level. Then, anytime he comes to a place where he has to make a choice, he'll split into two probability Baljeets. Allowing him to explore the consequences of both timelines? Exactly, Isabella! Hit it, Ferb! I love it when you guys tamper with the forces of nature. I know, right? Is science happening yet? I am feeling nauseated! Yeah, that sounds like science to me. Oh, this is so bustable. All right, Ferb, let's get him outta there! Now, how're you feeling, Baljeet? Effervescent and frothy. Just like my Ma's homemade toothpaste! Come on, buddy, get up! How come he ain't split in two yet? Because he hasn't made a choice yet. Oh, boy! It's the ice-cream guy! Oh, I thought it was someone's phone. Come on, Baljeet! Let's see if the infinite probability generator worked! Howdy, Mike! My good friend, Baljeet here would like to sample your fine frozen confections. All right, Baljeet, what flavor? Vanilla or strawberry? Carpe diem, Baljeet. Carpe diem! One vanilla and one strawberry! Weird. Hey, I also have banana splits! Good one, Mike. Here you go. Vanilla and strawberry. Now, I am beside myself. And I like it! That's very clever, Second Baljeet. This is great! Now that I have made both choices, I will no longer miss any oppâ What do you know? I was right! Wow, tough break. Yes. But, that means I am going to become President! Carl? Carl, where are you? I'm over here, sir! How did you get over there? I was coming to see you! Why are you over there? I'm trying to get out of here! What are you trying to do? Well, I was looking for you so we could leave together! Oh, for Pete's sake. Danni Oh, and this shiny girl came all the way from Greece. I call herâ What the blazes?! See, I told you he was good! Now, about your refund policy That hat don't make you special. You're still a platypus. I'm gonna make you eat those words or that noise. You and your hat are gonna make a fine addition to my trophy room. Trophy room? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on a second, I just hired you to trap Perry the Platypus, notâ Consider me off the clock, Doc. Hello? What is this? Is this a hammock? If it's a hammock, it's way too tight. Hello? Mr. McCraken, I think you caught me by mistake! No mistake there, Doc. You're either with me, or you're against me. Come to think of it, I don't have a pharmacist on my trophy wall yet. Come to think of it, I don't have a pharmacist on my trophy wall yet. Wait, wait, whâ What do you mean, ""yet""? I give you sixty seconds head-start before the hunt commences. I-I don't even know what you're talking about. Who's this platypus? Why am I handcuffed to him? Where is Perry the Platypus? So to recap in order of importance, why am I handcuffed to him? So, to make it easier to hunt the both of youse. Now, run. Okay, fair enough. Whoa! Wow! You know, I really shouldn't have ignored the 97% of customer feedback that says he tends to go rogue. So, okayâ I guess we should introduce ourselves. My name is Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz and you being a platypus, you can't talk to tell me your Youâ You know what, I'm just gonna call you Steven. Is that all right? You look like a Steven to me. Bacon! What luck! I-I have really worked up an appetite with all this eluding. Whoa, it was a trap?! I did not see that coming! All right, Nancy. Don't hold anything back, love. What took you so long? All right, you two. Let's get somethin' straight here. There'll be no messin' with the Buford. Don't make no diff how many of you there are! Buford, I would never mess with you! Neither would I! That's good, 'cause I've still got your number! Or would that be ""numbers""? I don't know. Hey, Baljeet, which one would be grammatically correctâ Huh? How rude. Finally getting around to spring-cleaning in the summer. First up, the fridge. Mom, look at this! Look what Phineas and Ferb did! Hello, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher. Oh, hello, Baljeet. How's your mom doing? Oh, she is doing well! That's good. That's nice. Would you like a snack? Something to drink if you have it. Let's see. I've got some grape juice or orange juice. I would like grape juice. And orange juice! Mom! My, someone's thirsty. Oh, there's more juice down here. Let's see, I've got pineapple, mango and tomato. Pineapple! Mango! Tomato! Okay, Baljeet. You weren't kidding, you really were thirsty! Mom! I think we lost him. You can slow down now. I just said ""slow down"", I didn't say ""stop"". What are you looking at? Oh, no, we are not goingâ That's cold! Wow, you're like a little motorboat there, Steven. Wow, Steven, that was sweet! You're really good at thatâ That barb thing. What? Why are you turning around? Don't go back that way, that put-me-on-the trophy-wall guy is back there. Oh, I see, a waterfall. Just in time for commercial, isn't that convenient? What's that all about, anyway? It's not a cliff-faller, it's called a cliffhanger. Here we are, falling, andâ Watch, watch, watch. H-Here we go. Wait. Yup, yup, see? There you go! Fading to black! I know you're down there, you platypus. And I'm gonna find ya. Hey! Hang on there, Steven. I'm tired of running. And I don't mean tired like, I need to sit down for a while. I-I mean, although I am tired and I do need to sit down for aâ But, I meanâ I'm fed up with that guy! And with your animal instincts and my vast knowledge of science, I think we can make a stand. W-What do you say? Are you with me? Groovy! I wonder if the others would like some juice. We should take some out to them! What about Buford? Indeed, what about Buford? What has he ever done for us? You mean to us! Yeah, he can get his own juice! Yeah! The jerk! Oh, hello, boys! Are we having a party, Baljeet? And Baljeet and Wait a moment. If he's Baljeet, then you must be Baljeet! Oh, all right then, carry on! So, we all agree. No juice for Buford. Yeah, no juice for Buford. Come on! Now, what's all this, then? All right, Jill, something's not right. Be a love and have a look around. Jill? Jill? Where are ya? Ah, there you are. I thought maybe you'd taken off from me. What the blazes? Oof! Yeah! We did it, Steven! High five! Ha! So you think you've bested old Liam and his ladies? Sue begs to differ. I call this one Sharpay. 'Cause she's sharp, eh? Ugh! Oh, it's all right, Sharpay, I'll give you another chance. Whoa! That's my girl. Ooh, ow! Steven! Help! This looks like a job for Natasha! Okay, Mom, I'm going to replicate the anomaly right in front of you. Fine. What is it, Candace? Look closely. How many Baljeets do you see standing here? One, Candace. There is only one Baljeet, after all. Why, thank you, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher! That is very kind of you to say. She's talking numbers, kid. Don't get a big head. Okay, Mom. Now watch what happens when he has to make a choice. Baljeet, would you like some grapes, or this chocolate bar? Grapes, please. That's really great, Candace. Now I gotta get back to the fridge. I don't get it, what happened? I just really wanted grapes! Ugh! There's no sign of him. Well, Doc, it looks like it's just you andâ Oh! What the blazes?! ""Danville Botanical Garden""? Steven, you came back! That's right, 15% off at the gift shop. Nice going, Steven! Okay, then. Teresa One and Teresa Two, let's teach this platypus some manners. Very clever, but let's see how you do against the Seven Sisters! Looks like it's time to bring out Toni with an ""I""! Looks like it's time to bring out Toni with an ""I""! He is always giving us a hard time! He says he is our friend! Would a friend steal your bike? To be fair, he stole everyone's bike. And what about the time he drank all the water out of our fish tank? Something's going on over there. The Baljeets seem to be gathering. Oh, I don't like the looks of that! Gatherings have the habit of turning into mobs. And mobs rarely make good decisions. Oh, come on. Couldn't a gathering just as easily turn into a shindig or a hoot-nanny? Under normal circumstances, I'd say yes. But this one seems to have a ""Storming of the Bastille"" sort of vibe. See, they're playing music! It is a hoot-nanny! (Song: Buford is in Trouble)  Decisions are much easier when made en masse   No one accountable, no fear of loss   Because there's more of us, you will obey   You do not have a choice, do what we say!   It's only mob mentality, you do not understand it fully   Put together thirty nerds and you can make a giant bully   Buford is in trouble now, see the sweat upon his brow   Our numbers are superior, surrender we will not allow   Buford is in trouble now, see the sweat upon his brow   Our numbers are superior, surrender we will not allow   Buford is in trouble now, see the sweat upon his brow   Our numbers are superior, surrender we will not  Huh. So, that's what comeuppance looks like. Lauren! You put her down! Platypuses can't throw boomerangs. Ow! Phineas, Ferb! You've gotta save me! They've all gone crazy! It's the mob mentality! Once it gets rolling, nothing can stop it! Mom! They're back! All the Baljeets are after Buford! What do you mean, ""after"", Candace? ""After"", like they're going to get him! Baljeet, picking on Buford? Candace, Buford outweighs Baljeet by like, 90 hamburgers! Now, take it easy, buddies. This is really a bad decision! Let's be rational about this! Okay, everyone. Get him! Okay, boys, break it up. What's going on out here? You missed it! There were, like, 20 of 'em! It is okay, Mrs. Flynn-Fletcher. We were just talking about how easy it is to make a bad decision. All right, but play nice. Okay, Mom! Who wants pie? Now, that's a decision we can all agree on. Okay! Okay, I give up! You've got some skills, platypus, I'll give you that. But there's one thing you should know about my gals. They always come back! Aha! Gotcha! My greatest hunt ever ends right here! Stop what you're doing, McCraken! Step away from the platypus! Doofenshmirtz. I'd like you to meet my ladies. Ruth and Esther! Ah, docents. Oh, not again! I'll be right back, I know how to handle these ladies. Uh The sign must have just been installed, I'veâ I've never seen it before. Nice try, Liam, but this is your third infraction in as many weeks! Hand over your membership card! What? Let's not get crazy, now. All your garden privileges have been revoked for ten days. Esther will escort you off the grounds. But I can't leave! It's my natural habitat! Your file says you're from Pittsburgh. But, it's not my fault! It's him! It's the platypus you want! Oh, look how cute he is! What a handsome platypus! There has got to be a way out of here. Major Monogram? Yes, Carl? Iâ I-I want you to meet my cousin, Larry. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You got out of the vent, found your cousin and brought him back in here? Well, I didn't have to find him, we had a lunch date, he was waiting for me. Why on earth would you bring him back into the vent?! 'Cause I wanted you to meet him! Plus, I really like vents. Mutual, I'm sure. How are you feeling, buddy? Oddly enough, I feel the same. But I am not worried about making choices anymore. Well, it's nice to have you back, Baljeet. I agree. It's nice to have you back. One of you back. Buford! Do I detect true sentiment in your voice? You do realize I'm holding a pie here. I retract my mocking tone. Perry the Platypus! Oh, this is perfect. I want you to meet my new friend, Steven the Platypus! You guyâ Huh? He's gone! Iâ I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye. Steven! We were just talking about you! Hey, I'd like you to meet Perâ Now where did he go? Oh, I really wanted you to meet him. Hey, maybe you know him! Iâ It's not that I think platypuses all know each other or anything, it's just thatâ I thought that maybe you might, you know, run in the same crowd or something.  Don't know which choice to choose when people ask   Not sure which task to take, or take to task   I don't know which is best, or which is bad   I'm like a question mark, or hanging chad   Even doing nothing is still a choice like I must make   I'm paralyzed by fear that it will all become a big mistake   Everything is probable, nothing is impossible   Choices left to random chance are highly irresponsible  March, my little off-package robots!

"It was good getting down around town with my main man, Phineas and Ferb. I think those translation sideburns are really working for you, Meap. Rock n' roll! Meap! Later, Meap! Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Oh, you missed it. We were just talking to Meap in the galactic web. What is that flashing on your screen? Hmm I don't know. Let's open it up, Ferb. Hi! My name is Morg. Have you ever wished that you could pop off to another planet, on the other side of the galaxy for a quick visit? Well, now you can! With Mind Share Vacations! Hmm! You and your friends can trade places, with me and my friends, for the interplanetary vacation, of a lifetime! That sounds like fun. Imagine, relaxing in a hot rock by the pools, and then surrounded by beautiful newts! Or splork through the tubeworm forest, of put wishum foomf! Woo-hoo! Hmm! Here's how it works. Your mind comes to lodge in his head, and his mind goes to stay in yours. Only your mind makes the trip, hmm. All you have to do, is build this highly sophisticated device, and be on your way to priâ A mind share vacation of a lifetime! Ferb, I think I know what we're gonna do today. It sounded like he almost said we were on our way to Perry. Hey, where is Perry? Morning, Agent P. We have intelligence that Doofenshmirtz may have taken up Square Dancing. He cannot be allowed to use one of our beloved American traditions for his evil purposes! So get out there and make sure he doâsiâ Doâsen't do that, I guess. There, finished. Well, that was easier than I thought. Let's fire this bad boy up! Brace yourselves for fun, because we're going on a Mind Share Vacation! Did it work? I think it did. Hey, wait a second. Where the heck are we? Oh, ""prison"". We were on our way to prison. That's what he almost said. Hmm! Our escape plan worked perfectly! We are now free to ransack this planet! Everyone, celebration noises! Okay, that's enough! It appears as though we've been transported into some sort of intergalactic hoosegow. I was framed! I'm afraid we've all been duped into aiding in the escape of some rather brilliant galactic prisoners. And they did it with this little gadgetâ Phineas, that's you! That's right, losers, hmm! We pulled the old switcheroo! In case you chumps have any ideas about coming back, we're setting the device on our end to self-destruct! In one hour! Why are we waiting an hour to destroy it? Have you no sense of drama? Sayonara, suckers! Hmm! Ain't that the squirts. Well, look on the bright side! I got nothing. Hey, guys! I just realized somethin'! I'm the only fly in a prison full of frogs and lizards! Luckily, I do not think anyone else has noticed. You're mine, flyboy! Fresh fly! We're gonna get you! Well, it was nice knowing you. I think I figured out how we can reverse this thing. We'll be back in our own bodies in no time, barring any unforeseenâ What's that? Out of your cells, ladies! Surprise inspection! Cell number 12, don't make me come down there! Morg! What are you and your misfits up to this time? What's that? Oh, uh Contraband! One more infraction outta you nerds and I will put you all in the hole for good! You got it?! The guard just took our only connection back to Earth! Now what are we gonna do? I think we might be able to rebuild it, if we could just get the parts. We need to find a guy who knows how to get things. Every prison has one. How do you know what every prison haâ Uh-uh! Don't go there! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Where on earth do you think you're going? We're going to Lotsmo to steal food. What?! Are you pretending to be aliens or something? Hmm. Yes, pretending. Hilarity noises! I'm not gonna tell you again! Gotcha! I know what you're thinking. Why the snazzy getup? Why the boots? Well, you see, I met this girl, Rosie, on a square-dancing website and I may have led her to believe that I'm an expert square dancer. Hey, don't give me that self-righteous look! It's the web, man! Everybody stretches the truth! You don't think that cat really eats cheeseburgers, do you? Anyway, that's why I made these boots to help me dance. See? They have these little microphones that hear all the commands of the square dance caller, and they move exactly to those commands, making me the perfect square dancer! So, I really want to make a good impression. Maybe you can come along and, you know, make me look good. What do you say? Will you be my wingman? There's my guy! Oh, yeah, and by the way, she also thinks I'm a champion bull rider, so if it comes up, youâ Hey, don't look at me like that! There must be a guy like me in every prison in the universe. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. Dragonflies, a warm rock if that's your thing, or maybe a lilypad for your kid's graduation. So, when Morg and his friends needed parts for a mind-swap device, they came looking for me. Psst. I understand you're a guy that knows how to get things. Stop it! Stop it! What is wrong with you?! Spit him out! I'm sorry. I skipped breakfast. What is it you are looking for? Here. We made a list. You can find everything you need in the dumpster out back of the Lotsmo on Flyway 61. So then, you can get us the stuff? No. I'm not the guy who gets things. I'm the guy who knows how to get things. You would have to tunnel out of your cell and crawl 500 yards through the prison gunge pipe just to reach the outside. That's the length of five football fields. How d'ya know how long a football field is? Later that day, to make their escape, those boys crawled through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness I can't even imagine. That's the length of 11 baseball banners, one tennis court, a medium-sized male elephant and a croquet wicket. It wasn't long before they found everything that they needed. Great! Let's hurry up and put this thing together! The sooner, the better! But if we do the mind swap here, those criminals will still be out of jail. You're right. I hadn't thought of that. So, even later that day, those boys crawled back through 500 yards of foul-smelling nastiness that Iâ Actually, it is not as bad as you would think. Yeah, gunge is actually quite refreshing. Oh. Well, it was still 500 yards. That's the length of two volleyball courts, a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, a large three-drawer filing cabinet, three Frenchâ We're not listening anymore! Oh. Okay, then. Ooh, check it out, Perry the Platypus. There she is. That's Rosie. She's from Hazel Park by the racetrack. Why don't you go over there and sit with the other wingmen? And you can, you know, give me hand signals in case I get stuck. Right? Hi, there. I'mâ I'm JohnnyRingoenshmirtz217. Oh, so nice to finally meet you face to face. I must say, I like a man with a strong chin. Oh, well Well, thank you. Iâ A lot of people just focus on the, you know, the weak forehead. So, youâ So, you care to dance? Well, I would love to. (Song: Square Dance)  Do-si-do with all your might   Join elbows and circle right   Now join hands with the lady fair   And promenade her around the fair  Well, Johnny, I'm impressed. Pick it up now! Well, these boots were made for dancin' literally.  You're lookin' good out there   Now promenade your lady fair  Well, these boots were made for dancin' literally. Hello? Earth? Hello? Why are you talking like my little brother, lizard boy? It's me, Candace! Phineas! Outer space alien super crooks from a planet of frogs and reptiles have taken over our bodies. Okay. What do you want me to do? Really? You believe that weird story just like that? Yeah, it's been a long summer, kid. What do you need? Well, okay. We need you to find those aliens that look like us and get them to stand on the mind share machine staging area over there. The what? You know, that platform thing. It's the only way we can get our brains back into our bodies. Okay. Oh, the machine is set to self-destruct in one hour, so you've gotta hurry. Right! I'm on it, Phineas! Hmm, quickly now! Get all that gluten on the transport vehicle! Hmm, let's go! I've seen Argonian moon sloths that move faster!  Now join hands with the lady fair  Hmm, what is that?  And promenade her around the fair  That sound? I feel compelled to obey its hypnotic quadrilateral voice commands! Pick it up now! Hmm. Must seek out source! Where are they going now? You got me all tuckered out with that fancy footwork you been doin'. What should we do now? Oh, well, let's see. We could rub our stomachs and point to our mouths and later we could roll our eyes and put our head in our hands? I thought we could get somethin' to eat. Oh, that sounds good, too. I meanâ Hang on, let me check. Let's go! Oh, rhinestone encrusted oracle, command us with your quadrilateral right angle voice commands! Hmm.

What have you got to say for yourself this time, Morg?! We were framed! Hmm. Candace, you did it! That's right, and when Mom gets home, you're gonna be so And just in the nick of time! Oh, never mind. Oh, Johnny, isn't it amazing how well we square-danced together? (Song: Shake Your Body)  Shake your body like you just don't care!   Shake your body like you just don't care!   Shake your body, shake your body, shake your body, shake your body   Shake it, shake it, shake it  It's the boots! I-Iâ I don't usually have boogie fever! I don't usually have boogie fever!

"Guys, can you settle an argument for us? Preferably in my favor? If a vegetarian becomes a zombie, would they start eatin' people? Mr. Smartyunderpants thinks they just keep eatin' vegetables. But they are, after all, vegetarians. I guess they eat things like heads of lettuce Uh, ears of corn! Eye of potato! Leg of carrot! What? Your carrots don't have legs? Where do your parents shop? Hey, guys! What'cha doin'? Oh, we're just solving the world's problems. Zombie vegetarianism is a world problem? Not yet. But recycling is. We've gotta lot of leftover material from past inventions and we're trying to figure out what to do with it. My mom always just throws all our leftovers into a pot and makes a giant casserole. It's best to just eat first and ask questions later. That's it! We'll use all our leftovers and make an invention casserole! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Hey, where's Perry? I'm right here, guys. It's Internet sensation, Parry Gripp! How's it going? It's going well! But, actually, we were looking for Perry the Platypus. Oops. Sorry for the misunderstanding. Internet sensation, Parry Gripp, ladies and gentlemen! So, where's our Perry? Oh, here you go, Perry. I burnt another one. I guess that's what I get for staying up all night. Unless I get my act together, that means plenty more for you, Perry. Red leather yellow leather, red leather yellow leather, red leather yellow Lawrence, what on Earth are you doing? Oh, just a few vocal exercises before my big speech for the committee of the Danville Museum. Would you like a little sneak peek? I'd love to, honey, but I've got quite a lot of baking to do if I wanna make my quota for the Live and Let Pie event. Live and Let Pie! for charity. Why don't you practice in front of Candace? Ooh, fine idea. There's nothing teenagers love more than listening to speeches. Okay, where was I? Oh, no! Well, Perry, looks like you've got yourself another Uh, where's Perry? Right here! Platypus. Oops, didn't mean to intrude. Morning, Agent P. Guess whose birthday it is, Agent P? It's not Carl's. And it's not yours. Okay, okay, it's mine! Help yourself, Agent P. Not a cake person, huh? Oh, well. We've noticed a surge of revenue going to Doofenshmirtz's bank account recently. Get to the bottom of it. Are we ready to sing, Carl? I'm patching in all the agents now, sir. We couldn't afford the rights to that famous birthday song, so the agents and I came up with this. A one, a two, a three.  Birthday!  That was just beautiful! ""Thank you for coming here today to hear my speech on the history of the ancient Ornithorhynchan tribe. The Ornithorhynchans were a platypus-worshipping society known for painting themselves teal-blue and wearing elaborate platypus-themed costumes for their various dances and rituals."" Oh, you know what? I just remembered some friends asked me to help them form a giant human pyramid and I told them that was, like, the last thing I want to do today, but It turns out I was wrong. So, I-I gotta go. The speech is great, Dad, but you might want to add some visual aids. Just a little dry. Hmm, visual aids. Ah, that's how I can spruce it up a little. Spruce! Spruce! Spuh-ruce! Ah, very good then.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated  Good to see you, Perry the Platypus! But, you'll be lucky to see anything after yâ Oop! Oh, I almost used my final zinger before I even told you my evil plan! Just put it out of your mind. Bzzt! It's gone like like you've been zapped by a Mind Zap-inator. Zapper-inator or something. Hmm. Anyway, you may be wondering why you're in an ophthalmologist's chair. Well, it seems that I've come into a bit of good fortune! Some technology of mine is being used to in eye examination equipment and I've been getting royalty checks. The extra money is fine and all, but it really chafes my hide that something I invented is being used for good! Ugh. Y-You know what I mean? Soâ So, I invented the Eye Fog-inator to temporarily blur the vision of whomever it hits. It will then force people to go out and get their eyes checked, and then I'll get even more money, which I can then spend on evil! So, you know, i-it kinda evens out. And you, Perry the Platypus, will be my first test subject! Okay, put your little chin on the thing. Oh. Oh, l-let me wipe that off for you. Gets so greasy. Okay, lift your head a bit. Thereâ There we go. Perfect. Okay, now here's my zinger. You'll be lucky to see anything after the Eye Fog-inatâ Ugh! It-Itâ You know, it worked before when it was in context, butâ But it just sounds silly now. Ugh. Okay, nowâ Now you'll feel a slight puff of air. Okay, and the blinding ray. So, diâ Did it work? Well, why are you giving me the stink eye? Did it work or not? Huh, I-I guess I'll just have to try it by myself. Okay, three steps back and Whoa! Whoa, I can see that I cannot see. Whoa, I can see that I cannot see. Thisâ It-It works! It workâ I-I consider this a success, Perryâ Perry the Platypus, where are you? Did you say something? Nice work, Baljeet! I found some slide rulers from my World of Calculation exhibit. I found some coat hangers from that Leaning Tower of Closet Space and an old college sweatshirt. Cool! We can hit this baby with the Mega-sizer and it'll make a great parachute. I found these catering trays from the giant picnic and this parachute from the drag race. Cool! We can shoot that with the Micro-sizer and it'll make a great sweatshirt. All this stuff is gonna work out great! It's a shame Perry isn't here to see it. Here I am. And I brought some old guitar strings to recycle. Wow. Thanks. Butâ You meant Perry the Platypus, didn't you? Well, yeah, but your timing is perfect. We were just about to start the song. Okay, try this on for size. (Song: Backyard Hodge Podge)  You take a   Bucket full of forks and a rusted oil drum   And a broken carburetor stuck together with some gum   Got a motor, and a floater, and a giant can of soda   Uncle's college sweatshirt, but it's got a funny odor   You take a little here and you put it over there   You can tie it all together with some fake gorilla hair, and then   We've got a backyard hodge podge!   (It's a backyard hodge podge!)   It's a backyard hodge podge!   (It's a backyard hodge podge!)   Well, we've got   A motorized spatula, a rubberized tarantula   A weird potato chip that kind of looks like Dracula   A locket, and a socket, and a shiny medal sprocket   A slide without a ladder, and a Saturn V rocket   You'll ogle with your goggles as you weld another toggle   And your mind'll truly boggle when it starts to wiggle-woggle because   It's a backyard hodge podge!   (Oo-ooh, it's a backyard hodge podge!)   It's a backyard hodge podge!   (Oo-ooh, it's a backyard hodge podge!)   It's a backyard hodge podge!  I've got you now, Perry the Platypus! Perry the Platypus, did you get yourself upholstered? Oh, man! Actually, this is way too tame. Hey, crank it up to double black diamond! This parachute smells funny.  (Oo-ooh, it's a backyard hodge podge!)  Nice repurposing of Buford's chewed gum collection.  (Oo-ooh, it's a backyard hodge podge!)  That sure was great! But, I wish Perry was here for once. He would just love it! I do love it! I've never had so much fun! Anyway, fellas, I'm gonna hit the road. See ya! Well, he's no platypus but still a lovely fellow. You know, maybe I should've thought before blurring my own vision. And it was very short-sighted of me. Hey, could you make that ""digga-digga-digga-digga-digga"" sound for meâ That was a lucky kick, Perry tâ Wait, I just need to blast myself again and I'll clear my vision and get the jump on him. Hey, hey, you jumped on me! You used my own turn of phrasing against me! Wow, irony! Really? A stack of buckets? That'll teach me to randomly stack buckets in the center of my lab. Oh, another reject. Here you go, Perry. Oh, there you are. What're you doing up there? Oh, it's a bag of bread. Oh, I've been up so long I'm starting to see things.  Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two   Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two   Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine-two   Pi!  Okay. That's it. I can't believe I'm doing what I'm about to do. Hello? I hate to interrupt your day, honey, but I need your help with these pies. I'm so tired, I'm startin' to see the weirdest things. Weird? Yes! I'll be right home! Um That was partially my fault! Ugh, the pies aren't the only things that are burnt. I gotta get outta here! Oh, that didn't go over as well as I'd hoped. Hmm, perhaps I need to spruce it up more! Spruce! Sprrrâ Ooh! Ow! I do believe I've sprained my elbow. Maybe some fresh air will help wake meâ âup?!  (It's a backyard hodge podge!)  Hi, Mom! Phineas?  It's a backyard hodge podge!  Okay, found it! Okay, I just have to take three steps back. One twoâ One twoâ Why do I keep stacking buckets?! Curse you, Perry the Platypus! This is gonna be epic! Okay, Mom! Here I am! Candace, do you see what I'm seeing? I don't see anything! I don't see anything! I don't see anything! I don't see anything! That's it! I'm lying down! I can see everything so well now. Yes, whoever invented those gizmos inside that machine must be a person who's dedicated his or her life to good. Oh, man! Ignore the upside down man, Balthazar. Ladies and gentlemen, our keynote speaker on the history of the Ornithorhynchan tribe, Lawrence Fletcher. Thank you for coming here today to hear my speech on the history of the ancient Ornithorhynchan tribe. The Ornithorhynchans were a platypus-worshipping Why is his arm in a sling? That's what bothers you about this? That nap did me a world of good! I feel so much better now. No, maybe not. Back to bed.

"(Song: Bee Song)  Where's that swarm? What's that drone?   Something's buzzing close to home   It's Bee Day   And I'm feeling fine   They look for pollen wherever they roam   Then regurgitate honey in a honeycomb   It's Bee Day   Come on, get in line!   It's time to celebrate Bee Day!   They pollinate the flowers   Bee Day!   They party in the hives   Bee Day!   From time to time they sting us and they pay for it with their lives   Because it's Bee Day!  Why do we always end on that weird Bâ­ with an F# bass? It's tradition, Jimmy. We don't question it. I mean it's not even in the key. So, did you all have fun at the Bee Day Festival's Opening Ceremony? It was bee-wildering. Bee-utiful. Bee-dazzling. Bee-yond. Bee-guiling. Ugh! Just bee quiet! Oh, Candace. Bee-have. What's so important anyway? Oh, nothing. Just taking the What Kind of Teenager Are You quiz to unlock my true teen identity! Well, I'll just leave that to the professionals at the magazine. Oh, look at that. An inflatable wading pool. Oh, it's just like the one I used to play in with Candace when she was little. Remember, hon? Mm-hmm! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. And I'll tell you after the wipe. We're making the ultimate inflatable wading pool for Mom. Hey, where's Perry?  Agent Bee!   P!  Good morning, Agent P! We, uh Sorry, myâ âallergies are acting up, this whole Bee Day business is stirring up all the pollen in Danville. Anyway, Agent P, uh Doof's been spotted gathering bee pheromones, which is not only disgusting but probably evil. To send you on your way, Carl actually came up with a bee-themed jetpack. It's right behind you. Carl, where are those tissues?! Here you go, sir. Single-ply, seriously? We're on a budget, sir. Okay, Stace! I'm done! Just tallying up the score. So, how did you dâ Okay, whaâ You done? No. Candace, talk to me. Heather Magazine says I'm an emo teen! An emo teen, Stacy! I don't even know what that is. Okay, to the Internet. Here we go. Emo, emo ""Emos believe everyone's against them."" How can you say that to me? ""They're highly sensitive and drama queens."" No, I'm not! You know, as teenage sub-cultures go, it's not so bad. You just need a new look to match your true teen identity. I'll be right over. Ferb, how's the pool inflation coming? Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin? Ferb and I are building a super inflatable wading pool. You wanna help? I'd love to, but actually, I need your help. Anything for you, Isabella. Really? Of course. Your word is my humble command. I would travel the four corners of the globe which I actually have done, but this time, it would be for you. All for you! A-Ahem? You were lost in Phineasland again. Oh, right! Right. The Fireside Girls are going for our Beekeeping patch, and we need to borrow something. Of course. But I'll need some collateral if you're gonna borrow Ferb. Oh, Phineas! It's not that funny. Stand down, Fireside Girl.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Oh, there you are Perry the Platypus. Hey, great costume, that's the bee's knees orâ You know, wings in this case. Ha! Swats happening, Perry the Platypus. Swats up! Swats goinâ Hey, swats your problem? Oh, I'm sorry, I-I can't help it, I got bees on the brain, especially the queen bee. She's all you hear about. Queen bee this, queen bee that. You never hear about the King Bee, do you? That means there's a power vacuum that I need to exploit. Behold! The Aroma-nator. Like the queen bee, I have acquired mass quantities of pheromones, see? Right here in the tank. Once I spray myself, the bees will be attracted to me and I will be crowned King Bee! After that, it's just a hop, skip, and a jump to ruling the entire Tri-State Area. Okay. So the top three items on the Heather Magazine 11-step guide to being a true emo teen are dark hair, dark clothes, and pencil-thin jeans. Ugh! Let's see what you got. Hey, not bad! Whatever. Well, you've got the look and you've got the attitude. Now there's just one last test to see if you're a true emo. Do you have enough ennui to resist the urge to bust your brothers? I don't think your mom would approve. Of course not! They're gonna be so busâ Uh-uh-uh! True identity, Candace! What's the point? No one understands me anyway. Wow, Heather Magazine is good! Thanks for the loan, Phineas! We're sure to get our Beekeeping patch now. No problem. What are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony? Of course! Wouldn't miss it! This is fascinating! Tell me more about bee dancing. Really? Because usually, people are either gone or fall asleep by the time I get to this part of the sentence. Hey, Baljeet! Mind giving me a hand with these pools? In a minute. So to continue, the figure eight and Aw and we are back. Hi, honey. Love the new look. You obviously don't know me. Nobody does. And if somebody did, I'd just deny it. Sweetie, I went through a similar phase when I was your age. Try writing some poems. Whatever. I don't care, No one gets me Except my hair. That's my girl. Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. 'Cause you see, it's aâ It's a real vacuum cleaner. No? Wow, either I'm off my game or you're just being stubborn. Sucks to be you! So, we're back in business! Now, lemme just shut this babyâ Oops! I almost hit the self-destruct button here! What? I-I install one on everything. It's my thing. Iâ I put one on my coffee machine, on my TV, I have one everywhere. Look! I even put one on my underwear, see? Look. All right. That, uh That was not pleasant. All right, gang's all here. Let's get this pool party started! Sorry, Buford. I promised Isabella and the Fireside Girls that we'd wait for them. ""Ooh, I promised Isabella!"" Is that how I sound? He really nailed you. It is uncanny. Well, I guess we can test the pools out to make sure they're up to our usual standards. ""Well, I guess we can test the pools! Hey, look at me!"" You guys are right! It's like listening to a mirror! All right, gang. Let's give this wading pool a try. Woo-hoo! Carbonation. Makes me belch. That's why I like it. Yes, thank you for sharing. Now that the bees are out of the way, let's try this baby out. Just a little spritz. Ugh. Okay Needs a little adjustments. Oh, that's right. Charlene's coming over to get Vanessa's headphones for her. Hello, Heinz. Hey, Charlene. Here you go. Oh, thanks, Heinz. Wait, are you more attractive all of a sudden? Oh, why, thank you, I have been trying toâ Oh, wait, no, it's just the pheromones. Wow! Well, it's really working because suddenly I can't remember why we broke up. You said you hated Mr. Tomato. Hello, Charlene. Oh, hello, Mr. Tomato. Thanks for the reminder. I'm outta here. You know it wasn't me she didn't like. Shut up! Awesome! Yeah! What a thrill! Man, that kid can wade! Sibling unit, Wading, wading. I sit here Not relating. Wow, pithy. Now we're cookin' with gas! Watch, Perry the Platypus, I spritz myself right into ruling the Tri-State Area! Uh-oh. Oh, I think it might be time for Plan Bee! Hey, stop it, stop it! They're all over me! Get 'em off! Get 'em off! Get 'em off! Get 'em off! Thank you for saving me, Perry the Platypus! And on the bright side, with all those bees, not one sting! Oh, man! *I should've expected this. *At least my inator is intact. *Ah, shoot! *Curse you, Perry the Platypus! *Curse you! *I said, ""Curse you, Perry the Platypus!"" *Yeah, well, see, you should be able to get it in context. What the heck is that? I have no idea, but the bees sure seem to like it. And so continues the inevitability of my mundane existence. Once again, I'm humiliated by the universe. What just happened? Hey, kids! Anyone up for some iced tea? Sure! Thanks, Mom! Oh, there you are, Perry! Oh, look. You kids found Candace's old wading pool! How sweet! We're gonna have a pool party! Go ahead, wade away! Sorry we're late, Phineas. Our bee ceremony ran long. No worries, Isabella. Go ahead and join Mom in the fun. ""No worries, Isabella!"" Hey, he does a good you! Come on, girls! Let's hit the pool! Aw, it's just like old times. Hey, Candace. I just realized you added up your score wrong! Your true teen identity is actually the ""Busting and Crush Obsessed Older Sister Type Who Can't Do Math"". But, but, but, but, but But, but, but, but, but But, but, but, but, but But, but, but, but, but But, but, but, but, but Whatever."
"The opening ceremony of the Bee Day festival was awesome! It's my favorite part of Bee Awareness Day! My favorite part is the Bâ­ with the F# bass at the end of the song! What? It's tradition! Okay, girls, festivities are over. Let's focus on getting our Beekeeping patches. It's the only patch that we've ever tried to get and failed. Remember last year? You promised to never flashback on that ever again. Right, right! You're right. But still, if we don't succeed today, the two-strikes-and-you're-out rule kicks in, which means this spot will stay empty on our sashes forever! Chill out, Isabella. We've got this. Ready, girls? They're gone! Gone? F-F-Fighting flashforward to potential catastrophe! Hey, where's Pinky? Good afternoon, Agent Pinky. I see you've taken our new handbag conveyor system. Carla here has intelled that Poofenplotz has been hatching some sort of bee-related evil scheme. Carla? Yes, it seems that Poofenplotz is researching the use of royal jelly in the bee community. Oh, there's your coffee. Isn't she a find? She comes from an entire family of unpaid interns. Anyways, see if there is anything to Carla's research, Agent Pinky. Admiral Acronym out. We've gotta find those bees before the sun goes down! But how? In the guideline for the Beekeeping patch, it says that a good beekeeper tries to think like a bee. Bzzzz What are you doing? I'm thinking like a bee. I know! We can get stung by radioactive bees and gain bee-themed superpowers! Um We don't have access to radioactive bees. Yeah. That's what's wrong with that plan. But we do have access to Phineas and Ferb. And they have access to a sorbet machine that turned Candace into a fly. They've gotta be able to modify it to turn people into bees. Phineas and Ferb have a sorbet machine that turns people into flies? Katie, for crying out loud, look it up on the internet!  Poofenplotz reading her junk mail!  Let's see. Bill, bill, flyerâ This must be my acceptance letter into L.O.V.E.M.U.F.F.I.N.! Oh! And open, uh. ""Dear Esmeralda Poofenplotz"" Oh, that sounds promising! ""We regret to inform you thatâ"" Oh! Reject me, will they? No matter. My newest evil scheme is sure to catch the attention of that silly boy's club. Pinky the Chihuahua! Fortunately, I was expecting you. The makeup case doubles as a trap. Could you hand me that lipstick in there? Thank you. What are friends for, if not to reconfigure a sorbet machine that turns people into flies into a sorbet machine that turns people into bees! Just remember, the effect wears off after a couple of hours. Oh, why don't you come back for our inflatable wading pool party after your patch ceremony? Of course! Wouldn't miss it! See you later, then! Did you know that bees can communicate with each other through dancing? That's really interesting! Yes. They do a tail-wagging dance to alert each other to a source of food Okay, let's see. Setting targets. ""Fireside Girls"" And that should do it. Here we go. In a minute. So to continue, the figure eight and Aw And we are back. Fireside Bees, follow your noses! That way! Much better. Now that my lips are taken care of, I can tell you about my beautifully evil plan. Bad doggie! Okay, sit! That's better. Now pay attention as the camera slowly moves closer and we cross-dissolve to my thoughts. Behold, a humble beehive. A massively warded society just like our own. Observe a young grub being fed mass quantities of royal jelly, which will make her larger and eventually she will become the queen. So logic dictates that if I were to consume massive amounts of royal jelly, then I would grow forty times bigger and live forty times longer and eventually be crowned Queen of the World! The Queen! And I shall not be dark, but beautiful, like the night in the day, and all shall love me and despair! And I might have a grotesquely large abdomen for laying eggs, but I can live with that. Come, Pinky the Chihuahua! To the Myself-icopter! My bee instincts are buzzing! This must be where our bees went! They must've been attracted to that heavenly scent. What is that? It seems to be coming from that gigantic perfume sprayer. Okay, time to fill the void in the power vacuum. Let's check it out! Whoa! 'Cause you see, it's a real vacuum cleaner. It looks like every bee in Danville is here! Fireside Girls, forward, buzz! Sucks to be you! Let me just shut off this babyâ Oops! I almost hit this self-destruct button here! Wow! Humans really take for granted not being sucked into the nearest vacuum cleaner. What? I install one on everything. It's my thing! I'm gonna see if the queen knows anything. Excuse me, Your Majesty, do you have any idea how to get out? Not a clue. And without my jelly, I'm way too weak to fly. Ugh. What do you think, Fireside Girls? What are we supposed to do now? Bee Day's almost over and we're stuck inside a pharmacist's power-vac. What? Over? Did you say ""over""? Nothing is over until we decide it is! Was it over when we helped Candace get fifty patches in one day? Heck no! I thought it was only forty-nine. Forget it, she's rolling. And it's not over now! 'Cause when the going gets tough the tough get going! Come on, girls, we've got enough patches between all of us to make this work! We can do this! Gretchen, Milly, Katie, you've got the Exploring patch, right? Yes, and we can look for a way back out of here! Right! These pieces of hair and dust are like rope! Holly, Ginger, you girls have the Advanced Knot-tying patch. What do you think? We could totally work with that stuff! And make a sling for the queen! And Adyson, you and I have the Appliance Repair patch! Let's hotwire the vacuum and reverse the motor so that it blows us all out again! That's what I'm talkin' about! There they are! All we need to do is swap those leads to the forward-reverse switch. Great! How's that sling comin'? All good to go! Excellent work! Recon Team, is the escape path charted? Yes, ma'am! Power-vac hose located! It was murder on my allergies. Bee-utiful! Prepare for exit, everyone! Uh-oh! You know, I think it might be time for Plan Bee! Great job, Adyson. Uh, thanks? We're going home to the Fireside Lodge! Everybody, follow me! Oh, it's wearing off! Come on, we're almost there! Yay! The bees are back! Now we just need to get them back into their hive. Okay, little bees, go back into your hive. We don't speak their language anymore. We can't communicate. Ooh! I have my Semaphore patch! Would that work? Only if they were on a boat. Baljeet is the answer. Ginger, now really isn't the time toâ No, no, no! He told me all about this dance they do to alert each other to a source of food or shelter. Like the rhumba? No, it's a waggle dance! Dance patches we've got! (Song: Waggle Dance)  Well, I don't think I can really overstate it   But bee communication is quite complicated   What seems at first like a simple figure eight   Is packed with meaning when their butts gyrate!   See, the waggle explains the angle   From the sun to the door of the hive   We shake it to and fro to let everybody know   That the angle is seventy-five  Oh, 75 degrees is the angle in relationship to the sun. Yeah, but it also tells the bees the distance they're gonna have to go just to get there! Ooh  It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Show them where they got to go!   It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Take it to the bee chateau!  Let's do it!  Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Figure eight and shake it again!   Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Everybody shake your rear end!  You got it!  Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Come on and swing those skirts!   Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Try to hit 'em at thirteen hertz!  That's right!  It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Show them where they got to go!   It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Take it to the bee chateau!   (Waggle dance!)  Ah, my Locatif-icator has led me to the mother lode! The royal jelly room at the Moist Beauty Works factory! It won't be long now, Agent Pinky. Soon I'll be able to carry out my most beautifully evil plan yet! Bad doggy! Bad, bad doggy! That's the last time I buy a cheap designer knockoff trap from downtown. I don't believe it! Fortune is smiling upon me like the creepy guy on the corner of 3rd and Main! We're in the royal jelly chamber of the Moist Beauty organic cosmetics factory! How unbelievably coincidental. No, really, I mean, I couldn't have asked for a better place to crash. Anyway, you have failed, Pinky the Chihuahua, and brought me right to the biggest supply of royal jelly in the Tri-State Area! I. can't move. I. can't move. Well, Iâ I'm not much larger and I'm not really feeling royal at all. Iâ I suppose my plan was predicated on a faulty hypothesis now, wasn't it? I guess there's only one thing to say, and that's Curse you, Pinky the Chihuahua! Ooh, how humiliating. Piloted off to the pokey by a pooch. Here's your patch and here's my patch! Yay! Time to party! Sorry we're late, Phineas. Our bee ceremony ran long. No worries, Isabella. Go ahead and join Mom in the fun. Come on, girls! Let's hit the pool! Aw It's just like old times. Hey, Isabella! We're having iced tea! You want some, honey? What did you say? I said, we're having iced tea! You want some honey? Oh. Um Sure!  Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Figure eight and shake it again!   Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Everybody shake your rear end!  You got it!  Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Come on and swing those skirts!   Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, stop!   Try to hit 'em at thirteen hertz!  That's right!  It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Show them where they got to go!   It's a waggle dance, waggle dance   Take it to the bee chateau!

"I think this might be the hottest day on record. Wait. Yep. Hi, guys. Hey, Baljeet! How was physics camp? Positively remedial. How much more basic can you get than the surface tension of water droplets? Surfer tension? What's that? Surface tension is the property which allows molecules of water on its surface to form a sort of stretchy skin, which allows it to retain its shape and durability at a small size. Cool! Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today! Not me. Really? And what are you doing today? With the hurly-burly of my busy social calendar, I often forget to have quality time with my pet goldfish, Biff. So, I shall smell you later. Wow. ""Smell you later"" sounds a lot more formal when you bow. Well, Ferb, I know what the rest of us are gonna do today. Speaking of pets, where's Perry? Sorry I can't be there, Agent P, but I'm stuck on jury duty. You'll be getting your mission today from Director Dipthong from accounting. Good luck. Uh Noâ No! No, Your Honor, I'mâ I'm not speaking on a mobile device. I'mâ I'm talking to a wart on my hand. I'm talking to a wart on my hand. Go away, wart! Go away! Hello, Agent P. It's me, Director Dipthong, from accounting. Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been buying an exorbitant amount of negative ion generators and negative power cable and I'm positive that it can't be good. Yeah. Uh, so go find out what Doofenshmirtz is up to and put a stop to it. Descending Dipthong! What are you doing? It's my signature sign-off. What do you think? Descending Dipthong. I'd stick with accounting. Can you believe how hot it is today, Jeremy? Even my dollies are sweating! Not that I play with dolls. I just happen to have a couple on my shelf next to my unicorn. Heh. Cool. So, what do you wanna do today? I don't know. I thought maybe we could head to the mall. I suppose we could go to the mall again.  the mall again the mall again the mall again  the mall again the mall again the mall again  the mall again the mall again the mall again Really? The mall again? Wow, you are so predictable! So ordinary! Predictable? Ordinary? I mean, come on! I play 20 instruments! Yeah, that all start with the letter ""B"", as in boring.  Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  Who's that? Just pretend she's not there. That's what I do. Candace? Candace?! Are you there? Uh, yeah. Yes, sorry. Forget the mall. I'm gonna think of something else to do that's really cool and totally different. 'Cause, you know, I gotta be my unpredictable self. So, Candace is out, peace! Uh, y-you know what? That's so overused. Candace is out.  Tra la la la la la la la la  Candace, I'm on my way toâ You know, this feels awfully familiar. I tell you I'm going out, later you'll tell me Phineas and Ferb are up to something, but there's nothing there to see, so we all have pie. Just another ordinary day. Ordinary?! Do I ordinarily do this?  Tra la la la la la la la la la la la la la la   Tra la la la la la la!  Like I said, just another ordinary day.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Aw, man, why did I save all the manual labor on my newest inator for the hottest day of the year? I might as well be doing hot yoga up in this piece! Can I get a ""what-what?"" Norm, where's my ""what-what?"" I'm sorry, sir. People do not say that anymore. How do you stay so current? Ah, Perry the Platypus, won't you have a seat? That is not not how you sit on a chair! Which means it is! Because I used a double negative! Sure, it's grammatically incorrect, but it's the core of my newest creation the Double Negative-inator! It takes any negative statement and turns it into a double negative, which which, in turn, makes it positive, Iâ Anyway, Iâ I was dreaming about cold weather because it's been so hot lately and I remembered how much I loved the Minty Wink Eggnog they make at Beverly's Lunch downtown. So I went out to get one. But then, Beverly told me I couldn't have it because they only make it in the winter. No matter how I begged and pleaded, she stood firm. No Minty Wink Eggnog! Because it's not winter! Ugh! Anyway, once I recovered from the shock, I did what I always do. Solve a simple problem by inventing a complicated and menacing machine. All I have to do is blast Beverly with this and bzzt! She'll be like, ""Oh, I guess you can have it, because it's not not winter"". And, suddenly I'm drinkin' Minty Wink Eggnog, baby! Perhaps then, I can make myself not not ruler of the Tri-State Area, huh? Huh? You didn't see that coming, did you? Oh, don't be cranky, Perry the Platypus, you can have a Minty Wink Eggnog, too. Nice work, guys! We'll have no trouble beating the heat with the world's largest drop of water. Yes! By my calculations, we have effectively strengthened the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, so that the surface tension is virtually unbreakable! In your face, physics camp! Booyah! Come on, gang! Let's surf the surface tension! Cowabunga! Totally awesome! Okay. Today's the big day in the Danville Fish Show. Are you nervous? Don't worry about it. It's normal. Just remember today is your day to shine! So we gonna be scared? ""No, Bufie!"" Are we gonna be tough? ""Yes, Bufie!"" So let's see what you got! Just like we practiced, jump through the hoop. You can do it, buddy! Jump through the hoop! Victory! What am I gonna do, Stace? Jeremy wants to spend time with me, but the best thing I could come up with is the mall! That's how boring I am! Well, there's a lot more interesting things to do. At least, that's what my mom says. The cafÃ©, movie theater It just all seems so so ordinary. I just gotta find something cool to do to get me outta my rut. Wanna come along? Nah, I'm sticking to the mall. It's air-conditioned. (Song: Extraordinary)  I want to be extraordinary   Not just extra ordinary   It seems like everywhere I see   People far more interesting than me   I know that change is kind of scary   But maybe I should try to vary   Some minor detail a small degree   A slightly different version of me   I could learn to cook vegetarian or take a fashion workshop   Meditate, calculate, learn to knit a tank top   Yoga, hula, clogging, jogging, walking on a tightrope   Take a correspondence course and learn to make my own soap   Jumping on a pogo stick, standing in a wheat field   Going on a snipe hunt, gotta keep my eyes peeled   Take a little time to really decorate my door, and   Change my hair to black and then I'll dye it back to orange   Underwater taxidermy, shopping for a suitcase   Peeling tangerines while placing second in a sack race   Lion taming, online gaming, trying to win a prize fight   Appearing on a talk show dressed up like a water sprite   Yeah!   I'm gonna be extraordinary!   I'm gonna stand out from the crowd and shout out loud   You'll see   I'll be a brand new me!  On your marks Get set Spherical laps! How cool is that? Awesome! The momentum from the swimming action is causing us to roll! Looks like we're takin' this pool party on the road! Hey, you know what? We can totally steer this thing if we paddle opposite the direction that we wanna go! Seems counter-intuitive, but okay. Full speed ahead, Ferb! Bumpy Street! Dead ahead! And hang a right onto Zigzag Street! Whoa! Loop-de-Loop Street! At least it's rent-controlled! I'm okay. Happens all the time. Okay, a few more tweaks and I'm ready to double down on some negatives! Wow, Iâ Now, that double negative did not make a positive! Ow! Oh, you are gonna get it now! Oh, no, no, n-no! Now it's stuck in random fire mode! Don't know why I put that mode on there. Not it! Not it! Not it! Not not it! Get him! We, the members of the jury, find the defendant not not guilty. So I guess we find him guilty. Funny, I could've sworn he was innocent. Hey, can't you see the detour? This is not a through street. Like I said, it's not not a through street. Go ahead. All right! Ugh! This isn't extraordinary! It's just embarrassing! Hey, Candace! Phineas and Ferb? Thanks, Bobbi. I'll see you next week. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Candace, what on earth is on your head? Never mind that! Phineas and Ferb are rolling through town on a giant ball of water! Come on! What about your fruit hat? Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our next contestants, Rodney von Roddenstein and his pet piranha, Fluffy, with their hoop trick! Ta-da! What a terrific new twist to a tired old trick. Let's see what the judges have to say. Wow! That puts Rodney and Fluffy in the lead and almost impossible to beat! Next up are Buford and his pet goldfish, Biff, doing their version of the hoop jump trick. Good luck toppin' that one, guys! Okay, Biffy, we're up! Jump through theâ Oh, no! Public art! Right ahead! It must be part of the Public Art Relocation Program! You did it, Biff! We're number one! Congrats, guys! Thanks! I'm gonna put Biff's prize money in a scholarship fund for that fancy fish school in the Maldives! Wait until you see this giant ball of water! Hi, guys! Come on in! The water's great! You're right, Candace. There is a ""giant ball of water"". Though most people prefer to call it a lake. Wow, a party in the lake? I never would have thought of that! You come up with the best ideas! We can go to the mall tomorrow. You really want to go to the mall again? We're teenagers. It's what we do. Ha! You misâ Ow! That was refreshing. Ah, that was not not the self-destruct button. Ugh! Well, oh, man, once again, the place is trashed! You just take off, leaving me here to clean it all up. Does it ever occur to you, Perry the Platypus, how much of a mess is left after one of our little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªtes? I bet you, it never even occurred to you that I keep talking to you for a while after you're gone! I mean, it's probably a sad commentary on my life that I'm wearing an apron and talking to a platypus that's no longer How long have you been standing there, Vanessa? Long enough, Dad."
"So, we all need to be prepared. You'll want to find a safe place and establish a defensive perimeter. Like in the basement? No! You never go in the basement! What is going on here? It's just our bi-monthly Zombie Apocalypse preparedness lecture. Yeah! You're welcome to join us. You might learn something. Puh-lease, Phineas. There's nothing about zombies that I don't know. Did you know there's one standing behind you? Very funny. Ha! Good one, bro. Phineas, Pinky's missing! Aw, that's too bad, Isabella. Chihuahuas, that's the first thing zombies go for. Uh, we moved past zombies, Buford. He's been gone all morning! He didn't even touch his breakfast burrito. What am I going to do? We could put up posters. We could do nothing. We could make a portable positronic canine detector using the olfactory receptors that Ferb and I were gonna use for our milligram scale purification study. Let's do that one! You kids have fun. Really, I wish I could stay and bust you but I have a lunch date with Jeremy down at City Hall. City Hall serves lunch? I thought they only served subpoenas! Oh, come on! What's a guy gotta do to get a rimshot around here? For your information, I'm going down to City Hall because Jeremy's working the Slushy Dawg concession stand at the food court there. And we're gonna have lunch together. But don't worry, Isabella. I'm sure Pinky'll turn up. Perry always does. Speaking of which, where is Perry? And where's Pinky? And where's that breakfast burrito? Ah, there's my guy! Ah, Agent P. I believe you know Agent Pinky. Agent Pinky informs us that Doof intends to steal the deed to the Tri-State Area from the City Hall archives. It seems he's discovered that whoever has the deed automatically becomes the ruler. It's an old law from a simpler time. You'll find that Agent Pinky is quite an asset, Agent P. He's good with computers, covert ops, and, quite frankly, he needs the hours. So get out there and stop Doofenshmirtz! Good luck, Agents P and, uh P! Good luck, Agents P and, uh P! I guess you're just two ""P's"" in a pod. Carl, where's my rimshot? It's right in front of you. How did you do that? Now I am here, but the best way to the food court is Is by taking the mandatory city hall tour! Butâ Wouldn't want a bunch of uninformed people wandering around City Hall! Butâ You can't fight it. I've been on this tour since this morning and I've been caught trying to escape twice! No talking back there! Now, follow me to a world of bureaucratic action and adventure! Perry the Platypus? No way! What a coincidence! Excuse me, if you and your mullet would just take one step to the Thank you. Oh, look! You brought your little dog, too! How cute! Oh, FYI, I don't think they allow dogs in here. So, you know, watch out for that. Anyway, I bet you're wondering why I'm in City Hall, right? Well, I plan to go down into the secret City Hall vault and steal theâ Oh, y-you know that, right. Right, right, of course. 'Cause that's probably why you're here. To stop me, right? What you probably don't know is how I will get into the vault without being noticed. Behold! My Blend-Into-The-Background-inator. I will be able to search out and steal the hidden deed, because, like they say, it's easier to find a hidden object when you're hidden as well. What? That's a thing. They say that. Anyway, I place the inator on my head, like so, I press this button and, now I'm here, and now I'm blended in. I'm here, I'm gone! I'm here, I'm goâ Oh, my head! I-I hope there's no long-term damage from this, butâ Ugh! Anyway, I bet you think I forgot to trap you. Well, surprise! You're already trapped by bureaucracy! You're already trapped by bureaucracy! You see, you don't have a number, Perry the Platypus. So by the time you and your little dog get into the archives, I will already be ruler of the Tri-State Area! I'm sorry, you cannot go in there without a number, sir. Oh, please don't tell me you brought your dog! Behold, the Dog Sensomatic Helmet! It will amplify Buford's senses to those of a dog. Okay, Buford. What do you smell now? I think I can smell the future! It's working! Do you smell Pinky yet? I smell somethin'! I smell I smell bacon! No, Buford, wait! Uh-oh. Now, this is a very old painting depicting John P. Tristate and Otto H. Adjacentâ Excuse me, I just need to get to the food court. Please hold all your questions till the end. Those are the rules and also please refrain from gum chewing and there are no pets allowed on the tour. Also there are no cutsies or halfsies for funsies. And absolutely no crossing the stanchions, please! Â¡No cruzar la cuerda por favor! (Please don't cross the line!) To the basement! Quit it! Fresh! All right, let see Garage, basement, catacombs, pessimistic humanoid underground dwellings Ah! Here it is! Gift shop and secret vault! Who's a good boy? It's me, right? Who's a good boy? Am I the good boy? You're a good boy! You mean me, right? Yes, you are! Yes, you are! Isabella, how does this help us with Pinky? Easy, I've been rubbing his belly with Pinky's squeak toy. Now he's got the scent! He's this way! I can smell it! Good boy! Yeah! I'm a good boy, right? Yes, you are! Huh? Oh, that had better not be the mailman! No, Buford, you're supposed to be finding Pinky! What kind of elevator falls at the speed of gravity? Why did they even put an elevator there? I could've just jumped down the shaft or withâ The deed! Well, I guess it's not not all that hidden, then, is it? Well, maybe it's just easier to find 'cause I'm hidden! Yes, I knew that was a real saying! Come to Papa! Perry the Platypus?! Oh, and your pet dog. How did you escape the clutches of bureaucracy? Oh, y-you took a number. I guess the line wasn't as long as I thought. But you're too late! Once I get outside, I will own the Tri-State Area! W-Which one is it? Oh, great, now I'm confused! And over here are the spontaneous musical number dioramas. The huh? Ooh, Danville is known for its spontaneous musical numbers. For instance (Song: The History of the Tri-State Area)  A lot of people know that the Tri-State Area   Used to be a Bi-State Area with an Adjacent Area over there   What people don't know is that originally it was three distinct   Single-State Areas, but people don't care   The founders of the Area were independent thinkers   Completely unaffected by bureaucratic hurdles   And that's why the Capitol building was moved here from Sri Lanka   On the backs of seven giant sea turtles   It's the history of an area, the Tri-State Area   Formed mostly from adobe and seaweed   If you've heard it different elsewhere, that's historical hysteria   So stop believing everything you read!   Over here's a diorama of the first diorama   Of Vincent Diorama, who lived right here!   When I say ""right here"", I mean in this very room   'Til we moved him to a studio apartment last year   It's the history of an area, the Tri-State Area   Don't mean to cause a ruckus or a fuss   It's the birthplace of the onion and the Danville cafeteria   And home of Bigfoot's hairless cousin, us!   It's the history of an area, the Tri-State Area   Where planet Venus holds some office space   Try to think of someplace better, well I double-dog-dare ya   But if you can't, then get out of my face!   It's the history of the Tri-State Area!   (History of the Tri-State Area!)   (Area!)  And now, step this way for the history of the history of accounting. Okay, let see The Declaration of Independence, the Magna Carta, the Deed to the Tri-Stateâ I mean the Mayflower Compact? Goodbye, Perry the Platypus! Oh! Oh! In here! Follow Buford! Hey, guys, he went here! I think Buford found him! Really? A doggy door in a municipal building that does not allow dogs? Whatâ Who did that? This way, everyone! Let see, how do you get outta here now? Hey! Huh? Another dog! This way! Oh, I hope it's Pinky! Right here! Right here, andâ What? He should be right here! Oh, man! I don't get it. Uh, maybe the helmet needs to be fine-tuned. Yeah, you guys do that. I'm gonna go get a Slushy Dawg. R-I-D-E, colon. R-I-D-E, colon. R-I-D-E, colon. R-I-D-E, colon. R-I-D-E, colon. Password? Oh, good! I'm really good at passwords! Okay, let see Uh, how about, the ""Reindeer flotilla"". Huh. And send. Yes! Now, I'll just take this deed outside and I'll be the ruler of theâ Perry the Platypus?! And your little dog, too? You're both persistent, I'll give you that, but the security system is offline and there's nothing you or your little dog friend can do about it! You know, unless, one of you happens to be really good with computers. Agent Pinky is good with computers good with computers good with computers good with computers good with computers Wow! That guy is really good with computers! Now, who's ready to see the whole tour again? Run! Actually, the song part was nice. Oh, you like the song, do ya? Well Hey! Hold it! Is that a dog? Hey, it's Pinky! I'm sorry, no dogs allowed! This tour is officially over! Candace! Candace, you found him! Thank you! You said he'd turn up and he did! Oh, there you are, Perry! Way to go, Candace! Come on, you two wandering pets! Who wants a breakfast burrito? I do! Exactly how long have you worked here at City Hall? Oh, I don't work here. I was sent by Yarnak to help uninformed citizens in need! Now, if you'll excuse me, I am needed elsewhere! Whoosh! Hey, Candace! Where were you? I'm sorry I missed lunch, Jeremy, but this weird guy made me go on a tour. That's Don. He's, uh, kind of a fixture around here. I'm the ruler of the Tri-State Area! Oh, great, now I'm confused!  It's the history of an area, the Tri-State Area   Don't mean to cause a ruckus or a fuss   It's the birthplace of the onion and the Danville cafeteria   And home of Bigfoot's hairless cousin, us!

"From the PFT Studios in still moderately charming and majestic downtown Danville, it'sâ Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know the drill. We've hosted before. He's good and I'm evil blah blah blah. I, for one, am excited to be here. And I'm all tingly! I've actually got butterflies in my stomach. Let me finish my introduction! Welcome to Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by Kelly Osbourne! Welcome to Phineas and Ferb's Musical Cliptastic Countdown Hosted by Kelly Osbourne! And now, here's our host. She's a singer, an actor, a fashionista du jour Kelly Osbourne! She's a singer, an actor, a fashionista du jour Kelly Osbourne! Hi, everybody! What'cha doin'? I have always wanted to say that. I am so excited to be here. I promise you guys, this is gonna be a rockin' show full of surprises. And anyone who knows anything about me, they know that I absolutely love Phineas and Ferb! And being a singer myself, I love love love the songs. Wait, wait, wait. W-What's goin' on here? We are the hosts! Yeah, and, uh, aren't you a little too three-dimensional to host an animated show, young lady? Yes. Yes, I am. But I'm doing it anyway, so just deal with it. B-But we have hosting contracts and everything! Did you read your contract? Nobody reads them, they're like a hundred pages long and pages 2 through 99 are useless. Like, like parsley on a dinner plate. Nobody eats it. And you know, if they're gonna put stuff on your plate that you're not going to eat, why not make it something useful, like aâ Like a keychain or, or gold doubloons. Dude, why are you rambling on about parsley? You're bringing the entire energy of the show down! Maybe you guys can be my co-hosts! Co-hosts? I don't like the sound of that. Sounds like a demotion. Enough of you two. You guys ready? Let's get this party started! There were so many songs to pick from, I mean, just take a look at all of them. Wow, that is a lot of songs. You guys voted and now we're gonna rock the top 10! Here's number 10! Is this the Phineas and Ferb party? Sure is. Phineas and Ferb parties rule! It's not their party, it's my party! And it's not a party, it's an intimate get together. What was that? Put that down. Pardon me! Use a napkin! What is my science teacher doing here? I never miss a Phineas and Ferb party! First of all, it's not a party, but if it were a party, it would not be their party, it would be my party!  (Candace party! Candace party!)   It's not a party, it's an intimate get together!   (Candace party! Candace party!)   Don't call it that, it's just a get together!   (Candace party! Candace party!)   Don't spill your drink   Don't drop your food   Don't make the music in the house go boom   Hey, don't use my mom's good scissors   And please stay out of my room!   Take your feet off the chair   No running in the house   Put a coaster under that drink   Hey, these tchotchkes aren't for juggling   And that's a toilet, not a sink!

Don't worry, Kelly. I am totally down for being second banana. Well, first of all, that's a little sad. But, second of all, technically, you would be third banana. It would go, Kelly, and then me, and then you. And, itâ I would be second banana. Nobody is a banana, because there are no bananas! Yes, we have no bananas! Here's the song rolling in at number 9! Excellent. From the top of this building, everyone in the Tri-State Area should be able to hear us.  Perry   You know you are a boy's best friend   You're more than just a passing trend   You're like a treat from a candy store   Oh, Perry   We love you more than ice cream cakes   We love you more than bugs and snakes   We love you more than all things mentioned before   Oh, Perry   You're extraordinary   You're kinda short and hairy   The color of a blueberry   Yes, Perry   So come home, Perry   Come home, Perry, come home  Hey, Candace, why don't you sing one?

This is going to be a fantastic countdown! Um, just one thing, you guys. We seriously have to do something about your your fashion. It's just not working. Well, really? You look a bit, like, stiff and-and uniformy. Right, guys? Uniformy? Is that even a word? Yeah, ""uniformy."" If you look it up, there's a picture of you. You're one to talk. What? I mean that whole laboratory look was never in, even if you are an ""evil scientist"". You should try a cape. A cape? Where am I gonna get a cape at this hour? You could try a Nehru jacket. Well, go and get changed then. If I could get a Nehru jacket, I could get a cape. Men. While my co-hosts go backstage and bring their fashions into this century, here's song 8.

That's it. Look it up, kids. That's what the internet is for. That was fun! Great idea, Kelly. Thank you. But, but, voguing was my idea! I started to say ""voguing"" and you just cut me off right before when Iâ When I just got ""vo"" out. You know, I-Iâ W-What did you think I was gonna say? Vociferous? What other words start with ""vo""? Give it a rest, Heinz. He's always like this. That's it! That is it! You will rue the day that you demoted Heinz Doofenshmirtz to co-host! Hm. You know what that means? I think I do. More hosting for us! All right! Here's a little ditty I like to call ""Song Number 7""!  Through the eye of the needle   Time to loosen your tongue   Got a tip how to make ends meet   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   Gets us all up on our feet, yeah, yeah, yeah   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   We're tying the world together   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   We're tying the world together   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   We're gonna tie the world together   (Aglet!)   A-G-L-E-T, don't forget it   We're gonna tie the world together   (Aglet!)   One word at a time!  Ladies and gentlemen, my sister, Candace Flynn!  And in the end of most important thing   Is that we never forget   The end of a shoelace is called the  The Uh Wait a minute! It doesn't matter! I can't believe I was almost sucked into this! Are you guys having as much fun as I am? Yes! Now that I'm back in my old clothes, uniformy or not. I predict the Nehru jacket will make a comeback. Hmm. Not gonna happen. Oh. But you know what is gonna happen? Song number 6! So Phineas, what do you think of the City of Love? I wish it was the City of Airplane Parts. Oh, you're just too stressed. You should take a moment to relax and enjoy it.  We could share a crÃªpe sucrÃ©e   At this Parisian cafÃ©  Huh. That awning could be used as a sail. Or, you know, a parachute, depending on how things go.  Take a break and smell these flowers   Underneath the Eiffel Tower  I wonder if they still have pieces of that hanging around? The rivets would come in handy. Oh, Phineas  Won't you share a crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e with me?  Hey, look at that nifty little blow torch!  How perfect could this be   In the City of Love?   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   We could try some fancy cheese   Or peruse the galleries  I wonder if oil-based paint is combustible as a rocket fuel.  Isn't this a perfect day?   How do I look in this beret?  Oh, that reminds me, we might need helmets!  Oh, how can he not feel the same way   When we're strolling down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es   In the City of Love?   (In the City of Love)   (In the City of Love)   I wish that he would whisper ""ma chÃ©rie, je t'aime""   But all he wants to do is try to fix that plane   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)   In the City of Love   (In the City of Love)  Hey, you! Stop letting my balloons go! Okay, little Miss Osbourne, prepare to say hello to your doom, at the hands ofâ Okay, little Miss Osbourne, prepare to say hello to your doom, at the hands ofâ Well, I guess in this case, in the head of the man who is not your co-host! Wow. That was close. Wait. Was that Perry the Platypus? Great, they're probably letting him host the show.  Perry!  Everyone, welcome Perry! Oh my gosh, this day just keeps getting better and better! You know, I was hoping that you'd stop by. Do youâ Do you want to introduce the next song? Let me translate for you guys. What I believe he just said was, ""Swinging in at song number 5 is"" Summer It sounds dangerous, yet oddly compelling. What is it? What is summer? Man, where do I begin?  The days are longer   The nights are shorter   The sun is shining   It's noticeably warmer   Summer, every single moment is worth its weight in gold   Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told   It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin   It's summer, man, where do we begin?   Summer is ponds and pools and garden hoses, tryin' to beat the heat   Summer, bicycles and roller skates and even just bare feet   It's also   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nanobots   Or locating Frankenstein's brain   Finding a dodo bird   Painting a continent or driving our sister inâ  Oh, wait. Maybe we're going too fast.  Summer, it's crickets and cicadas and a glass of lemonade   Summer, it's sitting with your brother in the backyard under the shade of a big tree   That's what it means to me   The days are longer   The nights are shorter   The sun is shining   It's noticeably warmer   Summer, every single moment is worth its weight in gold   Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told   It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin   It's summer, man, where do we begin?   It's summer, man, where do we begin?  That last song just makes me wanna move and groove, but enough about me. Because I have a surprise for everyone. A friend of mine wanted to stop by and say hi, so please, put your hands together and give a warm welcome to Maia Mitchell! Hi! Everyone, I was watching from backstage and I could not wait to get out here! I love all the songs so far! I know, right? Aren't they fun? Yeah, they're amazing! And, Kelly, you are doing an awesome job of hosting. Isn't she? No, no, you're great! And, Major Monogram, I'm Maia. Pleasure to meet you, young lady. And Perry! I love you! You're my favorite, actually, because, we have something in common. What's that? We're both from Australia. Didn't even think of that. That's so cool! That is so cool. Maia, why don't you introduce the next song? Yeah, I was actually waiting for you to ask me to do that. Check it out! It's number 4! Do I know you? Yeah, I'm you from another dimension. Well, that would explain the handsomeness. Right back at you, big guy. Does that mean you and I are exactly alike? I suppose so.  Do you want some rice pudding?  Blech, no, that's gross!  It was a test! Almond brittle?   Ooh, I love it the most!  Me too!  Do you collect coins?   Yeah, just in case   Vending machines become the dominant race!   I've been alone all these years  With my irrational fears  But not the vending machine thing. That's gonna happen.  But now before me I see   Someone with whom I agree   I've found a brand new best friend and it's me   I've found a brand new best friend and it's me   Hmm, I thought I'd be taller   I've been told I slouch   I thought I've have both my eyes, you know  It's in this pouch. Ouch! You know, I can't help but notice that your scar goes over your eyepatch. Yeah? Nothing.  Do llamas weird you out?   Yeah, are they camels or sheep?   No, no, I meant Lorenzo  Oh, that's right.  He played Meap!   Now I know all about you   And you know all about me   Ooh-wee-ooh   And now before me I see   Someone with whom I agree   I've found a brand new best friend and it's me   I've found a brand new best friend and it's me   Now that I've found you   Or we can be a duo  That's right.  Twice the evil   Double Doofenshmirtz   Coming at you Fridays!  What's that, are we doing a TV show together? Oh, no. It just sort of sounded like that. I-I mean, we could. We should! Hmm, maybe we're not so much alike. That can be your catchphrase! You're the grumpy one. Eh? There are so many great songs! I know! What did you think about that last song, Perry? I-I have aâ I have a confession. What's that? I might, uh make Perry noises when no one's looking. You're kidding! Me, too! You do? All the time! Make that three! Sir, I just wanted to check and see if youâ Maia Mitchell! I'm your biggest fan! Love your voice and your work! Thank you so much. You're really sweet. Hey, you know what? I've got an idea. Why don't we all make Perry noises together? Yeah! You ready? Yeah. Ready? Okay. Nobody does it better than Perry. I'll never get tired of that. Me neither. Well, sadly, I have to go. No! Really? Yeah, but thank you so much for having me. Thank you so much for stopping by! Of course, my pleasure. Maia Mitchell, everyone! Bye! Hey, I'll walk you out! Looks like someone's got a schoolboy crush. You think? Anyway, let's get back to the countdown. Here's number 3. Who's up for charades? Perry the Platypus, what are you doing down here? Dad? Oh, hi, Vanessa. Dad, what are you doing?  Well, I'll be honest, I don't really understand   But I fell down this hill now I got glue on my hands   And I got records on my fingers   (Whaaat?)   Records on my fingers   I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   (Don't stop!)   I can't stop, I got a platypus controlling me   (Whaaat?)   I got a platypus controlling me   Now let me sum it up   It was a strange set of circumstances   (Strange set of circumstances)   I fell down the hill, I got glue on my hands   Now I got records on my fingers and I just can't stop   (Don't stop! Don't stop!)   Well I would if I was able   There's a platypus controlling me, he's underneath the table   (There's a platypus controlling him)   (Whaaat?)  Oh, I get it! Platypus is a metaphor for whatever's keeping you down!  Like corporations are a platypus   The government's a platypus   Your teacher is a platypus  My teacher is a panda.  Society's a platypus   My parents are a platypus   The media's a platypus   It's all just propaganda   Yeah, we all got a platypus controlling us   Just me   We all got a platypus controlling us   I'd stop if I was able   We all got a platypus controlling us   I'm not speaking metaphorically   The platypus controlling me is underneath the table  Wait! Oh, wait, no, he's gone! Hey!  There's no platypus controlling me!   There's no platypus controlling me!  Your dad's kinda cool. You're my punk-rock boyfriend! You're not supposed to think my dad is cool! It only matters that I think he's cool. She thinks I'm cool! You know what'd be really cool? To write a song, so next year the song can be on the countdown! Well, as a fellow musician, I heartily agree. Oh, you're a musician? Well, yes, from, uh From time to time, I like to strum the ukulele. Ah! Uh Did I miss Maia Mitchell? I'm afraid so. Ah, bummer. Anyway, as a musician, not as a co-host, mind you, I'd like to get in on this little songwriting thing you're about to do. What do you play? Oh, several things, but my instrument of choice is the kazoo. You rock the kaz? I do. Fine! Let's start with the lyrics then. Maybe we can do some sort of a round robin kinda thing and write a line, and the next person can rhyme it. Oh, good idea. Me first, me first. Uh, let's see, um ""When I wake up in the morning sun"" ""I realize you're the only one."" Oh, now it's me. Oh, yeah.  ""And by the moon that's also silver""  Dude, really? What? What? There's no rhyme for the word ""silver"". Yeah, she's right. No, no, look! Eh, then Uh ""Bilver"" a-and there'sâ What, what? What is a ""bilver""? It's a water moving thingy. I believe what you're thinking of is a bilge pump. Oh. I've always called it a ""bilver"". Okay, how about this?  ""And by the moon that's also orange""  Oy. Is that better? See how I just rolled my eyes? Please roll clip number 2!  It's been a long, long day and there were moments when I doubted   That we'd ever reach the point where we could laugh and sing about it   Now the sun has set on this another extraordinary day   And when it comes around again, you know I'll say   Tell me what you wanna do today   All we need is a place to start if we have heart, we'll make it   'Cause we're not messin' around   (We're not messin' around)   Yes, we can dream it, do it, build it, make it   I know we can really take it   To the limit before the sun goes down   As soon as you wake up you gotta make your move   Don't miss the beat, just get into the groove   The sun is shinin', there's a lot that you can do   There's a world of possibilities outside your door   Why settle for a little, you can get much more   Don't need an invitation, every day is new   Yes, it's true   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun   There's nothing better to do   Summer belongs to you  All right, I'm taking a verse. Be my guest!  I traveled halfway 'round the world and almost turned and ran away   But you helped me get my courage back, so now I've got to say   That though I've often thought of you as just a nuisance and a bother   Today I can't imagine having better little brothers   And you gotta believe in something   So today I believed in you and you came through, we made it   I've never been so proud   Never been so proud   I know at first it seemed implausible   But we accomplished the impossible   Now there's something that I've got to say out loud   Time is what you make of it, so take a chance  That's it!  Life is full of music so you ought to dance  She's got it!  The world's a stage and it is time for your debut  By Jove, I think she's got it!  Don't waste a minute sitting on that chair  Yeah!  The world is callin', so just get out there  That's what I'm talking about!  You can see forever so your dreams are all in view   Yes, it's true   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to everyone, so have some fun   There's nothing better to do  Hey, Candace!  Summer belongs to you  Jeremy!  (Summer belongs to you)  You came back early!  Summer belongs to you  Well, I missed my girlfriend.  (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to boys and girls all around the world  Ooh, I like the sound of that! Besides, you forgot something in France.  We wouldn't say it if it wasn't true  I did? What? This.  Summer belongs to you  Hm?  (Summer belongs to you)   Baby, baby, baby, baby   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Whatever you want to do, you make the rules   You got the tools to see it through   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Summer belongs to you   (Summer belongs to you)   Just remember that you can do it and when you're through it   Will change your point of view   Summer belongs to you!  Right, guys, before we roll our last clip, I have to know something. Do you have a favorite song on the countdown? Well, I'm, uh I'm particularly partial to number three. And I like number seven, that's my lucky number. It all started when I was seven years old, back in Drusselsteinâ W-W-Wait, wait, wait. Y-You're doing a flashback. Oh, yeah, it's kinda my thing. I do a lot of these, uh It'sâ I'm really sorry, but we can't fit that in. So, back thereâ Well, what if I make it short? We still don't have time because It's the moment we've all been waiting for! And I can't believe this, but you all picked my favorite song as the number one song! You guys have fabulous taste, I'm just saying. You guys ready? It's Everything's Better with Perry! It's Everything's Better with Perry! Good morning, Perry! Now that's the way to wake up. This is gonna be the best day ever.  We consider every day a plus   To spend it with a platypus   We're always so ecstatic   'Cause he's semi aquatic   Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus   Brings smiles to the both of us   Life's never fuddie duddy with our web-footed buddy   When we're brushing our teeth   (Ooh)   It's better   Tying our shoes   (Oh, yeah!)   It's better   Combing our hair   It's better   Like we're a cheese sandwich and he's the cheddar   Blinking our eyes   (Oh, yeah)   It's better   Breathing in and out   (So much better!)   It's better   Sitting in a chair   It's better   And taking a bath, just a little bit wetter   Every day is such a dream   When you start it with a monotreme   He's duck-billed and he's beaver-tailed and hairy   (You know that he's hairy)   Everything's better with Perry   (Everything's better with Perry)   Everything's better with Perry   (Everything's better with Perry)   Everything is better with Perry   (Everything is better)   (Everything's better with Perry)   (Everything is better with Perry)   Everything's better and we just want to tell you, Perry   Everything's better with you   (Better with you)  Well, this has been the most amazing day! And to quote my favorites, Phineas and Ferb, ""The best day ever!"" I completely concur. Okay, okay, I've been reconsidering and I'm going to give in. I'm totally gonna be your co-host. That's great. Butâ So what are my co-hosting duties? What's next on the old co-hosting train I jumped aboard? What do I do? Say goodbye, Dr. D. That's it? Goodbye, Dr. D! Goodbye. Thank you so much, everybody, that was so much fun! I'm gonna be singing these songs all day! See you next time!"
"Okay, gang. Today, we're gonna tie a legendary knot. Whoa, whoa, whoa! We're just startin'?! Noâ No intro, nothin'?! Just gettin' right into it? Yep, we're just doin' the knot. Wait, how can we do something not? No, it's ""knot"" spelled with a ""k"". I didn't think it was spelled with a ""k"". No. It's ""knot"" spelled with a ""k"". It's ""knot"" spelled with a ""k"". I don't understand your pauses. Let me start over. Today, we're going to reproduce the Gordian Knot. Well, why didn't you say so in the first place? I've heard of that, but I can't remember the story. I got this. Back in the day where men wore miniskirts Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle. Alexander the Great was vacationing in Gordium, when he came upon a celebrated oxcart that was tied to a post using a knot that was so complicated, it was impossible to untie. So he just sliced it in half in one bold stroke. A simple solution to a complicated problem, hence the phrase, ""Cutting the Gordian Knot."" I've never heard that phrase! That is new to me. Trust me, it's a thing. So, we'll tie these ropes around our waists, follow this blueprint to recreate it, then it's up to us to figure out how to get loose. That will make us the second people to tie the Gordian Knot, but the first people to untie it! What if we cannot untie it? No problem. Our mom was always really good with knots. There was this one time when Candaceâ Hey! I thought we weren't going to bring up the clothesline incident ever again! Oh, right. Anyway, would you mind getting Mom if we get stuck in the ginormous Gordian Knot we're making? When it gets big and weird, I'll go get Mom. Excellent! Does everyone have their ropes tied? All right, let see. Isabella and Buford, make two loops where you're standing. Great! You're good to start climbing. Baljeet, turn twice counterclockwise and then dive in five loops from the bottom. Then Ferb and I will do this and this and this, and we'll join you inside. Shall we? Absolutely. Let's go, bro! Baljeet and Ferb, twist to the right and wiggle towards the top. Hey, where's Perry? Morning, Agent P! Seems that Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been hitting every all-you-can-eat buffet in town, which can't be good! And if anything were to happen to Doofenshmirtz, we would have to make some drastic cuts over here! Especially in the non-essential personnel department. Good luck, Agent P. Oh, don't worry about the mess, uh Carl will take care of it. I guess that makes me essential, huh? Don't get cocky, Carl. Hey, Candace. Hi, Jeremy. What a nice surprise! Ooh, what's that? Oh, it's an old mini safe of mine that I found in the back of my closet. I've had it for ages, but I haven't used it in so long that I forgot the combination. I thought your brothers could open it. I figured that's a ""safe"" bet. So, what's in it? That's the thing. I don't remember. Maybe it's a rare baseball card. No, I sold all those a long time ago. Um, could it be your favorite toy car from when you were a kid? No, I traded that for this safe. Well, maybe it's something cute, like your baby teeth. Nope. Definitely not. I still got those. Ew. I mean, cute! Yeah, the Tooth Fairy never visited me when I was a kid. Anyway, could you give this to your brothers? I gotta rush to work. Sure. I'll give it to them as soon as they finish their Ferbian Knot. Don't ask. See you later, alligator! In a while, crocodile! You guys have got to work on your pet names for each other. So what's in the safe? I don't know. But it's not baby teeth. Okay, everybody. Two twists to the left and we should all see daylight. Well, I just earned my Overcoming Claustrophobia Patch! Ugh! Daylight! Now what? Now we burrow back in and untie ourselves. You gotta be kiddin' me! Who looked at this idea and said, ""Yeah, that'd be fun""? You see?! This is what happens when we have no intro! I have been making mental notes of the paths and probabilities as I have gone along. It will be a piece of cake. If I just walk backwards, it should work. To heck with this game! I'm just gonna chill here for a while. Hey! Who's pullin' on my rope?! Over here, Perry the Platypus. I'm just having a little lunch. Why don't you pull up a chair and join me? What do you think? Pretty clever, right? It's my new high chair trap! I thought of a high chair 'cause you're just a little guy. Aren't'cha? Yes, you are. You're just a little guy. Hey, you're not getting outta this so why don't you enjoy the food? It's All-You-Can-Eat, you know. Y-You're good? You're already full, right? Me, too. I barely touched my plate. That's how these all-you-can-eat places make their money. They charge you like you're gonna eat a week's worth, but then, when you fill up after, like, two plates, t-they've really made a profit. That's why I'm opening up my own All-You-Can-Eat Drusselsteinian buffet! Look. I've already made a commercial for it. All-You-Can-Eat Drusselsteinian Buffet! It's food the way your mother never made! We've got Hassenfloffer Entrail Waterzooi, with Gopher Gut Au Gratin! Fuzzy Fungus Flugelbrotchen! And an assortment of tripe-based desserts! And those brave enough can try our new Mystery Lump! Remember, ""Doof"" spelled backwards is ""fooD""! You know, come to think of it, it really should be called the All-You-Can-Stand, because Drusselsteinian food is terrible! That's the beauty of it. Nobody will be able to finish even one plate's worth! My profit margin will be huge! But, first, I've got to eliminate the competition, with this the Eat-It-All-Inator! You see, it gives people a huge appetite, so everyone will eat so much that all of these All You Can Eat places will go out of business! Then my restaurant will be packed! Maniacal laughter. What do you suppose it is? It's probably some dumb boy stuff like firecrackers or turtle shells. Or maybe it's his secret inner thoughts written as a sonnet. No, no, no, no, that's not it! I gotta think more like my brothers. You know, use my imagination. This could be dangerous. Maybe it's a secret spy plan. Or a glass eye! Or Abraham Lincoln's beard! Now, just watch what happens when I zap those people over there. Huh? What happened? How could I miss? Oh, I'm so hungry all of a sudden! Oh, that was great! Iâ I can cut out the middleman and do all the eating myself! I'm going down for seconds. How can you eat like that and stay so thin? Oh, I built an All-You-Can-Eat-inator that speeds up your metabolism so you don't gain any weight no matter how much you eat, ever. You should mass produce that machine! Everyone would buy one! You'd be a millionaire! Don't worry about me making money, mister! I-I've got a complicated plan. Iâ Like I'm gonna take advice from some guy in a diner. (Song: Gordian Knot)  There's a legend I've heard, or so it's been taught   'Bout Alexander the Great and the Gordian Knot   Looked it up on the net so that we could recreate it   Now the knot we have here is quite complicated   It's got closed bends, loop splices, bowlines and lashings   Maybe we can loosen it with just a little thrashing   Square knots, sheepshanks and all kinds of hitches   When it comes to constraint, there's an embarrassment of riches   It's already a knot, so ready or not   We're gonna try to untie it, though it's terribly taut   So it won't be for naught, we'll give it all that we've got   To untie the un-untieable knot   We don't know what it is, but we know what it's not   It's not a Gutenberg press or a coffee pot   It's not a car or a tractor 'cause the safe's too small   And a fish or a piano wouldn't make sense at all   It's already a knot, so ready or not   We're gonna try to untie it, though it's terribly taut   So it won't be for naught, we'll give it all that we've got   To untie the un-untieable knot   To untie the un-untieable knot   To untie the un-untieable  Not even close! Not even close! That's it, I'm gettin' the boys.  Doo bee doo bee doo bah   Perry!  Looks like we've all got just a few more moves to get untied. Except for Buford, who's managed to tie himself into a knot. I'm a victim o' circumstance. Phineas and Ferb, you've gotta open this safe and tell me what's inside! It's drivin' me crazy! Sure. We'd love to. As soon as we finish untying the Gordian Knot. Alright, it's big and weird. Ma! In a minute, Candace!  Doo bee doo bee doo bah doo  Ha! You're too late, Perry the Platypus! Buffet Number Two is history! I am starting to feel a little full though. Hmm. I thought it would last more than a few minutes. Better give myself a little boost. That's more like it! Wow, I am so hungry, I could eat everything at Buffet Number Three, baby! Yeah! Oh, give up, Perry the Platypus, those chairs areâ Oh, man, I swallowed my inator. Oh, well, at least you can't destroy it now, because it's inside my stomach. So, today, I win! Okay, you broke it. I can feel all the little pieces just rumbling around in there. I'm starving! What's that sweet smell? Probably licorice. We used it to make the ropes as a failsafe in case Mom wasn't around. Perfect! Wow, I never knew Candace was such a licorice fan. Hey, thanks. I am so in love with her right now. What? Nothin'. That's a solution to the Gordian Knot that even Alexander the Great wouldn't have come up with. Alright, Candace, what am I looking at? I ate it! It was the size of the house and I ate it! You ate it? I know, I don't believe it either! Well, what is that? It's a safe. I can't open it. Gimme that thing! I got an opener that can open anything! Â¡Para usted, seÃ±orita! (For you, miss!) A pencil? This is what I've been obsessed with all day, a pencil?! Oh, I remember that! In grade school, a pretty girl loaned me that pencil and I've kept it ever since. A pretty girl? Who was she? Candace, that pretty girl was you. See, those are your teeth marks. Okay, Candace. You can eat the rest of that pencil. Unless you'd like to join us all for some chocolate triple layer cake. Yay! Ugh! Ugh Oh, there you are, Perry! Hey, my baby teeth just fell out! Why don't you put 'em in here? Ew. I mean, cute!"
"Na, na, na, na, na  So this rock climbing wall will be big! And best of all, it'll be built out of all-natural, 100% organic, free-range yard trimmings! So, it is only a rock climbing wall? No, it's not only a rock climbing wall. It's free-range organic rock climbing wall! I can see how that would be relevant if we are going to eat it. We are not going to have to eat it, are we?! I guess if we had to, we couldâ Did I just hear we're building something we can eat? You know, for the record, I would like to not be in the position today, where I have to eat this wall. We'll see what we can do, but we're not making any promises. Mom, have you seen my other white skirt? What are those charts? Hon, the rare and elusive bent-bill nuthatch is in its nest building season. The birds will be done traveling North, and should be right here in town today! Snores-ville. No, dear, the bird took a left at Snores-ville, and is up here in Danville. Can I get one up high? Woo-hoo! Okay, more specifically, it should be right in our backyard at exactly 4 today! Isn't that exciting?! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! So, you and a bunch of trained observers are gonna be in our yard at exactly 4 in the P.M. today? Well, yes. Love it! The Booby-hatched trash-nut whatever it is, is my new favorite bird! This is awesome! See you guys later. See? She thinks it's fun. Oh, yes, and I'm British, so you think I'm supposed to like bird-watching. ""Oh, I'm British, so I'll be in the conservatory with a cup of tea and a crumpet."" I'm saying that ironically but actually that sounds quite good. So, I'm going to do that. Ta. Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah. This looks good. So, how long till you're done with this contraption? Think you'll still be out here at 4? I don't know. I guess so. Hi, Phineas. What'cha doin'? Hey, Isabella. Rock climbing wall. Well, I just came by to tell you I can't join in on the fun today. I've been charged with the task of recording the audiobook version of the Fireside Girls Compendium Guide. It's gonna take forever. That book does not look so intimidating. Dude! This is just the table of contents. The actual book is being transported from a secret bunker to our recording studio in the Fireside Girl Lodge. Seriously, this is gonna take me a week. Hey, we can help. We'll just put this rock climbing wall off till tomorrow. Wait. What? No! You guys keep working, I'll narrate the audiobook. You stay here and help the boys. And not only will I finish recording your book today, I'll do it by 4 o'clock. So, let me get this straight. You'll do all the work, while I spend the day with Phineas? Hm Deal! But do you know anyone that can work a state-of-the-art soundboard? Someone who can edit huge digital files? Someone who can understand basic miking techniques? What is it, Irving? Okay, I'll do it. But only if Isabella says, ""where's Perry?"" No deal. You drive a hard bargain, I admit. It's okay, I was about to ask that anyway! Ah, Agent P. We're getting reports that there is a distinct smell of confectioner sugar and icing coming from Doofenshmirtz's building. He must be up to something evil and sweet. Sweet and evil. ""Sweevil"", if you will. Go and stop him!  Perry!  Standby and put your cans on. Fireside Girls Compendium, introduction, page one, and take one. Whenever you're ready. ""Ma May Me Mo Mu. Topeka, Kansas. Topeka, Kansas."" Man, this is the worst book dedication ever! How're we doing in there, Irving? Levels are fine. ""Page one. Welcome, Fireside Girl. You're about to embark on a transformative journey that you will remember for years to come. and water should be boiled. Now on to Part 2 of the Introduction. Section 12, Part 6. How to Start a Fire Using Only Bobby Pins and a Hat. Section 25, Part 16. How to Tell If the Marshmallow is Properly Roasted."" Can I get you some water? Maybe. Keep it rollin'! Keep it rollin'. ""Beginning Section 25, Part 17."" Okay, gang. Is everybody all strapped in their harness? Ready! But, it is also the worst wedgie I have ever had. Oh, really? Present company excluded. Alrighty, then. Let's go! (Song: Rock Climbing Wall)  We keep on climbing, climbing like kudzu   A creeping ficus up a climbing wall   A social climber, climbing with debutantes   There's Escanaba, I can see Montreal   No, I've never been so happy   Felt alive or looked so tall   Plus it's also a good aerobic workout   Climbing up a rock climbing wall   As long as you don't fall!

Gingerbread house trap. Hey, it looks a lot bigger on the inside than it looks like on the outside. Here, have some cozy gumdrop slippers. Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. I think I know why I'm having a hard time taking over the Tri-State Area. It's because of dinner parties. That's right. Follow me, i-it goes somewhere. You see, my brother Roger is a success, because of his amazing dinner parties where he dazzles important guests with his magnetic charm. But, what if he were unable to charm anyone, because his fabulous dinner parties were over, before they began? That's why I created this the Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator! You see, everyone knows that once the dessert comes out, the party's over. That's whatâ That's what's called a social cue. This rocket will go into a Rogercentric orbit around his house. At the wrong moment, it will shoot a blast which will make Roger bring out the dessert. Ending his dinner party before it can begin. He'll lose his charming edge and people will lose interest in him. Bing-bang-boom! They'll stop voting for him, and that's when I'll slink in and takeovâ You know, I-I know I'm grasping at straws here, and uh probably end up grasping a bendy-straw, and fall on my face, requiring months of rehab to learn how to monologue, all over again, and then off to empowerment camp, where I'll have to fall backwards and hopefully no oneâ Who wants desserts? I made this lovely tiramisu. Hey, it works! Oh, you think you're very funny, Perry the Platypus, blasting me with my own Bring-out-the-Dessert-inator. Oh-ho-ho. I hope you left some room! I made a yummy double layered pumpkin cheesecake. It has creamyâ Oh! You got me again. Well, you made me bring it to you, so you're gonna eat it. Ow! Now, it's your turn to bring out theâ How about a banana split? Finally got your just desserts! Good one, right? What are you doing with that pound cake? I was saving that for company! Oh! Oh, wow! Perry the Platypus, I'm getting such a sugar rush! How 'bout you? ""In conclusion, may your Fireside Girl experience be a treasured one with memories for a lifetime. The end."" Um I'd like you to do one more take on that last chapter. I'd like to hurt you. That's a wrap! Hey, guys! I can see my thoughts! They're all sparkly and spread out around us. It is the lack of oxygen, it makes you light-headed. I think it's time to climb down. Coming down! Oh, I get it, we're in space. I heard that. Can you do this, Perry the Platypus? Can you jump really fast, up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down? Yeah, that's it, Perry the Platypus! Doesn't it feel good? Let's be jumping buddies. Let's just eat dessert and jump up and down and up and down and up and down all day. It'll be our thing. Just remember. I-I invented it, because I'm the inventor. Yes, it's still here! Hey, Candace! How'd it go? I finished recording, Irving's uploading it to the Fireside Girl mainframe as we speak. Thanks so much, Candace! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, the important thing. To get Mom out here. Mom! Mom! Do you want me to get Mom? No! You stay here. Nobody move. If we leave, this thing'll disappear. She'll be out here in two minutes, with her bird watching group. I'll wait. Jump. Jump. Jump.

W-What's that? Protein and carbohydrates? No, d-don't eat that! No! Okay, but But let's do that jumping thing again sometime, huh? Okay, gang. Everyone, follow me outside. The bird should be rightâ Hey, who's ready for dessert? Doesn't that sound good? Oh, see now? Brits like desserts. Does this mean she wants us to leave? Well, according to social convention, I guess. Welcome, Perry the Platypus. What took you so long? I'm speaking to you through this amplifier right next to the self-destruct button. The rocket will soon be in orbit around my brother's house, ready for the next dinner party. And you can ride that rocket until your tail falls off, I don't care. Or until you find the self-destruct button which is right next toâ Oh, dang it! Curse you Perry the Plat typus. Mom! Candace? Mom! Mom, come outside! Hon, I can't hear you. Let's talk in a minute. Who wants this Ã  la mode? Mom! Look! Ooh, it's the rare bent-bill nuthatch! Isn't she beautiful? She's finding material for her nest. Well, I guess they've got a lot of nests to make. We did build the thing out of pressed twigs and lawn clippings. Nature's little recyclers at work. Come on, come on! What? What? No! But, but, but Oh, honey, I see it! What? Don't move. Hold still. Got it! Oh, Candace, I wouldn't have seen it, if you hadn't grabbed me forcibly and pulled me out here. Thank you! So, you kids want some dessert? Yeah! Some tea with honey would help that throat. And there's crumpets in the conservatory as well. He's so British. Let's go!

"Well, Ferb, we can cross that one off our bucket list. Hey, guys! What'cha doin'? Uh, I think the bigger question is, what are you doing, Buford? I'm filling in for Isabella while she's visitin' her grandparents in New Mexico. The dress was all his idea, though. Hey, I got the legs for it. Ah, New Mexico. My great grandfather once saw something mysterious in New Mexico. There he was, happily plying his trade, cow-punching. It was a dangerous profession. Darn tootin'. And one day, he saw it.  Chupacabra Ho!  What the Sam Hill?! Huh? It was the elusive chapricobra. The what? Based on his extensive history of malapropisms, I would say that he is talking about the chupacabra, the Latin American goat sucker, that is said to haunt the deserts of Mexico and South-Western America. That's just a myth. Like the Lake Nose Monster, and Klimpaloon, the magical old timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas. Um, have you not proven those things to be true? So we have. Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today. We're gonna search for the elusive creature that tends to slip away unseeâ Hey! Where's Perry? I-Is this thing on? I want to thank you all for taking some time outta your busy schedules to attend our compulsory O.W.C.A. Animal Sensitivity Seminar. However, if you currently are an animal, you may be excused to your missions. Whaâ Whatâ What, they get to go? What is this, Pick On the Higher Species Day? What?! Humans are a higher species. Everybody knows that! And that's why you're here today, Sir. Gentlemen and gentlemen, we present to you the Chupa-Copter! Wow! Right on! Et cetera. Alright, everyone! Take your seats and buckle up! We're off to New Mexico to find the elusive chupacabra! But what are we going to use as bait? Oh, I get that handled. Check it out! It's reversible! Ta-da! A goat costume! Alright, then! Let's start trackin' us a chupacabra! Searching chupacabra traits. Rooting, sniffing, long neck, desert dwelling. Rooting, sniffing, long neck, desert dwelling. Rooting, sniffing, long neck, desert dwelling. Rooting, sniffing, long neck, desert dwelling. Ferb, let's light this candle! Look! Everything in my wardrobe is jinxed! Jinxed? Uh-huh. I was wearing this one when the boys made a giant gelatin monster. I was wearing this one when the boys split me into like, fifty mes. This one is from the whole Meap thing. And this one Well, I just spilled grape juice on it. Begin analysis. Rooting. Ooh. Je Bust Number 12. Sniffing. I think I could wear this tonight. Long neck. Non-desert dwelling. Not chupacabra. Wait. Somebody's judging me. Phineas and Ferb! You're so busted for something! You're so busted for something!  Dooby dooby doo-bah   Dooby dooby doo-bah   Perry!  Well, hello, Perry the Platypus. You like the new biplane? Pretty sweet huh? Uh, I got it off the internet. Don't worry about your hat, the heat is really good for the felt. Look what I invented. It grows your hair back. I got it in all the stores, but it's not selling as well as I thought it would. I don't know why, it's even got a catchy name. Get Back Hair.  Get Back Hair!  It should be flying off the shelves. I-I just don't get it. Anyway, that is about to change. Behold, the Switch-Place-inator! Behold, the Switch-Place-inator! Whaâ Why do you look so unimpressed? I-I'll explain. I simply fly over town in my biplane, Ride Off and I look for someone with a receding hairline, standing next to someone with a full head of hair. I fire, and presto! The hairdos switch places. The person who was formally hairline-challenged is thrilled, and the other guy is Well, he's gonna spend a lot of money to get his hair back. Thus, Get Back Hair.  Get Back Hair!  Here, I'll show you how it works. Okay, Perry the Platypus, how'd you like to trade places with a hungry, man-eating shark? Oh, yeah, you're a semi-aquatic. Well, I've got some other tricks up my sleeve. Like switching places with aâ Ow! Oh, man, I did not see that coming! Okay, seÃ±or pantalones inteligente! That's, Mr. Smarty Pants Spanish. Tanks for playing, Perry the Platypus. See you around! Okay, guys. Welcome to New Mexico. Ferb, let's lower the chupacabra bait. Hey! Hey, watch the cactuses! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Hey, who's driving up there? Baljeet? Sorry. Now, to go make my millions with my trusty Switch-Place-inator! Where is it? Perry the Platypus, y-you didn't by any chanceâ Ugh! Hand it over. It belongs to me. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Give it, give it. Whoa! Yeah! This is what I call ""fly fishing""! Yes! Yes! Attaboy! Woo-hoo! Okay, make a wish. What'd you wish for? Really, that's what you wished for? I'm gonna wait right here until the bustees return. Oh, and they will return. So Since you're in busting mode, I take it, my services are not required? Yep, I'm superfluous.

Yes, surprising, is it not? Well, I think he's kinda cute. Now, we just have to get him back home. Wow. The chupacabra doesn't sound too happy. Aha! A real live chupacabra, eh? Wait til Mom sees this! I bet he's hungry. I totally sound like that when my blood sugar's low. Does your mom have any goat-based food products? I don't know. Can't hurt to check the fridge. Now's my chance! Woo! Evidence at last! Wait a minute. Let's just make sure it's really in here. Here chupaâ This is the best day ever! Wait a minute. I'd better move this to the front lawn where Mom can see it right when she gets home. Hello? Mom? Hi, Candace. What is it? Mom, listen. The boys have caught a chupacabra. You have to get home quick and bust them. Take it easy, honey, I'm just a few blocks away. Awesome, thanks! Whew! Now, all I do is wait. While I sit on top of the crate for safe-keeping. Hold that thought. Mom will be back soon. Ha! How convenient that your mother has a whole terrine of goat biryani. I know, right? Those gourmet cooking classes are sure comin' in handy. Hey, wait for me guys! Whoa! The chupacabra's gone! This must be how Candace feels when this happens. You know, I've had it with you, Perry the Platypus. You never, never let me have aâ Curse you, Perry the Platypus! Agent P. We've just heard that our New Mexico operative, Agent CH, has had his cover compromised. We have the coordinates of his location, and you are the closest agent. Get to it. Keep writing, Sir. Mom, you won't believe this. Now, Candace, why would you ever give me reason not to believe you? What if I told you, that Phineas and Ferb captured an actual chupacabra? Well, that would test my suspension of disbelief. Well, disbelieve no more, 'cause I've got it right here! And it's not going anywhere. Right. Oh, ye of excessive sarcasm. I present to you the elusive, chupacabra! I present to you the elusive, chupacabra! I present to you the elusive, chupacabra! I don't believe it. Hey! How did I get into that crate? Well, I'm at least glad to see you kids are going to finish up my leftover biryani. Yes, ma'am. But But, but, but  Chupacabra ho  I don't get it. He usually shows up by now. Oh, there you are Perry. You'll never believe this, but for a while there, we had a real, live chupacabra. Here, we took pictures. Next. Next. Next. Next. Well, I guess perhaps the universe wants some things left un-photographed. Like chupacabras, or group photos where everyone has their eyes open."
"Futons, bouillon, platypus food Ooh, microwave popcorn! Need this. And I have sodas. What else do we wanna bring over to your house? Doesn't matter. I doubt we'll even be able to eat while watching this movie. The Grievance. So scary, no one over the age of 45 will even watch it! It will be even scarier 'cause my family's out for the day and we'll be alone at the house. Great! Candace, are you sure you can handle this?

And why are you wearing a hat? Look out! And who's this pharmacist? Really? Really? W-Why does everyone just stampede to that conclusion? O-Other people wear lab coats, you know. Why-why don't you say, ""Oh, look, a rocket scientist."" Or a veterinarian? Are you a veterinarian? No, but that's not the point! Check it out! We made your favorite, a red velvet cake with a little surprise. Ooh! I hope they do not have a male dancer popping out of it. They asked, but they couldn't afford me. Will you do the honors, Ferb? Make a wish. I wish for time alone with Phineas. What are you doing? Waiting for things to get dangerous, so I can call my mom to come bust the boys. That's not dangerous? Dude, this is nothing. It'll get worse. So, did you get what you wished for? Uh Yeah, it's every girl's wish to have her backyard covered in litter. Let's go, you two. Next event! You're gonna love this.

I mean, is all this really necessary? Wait a minute! It says right here in your silly little pamphlet that if your host family finds out about your agent status, then everyone who's seen you has to have their memory erased, or you'll get relocated. Perry, I'm not part of your host family! I know, I know, it's a technicality. Look, I don't want Candace and the boys to lose you, but I also do not want my mind erased. I'm on the last ten minutes of that Grievance movie, and I don't want to watch that whole scary mess again. So, uh Can we just keep this a secret? Luckily, Sir, it looks like the residents were not home. Hello? Uh, anybody there? I'll take care of it. Oh, hello there, young teenager. Do you live here? Yes. I walked home from the mall to find this. I walked home from the mall to find this. What is happening here? Oh, you didn't see what happened? Well, um We're with the city, and there was a swamp gas incident here. We'll just get it all cleaned up, and get out of your hair. Psst. Hey, Carl. We're not gonna need the mind-erasing deviâ Iâ I mean, monkey wrench. It's a monkey wrench, yeah. We don't need that. Happy birthday, Isabella! Thanks, guys! I still can't figure out what went wrong with the grand finale. After the laser light show and the fireballs, the swans should have been released, andâ Phineas, I really liked the butterflies. Thank you. Well, to make it up to you, it's kinda lame but Maybe Ferb and I could, I don't know, take you out for some ice cream or something? Uh I just remembered there's something I need to do. I just remembered there's something I need to do. You two go. Is that cool? Yes, very cool! Ferb. So, did you get what you wished for? Oh, yeah, I already asked that. Confetti and streamers. Hold on, gonna get another napkin. And butterflies. You always give me butterflies. Ah, look at them out there. What are they up to? Ah, it looks like Phineas is saying, ""Where's Perry?"" Huh. Where do you think Perry goes everyday, Stace? How do I know?! Why are you asking me?! How should I know?! Uh, don't look at me! Huh, I don't know why I was asking you. Whew! No one suspects a thing."
"1 ""Thanks But No Thanks""   There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   - This was nice. - Yeah, I'm glad we ran into each other.  Yeah. Almost literally. You barely missed me with your scooter.  [LAUGHS SHEEPISHLY.] What can I say? You walk slow.  So, uh, what're you doing tonight?  Yeah, I'm going to see Love Sandal.  It's a Love Handle cover band that, uh,  that plays in sandals.  My cousin plays bass. He can get us backstage.  It'll be fun. You wanna come?  Uh, no. No, I don't.  I'll catch you later.  I'll keep an eye out for that scooter.  Monty and Vanessa sitting in a tree   - Carl! - Let me finish.  K-I-S-S-I-N-G   - Go ahead. - You mean there's more?  Look, you don't have to tell my Dad about this, do you?  Monty, Monty. Walk with me.  [SLYLY.] You know, your dad is my superior.  I'm obliged to tell him everything.  I can't imagine what could possibly sway me  to consider such a dereliction of duty.  All right, Carl, I get it. What do you want?  I want your father to disown you and adopt me!  Okay, what do you want within reason?  You don't understand. I do all the work at the agency,  but he doesn't even acknowledge me.  I mean, that's all I want, a simple ""thank you.""  Is that too much to ask?  - You just want him to say ""thank you""? - Yes, a simple ""thank you.""  Carl, if that's all you want then  I'm sure I can get Dad to say ""thank you"" to you.  Well, if you can do that, maybe I can just forget to mention  the whole dating a sworn enemy's daughter thing.  Deal.  Hey, Ferb. Check out this cool picture  of Grandma and Grandpa Flynn in their pyramid water-skiing days.  Wow, it's all the fun of water-skiing times 10.  Y'know, I bet you pyramids would make any sports better.  - Ferb? - What do you two think you  I know what we're gonna do today!  - Doing? - Oh hey, Candace.  - What? - I said, hey, Candace.  What? I can't hear you over all this ringing.  Don't worry about it.  It'll go away in a sec. See ya later, Candace.  I may not be able to hear you, but I can see you.  If you stay in range.  [GIGGLES.] Hello, Candace! Right on schedule.  Uh, hi. Are you new here?  Heavens no, dear. I've been here all summer.  I've so enjoyed watching your brothers  - build so many amazing things every day. - Oh, that's perfect.  Ugh! You know what, my arms are getting really tired.  Just hold that thought I'll be right back.  - You were saying? - [GIGGLES.] They're so inventive.  I mean, they built that roller coaster. Oh, and that spa.  And I love that platypus-themed restaurant.  Even though I couldn't get a reservation. The bouncer was so harsh.  Oh, but the best was when they had their own sitcom.  Wait, I wasn't even here for that one.  I know, but I wouldn't miss a minute  of witnessing your brother's backyard fun.  Lady, you've got to help me!  You've got to come down here and tell my Mom all about it!  Oh, I don't think so, dear.  Um, I just don't feel up to leaving the house.  No problem! You stay right where you are,  and I'll bring my Mom over!  [CHUCKLING.]  Oh, by the way.  - What? - Where's Perry?  CHORUS: # Perry! #  Perry!   - Hey, Dad. - Monty, my boy.  - It's always wonderful to see you. - Hello, sir.  Carl, what took you so long? Hand me that report there, would you?  - Yes, sir. - My coffee. Hah! Thanks, Monty.  - Argh! - Actually, Carl  Carl, the trash chute is clogged again. Do you mind?  Of course not, sir. Pardon me.   Excuse me. Coming through.  - Uh, Dad. Agent P is here. - Oh. So he is.  Good morning, Agent P.  Dr. Doofenshmirtz has been spotted on his balcony  repeatedly shaking his fist and then running back into his building.  Which is obviously evil.  Well, okay, maybe not evil but definitely clichÃ©.  So, go and stop him from his cartoon conventions.  Pyramid sports   Pyramid sports, pyramid   Pyramid, pyramid sports   If you want something new  [LAUGHS.]  We've got the game for you   It's a sport of a different sort   You can do what the Pharaohs do   Woo   The new recreation   That is sweeping the nation with pyramid formation   Pyramid sports   Pyramid sports, pyramid   Pyramid, pyramid sports   Here's how you play.  Form yourselves into a pyramid   I guess that's step number one   Try any sport now experiment   Just go and have some fun   You can do any sport you wish   Archery, bowling   You can even pyramid fish   I don't care if it's played in a field or on a court,  'cause everyone here is into pyramid sports.  Pyramid sports   Pyramid sports  Pyramid sports   Pyramid sports  Pyramid sports   I think I pulled my sigmoid colon.  [BAGPIPE PLAYING.]  Doofenshmirtz: Annoying musician? C'mon. C'mon. Come to pappa.  Ah, bingo! Hey, what's with the waffle?  Oh, very funny, Perry the Platypus. Very funny!  If you'll just be so kind as to move your tail out of the way.  Thank you. There we go. That's good.  [STAMMERS.] See, now you're just being childish.  Look, I promise you, I'm not even being marginally evil.  I just want to stop that guy from playing his bagpipes.  Every day, 24 hours a day. I mean, look at him!  On what planet is that racket considered music?  Ugh, I cannot take it anymore  so I'm gonna hit his bagpipe with my Inflatinator.  Yeah, I know, it's basically the opposite of my old Deflatinator.  But I can't concentrate with all that noise.  I was lucky to come up with that. But when that bagpipe blows up,  I will once again be able to hear the usual din ringing  through the city streets. Like car alarms and babies crying.  And inators blowing up. [GRUNTS.]  C'mon! C'mon! C'mon! This time I've got an eyewitness!  Go on, go on. Tell my Mom everything!  Well, when the empty window feels like talking, you let me know.  There it is. I dropped my penny.  Did you say something, dear?  Monty: How was your meal, Dad?  Absolutely delicious. What a great new place.  - I know, right? Carl found it. - Well, then. Let me just say, thank you,  to the chef. Thank you, for that delicious meal.  You're most welcome. So glad you enjoyed it.  Dad, isn't there something you wanted to say to Carl, as well?  Of course.  What was I thinking?  Don't be rude, Carl! Thank the chef.  - Thank you. - I like this table.   And to show my gratitude, dessert is on the house.  Now, if you'll excuse me. I must go and fire a member of staff.  Luchenzo, come here!  There, you see? A little gratitude goes a long way.  Pay attention, Carl. You could learn something.  - Really learn something from you - Just chill out. I got another idea.  [YELLS.]  Check you out, Perry the Bloat-a-pus!  [LAUGHS.]  Well, this is awkward. Seriously, you're gonna  [GRUNTS.] Well, I'm so glad to have this helipad installed.  Mmm.  [GRUNTING.]  Upsy-daisy.  No really. I swear, the old lady is there in the window  - right now. I swear! - No need to swear. I'm coming.  There she is!  Funny, Candace, I could swear your old lady  - looks just like a houseplant. - What?  There you go. A little thirsty, weren't you?  [GRUNTING.] [BAGPIPE PLAYING.]  Oh, wow. Aw, man, we're not getting anywhere.  How about we take a time out?  [HISSING.]  Wait. Your hat has a pressure release valve?  Wow! So that's what the inside of a platypus smells like.  I could have gone my whole life without knowing that.  Hey!  Aw, man! Another inator bites the dust.  Now I'm stuck listening to Jerky MacIrritating across the street, now.  [WHISTLES.] Shh.  What's that? Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stop.  I didn't realize I was disturbing you. Cheery-bye.  Huh. I guess I might have overthought that solution just a little bit.  [YELLS.] Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  Whoo!  Ahh!  Whoo!  Carl: This had better work.  Don't worry, Carl. Once you save my Dad's life,  there's no way even he could avoid thanking you for it.  I hope for your sake you're right.  Y'know, it's funny how no one's noticed  a grand piano dangling precariously over our table.  Well, I also tied up a couple of violins over there  so it would seem like a theme.  All right, listen. So when my Dad returns,  I'll excuse myself and cut the rope  and you push my Dad out of the way of the falling piano. Got it?  - Well, let's get to that dessert menu. - Excuse me, Dad. It's my turn.  I'll be right back. You guys start.  Sure, sure. Thank you for not making us wait.  [CHUCKLES.] That bathroom attendant was lovely.  He gave me mints and some floss. I just couldn't thank him enough.  [GASPS.] Watch out, sir!  - Dad! Carl! Are you all right? - Oh, I'm fine.  - I'm all right too, sir. - Wow, Carl. You saved my Dad's life.  Yes. It's a shame he couldn't save the table too.  - Let's go find the host. - No, wait. What? Seriously?  - What? - Dad. Aren't you going to thank him?  Oh, well, I didn't realize, I hadn't.  Thank you for pointing that out to me, Monty.  Dad!  Oh, uh, yes, right. Thank you, Carl.  Oh, well, more dessert for us.  No, it's different this time! She promised to come down and meet us.  Right. My expectations have been completely reversed.  No! You'll see.  She'll explain everything.  Everything!  [DOORBELL RINGS.]  [GIGGLES.]  [GASPS.] Yes! See.  Mom, lady. Lady, Mom. Now, tell her everything.  You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say  Take your hands off me, Copper! I know my rights.  Sorry, Candace. Water the plant for me.  - I don't understand. What's going on? - Police matter, miss.  What could that sweet old lady have possibly done?  That ""sweet"" old lady is Peggy ""The Pyramid"" McGee,  the notorious ringleader of Danville's biggest pyramid scheme.  Pyramid scheme?  That's right. She's been selling these all over town.  See. These are just flat triangles painted in perspective!  That's fraud.  I'll be out before the time her mom serves pie!  Wow, Candace. I can't believe it.  - A pyramid scheme right under our noses! - Yeah. Imagine that.  [MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING.]  - Hey! - Hey, yourself.  - I thought, uh - Yeah, so did I.  But then I figured I couldn't leave you here to suffer alone.  That's what I like.  Thoughtful and dismissive simultaneously.  Doofenshmirtz: [YELLS.] No! Wait, wait, wait! Is that the Love Sandals?  Whoa!  Watch the hands, lady! Hey!  ""Troy Story""  Hey, Candace. Doing a little light summer reading, I see.  This is for the book club, Jeremy and I joined.  We all read the same book, and then get together and discuss over tea.  - Sounds sophisticated. - Yeah, the tea was my idea.  This week we're reading, ""The Iliad.""  That's a great book! It's all about the Trojan War!  - You read this? - Buford: We all did.  You're not the only one with a book club, you know.  I like your idea about the tea, though. Ferb, make a note of that.  The war started because Paris fell in love with Helen of Troy.  It's so romantic.  Yeah, and Helen could launch a thousand ships with her face!  My favorite character was Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior of all time.  He had this big fight with Hector.  He was all, wham! Bam!  - Stab! Stab! Stab! - Cut it out!  Isn't there something about a wooden horse?  Yeah, the Greek army built a huge wooden horse  and left it outside the gates of Troy.  The Trojans thought that the Greeks had given up  and that the horse was some sort of tribute to them.  So, they wheeled it inside the gates.  Hey. How did they get that big horse in that tiny door?  - Buford, just try imaging a larger door. - Oh, okay. Hang on.  - Oh, yeah. That's better. - Then late at night,   the Greeks climbed out of the horse, opened the gates  Then it was all, wham, zam, stab, stab, stab!  - Cut it out! - Wow, really sounds exciting.  I better get started. Book club is in three hours. Bye!  Wow. She must be a fast reader.  What gets me is, why did the Trojan War take so long?  If I were Achilles, I could have taken the city of Troy  - like in one afternoon. - Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  We're gonna finally recreate the Trojan War.  I'll be Paris because my name starts with a ""P.""  And I'll be Helen because uh, my name starts with ""I""  which is right after ""H.""  And I'll be the great Achilles!  And I'll be all wham, zam, stab, stab, stab!  [SCREAMS.] Cut it out!  And you can be Hector. Now get over there. I'm taking Ferb.  - Hey everyone, can I play? - Buford: No!  - I've got baklava. - Welcome to the Greek army.  You know who loves history and historical reenactments.  Hey, where's your Dad?  Dad: So it goes over, under, around and through.  [INHALES.] Oh, lovely. Time to open the shop.  [RINGING.]  [BRAYING.]  [BIRDS SQUAWKING.]  Hello, Agent P I see you used the rabbit-hole entrance.  [CHUCKLES.] Freaks the heck out of intruders.  [CLEARS THROAT.] Anyway, no news on what Doof is up to yet.  We're still awaiting a surveillance report from our special CR Unit.  Hey, Carl! Any news from Team Cockroach?  Carl: Nothing yet, sir. We think they may have been scattered.  Quite frankly, we fear the worst. Which isn't that bad.  They're just a bunch of roaches after all.  So we're gonna need you to get over to Doof and see  what mischief he's up to today. Good luck, Agent P.  Buford: And they say Rome wasn't built in a day.  Uh, technically, that's not Rome, that's supposed to be Troy.  If I wanted nerd facts, I would have kept Baljeet.  In case you are wondering,  the word you are looking for is ""impenetrable.""  Actually, the word I was looking for is ""decimate.""  - Fair enough. - Yeah, we're gonna need a bigger army.  Irving, break out my recruitin' fustanella.  - You mean the little Greek skirt? - It's a fustanella!  CHORUS: # Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! #  [KNOCKING ON DOOR.]  Coming! Hold on! Just hold your horses!  Wait Hello?  Ha! You missed me, Perry the Platypus!  But I got you!  You see, I was just doing a little inventory and reorganization  of all the stuff that I've collected over the last 40 years.  Yeah, I know it's gotten a little out of hand.  I kinda let it go and Norm's been in Maui for, like, a month.  So I made the De-clutterinator.  I was actually gonna shoot myself with it,  which would make me want to unclutter everything, and,  uh, then I lost it, 'cause, you know, it's  it's really cluttered in here.  So then I hired a nice young lady named Doreen  to help me get organized, and, well, I think she may have gotten lost, too.  I haven't seen her in days. Doreen, are you out there?  Doreen: So thirsty.  I never approved overtime!  Doreen: Food.  So, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to my search for Doreen.  Maybe I'll get lucky and find the De-clutterinator, too.  Hey, Doreen! Marco!  Doreen: Water.  Yeah, she really stinks at this.  Okay, next!  - Name? - Balthazar Horowitz.  - But you can call me the Ball Pit Kid. - Any medical problems?  - Well, I have a perforated - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're in.  Get a shield, come back with it or on it.  - Next! Name? - Dimitri Papanicolas.  Any experience being Greek?  Actually, I am Greek. I was born on the island  I don't want your life story!  Grab a shield, come back with it or on it.  Irving, go get some more baklava. Come back with it or on it.  - I'm on it! - Yeah? Well, get with it.  ""Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus' son, Achilles""  [SNORING.]  ""Achilles, and its devastation which put pains upon the Achaeans""  ""Upon the Achaeans, hurled in their multitude to the house of""  Buford: Hector!  Oh, for Pete's sake!  Buford! I'm trying to read this  What the heck is going on out here?  You've inspired us, Candace! What do you think?  Are you by any chance re-enacting the Trojan War? Like in my book?  - That's the plan. - Okay.   I'll just watch you guys and take notes for my book club.  Buford, continue.  Heya, Hector! Why don't you come on down here?  I got something for ya.  Oh, sweet! I am going down there.  Okay, here I am. What have you got for me?  Buford: Get him!  Oh, no! Not good!  [SCREAMS.]  Eat hot chariot, sucker!  Well, so much for Hector.  There was a hottie named Helen   And she launched a thousand ships with her face   Face, face, face   Paris took her home to Troy   And to the Greeks this was a slap in the face   Face, face, face   The Trojans stole Helen!  Agamemnon got mad 'cause that just wasn't right   He said, ""Hold your Trojan horses, now we're having a fight""   And I haven't sacked a village since at least last Saturday night   And for 10 years they were all   Stabbing, and jabbing, and clashing, and gashing,   And brawling, and mauling, and trashing, and smashing   When they finally figured out they couldn't take 'em by force   The Greeks all got together and they hid in a horse   Bagpipe solo!   [PLAYING.]  Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!   You know, bagpipes are sort of anachronistic for this time  Quiet, you!  Go back to being vanquished.  Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!   [SCREAMING.]  Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy!   Troy! Troy! Troy! Troy. Oh, it's all over.  Doreen! Come out, come out, wherever you are!   I should have I should have brought some bread crumbs  or something to leave behind me so I could find my way  Oh, you know what? Better yet, I should have brought a sandwich,  'cause I am famished.  [BEEPING.]  Hey, where you guys going? We're not done yet.  - BOY 1: I gotta get home. - BOY 2: I've got book club.  I've got a balalaika lesson.  You know, they've got a word for what you guys are doing.  - Yeah. It's desertion. - No, it's  Oh, no. It is desertion. Irving, get over here.  - It's time to execute Plan B. - Plan B?  Yeah, you know the one where you climb into the decoy and, uh  - Oh, that Plan B - Get going.  A Trojan platypus?  Come on, Buford, what makes you think we'd fall for that.  Irving: I told you, Buford. [YELLS.]  Why did you have me get in this thing?  Now, we're getting somewhere.  Ha! I bet you didn't see  a Trojan T. Rex  with laser-cannon mouth and laser eyes comin', did you?  Well, he's got me there.  Seriously, if you were just gonna crush the Trojan platypus,  - why did I - Leave me my simple pleasures.  Now, Ferb, destroy Troy! This is why I got Ferb on my team!  [GASPS.]  Uh-oh. Looks like Ferb's goin' off book.  Everyone to the chariots! Hang on!  Whoa-ho! Laser-proof. Nice touch, Ferb.  [YELLING.]  This is really cool.  Book club starts in 10 minutes.  I have an idea! Throw that rope to the other chariot!  Well, that can't be good.  I guess they knew a T. Rex's weakness is also its Achilles' heel.  [SCREAMING.]  - That was awesome! - Who won?  This time I think it was a draw.  Come on, let's go tell Candace how it ends.  Yeah, and maybe we can pick up some Greek frozen yogurt on the way.  Doreen, come on, quit kidding around.  [GASPS.] Perry the Platypus?  You've found the De-clutterinator!  Excellent, okay, shoot me.  Shoot me and I'll clean this whole place up.  Oh wait. [STAMMERS.] What?  Oh, it's not plugged in. Hold on one sec.  My, word! What a mess.  Okay, here's an open socket.  That doesn't sound good.  [EXPLOSION.]  Oof, I say, I feel the sudden urge to declutter.  Well, you have to admit it did get rid of the clutter.  - There you are. - Doreen! What's happening?  My invoice. You'll be hearing from my lawyer.  Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  And there goes the last of it!  Lawrence, what are you doing out here?  Oh, you know, just tidying up a little.  Well, the yard looks great! Come on in the kitchen.  I've got a plate of cake that needs cleaning up.  I'm your man.  Now that we're all here. Who wants to go first.  Ooh, me! In general I thought the Greeks' decoy platypus  was a brilliant idea until it got smashed by the T. Rex!  Its use of lasers to destroy the city of Troy really seemed  unbeatable until Paris flew down in his laser chariot.  The flying chariots were all, pew, pew, pew, pew!  - Ga, ga, ga, ga! And - [IMITATES BOMBS FALLING.] Cool!  ""The Iliad"" is truly an epic!  Candace, you didn't read the book, did you?  I'm so busted.  Oh, that's okay. I don't think anyone did.  I just come to book club for the tea."

This is a big night for me.  My boyfriend is coming Oh! Here he is right now.  Ooh, a vampire. It's a good thing I have my neck covered.  You're not my boyfriend.  Whoops.

That's a great idea!  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  Seriously? That's it? A soft fire plug?  Well, yeah. Attached to a giant revolving treadmill  with a giant soft neighborhood, containing soft obstacles.  Oh, yeah, okay.  - Where is Perry? - What did you say?  I was just asking where Perry is.  - Oh. - What did you think I said?  Uh, well, I thought you said  Uh, never mind. It was too weird.  [ACTION MUSIC.]  [MONOGRAM GRUNTING.]  [GROANING.]  Get it off! Ugh!  Sorry, Agent P, I just walked through a spider web.  Don't you just hate that?  You spend the rest of the day worried there's a spider on you.  [SHUDDERS.] Gives me the willies.  Any-hoo, our sources tell us that there's  a cowboy hat in front of Doof's building.  Normally, that wouldn't be of any interest to us,  because this is the week of the Danville Hootenanny,  But it's a rather large hat, and, in spite of its name,  the Danville Hootenanny is a dignified affair.  I wish I had more information,  but Carl said there was a big bee by the surveillance equipment.  So, get out there, Agent P.  [SHUDDERS.] Carl, is is there a spider on my head?  Carl: No, sir. There's no spider on your head.  NARRATOR: Meanwhile, at the Danville Space Laboratory  MAN: ""Laboratory""?  [GRUNTING IN FRUSTRATION.]  Oh, Jack, it sure was nice of you to show Candace and me around.  This satellite stuff is very interesting.  No problem, Linda.  I'm flattered you'd be interested in our humble facility,  considering your background in astrophysics.  Oh, yeah. Uh, listen, that's kind of a secret.  - So don't - Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.  - So, what does your father do here? - Oh, he's part of a team  that makes and manages reconnaissance satellites.  They actually had a couple of Rovers on Mars earlier this summer.  But they suddenly stopped working.  You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?  Uh, how would I, uh [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.] What do you mean?  All right, Your Highness.  - [GASPS.] Who told? - Stacy.  CHORUS: # Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! #  Uh, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering  wondering why I'm cowering outside my lab.   Well, the day started like any other day.  You know, I, ""How am I going to take over the Tri-State Area,"" but  and I suddenly remembered a movie that I'd seen long ago at a drive-in.  It was called Night of the Felis.  I knew right away that the old masters were onto something.  Imagine, taking something cute and enlarging it to frightening proportions.  Brilliant!  But in order to take over the Tri-State Area,  I'd have to start with some other type of small animals.  [PEOPLE IN MOVIE SCREAMING.]  Preferably something that could fly. [CATS IN MOVIE MEWLING.]  And I vowed to get right to work, as soon as the movie was over.  The first thing I needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger.  Huh?  I tried it out on my cowboy hat.  It was a success.  My ten-gallon hat had turned into a two thousand-gallon hat.  Whoa!  [CRASHING.] [CAR ALARM WAILING.]  Well, that's the end of that hat.  Next, I had to genetically modify a mouse so it could fly.  [MOUSE SQUEALING.]  [BITING.]  Doofenshmirtz: Ow!  Then I decided it would be easier to just use a bat.  So, I ordered a retired stunt bat from a low-budget bat circus  that had recently gone belly-up. You know, the economy.  I was on the precipice of Tri-State Area domination.  At last, I had the ultimate creepy soldier! [SQUEAKS.]  And then I remembered, I had a very mild phobia of bats.  [BAT SQUEAKING.]  [SHRIEKS.] Get away, get away, get away!  I also have a mild phobia of shellfish.  WAITRESS: Here's your order, sir.  Doofenshmirtz: [SHRIEKS.] Get away, get away, get away!  But bats are worse.  Scram, you flying gerbil! [BAT SQUEAKING.]  Am-scray!  [SQUEAKING.]  You're making me miss the Hootenanny! [SQUEAKING.]  Sir, I found your radio.  It was embedded in the dashboard of your car.  Norm! Don't just stand there! Do something about this bat!  Really? That's your solution? Throw a radio at it.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Don't throw that. That's imitatable.  What if I hit it with this?  No! No! Wait! Don't shoot him with that! That's my  And I thought the bat was scary before, when he was, you know, tiny.  [BAT SHRIEKING MENACINGLY.]  It was at that point that Norm and I decided to come out here.  Plus the bat kind of looks like my cousin, Narthelliot!  Which, as you can imagine, is weird for me.  - Isn't that about right, Norm? - It's even more horrible than it looks!  Phineas: Everybody got their helmets and boards?  - Isabella: Yeah! - Buford and Baljeet: I'm ready!  Okay, Ferb, fire it up. We're going to Foam Town!  [WHOOPING.]  [GRUNTS.]  There's nothing that I've found as good as goin' round and round   In Foam Town   In Foam Town   I used to skin my knees  [WHOOPING.]  But here it doesn't matter where I fall   You'll never get scarred 'cause nothing's really hard   In Foam Town   So take a rollin' ride on a squeezable urban sprawl   Come on down to Foam Town   In Foam Town   Yeah   There's no bruises or concussions   There's no painful repercussions   There's no braces There's no bandages No hospital stay   If you jump and try to land it   You can eat it or face-plant it   And you know that your insurance plan will not have to pay   Come on down to Foam Town   Come on down to Foam Town   Come on down   Just come on down  to Foam Town   Come on down to Foam Town   Yeah!  Come on down   Come on down to Foam Town   And over here are the models of our robotically operated Rovers.  The Mars Rover,  the Moon Rover,  and this is the Irish Rover.  - You sent a Rover to Ireland? - Well, we had to test it somewhere.  In a land afar in Castlebar Many months ago   We sent an Irish Rover To look around, you know   With a tur-la-lur-la Fiddle-die-dee   And a tur-a-fiddle-die-do   In a land afar in Castlebar Many months ago   It took a couple of months,  but we're finally starting to get some really great pictures back.  Thank you for the blanket, Perry the Platypus.  - Vanessa: Dad? - Vanessa?  [WHISPERING.] Oh, no! Vanessa, get out of there!  - There's a huge bat on the loose. - Really?  [SHRIEKING.]  Vanessa: Wow! Cool. It looks like your cousin, Narthelliot.  [QUIETLY.] No sudden movements or loud noises, Vanessa.  Dad, relax. It's just a bat. They just eat bugs.  But it's a very big bat!  Now, come on. Just, just stand up. It's okay.  It's time to face your fear. [BAT GROWLING.]  [NERVOUSLY.] Well, okay  [MUFFLED GROANING.]  Oh, no, no!  Bad bat! Spit him out!  [GROANS.]  Gross! [SCREAMS.]  Oh, yeah, this is much better! [BAT SHRIEKING.]  Dad! Oh, hey, Perry.  I was wondering if you could help me. [ENGINE FIRING UP.]  Thanks, Perry. You're a peach.  So, what did I miss?  Oh, hey, Narthelliot! We were just talking about you.  Jack: Of course, even better than using a Rover, we have these.  We call them global surveillance satellites.  No matter where you are on this Earth,  there's always one of these flying above you in orbit,  streaming live video to us here.  That's right. Here's the outside of our building, right now.  And we can look up any location, instantly.  The Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal  So, you could look down on anybody's backyard  and just see what they're doing?  - Pretty cool, huh? - Wow, that's got to be handy for something.  And three. Two. One  - What? - Really? All right.  [SHRIEKING.]  [Doofenshmirtz SCREAMING.]  Whoa! Oh, I get it. This is what it does.  Flying through a hoop. That's what I get  for buying a bat from a defunct bat circus!  - So, having fun yet? - Oh, you know I am!  You know, my Dad goes on and on about the cafeteria here,  and I think he's right. This food is [SPITTING.]  [GASPS.] I've got an idea! My brothers are   probably building something in our backyard right now,  and we can use the surveillance satellite to catch them doing it!  Come on!  I was wondering how long that would take.  Just let me punch in my address  [GASPS.] Oh, my gosh! I knew it! Look at that thing!  - Wow. What is it? - It's an eye in the sky bust!  Come on, let's go get my Mom.  Okay, Ferb, turn it off. Let's take a little break.  [Buford GRUNTING.]  - You okay, Buford? - I'm having the time of my life!  - Is anybody else hungry? - I am!  Come on, let's go see what's in the kitchen.  Doofenshmirtz: Oh no! Oh, no, no! Not again!  [CLANGING.] Ow, my head!  Ow, my head again!  Ow! Now I forgot math.  Ow! There goes Social Studies.  Oh, good! They're back!  This way, Mom. Just see for yourself.  Oh, wow! It's our house!  And you can see the boys! And their little skateboards.  Hi, boys!  - They can't hear you, you know. - I know.  Hi! Whoo-hoo!  Hey! Foam Town's gone.  You say that like it doesn't happen every day.  And you say that like an angry old prospector.  - What does that even mean? - I stand by that metaphor.  Finally, Daisy, we're here.  Our new home! Lots of elbow-room and no one to bother us.  The last frontier! A place where a man and his donkey can  Dang it! Come on, Daisy, we're heading west.  [Doofenshmirtz SCREAMING.]  Perry the Platypus! Welcome to Saint Louis.  Now, do something about this bat, please!  [SQUEAKING.]  [YELPS.] Well, at least I lost my fear of bats.  [CRASHING.] [GRUNTS.]  WAITRESS: Oh, it's you again.  Doofenshmirtz: [SCREAMING.] Go away, go away, go away!  WAITRESS: Oh, just stop it.  There's nothing that I've found as good as goin' round and round   In Foam Town   In Foam Town   I used to skin my knees  [WHOOPING.]  But here it doesn't matter where I fall   You'll never get scarred 'cause nothing's really hard   In Foam Town   So take a rollin' ride on a squeezable urban sprawl   Come on down  to Foam Town"

Welcome to the Macabre Book Mobile.  What is your pleasure tonight?  How about a fright? Well, you are in luck,  because I have three stories that are  guaranteed to make you scream with delight!  Stop it! Enough with the feather, Renfield.  We talked about this. Now knock it off and  go and stand over there by the chifforobe.  And stay out of those olives.  I'm saving them for company.  - Uh, excuse me. - What?  Can I get a free-range organic grilled cheese slider?  This isn't a food truck, you baboon! It's a Macabre Book Mobile.  Yeah, I'm totally giving you a bad review.  May the ancient moths of Sumeria feast upon your skinny jeans!  One star? Man, that burns.  Now where was I? Ah, yes!  The first story in our Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror!  For crying out loud.  Sorry about that. Now where were we?  ""Chapter one: A teenage girl chats  idly to her friend on the phone,  alone in her room, as a storm rages outside.""  Little does she know what evil awaits  her as she discovers how dangerous careless words can be.  No, Stacy, I have the whole place to myself.  Mom and Dad are at the movies,  and the boys are playing ping-pong over at Buford's.  Oh, so listen to this weird book I've been reading.  ""If one repeats this incantation in the presence of a doll,  then alive it shall be!"" But check this out.  ""The light of a full moon will make it evil!""  Oh, I'm so totally doing it.  Oh, relax, Stacy! It's funny!  I will you alive, Ducky Momo!  Candace, this is Ducky Momo.  You must buy more of my memorabilia,  like my fiftieth anniversary collector's item bobble head.  But, you know, I'm really concerned about its resale value.  Help! Help!  Sorry, okay? Just having a little fun.  So, what's up? Ha!  You know, I just used this new exfoliating  and moisturizing scrub in the bath, which is totally confusing,  because why exfoliate off all the cells you just moisturized?  Weird.  Hold on, Stacy.  I thought I heard a sound coming from under the bed.  Cheese and crackers!  And we don't even have a cat.  How did you get underneath there?  Oh, it's nothing. Ducky Momo must have fallen under my bed.  Now, stay put.  Okay, so let me tell you about my day with Jeremy.  So he picks me up, and the same song  I was playing in my room was the same song playing in his car!  The same song! I mean, what are the chances of that?  And then he says, ""You wanna get grilled cheeses at that place?""  And I was just thinking I wanted grilled cheese!  Me? I'm just making a snack.  Oh, I just thought I'd have, you know, something healthy.  What? Oh, okay, you caught me.  Donuts and cheesy popcorn.  Yeah, Jeremy was so great. He took us out for mani-pedis.  Is someone there?  Oh, the storm just blew the door open.  Yeah, I know. Creepy!  Anyway, since Jeremy's Mom is a regular at the mani-pedi place,  we got special treatment.  Yeah, they served us sparkling apple juice and finger sandwiches  and made fun of us in Thai. It was all so classy.  What can I say? I love a well-groomed foot.  You thought you were alone   but then you hear a floorboard creak   And from the shadows you see two crazy eyes and a little orange beak   Then you hear a noise that makes your heart skip a beat   It's the creepy pitter-patter of his little webbed feet   You say, no, no, no, no, Momo   Might as well say hello you can sense that he's near   Now you know why yellow is the color of fear   You say, no, no, no, no, Momo   Ducky Momo, Ducky Momo   You say, no, no, no, no, Momo   Ducky Momo, Ducky Momo   Is someone there?  Stacy, I know you're gonna think this is crazy,  but I honestly think something is in the room with me.  Have you ever been in a situation  where your whole body, like, senses a presence?  Like, you can't see it, but it's, like, it's, like, right next to you?  Upstairs! The only logical escape!  Stacy, you gotta help me. The spell from that weird book worked!  Ducky Momo is alive, and he's trying to get me!  No, he's downstairs, he Would you stop laughing?  Yes you are! I can hear the milk shooting out of your nose.  My phone!  Back! Stay back!

Think, think, think.  Block the door. Block the door!  I didn't really mean to wish you to life!  I was just goofing around!  I don't understand! What do you want?  Huh? It almost looks like you want a  a hug.  Seriously? You just want a hug? Well, okay.  But I don't get it. If the incantation made you alive,  then the moonlight should've made you evil.  What? What?  Oh, the moon was behind the clouds, so you're not evil!  But now Mr. Miggins is!  Ah, you have returned for more. Our second story starts  upon a dark and stormy night,  where a platypus will soon show an evil scientist  that every wish has a twist and the wisher  might not wish for what he wished.  Hey.  Doggone it! You You should know better  than to sneak up on a guy like that,  especially on a dark and stormy night!  Anyway, I was reading this weird book,  and there's a chapter in here I think might interest you.  Ha! Sucker!  I'm surprised you fell for that old ""Slam the platypus in a book"" trick.  Actually, I'm surprised it took me that long to think of it.  Anyhoo, you should know that that mysterious book that  you are trapped in has a very interesting chapter about,  bum-bum-bum, the inexplicable giant floating baby head.  Wow. That was weird.  I wonder if that's gonna happen every time I say,  ""inexplicable giant floating baby head.""  Oh, cool!  Hey, watch this. The inexplicable giant floating baby  ham sandwich! Ah-a-ha!  Anyway, the chapter says that if you get close enough to touch the  uh, the inexplicable giant floating you know,  you get three wishes. Pretty sweet, huh?  The rest of the chapter was devoted to the giant floating rest of the baby.  But since I've never seen one in Danville, I didn't finish.  So how am I going to get the baby head to come to me?  Behold! The Inexplicable-giant -floating-baby-head-attract-inator!  Everything I know about getting a baby's attention has gone into this inator.  Yes! Babies like keys, right? When you shake your keys.  Yeah it it's one of the things they like.  It's so horrible.  Gently, gently. Don't kill me.  Just one small  It's gone!  Perry the Platypus, look at my hand!  It's kind of disturbing but it worked. I get three wishes!  Okay, we'll give this a whirl. I'll use one wish just to test it out.  Hmm, I wish for an iced tea.  Well, look at that! It worked!  Mmm. Not bad, though it could really use  some sugar and one of those lemon slices.  I see, I wasn't specific enough.  Oh, right, I forgot in these kinds of stories there's always a twist.  But, but, but I'm too smart for that.  All I have to do is be really clear about what I want,  like my next wish. I'll be really sure to clearly say,  ""I wish to control""  Aah! Cheese and crackers!  Oh, you think you're so clever, don't you, Perry the Platypus?  Making me waste a wish? Nice try, pal.  But what you don't realize is that this  guy knows the real waste of a wasted wish is  to waste the wish that was wished wastefully.  And I am not wasting this wasteful wish.  The point is, I now have control over cheese and crackers.  Cheese, advance!  Swiss! Smoky gouda! String!  Individually wrapped cheese food substitute!  Ha! Cheese, snack attack!  You, Limburger! Hold on a second you're a strong cheese.  Get this book shelf off my foot.  Oh, man. If I wasn't so hungry, this would be horrifying.  Well, you may have shredded it, but you haven't stopped it!  Uh uh  Oh, I see. I don't know how I forgot cheese was edible.  By the way, I believe you're over the five second rule there, Perry the platy  Ow! Well, I hope you didn't leave room for crackers!  Crackers, go get him!  Why do I have six boxes of oyster crackers?  Must have been on sale.  Very clever, Perry the Platypus,  but let's see how you do against the hard stuff.  Parmesan, give him a taste of your crystalline texture!  Ah, so you beat up a bunch of snacks. Big deal!  But you forget, Perry the Platypus, I still have one wish left.  And I've learned from my past two mistakes.  I'm going to do this one right!  You know what it is I want, Perry the Platypus?  I want to be the biggest ruler of the What?  Oh, you're right! I say ""ruler"" and I could end up being, like,  a big wooden yardstick or something. Good catch.  Good, good catch, Perry the Platypus. Let me rephrase that.  I want to be, specifically, the monarch of  No, no. No, you're right, that's a butterfly.  Well, how about the super-inten  No, no. Wait I know!  I wish to be the head of the Tri-State Area!  Oh! Shoot! I just heard that.  Yep! Yep, I'm a head.  A big old head, Perry the Platypus. That's what I wished for.  Where are you going? So, what?  I don't need your help. That's right.  Just walk away, Perry the Platypus.  Oh, you're giving me the smirk face. Nice. Fine.  Maybe I like being a giant head, huh?  Uh-oh. Oh! I have to itch my nose!  Oh, no! I can't. Aah!  Ow! Curse you, Perry the Platypus!  And you, too, you giant inexplicable floating baby head!  Eh, knock it off!  At dot, dot, dot, funny warts, add the picture and  Ah! Back from the commercial, are we?  Shall I continue? Hmm.  The final grim installment in our Terrifying Tri-State Trilogy of Terror  takes place in an unassuming suburban backyard  where five happy campers and their platypus discover  they may not know what they are going to do today.  Suddenly, from out of the shadows,  the zombie bunny rabbit appeared and  then he ate up all the marshmallows!  Remember, those marshmallows are for everyone.  The zombie bunny doesn't care!  Okay, it's my turn to tell a scary story.  Ooh! What's it gonna be? Suspense, stalker, horror, action, adventure,  or my personal favorite, the campy costume alien teen romance dramedy?  Well, let's see what's in this weird book.  ""Make a doll come alive how to get three wishes  giant floating rest of baby.""  Hey, check it out! It says here you have to be careful not to spill  grape juice on a platypus or it will make an evil platypus clone.  I'm not really sure why anyone would  - Keep reading. - Buford, stop!  Aw, poor little guy.  Buford, you shouldn't pour anything on a platypus.  I just wanted to see what would happen.  Well, he's dry, but now he's purple.  - Whoa! - Cool! It actually worked!  Who's my little platypus clone?  - What was that all about? - What part of ""evil clone"" are you not getting?  Obviously, the ""evil"" part.  I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  - It's the only way to be sure. - Cheese and crackers!  Oh, no! Look! They are using our grape juice box to make more!  Wow. This is such a Halloween thing to happen in the middle of summer.  What are we gonna do, Phineas?  We have to contain these duplicating evil platypuses somehow.  Uh, we could build a vacuum that attracts only platypus fur.  No, no, then Perry would be in danger.  Uh, maybe an alpha ray grid to  - No, no, that's too much radiation. Hmm. - I can smell his brain working.  Oh, sure, blame it on Phineas.  I don't know, gang. I'm kinda stumped on this one.  Fear not! I know someone who can help us. Follow me!  I don't get it, Baljeet. Where are we going?  Whenever I need counsel on a problem, I go to my life coach.  Life coach? I am so hurt!  Buford, this man is the embodiment of pure thought and wisdom.  Well, well! If'n it ain't Baljeet!  Everyone, this is Rusty Britches. Rusty, this is everyone.  Well, I'm right pleased to meet you kids!  Wha Howdy?  Well, don't just stand there with your hair on your head  and your socks tucked into your boots, come on in.  Thank you for the lemonade, Rusty.  You're surely welcome. Now what can I do you for?  If I may, Mr. Britches.  The city's been overrun by evil platypuses,  and we can't figure out how to get rid of them.  Well, that's a real beehive in your well water.  Let me get my thinkin' bench.  Well, it's like old Pap used to say.  When your horse starts drawing a bath instead of a wagon,  it's time to change the welcome mat.  Does anyone else get the feeling we're really taking our time with this thing?  Look, Rusty, we really appreciate your colloquial prairie wisdom,  but I think we have to move along before things get worse out there.  Well, I reckon you know best.  It was right fine to meet Aw, cheese and crackers!  This is supposed to be for cleaning boats,  but sometimes you gotta wash with the wrong brush  - to get a colt to the chaparral. - Wash? Brush?  - Chaparral? - That's it! You're a genius, Mr. Britches!  Oh, shucks! I'm just a simple cowboy life coach.  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  So, since the evil platypuses are made out of grape juice stains and dark magic,  these high-powered bubble washers ought to do the trick.  Okay, suds up, people! We're going platy-scrubbing!  Hey, Phineas! How about some good ol', down-home, granny slappin'  platy-scrubbing musical accompaniment?  Yeah!  The chips were down, the stakes were high   The kids knew it was do-or-die   Ripped to shred with razor-like claws   Their doom was all but nigh   Screaming in pain, they'd be eaten alive   Hey, hey, hey, hey! What the heck, man? You're bringing us down.  It's really a good song but, uh  Maybe you could play something a little more, you know, up-tempo.  Oh, right. Gotcha!  Well, we were shootin' 'em, washin' 'em, scrubbin' 'em   Terminating all livelong day   Happy little kids with a happy little chore   Just yodeling all the way!   - Rusty! - Go on without me!  It's as I always say, you gotta  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!  This doesn't look too good, Ferb. Everybody retreat to that factory!  Oh, no, guys! This is a grape juice box factory!  How terrifyingly specific!  - They're here! - Run!  There's too many of them! Phineas!  Isabella!  I'm getting tired of running from these jerks.  And so, our heroes were ripped to shreds and left to die!  Wait a minute! That was a pretty grim ending, don't you think?  Yeah, talk about your unlightful endings.  He means delightful, and he means the opposite of that.  Okay, okay. I'll give you the Hollywood ending.  I have a plan. Everyone keep your eye out  - for the sprinkler system supply housing! - There it is!  Isabella, you, Baljeet and Buford hold them back  while we get the soap into the sprinkler system.  You'd better hurry, Phineas!  There are too many of them!  Oh, no! The manual override is way up there!  - There's no way I can reach it. - Uh, guys, I'm out!  - I am out, too! - What are we gonna do?  Yee-haw!  Look, everyone, it's Baljeet's cowboy life coach!  On a unicorn! Straining all credulity, he has come to save us!  Soap's on, little tykes!  Rusty, you did it! They are all melting away!  You've saved my factory!  Look, everyone! It is Officer Concord,  the juice-time juice box flavor cop!  Well done, everyone! Let's dance!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Totally unbelievable.  Which part? The unicorn or Officer Concord,  the juice-time juice box flavor cop?  - Nah, the cowboy. - You do not believe in cowboys?  Have you ever seen one in real life?  So, you see, if I had a Macabre Book Mobile,  those are the kinds of things that could happen.  - I'm gonna be blunt, Mr. Macabre - It's ""Macabre.""  Mr. Macabre, I'm not gonna give you a loan to buy a Macabre Book Mobile.  - Why not? - You have no detailed  records of assets, no inventory, nothing you can use as collateral.  Your stories don't even make sense! It's a bad business proposition.  What if I were to say ""please""?  - That's not gonna work. - Please?  - Get out. - Pretty please, with a cherry on top?  A cherry, huh?  Okay, but this is the last loan I am giving you.  All is well that ends well   With a happy little cowboy song   Happy little steps on a happy little   - Aah! - Dang it!  I'm all right. Hey, you go ahead and read the credits,  I'll just wait down here.  It's kinda nice down here, actually. There's a dandelion.  It's all puffy and ready to go. Here you go.  Logo ought to be coming up any minute. There it is!"
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a Halloween special!   ""Face Your Fear""  Okay, guys. Now you try it!  Nice! Very smooth, Baljeet.  [CLANG.]  - What's the problem, Buford? - Well, you know, the sun was in my eyes.  Buford, what's with the lack of effort?  - I'm just trying to be careful. - You?  Yeah, we're out of credit at the emergency room.  My mom said if I break one more bone, she's gonna break the rest of 'em.  Fairly sure that was hyperbole. Besides, look how hard that hydrant is.  Well, maybe we could make our own fire hydrants out of soft foam rubber.  Hey! That's a great idea!  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today.  Seriously? That's it? A soft fire plug?  Well, yeah. Attached to a giant revolving treadmill  with a giant soft neighborhood, containing soft obstacles.  Oh, yeah, okay.  - Where is Perry? - What did you say?  I was just asking where Perry is.  - Oh. - What did you think I said?  Uh, well, I thought you said  Uh, never mind. It was too weird.  [ACTION MUSIC.]  [MONOGRAM GRUNTING.]  [GROANING.]  Get it off! Ugh!  Sorry, Agent P, I just walked through a spider web.  Don't you just hate that?  You spend the rest of the day worried there's a spider on you.  [SHUDDERS.] Gives me the willies.  Any-hoo, our sources tell us that there's  a cowboy hat in front of Doof's building.  Normally, that wouldn't be of any interest to us,  because this is the week of the Danville Hootenanny,  But it's a rather large hat, and, in spite of its name,  the Danville Hootenanny is a dignified affair.  I wish I had more information,  but Carl said there was a big bee by the surveillance equipment.  So, get out there, Agent P.  [SHUDDERS.] Carl, is is there a spider on my head?  Carl: No, sir. There's no spider on your head.  NARRATOR: Meanwhile, at the Danville Space Laboratory  MAN: ""Laboratory""?  [GRUNTING IN FRUSTRATION.]  Oh, Jack, it sure was nice of you to show Candace and me around.  This satellite stuff is very interesting.  No problem, Linda.  I'm flattered you'd be interested in our humble facility,  considering your background in astrophysics.  Oh, yeah. Uh, listen, that's kind of a secret.  - So don't - Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.  - So, what does your father do here? - Oh, he's part of a team  that makes and manages reconnaissance satellites.  They actually had a couple of Rovers on Mars earlier this summer.  But they suddenly stopped working.  You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?  Uh, how would I, uh [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.] What do you mean?  All right, Your Highness.  - [GASPS.] Who told? - Stacy.  CHORUS: # Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! #  Uh, Perry the Platypus, I bet you're wondering  wondering why I'm cowering outside my lab.  Well, the day started like any other day.  You know, I, ""How am I going to take over the Tri-State Area,"" but  and I suddenly remembered a movie that I'd seen long ago at a drive-in.  It was called Night of the Felis.  I knew right away that the old masters were onto something.  Imagine, taking something cute and enlarging it to frightening proportions.  Brilliant!  But in order to take over the Tri-State Area,  I'd have to start with some other type of small animals.  [PEOPLE IN MOVIE SCREAMING.]  Preferably something that could fly. [CATS IN MOVIE MEWLING.]  And I vowed to get right to work, as soon as the movie was over.  The first thing I needed to do was create an inator that would make things larger.  Huh?  I tried it out on my cowboy hat.  It was a success.  My ten-gallon hat had turned into a two thousand-gallon hat.  Whoa!  [CRASHING.] [CAR ALARM WAILING.]  Well, that's the end of that hat.  Next, I had to genetically modify a mouse so it could fly.  [MOUSE SQUEALING.] [BITING.]  Doofenshmirtz: Ow!  Then I decided it would be easier to just use a bat.  So, I ordered a retired stunt bat from a low-budget bat circus  that had recently gone belly-up. You know, the economy.  I was on the precipice of Tri-State Area domination.  At last, I had the ultimate creepy soldier! [SQUEAKS.]  And then I remembered, I had a very mild phobia of bats.  [BAT SQUEAKING.]  [SHRIEKS.] Get away, get away, get away!  I also have a mild phobia of shellfish.  WAITRESS: Here's your order, sir.  Doofenshmirtz: [SHRIEKS.] Get away, get away, get away!  But bats are worse.  Scram, you flying gerbil! [BAT SQUEAKING.]  Am-scray!  [SQUEAKING.]  You're making me miss the Hootenanny! [SQUEAKING.]  Sir, I found your radio.  It was embedded in the dashboard of your car.  Norm! Don't just stand there! Do something about this bat!  Really? That's your solution? Throw a radio at it.  Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Don't throw that. That's imitatable.  What if I hit it with this?  No! No! Wait! Don't shoot him with that! That's my  And I thought the bat was scary before, when he was, you know, tiny.  [BAT SHRIEKING MENACINGLY.]  It was at that point that Norm and I decided to come out here.  Plus the bat kind of looks like my cousin, Narthelliot!  Which, as you can imagine, is weird for me.  - Isn't that about right, Norm? - It's even more horrible than it looks!  Phineas: Everybody got their helmets and boards?  - Isabella: Yeah! - Buford and Baljeet: I'm ready!  Okay, Ferb, fire it up. We're going to Foam Town!  [WHOOPING.]  [GRUNTS.]  There's nothing that I've found as good as goin' round and round   In Foam Town   In Foam Town   I used to skin my knees  [WHOOPING.]  But here it doesn't matter where I fall   You'll never get scarred 'cause nothing's really hard   In Foam Town   So take a rollin' ride on a squeezable urban sprawl   Come on down to Foam Town   In Foam Town   Yeah   There's no bruises or concussions   There's no painful repercussions   There's no braces There's no bandages No hospital stay   If you jump and try to land it   You can eat it or face-plant it   And you know that your insurance plan will not have to pay   Come on down to Foam Town   Come on down to Foam Town   Come on down   Just come on down to Foam Town   Come on down to Foam Town   Yeah! Come on down   Come on down to Foam Town   And over here are the models of our robotically operated Rovers.  The Mars Rover,  the Moon Rover,  and this is the Irish Rover.  - You sent a Rover to Ireland? - Well, we had to test it somewhere.  In a land afar in Castlebar Many months ago   We sent an Irish Rover To look around, you know   With a tur-la-lur-la Fiddle-die-dee   And a tur-a-fiddle-die-do   In a land afar in Castlebar Many months ago   It took a couple of months,  but we're finally starting to get some really great pictures back.  Thank you for the blanket, Perry the Platypus.  - Vanessa: Dad? - Vanessa?  [WHISPERING.] Oh, no! Vanessa, get out of there!  - There's a huge bat on the loose. - Really?  [SHRIEKING.]  Vanessa: Wow! Cool. It looks like your cousin, Narthelliot.  [QUIETLY.] No sudden movements or loud noises, Vanessa.  Dad, relax. It's just a bat. They just eat bugs.  But it's a very big bat!  Now, come on. Just, just stand up. It's okay.  It's time to face your fear. [BAT GROWLING.]  [NERVOUSLY.] Well, okay  [MUFFLED GROANING.]  Oh, no, no! Bad bat! Spit him out!  [GROANS.]  Gross! [SCREAMS.]  Oh, yeah, this is much better! [BAT SHRIEKING.]  Dad! Oh, hey, Perry.  I was wondering if you could help me. [ENGINE FIRING UP.]  Thanks, Perry. You're a peach.  So, what did I miss?  Oh, hey, Narthelliot! We were just talking about you.  Jack: Of course, even better than using a Rover, we have these.  We call them global surveillance satellites.  No matter where you are on this Earth,  there's always one of these flying above you in orbit,  streaming live video to us here.  That's right. Here's the outside of our building, right now.  And we can look up any location, instantly.  The Eiffel Tower, the Taj Mahal  So, you could look down on anybody's backyard  and just see what they're doing?  - Pretty cool, huh? - Wow, that's got to be handy for something.  And three. Two. One  - What? - Really? All right.  [SHRIEKING.]  [Doofenshmirtz SCREAMING.]  Whoa! Oh, I get it. This is what it does.  Flying through a hoop. That's what I get  for buying a bat from a defunct bat circus!  - So, having fun yet? - Oh, you know I am!  You know, my Dad goes on and on about the cafeteria here,  and I think he's right. This food is [SPITTING.]  [GASPS.] I've got an idea! My brothers are  probably building something in our backyard right now,  and we can use the surveillance satellite to catch them doing it!  Come on!  I was wondering how long that would take.  Just let me punch in my address  [GASPS.] Oh, my gosh! I knew it! Look at that thing!  - Wow. What is it? - It's an eye in the sky bust!  Come on, let's go get my Mom.  Okay, Ferb, turn it off. Let's take a little break.  [Buford GRUNTING.]  - You okay, Buford? - I'm having the time of my life!  - Is anybody else hungry? - I am!  Come on, let's go see what's in the kitchen.  Doofenshmirtz: Oh no! Oh, no, no! Not again!  [CLANGING.] Ow, my head! Ow, my head again!  Ow! Now I forgot math.  Ow! There goes Social Studies.  Oh, good! They're back!  This way, Mom. Just see for yourself.  Oh, wow! It's our house!  And you can see the boys! And their little skateboards.  Hi, boys!  - They can't hear you, you know. - I know.  Hi! Whoo-hoo!  Hey! Foam Town's gone.  You say that like it doesn't happen every day.  And you say that like an angry old prospector.  - What does that even mean? - I stand by that metaphor.  Finally, Daisy, we're here.  Our new home! Lots of elbow-room and no one to bother us.  The last frontier! A place where a man and his donkey can  Dang it! Come on, Daisy, we're heading west.  [Doofenshmirtz SCREAMING.]  Perry the Platypus! Welcome to Saint Louis.  Now, do something about this bat, please!  [SQUEAKING.]  [YELPS.] Well, at least I lost my fear of bats.  [CRASHING.] [GRUNTS.]  WAITRESS: Oh, it's you again.  Doofenshmirtz: [SCREAMING.] Go away, go away, go away!  WAITRESS: Oh, just stop it.  There's nothing that I've found as good as goin' round and round   In Foam Town   In Foam Town   I used to skin my knees  [WHOOPING.]  But here it doesn't matter where I fall   You'll never get scarred 'cause nothing's really hard   In Foam Town   So take a rollin' ride on a squeezable urban sprawl   Come on down to Foam Town"

That sounds exciting.  I'll come have a look as soon as I'm done doing whatever this is.  I don't believe it! A fuzzy doll in the shape of a bear?  It's the end of decency.  You never believed in me or anthropomorphism.  Everybody, run! It's a big hammery swan!  Ha! Soon you will all see the power of my  We can't hear you!  Look! A huge, rampaging, steam-powered hammery swan!  If only there was a way we could record this event.  Auguste, you have just invented the moving  picture documentary. Quickly, mood music!  This sure is a lot of shucked corn and fresh milk.  All in an afternoon's work.  Aren't you a bit young to be industrial revolutionaries?  Yes. Yes, we are.  As a simple farmer from a bygone age, that's good enough for me.  All right, Spartacus, let's get these goods to market,  and then it's back to the bookcase for you.  All our chores are done and it's still light out.  What else do you guys wanna do today?  We could drink lemonade and sit on the porch.  We could go to Panama and start digging.  We could formally begin courting.  - What? - Nothing.  They built a giant machine that does their chores.  It shucks the corn, and it shoots seeds out of a Gatling gu  - But, but, but - Candace, it's 1903.  We do not use that word!  No, no, no, you're not getting my best side.  But here, let me show you my worst side!  What? Sweary the swan!  Ah, you wanna play swan-chicken, huh?  Oh, no. Get back here!  Oh, no! He's using the old foie gras maneuver.  Curse you, Sweary the Swan!  And that's the way it was at the Danville World's Fair.  A giant steam-powered hammering swan?  Come on, Dad. That sounds a little far-fetched  for the time period, doesn't it?  Oh, yes. Yes, it does.  Man, how long was I up there?  Welcome to the future, all you forward-thinking socialites   Delightful world of steam so bright   Change your life overnight   Behold, this lady's hair brush This motor-powered cow   If you don't know how this gizmo works   I'll try to show you how   It's robotic kitchens, prototypes, a singing kettle   You'll love this nut and turtle shell made of living metal   You'll never need to settle for yesterday's future   We've borrowed from tomorrow   Steam power, it's so super!   Welcome to a brave new world!  My word!   The future is an amazing time for you to climb aboard   Welcome to a brand-new day  Hurray!   Everything will change Time for me to show the way"
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   4x27 - ""Just Our Luck""  Dude, somebody's got to play it, right?  [BUZZES.]  You know, Universe, if you were going to give me  practically unbustable brothers,  you could at least have made them not morning people.  Yeah, I see you down there.  Hey, where's Perry?  [CHATTERING.]  Sorry you had to pull that all-nighter,  but we really appreciate you filling in for Agent Q.  With most everyone down at Agent-Con this week,  we're, uh, a little short-handed.  Yet again, I am the only girl.  Anyway, Agent P, Doofenshmirtz has been experimenting  with energy fields and it's starting to get dangerous.  It knocked out our microwave oven!  Get out there, Agent P, and right that ridiculous wrong.  This breakfast burrito is like a, bean and cheese icicle,  except that it's larger and wrapped in a tortilla.  - Hey, Phineas. What are you doing? - Hey, Isabella.  You're just in time to help us build a zip line tennis game  across town for the ultimate game of sky tennis.  - Or ""skennis"" for short - Now that you're here,  - we can play doubles for twice the fun! - I'll be the judge of that.  Perfect! 'Cause we need you to be the line judge!  Judge? Cool! Do I get one of those powdered wigs?  - No. - Ah, I'll do it anyway.  [CHORUS.] # Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! #  Woof! Woof! Intruder approaching!  Woof! Woof, Woof!  Good boy. I love this new guard dog software.  I was beginning to think you'd found another evil scientist to fight. Oop!  Oh, what a little angel.  I'll just have to tell you my evil plan subliminally,  like, like when people listen to foreign language CDs in their sleep.  I did that once, and now I can totally speak Portuguese to sleeping people.  Anyway, recently I was musing to myself  about how lucky my brother, Roger, is.  Luck is called ""stinkelkrampen"" in Drusselstein  and I never seem to have any of the good kind.  Turns out that every object has a positive or negative energy field.  I harnessed that positive and negative energy  and created the Stinkelkrampen-inator!  [YAWNS.] Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!  You see, what I'll do is I'll zap myself with good luck,  and then I'll go zap Roger with bad luck.  Then, I will ascend to become the mayor of Danville  and then I will rule the entire Tri-State  [YAWNS.] I will rule the entire Tri-State Area.  Aw, man! Norm, I told you, on the paper. On the paper!  Bad Dog.  Looking good, guys.  All we need to do is hammer in this last nail  and we'll be ready to go.  Huh, that's odd. Glad, I always carry a spare.  Whoa. Good thing you're wearing your steel tip sneakers.  Actually, today I'm not. Ouch.  And that is how the bad luck setting works!  Except, of course, I won't be shooting random blasts off the balcony.  Now check out the good luck settings!  And again, I won't be just shooting it off the balcony like this.  Time to embark on my daily 500 brush  stroke marathon to manageable hair.  One. What the  A perfect 40 degree angle?  I can't believe it! A perfect hair day!  - I finally got my P.H.D! - Oh, that's wonderful, honey.  Not a single day goes by when I don't appreciate my P.H.D.  That's great, Dad, but I'm not talking about a degree.  Oh, neither am I!  Time to take my perfect hair to a bust show.  [CELL PHONE RINGS.] Hello? You're kidding!  I won a random contest to sing back-up for Love Handel  at the Danville 24 hour music awards? Sweet!  Perfect hair day? Back-up singer for Love Handel?  That could only mean Wait, let me try one last thing.  [GASPS.] Pillows magically appear to break my fall!  It's true. I'm finally having good luck!  I was using my P.H.D., my ""Pillow Hurling Dexterity.""  Nah, still lucky. [GASPS.] I'll actually be able  to bust Phineas and Ferb today!  Oh, wait. Mom's at that weekend-long plant-potting retreat.  [CELL PHONE RINGS.] Hi, Mom! The seminar's over already?  Yeah appearently, I just put some dirt in a pot.  I don't know why I cleared my whole schedule.  Great! See you at 4:00. Yes!  Today is the day that I bust Phineas and Ferb!  - Whoo-hoo! - I just don't get it.  Everything we try to do either falls apart, breaks,  or somehow ends up backwards.  I know this goes completely against all logic  and therefore makes it totally out of character for me to say,  but I think you may have been cursed with bad luck.  [GASPS.] Bad luck?  Dude, I call 'em like I see 'em.  Hmm. Bad luck. That's a new one!  It happens. There's not much you can do about it.  No! There is something we can do about it.  If we can create algorithms to predict bad luck,  we can make allowances for it and still have fun.  Just like the fail-safe system on space capsules or airplanes.  Exactly. We'll make having bad luck fun!  Cool!  Okay, it's time to go.  Luck and cover.  [CHUCKLES.] Good stinkelkrampen tickles!  [GASPS.] Look! A penny! It's working.  Aw, man! Tails. Well, you know the rules, Heinz.  Turn it over for the next person.  I say, a lucky penny! Thanks for the flip, old bean.  Here is $1,000.  [SQUEALS.] It worked.  [CHUCKLES.] Ooh, time to give Roger  a dose of bad stinkelkrampen he'll never forget!  Okay, team! All fail-safe systems are in place.  Go! Yeah!  What a great day for sky tennis, huh, Markus?  Or a ""skennis"" as locals call it, Mark.  Mark: Phineas and the gang have the ball in play, so here we go.  Markus: Lob to Phineas and Ferb as Phineas sets up for a powerful return.  Ooh, looks like Baljeet is positioned perfectly for  Both: Oh, no! [SCREAMS.]  Mark: What rotten luck!  Let's just hope Baljeet survives the fall.  But Isabella is right there with the save.  And apparently so is Baljeet!  A beautiful air bag maneuver, Mark.  Which bounces him right back into the game.  Down we go, Perry the Sleep-apus.  And away we go.  Sweet!  - Free samples? - Thank you!  [CHOMPS.] Mmm, I could get used to this good luck thing.  It's better than having a genie. That was a mistake.  That wasn't a wish, it's just a song.  It's, it's not even a song. It's a jingle.  Ugh! You ever try to sue a genie?  Let's see what kind of tunes are on the FM dial. [SONG PLAYING.]  Hey, I love this song!  I guess I shouldn't be surprised at this point, but what the hey!  I'm swingin' from the cherry tree   What has this day got in store?   Dancing in the sunshine   Above the clouds I'm gonna soar   Then I'm gonna eat a s'more   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Smiles stretching miles long   Dancing in the sunshine   Got my favorite flip-flops on   My SPF is super strong   My hair blows in the summer breeze   Dancing in the sunshine   I'm groovin' with some retirees   With cartoon bandage on my knee   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh   Doofenshmirtz: I love it when the song ends right as you reach your destination!  Not to mention the free cans of almond brittle that I got during the chorus.  - Well, hello, Roger. - Hello, Heinz. What can I do for you?  Well, little brother, you have had nothing but good luck  your whole life and I'm here to even things up for once.  Oh, Heinz, the power of positive stinkelkrampen  is the result of hard work, strong networking,  and thoughtful actions in matters both business and personal.  [SCOFFS.] I prefer to inator my way to success.  Just like I wrote in my book.  Available in dollar bins everywhere.  Now let's see what Ferb can do with Isabella's blistering smash.  Wow! I've never seen a racket spontaneously become unstrung!  Ferb's shot is headed straight for Isabella and she  [GASPS.] Oh, that is a tough break.  She's flying right past the gap.  This is absolutely amazing.  Hey, do you guys have a permit to do sports commentary on this roof?  - We totally have one. - We do.  It's in the production truck downstairs.  Which totally exists. Let's get outta here!  - I'm home! - Hi, Mom!  I know you wanna drag me to the backyard right now, Candace,  but can it wait until I repot my new plant?  No prob, Mom. Take your time.  Okay Uh, thanks, hon. [GRUNTS.]  Oh, how cute. My new plant looks like a little secret agent. [GIGGLES.]  How 'bout you guard this alcove, Mr. Secret Agent Plant?  [GIGGLES.]  Sorry, Planty the Potted Plant.  But apparently, your cover's been blown.  I'm afraid you'll have to be repotted with another family.  All right, Roger. Prepare to suffer the bad luck of the  Hey, hey, hey! Hey, wait, wait a minute!  You suppose to stay still for a good inatoring.  Aww, but I just realized that I haven't said hello  to your little platypus friend.  Careful. He gets a little testy if he wakes up from his nap too soon.  [FLOOR CREAKS.] Uh-oh.  [GRUNTS.] Oh, yes, I'm not a morning person either.  Great game, guys.  Hello, brothers! I made you a pie! For your bust-day!  Well, that can't be right. Bus Day isn't until next week.  Guess she's getting a head start.  [GROANING.]  Aah! Oh, no. Now, my luck's gonna go back to normal.  Which is of course bad.  Just take your time.  It's not like the Earth is going to open up and swallow it.  Not today!  [GASPS.] Oh, no! That means  Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom!  [RUMBLING.] [ALL GASP.]  And right after Candace said that couldn't happen.  Yeah, that's borderline creepy.  Candace, you still haven't explained why you're covered with pie.  Oh, just come on. This'll explain everything. Bu-bu Wha  - Hi, Mom! - [STAMMERING.] But  Well, my luck may be back to normal, but at least I still  have an entire trunk full of delicious almond brittle.  [SCREAMS.] [SIGHS.]  Mental note,  never accept canned confections from a guy in a clown suit.  My hair blows in the summer breeze   Dancing in the sunshine   I'm groovin' with some retirees   With cartoon bandage on my knee   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh Dancing in the sunshine   Whoa-oh-oh-oh   Shine"

A whole day without Jeremy and you're not obsessing about it?  Who are you and what have you done with Candace?  Silly BFF, Jeremy likes me for who I am.  It's like we're one. When I breathe in, he breathes out.  His heart says, ""knock, knock,""  and my heart says, ""who's there?""  And the answer is ""us.""  [Candace giggles.]  Remember those days when I was always panicking  about what he thought or what he would or wouldn't like?  - Ancient history. - That was yesterday.  Candace, I'm going to the store.  - Do you need anything? - Nah, I'm good.  - Okay. - Oh wait, I am out of toothpaste.  - All right.

Hello? Hello?  Okay, Isabella, eep your eye on the ball!  - Whoa! Great hit! - Power hitter patch, check!  Your analysis of the pitch's angle and trajectory was most impressive.  Only you can nerdify a great sport like baseball.  Buford, hitting a baseball involves the basic principles  of velocity, force and geometry.  Buford: You're visualizing numbers in the air again, aren't ya?  Ferb, I know whate we're gonna do today.  We can use geometric algorithms to build the ultimate batting challenge.  - Well? - It's not as bad when he does it.  [sighs.] I cannot argue. So, where is Perry?  Oh, he's at home.  [chattering.]  He's not doing much. What's over here?  Morning, Agent P. As you can see, I, uh,  I've had a little shaving mishap with this defective electric razor.  Just not comfortable with my eyebrows moving independently of each other.  Carl: But you are rockin' the reverse mohawk, sir.  Get with it, Carl. The hip kids refer to it as a ""hawkmo.""  Anyhow, Agent P, retail stores all across the Tri-State area  are reporting a huge influx of returned faulty items and coincidentally,  Doofenshmirtz has been spotted at customer service counters.  I have a hunch that these two unrelated things may just be related!  Now go find out if Doofenshmirtz has anything to do with this.  Also, find out if anyone is actually calling it a ""hawkmo.""  And if not, please get that started.  Candace: Ugh, this is taking forever!  We'll never get home in time to bust the boys!  I'll tell you what. How about you shop for your own things  - and then meet me at the register? - Ooh, great idea!  Hygiene! Here we are.  Okay, lip wax, pimple cream, fungal cream.  Wow! Running out of all my most embarrassing  personal hygiene products on the same day.  Ooh, right, deodorant!  Oh, now, which Ducky Momo deadorant I use?  Hmm. Well, there's only one way to be sure.  [sniffs.]  Jeremy: Hey, Candace! What you doing?  Uh [nervous giggle.] Hey, Jeremy.  Um, yeah, I'm just trying to reach the top shelf.  Allow me.

I mean [giggles.] that's not my stuff.  That's my Mom's! I was shopping for my Mom.  Yeah, my Mom has really unruly , uh nose hair.  Yeah, really bad, okay?  Uh, yeah, I was on my way to the [clicks tongue.]  - the water sports section. - I didn't know you did water sports.  'Cause I'm going to the extreme water park today.  - Why don't you come? - Yeah, cool!  You know, 'cause I'm so down with the ten hanging and whatnot.  [giggling.] Yeah.  Chorus: [singing.] Doofenshmirtz evil incorporated!  A-ha! Consider yourself marked down!  Handy little shopping device, isn't it?  Anyway, you're gonna love this segue, Perry the platypus.  All of my broken inator parts were messing up the Feng Shui of my apartment.  Thanks, Larry. My Feng Shui consultant.  To keep my Chi in balance, I came up with this.  Behold! The Back-to-the-store-inator!  Now instead of waiting in those ridiculously long lines  at the return counter, I scan each item  and presto!

Whoo-hoo!  Phineas: [over speaker.] Welcome, sports fans!  We have a great game for you today!  It's the most extreme batting experience ever!  The game is simple.  Each level is worth 10 points.  The higher the level, the harder it gets!  The first one to hit the target at the top wins!  It's survival of the fittest, a test of wills!  Only one contestant will survive!  No, no, no, everyone will survive.  You're going down, dweeb!  I will beat you. It is a mathematical certainty.  It's extreme! It's extreme!  I don't know how extreme it is.  It's, you know, big, but it is still just a batting cage.  Let's not oversell it.  Gentlemen, start your engines!  No, no, they, they don't have engines.  Oh, oh, I guess Ferb Ferb has an engine.  Forgot about that.  It ain't mild or morate, safe or secure   it ain'meek or mellow, docile or demure   it ain't peaceful or placid, sedate or serene   [whooping.]  [screaming.] # what it is is ex, ex, ex #  extremely extreme   conclusively, decidedly, exactly, for sure   precisely, emphatically and definitely   unconventionally and unambiguously   ex, ex, ex extremely extreme   extremely extreme   [Candace groans.] [cell phone ringing.]  - Uh, hello? - Candace, I've been  waiting at the checkout line for a half hour!  - Where are you? - I'm at the extreme water park with Jeremy.  What?

[groans.]  - Wanna go again? - I gotta go home.  Ah! Very resourceful, Perry the platypus!  Using coupons to cut prices!  [stammering.] Wait! Not my baseball card collection! Oh!  Yes! I told you genies were real, Sheila!  Wherever you are.  Aw, man. You have no idea how much that was worth!  [cash register dings.] Although judging by the jingle Ow.  [bell ringing.]  Buford and Baljeet are tied!  And Buford steps up to the batter's box!  Folks, you can cut the tension with a child-safe knife!  Phineas: Here comes the pitch. Yes!  Looking good! Looking great! Looking fantastic!  Isabella: Denied!  Ugh.  Baljeet eyes up the target as he steps to the plate.  Ready himself for the pitch.  And Wow!  - What a trajectory! - Isabella: But not enough power!  Phineas: A disappointed Baljeet walks away.  Oh, it looks like this game could go into sudden death.  - It could just be a tie. - No! Sudden death!  [beam zapping.] Aw, man! Not my new flat screen!  Hey, no way! I paid way more for that TV!  [pennies jingling.] Ow! Ow!  Carl: I would like to return this electric razor.  Are you sure you read the instructions, Carl?  And you're showing me boring math equations why?  Buford, these equations show that if we combine your brawn  with my brains we can conquer the final target together!  Do my ears deceive me? Are you saying we should work together?  I know! My ears cannot believe it either.  Jeremy: Looks like we made it back before your mom.  Yeah, sorry to have to rush [gasps.]  I knew Phineas and Ferb were up to something!  [car honking.] Mom's here!  Just in time to bust the boys!  - Mom! - Don't poke the bear, Candace.  - You're in enough trouble as it is. - But, Mom  Now let's take these inside before the frozens turn into  Oh, shoot, I must've left the other bag at the store.  Mom! Just turn your head and look up! [car driving away.]  But But But But it's right there  - Are those batting cages? - Come on, Jeremy.  There's still a chance to bust them.  - This better work, dweeb. - Just follow the trajectory I plotted out  and I promise we will hit the final target!  - We can do this! - Optimism makes my angry.  - Baljeet: Use it! - Phineas: Here comes the pitch!  Isabella: Whoa, it's coming at the big one!  Folks, it's the power hit of the evening! But is it good?  [all bells ringing.]  - Phineas: It's good! - Isabella: Whoo! Yeah!  [all cheering.]  Both: Ah!  - Ooh! - Both: Aw.  [growling.] Aw, you'll bust 'em next time, tiger.  Doofenshmirtz: You know, chasing's not much of an option  with my pants full of pennies!  Ah, well, live and learn.  At least, you hit my clothes and not me.  I wonder what happens if a person  Drusselstein! Hmm.  Curse you, Perry the platypus and my wretched, wretched life.  Wow! Way to go, guys.  I guess we can work together after all.  - I hate to say you're right. So I won't. - Fair enough.  [chattering.] Oh, there you are, Perry!  Safe at home.  [chattering.]  - And what a waste. - Hey, the day's not a total loss.  We had a great time at the water park.  - Wanna go back tomorrow? - Uh, I have a confession to make.  The only reason I said I liked extreme sports  was because I was embarrassed that you caught me buying  all that hygiene stuff for myself.  Aw, nothing you do could be that embarrassing.  Oh, Jeremy.  [farts.] Candace? Was that you?  It's a normal bodily function, Jeremy. Get over it.  Wait, wait, I thought it was cute!  Hi, Mom. Stacy and I are gonna have lunch here at the mall.  - So we'll be hanging out a little longer. - I thought you probably would.  Candace: Are the boys doing anything bustable yet?  Not yet. Although, they are trying to figure out  how they can both use the push broom at the same time.  Candace: Okay, keep me posted.  Hey, Mom. We're going down to the park to fly our kites.  You guys want a ride or something?  I thought you had to meet with those landscaper guys.  Oh right! I forgot!  [reading.]  Chorus: # Du Bois landscape artists #  Also, that's yesterday's paper.  I thought the city council was getting a little redundant.  [car honking.]  [in British accent.] Hello. I'm Pierre Du Bois, one-day landscape artist.  Hi. Oh, it's not [pronouncing in French.] Du Bois?  No. It's just like it's spelled. It's French.  Chorus: # Du Bois landscape artists #  it's just like it's spelled, it's French   Except Floraine ain't French. He's from Dutch.  [speaking Dutch.]  That's Dutch for, ""it's nice to meet you.""  [chuckles.] To my American ears, it almost sounded like, ""where's Perry?""  Chorus: # Perry! #  [video game sounds.]  Ah, Agent P, special surveillance photos tell us that  Doof has been outfitting his skiff with something large.  - It's hard to tell what it is - Sir, I looked out the window at this   building just now and I saw the mysterious object was   - actually a bucket. A huge bucket - Carl!  Why didn't we just look out the window in the first place?  - I don't know, sir. - Doggone it, Carl.  We can't keep wasting our funds like this. Well anyway, Agent P,  I guess you can go over there and see what he's gonna do with that large bucket.  - Carl: Is he gone? - Yeah, come on. Let's go to Vegas.  Hey, Baljeet! Check this out.  It's a kite, but it totally looks like a pirate ship.  That is very nice. Have you seen my kite?  Whoa! Is there even gonna be enough wind for something like that?  There should be, with Phineas's wind amplification device.  So, how does this work again?  You start by blowing a bit of wind into the intake funnel.  [inhales, blows.]  [bubbling.] Then we add super cold liquid nitrogen to cool things down,  cold air sinks, until it starts to warm back up again.  And that's when we heat it up with a giant blowtorch. And then as it accelarates,  it sucks up more air volume and eventually blows it out of an acceleration cone.  [bird screams.]  But that was just one big puff of air. How can we fly kites like that?  Simple. Irving has volunteered to keep puffing air into the intake.  I've been eating mint all morning. You know, so it won't be stinky.  That's very thoughtful of you, Irving.  I didn't really do it for you.  So, here's the yard. I want something nice out here.  I think you know what to do. You are the landscapers, after all.  [speaking Dutch.]  Actually, we're landscape artists.  Do I need to show you the car door again?  - Chorus: # Du Bois landsca # - No, no, it's fine.  I'll be inside if you need me.  [speaking Dutch.]  No, I didn't get the money up-front.  Is everyone's kite ready?  - Baljeet: All set. - Isabella and Buford: Ready.  - Okay, Irving, let her rip. - Roger, wilco!  [inhales, blows.]  - Isabella: It's working. - Buford: Wow! Minty!  Ahoy and avast, ye swarthy dogs!  Wow, Buford, you look like a real pirate.  That's nothing. Watch this. Fire!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Hey, Phineas! Watch this, I'm jumping clouds! Whee!  That's awesome, Isabella! Watch this.  Now I'm in a car.  [bird screeching.]  Enjoy your little welcome to Danville luncheon, ladies!  For soon, Grulinda, you shall taste the wrath of my  Perry the platypus!  Oh, before I forget, I got you a little lair-warming gift.  [laughs.] You fell for the old ""spring-loaded cable trap hidden in a ring box"" trick.  What? That That's a thing.  Obviously. But I bet you're wondering why I'm spying on a garden party.  Okay, maybe you're not wondering, but I'm going to tell you anyway.  Doofenshmirtz: It all started when I was a child back in Drusselstein,  there was this mean girl named Grulinda.  Every day she would pour water on my head.  [cackling.] Ow!  - No matter where I was - Ow! [cackling.]   or what I was doing  [cackling.] Ow! Stop throwing water on me!  [father speaking German.]  But, by some wonderful twist of fate, she has moved here to Danville. See?  ""Grulinda Boubenweir moves to Danville.  ""Party to be held in her honor at Danville park.""  And the party just started.  I don't know how they got this picture in the magazine so quick.  Eh, guess they're trying to compete with the internet.  But I digress. I can finally have my revenge  with this! The sogg-inator! [laughing.]  Now, I will fly over her party  and douse her with a lifetime of soggy humiliation!  What? Oh, you think that it's petty  that I've held on to this grudge for so long.  Well, well, it's not petty. It's not.  It's evil or something. It's not petty.  Okay, guys. I'm dying to see what you  - [cat yowling.] What is that? - Well, it's not finished yet,  but it's a juxtaposition of the irrigated world of the suburban  lawn and the dryness of the natural summer environment.  A water bucket dumping desert cacti.  Honeysuckle basket, wheat grass handle,  extra spikey barrel cacti in place of the water.  That looked That's [grunts.]  [speaking Dutch.]  Not to worry. Great art always takes time before it's accepted.  [phone ringing.] Hello?  Mom. I need you to go into my closet and tell me whether  Candace, I Look, call me back in a few minutes.  - I'm a little ticked off right now. - What happened?  Du Bois have made a huge mess in the yard. They've ripped  up the lawn, there's a giant bucket and a bunch of cactuses.  I'm so mad! I gotta go.  Candace, what's wrong?  It's the boys. [softly.] They're busted.  I don't believe it, Stacy   the moment is here   my brothers are busted   put it on the blogosphere   I've been vindicated   there's no more to discuss   I did not anticipate it it's a straight-up bust   it's a straight-up bust say it all over town   things are lookin' up because my brothers went down   it's a brand new day may take a while to adjust   and it makes me wanna say,   ""everybody, it's a straight-up bust!""   Doofenshmirtz: We should be over Grulinda's party any minute.  Then it's soggy revenge time! Whoa! It's windy up here.  If that keeps up, I won't have enough water to dump on her.  [banging.]  What? Did you hear that?  [inhales, blows.] [drop.]  Uh-oh.  All: Whoa!  - Isabella: It's getting a little rainy. - Buford: A little?  - Looks like we'd better climb down. - Just remember, Baljeet,  the captain always goes down with the ship.  Oh, boy, a promotion! Hey!  All: Whee!  What's that noise? [screams.]  What the heck, man? You've been dumping out my water?  Well, this had better not be empty.  Pierre: Okay, Linda, I know you're gonna love this.  This is the irrigation wheel.  Each section represents a different section of the garden.  It's a comment on the capricious nature of our existence.  Some get water and live, others go dry and die.  This is ridiculous. I don't want to end up with a yard full of dead plants!  [speaking Dutch.]  - What did he say? - He said, ""great art takes time!"" in Dutch.  Hey, what are you Oh!  Hey, watch the ailerons. Whoa!  [crashing.]  [yelps.] Whoa, whoa, whoa!  [screaming.]  [continues screaming.]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, you!  [growls.] I almost dumped a giant bucket of water on you and your  party but then there was this whole mishap with a platypus  But I will get you next time.  Revenge is a dish best served soggy, Grulinda!  - Uh, Grulinda's over there, bub. - Oh, you're not [clears throat.]  - All right, Gru - Wait, is that hold on one second.  [gasps.] Soggybottom Heinz Doofenshmirtz!

I don't understand.  You picked on me all through grade school.  [laughs.]  I poured all that water on you because I liked you.  Really? Well, I guess you must have liked me a lot,  'cause there was a lot of, you know, water.  I've got more time to play   and this is totally a straight-up   my life's a big buffet   and this is totally a straight-up   I know this sounds cliche   but this totally a straight-up bust   Wait, what am I doing?  Stacy, get me off of this thing. I need to see what boys have done.  She holds the thorns, which symbolize the hardships of being a mom.  And she holds pink jasmine, which symbolizes the joy of children.  This is the most  sweet and adorable thing I've ever seen.  ""Sweet and adorable""? She's mocking us!  [speaking Dutch.]  It is so good to see you after all these years.  Just look at you. Oh, come here my little soggybottom.  - [stammering.] Yeah, well, you hug now? - Oh, why are you all wet?  [chuckles.] Funny thing, I was flying over your party  with a giant bucket of water and this platypus hit me with a  Why were you flying over my party with a big bucket of water?  - He was gonna dump it on you for revenge. - Okay, now you're on my list!  - Revenge? For what? - Well, you know, you did dump water  - on me when we were little - Heinz, I was eight!  Have you been holding this petty grudge all these years?  [stammering.] Well, no, it's not petty.  I was explaining to the platypus earlier. It's not petty exactly  Well, here you go, I pour water on your head! [groans.]  Wait, was that for the vengeance thing, or do you still like me?  Yeah, it was for the vengeance thing. [clank.]  Tell me! What did the boys do in the backyard?  - How much trouble are they in? - Well, at first I thought  Du Bois were the world's worst landscapers,  - but they're growing on me. - Landscapers?  Yeah, here, let me show you.  So, I figure we can attach the seat right here.  Here they are, mom.  - Show me what they did. - What did who do?  Whoa! Wait! Where did it all go?  - [humorlessly.] Ha, ha. - How is that even possible?  - Very funny, Mom. - It was all here just a second ago.  I have never been so insulted in my life!  She called it sweet and adorable.  [speaking Dutch.]  By the way, Floraine, I have no idea what you're saying.  Would you rather I spoke in English?  Well, yeah, now that you mention it.

"1 ""Cheers for Fears""  I'm totally sunk, Stace.  I've been working on Jeremy's birthday present for months,  but it's not even close to being as good as I want it to be.  Ugh. Lame.  Oh, come on, Candace. You're overthinking this.  Jeremy will love anything you make. What's your worry?  I just wanna do something really special to show Jeremy how much I care.  Something way over the top!  Something that defies the laws of physics  and exceeds the boundaries of the imagination Oh, no.  - Oh, yes. - No, no, no, no, no. Anything but that!  - You're going to have to ask for help from - Phineas and Ferb. Ohh.  Well, now that we've ironed out the bugs in our fusion-powered popper,  the popcorn is nice and fluffy.  And no longer glowing, so we're good to go.  What's that, Candace?  Let me talk to her, guys. I speak ""sullen.""  Candace messed up, and now Jeremy's birthday is ruined.  Hey! You completely misinterpreted what I said!  - Nuance. - So, what's going on, Candace?  It's Jeremy's birthday  and I wanna do mething really special to show I care  and you guys are good at doing, you know, what you do,  and well, all I have is this scrapbook and I don't wanna blow it.  So, can you help me, huh?  Wow! This is great! It's like a blueprint!  Ferb, I know what else we're gonna do today!  Great! Start working your magic.  And no pressure, but it's gotta be perfect!  We'll do our best.  - Thank you. - Oh. She said, ""Where's Perry?""  You have got to work on your sullen.  Hey there, Agent P.  Well, it's horrific movie night at my house, where a bunch of  agency guys get together and make fun of ridiculously bad movies.  He's always the guy shushing everybody.  Well, there's a time for fun and a time to pay attention.  Anyway, Agent P, when we went to rent tonight's horrific horror classic,  ""Night of the Living Torso,"" it was already gone.  In fact, all the movies within the horror genre  throughout Danville have been checked out!  Which is definitely a bummer and could possibly be evil.  Go check on Doof and see if he's bogarting those movies.  Uh, before 6:30, if possible.  - Candace, I'm headed out. - Okay, Mom.  - What's with the box? - Oh, uh, nothing.  I just wanted to see what this stuff looked like outside.  Candace, is this a ploy to get me to go outside  - to see what the boys are up to? - No! Er, I mean, no need.  Just go, and, uh, feel free to stay out for a while.  Stay out all afternoon in fact.  Reverse psychology. Nice try, hon.  I'm glad to see you changing it up.  - See you later. - Okay, bye.  So, here's all the Jerem-obilia I could find.  - Now, what? - Cool.  Now, just go around town and take pictures  of all the Jeremy related places and things you can.  The camera will transmit them back to us  to incorporate into our Mega Interactive Scrapbook-aganza.  No problemo. Candace is on field duty. Peace!  I'm sorry. Were you going to say something?  Okay.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Ugh. Isn't that always the way?  Right at the exciting part, that's when the doorbell rings.  Or, you know, a platypus breaks it down.  Anyway, behold the Worst Fear-inator!  What?  Oh, yeah, I guess from your point of view it's a little difficult to see.  Let me just get this out of the way for you. Here we go.  Now, in my never-ending pursuit of domination,  I discovered that the best evil rulers used fear to keep people in line.  So to get in the right headspace,  I did what any logical evil scientist would do.  Rented all the scary movies in Danville for research,  even the lousy ones like ""Dead Batteries.""  Which is actually better than its prequel, ""Batteries that Work,""  which was just a bunch of portable electronic devices functioning properly.  Once I was terrified, I was able to analyze  the fear-based synapses of the brain  and extrapolate some wonderful data.  Basically, I shoot someone with the machine  and whatever they're afraid of actually appears in real life!  What do ya say, Perry the Platypus? You like being a guinea pig?  Actually, you'd look kinda cute as a guinea pig.  I wonder if you'd be teal. I bet you would.  I bet you'd be a cute little teal guinea pig.  Something to think about for the future.  Anyway, Perry the Platypus, let's fire this baby up and see what scares you.  Because you know, it's going to materialize right over there.  All right, so what are you afraid of? Where is it?  What the hey! Nothing?  Ugh, that figures. I guess you'll just have to hang around!   Oh, wait, this one's better.  I'll just leave you here because you're all tied up!   One last one. You're gonna love it.  See you later, because it isn't my tail that's upside down!  No? No, no, I should've stuck with the first two. You're right.  Ooh, score!  That awning is the same color as Jeremy's eyes.  And daffodils!  Just like the ones he gave me on our third date!  Incoming. Perfect. Same color as Jeremy's eyes.  Huh, flower. I'm drawing a blank.  Daffodil. Third date.  Right. Now the machine will take the images  and print them in a giant, scaled-up form.  Nice touch. Smells like my Grandma.  I thought your grandma smelled like ant pheromones.  No, that's the other one.  These should really make Jeremy's Birthday Scrapbook-aganza  - a full sensory experience! - Great.  Just what I always wanted. To fully sense Jeremy.  Okay, what else? Ah!  - 'Scuse. Hot cocoa. - Hey!  Not bad.  Although Jeremy prefers it with a little more cinnamon.  I gotta make a note of that for the boys.  I guess my fortune came true.  ""You will share your cocoa with a long-necked teenager.""  - See? Right there. - Mine just says:  ""Your boyfriend's gonna get a fortune cookie at a French cafe.""  Get ready, Perry the Platypus!  The Tri-State Area's about to confront its fears!   Ow! Ow! I landed on my jawbone!  Right on that weird sticky-outy part under your ear.  And my jawbone landed on the remote.  Oh, Doof.  Okay. Nothing bad will happen as long as I don't think about anything scary. I  Oh, no! I couldn't help it. It just popped in there.  It can't be. Vending machines are taking over!  I said it could happen!  No, stay back, stay back.  No, no, no, no, I'm really not hungry. Really  No, no, no, not the tiny vanilla cookies!  How long have those been in there?  Okay, Candace. The Scrapbook-aganza is complete!  Plus, we got Love Handel to come in for a live soundtrack.  Okay, guys. Performance level.  I'm gonna need a test run so I can make notes.  - Sure! You're the boss. - That's right.  The way you play guitar That crazy octave reach   Your uncle's meatball sub We must have eaten two each   Here's where you ate that soup   And got that stomach flu   Your blue eyes Make me melt with a wink   You're always so polite You never say when I stink   It's a giant 3D scrapbook   And it's all about you   I know that I can be high-strung   Enough to make a lot of boyfriends flee   But you're still here with me now   Let's make some more memories   Let's make some more memories   You had hunky ankles in that sandal commercial   The time you saved that tree   It was so controversial   It's a giant 3D scrapbook   It's a giant 3D scrapbook   It's a giant 3D scrapbook   And it's all about you   And it's all about you   That sounded great, guys, but it's a B-natural in the chorus.  - Told ya. - That's what I was playing.  No! No! Not that!  Anything but the fake red licorice! It tastes like  What possessed me to make such a horrifying inator?  Well, I guess now we know what scares vending machines.  Well, Candace? Do you think Jeremy will like it?  Yeah, I just have a few notes here.  It's perfect! I love it, guys!  - I love it, love it, love it, I love it - She had me at smiley face.  Perry the Platypus! You're back!  I am never setting that puppy off again.  Oops!  It's really perfect.  I'm glad Mom's gone for the day, 'cause my biggest fear  is that this is just gonna fly away before Jeremy gets here.  And there he is.  Whoo-hoo!  Uh, did anyone else see that weird green beam?  I wasn't gonna mention it.  Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy! Jeremy!  You gotta see what the boys built in the backyard.  No, no, no! No! No! It's gone!  My worst fear has come true. I totally blew it.  Let me guess.  You had your brothers build me something super cool for my birthday  and now it disappeared. It's okay, I get it.  We don't have the invention anymore,  but here's what we used as a blueprint.  Candace designed it herself.  It's a regular-sized scrapbook   And it's all about you   And it's all about you   Oops! I really meant to hit the self-destruct button.  I'll just get this for you.  Uh, so, uh, do you need your parking validated  Oh, oh, you found a spot on the street! Ah, lucky you.  Curse you, Perry the Platypus and all that. You know.  Isabella, you've been awfully quiet all day.  I have just earned my 24 hours of silence patch.  I can see why you don't talk much, Ferb. I actually quite enjoyed it.  I ended up having an inner dialogue with myself all day.  Welcome to Ferb Land.  Yes, but the universe is constantly expanding.  Then, what is it expanding into?  Ooh!  Okay, now my mind is blown.  The way you play guitar That crazy octave reach   Your uncle's meatball sub We must have eaten two each   Here's where you ate that soup   And got that stomach flu   Your blue eyes Make me melt with a wink   You're always so polite You never say when I stink   It's a giant 3D scrapbook   And it's all about you   And it's all about you"

Let's see. Dorkenshmitz?  Doofen Doofenshmun  Doofenshmuntz?  No, that's utterly ridiculous.  Adrian: Whatever his name is, he's no Vanderbeek, that's for sure.  Nigel: There's the flag.  And they're off!  Monogram: Psst! Agent P, over here.  Doof has shot Vanderbeek with some kinda  Oh, right, he probably monologued his scheme to you already.  Anyhow, we need you to take Vanderbeek's place in the race.  Get that inator and get back here to reverse its effects so  Vanderbeek can finish the race and defeat Doofenshmirtz.  Carl has been trying to convince Vanderbeek to get back in the race  using his sophisticated powers of persuasion.  Come on, pretty please? Pretty please with a cherry on top?  - I'll be your best friend. - Yeah, you better get going, Agent P.  You can use the disguise setting on your Olson Martin.  Wow! The resemblance is uncanny.  Good luck, Agent P.  Nigel: What's this? Hello!  It looks like Paolo Vanderbeek is back in the race!  Wow, this isn't nearly as lame as I thought.  That's why our couch cushions are worn so unevenly,  Because we're always on the edge of our seats.  Doofenshmirtz: Let's see if I can rub this guy the wrong way.  [chuckling.]  Nice bumpin' into ya.  Or maybe it's time to use a little elbow grease.  [tires squealing.]  All right, smoke 'em if you got 'em.  Nigel: Approaching the Phillips head turn, millimetrically perfect!  Adrian: Or .04 inches perfect for backward people  who don't use the metric system.  Nigel: Dumpendork is gonna have his work cut out for him  if he wants to stay in the lead.  Uh, Paolo Vanderbeek! He's back?  Eh, looks like I'm gonna have to throw the works at him.  There ya go.  Nigel: I say, that is an unprecedented amount of  - contact shunts and shenanigans. - Adrian: Shenanigans?  Ian: You don't think there's some sort of foul play afoot?  In grand prix racing? Don't be ridiculous!  That kind of thing only happens in cartoons.  Looks like somebody needs another shot of the I-don't-care-inator!  Doofenshmirtz: Oh! That's mine!  Adrian: And that last contact has put Doofen [stammers.] spinning across the course.  Nigel: And Vanderbeek is pulling into the pits. What is wrong?  Come on, what are you, chicken? [squawking.]  Good work, Agent P! Now we just need you to  Oh, okay, yeah, you got that covered too.  Bocce balls! I cannot disappoint my fans!  Ian: Doifenshmoitz has got himself going again  with the help of an extremely large metal pit crew member.  This is without a doubt the weirdest race I've ever seen.  Grazie tanto, little beaver duck guy!  [shouting in Italian.]  Ian: And Paolo is back on the course.  Adrian: He'll have to really put his foot in  if he wants to catch Doofenshmintz by the end of the race.  [chuckling.]  Not to make excuses, but sometimes it's okay to be a little bit tacky.  Oh, maybe the tacks are supposed to be in the back.  Adrian: Dirkens splurtz has run himself off the course completely!  [speaking French.]  Nigel: And Vanderbeek pushes past, just in time  to seize the checkered flag! Well done!  All: Whoo-hoo-hoo!  - What an exciting finish! - Go, Paolo! Go, Paolo!  That was awesome!  Huh, I guess they're not doing anything today.  I am going to the mall and picking up a pleather jumpsuit.  Okay, did I win?  Oh, wait, no!  Oh, curse you, Paolo Vanderbeek!  You know that just doesn't roll    Perry the platypus, Perry the platypus.  And on that bombshell, we bid farewell from glamorous Montevillebad.  Doofenshmirtz' swanky new evil lair!   Yeah, it's swanky!  it's an even swap a variation on a timeshare   you can use the kitchen and the hallway closet   don't touch the rocket   or you'll lose your deposit   it's an old school evil hideout vacation swap"

Where's Perry?  Morning, Agent P! I see you're trying out the new SFU 2000.  It's a lot of fun, but don't let your duties slide.  Agent P, what do you think of his Father's Day gift?  Yes, it's a lovely tie. But I'm not your father!  Any who, Doofenshmirtz has plans to gum up the entire Tri-State Area!  And we need you to check it out. Good luck, Agent P!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!   Gotcha, Perry the Platypus! If you think this is a sticky situation,  you better hold on to that fedora. Behold!  The-Gum-Under-The-Shoe-inator!  I took all the wadded up chewing gum in the  entire Tri-State Area and fed it into this Inator.  Yeah, I know, it's really unsanitary.  Why don't people just throw the chewing gum in the trash, huh?  Today just isn't my day. It's Father's Day.  It's the hardest of the greeting card company holidays for me.  My issues with Father's Day began back when I was a child.  Those were lean times for my father  and our beloved lawn gnome was repossessed.  Okay, I know you've heard that one before.  But twice actually. But I really think that this  is where my relationship with my father went awry.  I mean, he made me be that lawn gnome.  Bewegen Sie nicht!  And he was really specific too.  He made me memorize the serial number of that particular lawn gnome.  D-A-E-H-M-2-3.  If only there was some way to reunite him with, you know,  that specific lawn gnome, maybe he and I could start again.  D-A-E-H-M-2-3!  You found him with an online gnome tracker?  Wow! There really is an app for everything now, isn't there?  Well, let's see. It says it's still in Drusselstein!  Now I can heal the old wounds between my father and me!  Oh, man, that is one of my most brilliant ideas yet.  An exact replica of Grandpa's old biplane.  Dad's gonna love this! Let's try her out.  Now, punch it!  Oh, yeah!  I know traveling by cannon is a little unconventional,  but the cannon place was going out of business,  so I got them at a volume discount.  Hang on.  Whoo-hoo!  Happy Father's Day, Dad! Dad?  Sorry for the lack of in-flight meal or entertainment, Perry the Platypus.  But one cannon can only go so far, so I set up a worldwide network!  Aw, man! Missed it by that much.  Perfect landing, Ferb! I'll go get Dad.  No, peeking, Dad! Keep 'em closed! Okay  - Open 'em! - Ta-da!  Thank you so much, boys!  I can't think of a better Father's Day gift!  Actually, there's a hidden feature you might want to check out.  - Hello, son! - Dad? But  - Come on, give us a hug! - Oh, Happy Father's Day!  What do you say we go on our traditional Father's Day flight?  Race you to the cockpit!  - Have fun! - What are you two standing there for?  You're part of the tradition now! Come on!  Cool!  - Right, then. Engine? - Contact!  Here we go!  In our two wing aeroplane doing tricks that look insane   To keep the peoples entertained and leave them breathless   Call us brave or slightly mad   I'm his son and he's me dad   And I look really grand in plaid   - # But now I'm vest-less # - # Nice ad lib, Dad. #  Thanks, son. I just roll with it.   Like you do!   It's the Fletcher Family Flying Circus!   Doing aerial acrobatics in the atmosphere   High above the stress and strife   There's nothing here to irk us   Just a father and a son together   Keepin' our heads above the weather   I wish that we could do this every year!   Barrel rolls and loop-de-loops   Buzzing that encounter group   Doing the Charleston on the wing   Yes, we'll try almost anything!   A Dim Old Man An English Bunt   A crazy Russian circus stunt   A Cuban eight An inverted spin   All while wearing this foolish grin!   It's the Fletcher Family Flying Circus!   Doing aerial acrobatics in the atmosphere   High above the stress and strife   There's nothing here to irk us   Just a father and a son together   Keepin' our heads above the weather   I wish that we could do this every year!   We're the Fletcher Family and we have no fear!   Ah, Drusselstein!  This way, Perry the Platypus.  Okay, so the gnome tracker located my  father's long lost lawn gnome at this location.  There it is!  - Hey! Put me down! - Ahh!  I thought you were my father's lawn gnome.  No worries, I get that all the time.  Probably due to my height combined with my eccentric fashion choices.  Uh, yeah. Uh, well, I'm looking for D-A-E-H-M-2-3.  Oh, yeah, it's been here for years. Here you go.  It is you! My father will be so happy!  Well, maybe not happy,  but anything is an improvement on surly and dismissive.  Let the father-son healing begin!  Wish me luck, Perry the Platypus!  Hello! Father!  You're never gonna guess what I brought you!  - Oh, hello, Heinz. - Hello, Father.  I see you brought me assorted broken bits of pottery for Father's Day.  Well, I suppose it's the thought that, um, counts.  Your brother Roger remembered how much I loved that old lawn gnome.  So he sent me this. Look! It also makes espresso.  Delicious.  But, you know, rubble is a nice gift too.  All right, uh, Happy Father's Day.  And, okay, bye-bye.  All this way just to give me broken shards of potter  D-A-E-H-M-2-3?  Well, that could've gone better.  Why do I even bother, huh?  At least there's one relationship in my life that's worked out pretty well.  Thanks for coming along, Perry the Platypus.  Let's go home. You are my rock.  And by that, I mean you're there for me, you're not made out of rock.  You're actually made out of, well, platypus probably.  Well, that was the best Father's Day flight yet.  It brought back some wonderful old memories,  and created a lot of new ones.  Thank you, boys, for making this possible.  Happy Father's Day!  Yes, yes it is.  Crikey! It's getting late! I best be on me way home.  Mind if I borrow your new aeroplane?  Why don't you hang onto her until next year?  I've got no room left in the garage anyway.  Will do! Cheery-bye!  Hi, honey! Hi, boys! So, how was your day?  Oh, the boys and I spent a wonderful day flying with Father!  - Ah, the Internet is a wonderful thing. - Why, yes, I suppose it is.  Well, here's something special from Candace and me.  Here you go!  Oh, my! An exact replica of Father's biplane.  Oh, it's perfect. Thank you so much, sweetheart.  Happy Father's Day, Dad.  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated   ""To the most evil dad in the whole world.  ""Happy Father's Day, love, Vanessa.""  Aw, a gift basket of switches and self-destruct buttons!  That's my girl!  Hm?  Bewegen Sie nicht!"

Go home to your family, huh?  [clapping.]  Wow, Isabella, you have some mad marionette skills.  - Thank you, Phineas. - I know I use this word a lot,  but you and the fireside girls were awesome-tacular!  I wish more people could experience your talents.  Well, we only have so many folding chairs.  Maybe it would help if your puppets were bigger.  - What do you mean Buford? - My uncle Oslo from Oslo  used to make huge marionette puppets!  People would come from miles around to see 'em.  Or at least they would have if he ever finished one.  Wait, Oslo's in Norway. I thought your family was Dutch.  Eh.  Nevertheless, Buford, I think you may be onto something.  We could build a huge, weird puppet and you guys could  take your marionette skills to the people in the streets.  Yeah, that'll freak 'em out.  So what do you say, Isabella?  - Are you ready to take the next step? - Oh, Phineas! Yes, I've been right here  in front of you all along just waiting for you to  Oh, wait, you were talking about the puppet, weren't you?  Well, yeah, what were you talking about?  Nothing! I, uh, was just [chuckling nervously.]  Hey, where's Perry?  Agent P, we have a situation.  Dennis, the rogue agent, formerly our most wanted rodent.  - Carl: Lagomorph, sir. - What's that, Carl?  Sir, they used to be considered rodents,  but were reclassified in the early 20th century.  Oh, well, I'll have to fix that then.  Carl, run out and buy me a new set of encyclopedias.  - A set of what, sir? - Hmm.  Anyway, Dennis, the most wanted lagomorph,  miraculously escaped from OWCA's maximum security prison  sometime this morning. Evidence suggests that  Dennis was snatched away by a ninja disco robot.  If this isn't the work of Doofenshmirtz then   - Carl will eat my hat. - Carl: Hey!  [beeping.]  I got your 22- and-a-half tons of reclaimed pine logs.  Hey, aren't you a little young to be driving a semi-trailer  with 22-and-a-half tons of reclaimed pine logs?  No. No, I'm not.  Babyface trucking   our drivers look like children but they're not   Now back up. Here come your logs.  Thanks, babyface trucking guy!  Now if you'll excuse me, I gotta head home.  It's nap time.  [horn blaring.]  - Is that everything, Phineas? - Yep!  Let's build us a huge marionette!  Chorus: # Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated! #  You can come out now, Dennis the rabbit!  Aw, look, how cute! He's cute! Isn't he cute, Norm?  He's adorable! And so soft, and warm, and squishy!  Okay, back off, lennie, you're creeping me out.  And you, you're not fooling anybody with that cutesy stuff.  I happen to know that you are a very bad bunny.  And I am, like, totally cool with that!  See, I want to defeat Perry the platypus and take over Tri-State-Area  and what I think I'm lacking is a certain animal instinct to get the job done.  You have animal instincts.  But what you lack is the evil scientist technology.  And that is something that I have. So, using my evil scientist skills,  I'll make it possible for you to defeat Perry the platypus  while I watch from a safe distance.  And together, we'll take over the Tri-State Area!  What do you say? Are you with me?  Great! I always wanted a rodent for a partner.  - Norm: Lagomorph, sir. - Gesundheit.  Wow, this thing's so cool, Phineas! Everyone ready?  All ready back here. How you doin', Ferb?  Come on, everyone, let's take this show to the crowd!  Giant marionette.   walk, walk, giant puppet girl so sweet   shift, and slowly blink   freak out the people on the street  they don't know what to think   move your articulated parting jaw   bow your head politely   drift through the crowd like a european ghost   now raise your hand just like me   ooh, ooh, ooh   It looks like she's trying to tell us  something important in her own silent, enigmatic way.  I feel this puppet is telling us to look into our souls  and find the power to embrace love for all humanity.  Hey, everyone! The Viking is right!  moving slowly,   shifting slightly   just by moving slowly and shifting slightly   the puppet fireside girl is telling us   to look into our souls and find the power   to embrace love for all humanity   Now, before I let you loose on the OWCA,  this should make you much more formidable.  I like to call it my, my, my, my, my  [yells.]  I guess the escalator wasn't such a good idea after all.  Oh, well, live and learn.  Anyway, I like to call it my Transmogrification-backpack-inator!  It'll give you a robotic exoskeleton that can transform into almost anything.  And it's perfect to wear undercover. No one will ever suspect.  Except maybe to say ""hey, look, there's a rabbit wearing a backpack.""  Go ahead, give it a try.  Hey! What the heck, man?  I live here. You can't go blowing holes in my stuff.  Now, try it again.  Uh, okay. Also, no smashing things in here.  I'm gonna have to make a list for you, aren't I?  Hey! Wait! Let me open the [smashing.]  roof.  Candace: It's true. Ferb told me.   They scrape it from the lining of a calf's stomach to make cheese.  And yet when I wanna talk about sushi, you say it's disgusting.  Oh, my gosh! Cutie Patootie!  My long lost pet rabbit! Where have you been?  Oh, honey bunny! Was Perry bothering you?  Poor little fluffy britches Patootie pants.  - Let me get you home. - Stay down, breakfast. Stay down.  Hey, guys, the crowd is loving it!  Isabella, I'm all puppeted out.  What say we take a little break and get some eats?  Let's take five.  Cutie Patootie, I got your chowzie-wowzie!  [gasps.] Oh! Stacy, he's gone!  - Where do you think he went? - Maybe he's down at the docks.  Yeah, maybe he Down at the docks?  Or maybe he's just playing with his friends.  [voices whispering.] Giant marionette.  [growls.]  Time to see how my little friend is doing.  You see, I installed a bunch of nano-bot cameras on his backpack.  - Who installed them? - It was my idea.  Oh! There he is! And he's fighting a giant puppet girl.  There's something very familiar about the way she fights.  Wait a minute. Perry the platypus?  That does it. I'm going down there.  The big difference is that the marionette has strings  while a puppet is hollow, so it can be manipulated from within.  But that doesn't mean that a marionette can't be hollow or  a puppet has strength. The thing to remember is that some  people take the subject very seriously, even though,  technically, there's no difference grammatically.  I looked it up.  Doofenshmirtz: There he is, Norm!  Down there! On top of the puppet.  Lower. Perfect.  Aah! Gotcha!  [chuckles.] Give up, Perry the platypus!  You know nothing of puppetry! Ow!  Okay, I, I admit it, you, you do have a certain knack for it  Oh, okay, well, maybe ""knack"" wasn't the right word.  Oh, no. No, no.  [grunting.] Ow!  Curse you, Perry the  [coughing.] platypus! I was trying to say platypus.  Okay, well, I guess I'll see you both later!  Unless I miss my guess, I'm on my way to Norway, so, uh,  take it easy, Dennis the rogue rabbit,  and, uh, curse you, Perry the platypus!  Candace: Mr. Patootie!  - Where are you? - There he is!  [gasps.] Mr. Patootie!  What do you know, he was down at the docks!  Aw, cutie Patootie, I'm so glad you're safe and sound.  - There you are, Perry. - Cool, Candace, you found your rabbit.  Oh, look, there he is. My pet bunny, Mr. Bigelow.  I've been looking everywhere for you!  Get over here, you naughty lagomorph!  But he's Do I have to?  - Well, he is a lagomorph. - Oh, okay. Here.  You've been a bad little bunny.  Now let's get you back to your special room.  I don't know, there was something weird about those two.  What do you mean, Candace?  Rabbit owners come in all shapes and sizes.  A flight helmet and cowboy boots?  I think the tall one was wearing a wig.  And the other one had a false mustache. [helicopter whirring.]  Plus, they're leaving by helicopter.  You do realize that none of those observations  disprove my statement, right?  All: Yeah.  Announcer: Welcome to the 48th annual   Montevillebad Grand Prix pre race show.    Coming to you, of course, from the coast of glamorous Montevillebad.  A name that translates roughly as  ""mountain village bath"" in a variety of european languages!  Seven hours of racing jargon and mindless statistics, here we come!  Ooh!

Born in the Scottish enclave  of a Swiss town in the Italian alps to Dutch parents.  Not only a king among drivers,  Paolo Vanderbeek is also a beloved man of the people.  No one is more passionate about his sport or cares more about his fans  than Paolo Vanderbeek, earning him the name the ""king of care.""  Gonna go get my bust on   gonna get, gonna get, gonna get  baw-ba-baw-baw-baw my bust on!   How can you go outside when it's grand prix day?  Uh, yeah, well, my pleather jumpsuit is at the cleaners  - and I feel underdressed. - Oh, that's understandable, then.  - Uh, she was being facetious, dear. - Oh, I see.  Well, doesn't look like there's anything bustable going on yet.  - I guess I could kill a few. - Give it a chance, Candace.  You might find it exciting.  Let's look at an incomprehensible map of the race course, shall we?  Nigel: I can't make heads or tails out of it. You?  Ian: Uh, no clue, but no doubt it'll be exciting!  Oh, yeah, the excitement is killing me.  Seems like a good time to wonder where Perry is.  Greetings from Montevillebad, Agent P.  You'll be joining us here for your mission, but the lines aren't secure.  So, we'll give you the details when you get here.  And to get you here in style,  we've provided you with a vintage 1963 Olson Martin!  So I'll see you after the wipe.  Hello, again, Agent P! International intel's indicated that Doofenshmirtz  is planning to sabotage Paolo Vanderbeek and enter the grand prix himself.  So, we need you to find out what Doof is up to while Carl and I  keep an eye on Vanderbeek here at the race track, incognito.  Nifty disguise, huh? Gives me a continental look, don't you think?  Anyway, Doofenshmirtz is at the casino at L'hotel Uber-Swank.  Chorus: # Doofenshmirtz at a casino! #  Male croupier: Monsieur in the lab coat and bow tie wins again.  Man, I am on a roll!  Stupid game. I'll never play it again.  Ah, never say never! Who's next?  Oh, a mysterious platypus to take my challenge!  Okay, I'll go first!  Male croupier: Jeux de morpion! Monsieur Platypus in a tuxedo wins.  What? Monsieur, there are no pets allowed in the casino.  What? He's not my mysterious platypus.  I didn't bring him in here. I'm just  Oh, oh, oh, you mean the cat? Yeah, my bad.  Look at all those cars in a line.  Nigel: The collective amount of horsepower is absolutely staggering.  And so [coughing.] are the exhaust fumes.  You realize this is just a bunch of cars parked in a line?  Both: Yes! Yes, we do.  [music.]  [chitters.]  [gasps.] The mysterious platypus from the casino!  Perry the mysterious platypus from the casino?  Bet you're tired of standing around, aren't you?  See tires! I thought it apropos.  You know, this being the grand prix and all.  Wait till you see my new lair.  Not too shabby.  - Hey, Norm, I'm back! - Look what I found!  Metal teeth!  [scoffs.] You've always had metal teeth, Norm.  Yes, but these are sharp.  What does that matter? You can't open your mouth.  Here, grab Perry the platypus. Isn't this place fabulous?  I found it through an international lair exchange website.  It's even got its own rocket.  You know, I think I might've gotten the better end of this deal.  [groans.]  Anyway, you gonna love it,  I was so impressed, I commissioned a whole new jingle!  Doofenshmirtz' swanky new evil lair!   Yeah, it's swanky!  it's an even swap   a variation on a timeshare   he can use the kitchen and the hallway closet   don't touch the rocket   or you'll lose your deposit   it's an old school evil hideout vacation swap   it's an elegant lair with spectacular views   but the carpets are white so please take off your shoes   the wiring is new   so you won't blow an electrical fuse   it's a swanky new evil hideout vacation   an old school evil hideout vacation   yes, it's Doofenshmirtz's evil hideout vacation swap   Yeah, look at these swanky moves!  vacation swap   Thanks, Cheryl. My real estate agent.  So, my evil plan.  As you may know, the Montevillebad Grand Prix  is a goodwill event, with all the prize money awarded  to the winner's favorite charity.  So I entered the race for my favorite charity,  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated, namely me.  I'm the Doofenshmirtz in Doofenshmirtz Evil  [stutters.] you get it. And check it out!  I re-engineered my Buhmshlaka 320i to meet the grand prix specs.  I also added some extras that should take care of, like,  99% of the playing field.  There's still that 1%, Paolo Vanderbeek.  But, uh, I got something else to take care of him.  Behold! My I-don't-care-inator!  It's not that I don't care, it creates apathy in whoever it hits.  It's a little esoteric, I know, but trust me, it'll work.  I'll just zap Paolo with this baby, and suddenly he won't care  about anything, and, uh, least of all racing.  I'll turn the ""king of care"" into the ""king of I couldn't care less.""  Which will pave the way for me to win the race  and the prize money for my favorite charity,  which I think I said before is me.  Now, before I go, lest you try to escape,  I'll show you one more feature of this place.  Look, it's got its own shark tank!  [chuckling.]  Okay, then, I'm off to the races.  Literally. Hasta la pasta, baby.  Adrian: Welcome back, racing fans, to the Montevillebad Grand Prix!  And the teams are making the final preparations before the start of the race.  Including our favorite, Paolo Vanderbeek.  Nigel: Just look at the amazing amount of care and attention  he pays to his fans and his car.  Listen to those fans, Paolo! They love you.  [grunting.] Eh, who cares?  Adrian: What's this? Paolo is walking away from the pit.  Nigel: And the race!  [chuckling.] What a shot! Norm, set me down next  to the registration booth and you go get the car ready.  Roger, wilco, sir.  [all screaming.]  Adrian: Wait a second, there seems to be a last minute entry.  A Heinz Doofen Doofen  [mumbles.] I'm hopeless with Drusselsteinian names.  Hand that over, mate. Let's see. Dorkenshmitz?  Doofen Doofenshmun Doofenshmuntz?  No, that's utterly ridiculous.  Adrian: Whatever his name is, he's no Vanderbeek, that's for sure.  Nigel: There's the flag. And they're off!  Monogram: Psst! Agent P, over here.  Doof has shot Vanderbeek with some kinda  Oh, right, he probably monologued his scheme to you already.  Anyhow, we need you to take Vanderbeek's place in the race.  Get that inator and get back here to reverse its effects so  Vanderbeek can finish the race and defeat Doofenshmirtz.  Carl has been trying to convince Vanderbeek to get back in the race  using his sophisticated powers of persuasion.  Come on, pretty please? Pretty please with a cherry on top?  - I'll be your best friend. - Yeah, you better get going, Agent P.  You can use the disguise setting on your Olson Martin.  Wow! The resemblance is uncanny.  Good luck, Agent P.  Nigel: What's this? Hello!  It looks like Paolo Vanderbeek is back in the race!  Wow, this isn't nearly as lame as I thought.  That's why our couch cushions are worn so unevenly,  Because we're always on the edge of our seats.  Doofenshmirtz: Let's see if I can rub this guy the wrong way.  [chuckling.]  Nice bumpin' into ya.  Or maybe it's time to use a little elbow grease.  [tires squealing.]  All right, smoke 'em if you got 'em.  Nigel: Approaching the Phillips head turn, millimetrically perfect!  Adrian: Or .04 inches perfect for backward people  who don't use the metric system.  Nigel: Dumpendork is gonna have his work cut out for him  if he wants to stay in the lead.  Uh, Paolo Vanderbeek! He's back?  Eh, looks like I'm gonna have to throw the works at him.  There ya go.  Nigel: I say, that is an unprecedented amount of  - contact shunts and shenanigans. - Adrian: Shenanigans?  Ian: You don't think there's some sort of foul play afoot?  In grand prix racing? Don't be ridiculous!  That kind of thing only happens in cartoons.  Looks like somebody needs another shot of the I-don't-care-inator!  Doofenshmirtz: Oh! That's mine!  Adrian: And that last contact has put Doofen [stammers.] spinning across the course.  Nigel: And Vanderbeek is pulling into the pits. What is wrong?  Come on, what are you, chicken? [squawking.]  Good work, Agent P! Now we just need you to  Oh, okay, yeah, you got that covered too.  Bocce balls! I cannot disappoint my fans!  Ian: Doifenshmoitz has got himself going again  with the help of an extremely large metal pit crew member.  This is without a doubt the weirdest race I've ever seen.  Grazie tanto, little beaver duck guy!  [shouting in Italian.]  Ian: And Paolo is back on the course.  Adrian: He'll have to really put his foot in  if he wants to catch Doofenshmintz by the end of the race.  [chuckling.]  Not to make excuses, but sometimes it's okay to be a little bit tacky.  Oh, maybe the tacks are supposed to be in the back.  Adrian: Dirkens splurtz has run himself off the course completely!  [speaking French.]  Nigel: And Vanderbeek pushes past, just in time  to seize the checkered flag! Well done!  All: Whoo-hoo-hoo!  - What an exciting finish! - Go, Paolo! Go, Paolo!  That was awesome!  Huh, I guess they're not doing anything today.  I am going to the mall and picking up a pleather jumpsuit.  Okay, did I win?  Oh, wait, no!  Oh, curse you, Paolo Vanderbeek!  You know that just doesn't roll off the time   Perry the platypus, Perry the platypus.  And on that bombshell, we bid farewell from glamorous Montevillebad.  Doofenshmirtz' swanky new evil lair!   Yeah, it's swanky!  it's an even swap a variation on a timeshare   you can use the kitchen and the hallway closet   don't touch the rocket   or you'll lose your deposit   it's an old school evil hideout vacation swap"

I've never been to a cadet graduation before.  - I hope I'm not underdressed. - Oh, you're fine, Carl.  Not everything's about you, you know.  - Hello, Colonel Contraction! - Greetings, Major.   I just wanna wish you good luck on today's event.  I've got the cake, and I'll be on my way  just as soon as I am done skimming out my kid's pool.  Very good, sir. This year's event will be  held at the Knights of Danville hall, Ballroom B.  Ballroom B? Isn't that a shared space?  Just another money saving idea of mine, sir.  I don't know, Major. What about security?  Oh, don't worry, sir. No one will know it's us.  We're registered as the ""Capulet Bat Mitzvah.""  Hmm, well, you have my utmost confidence, Major.  But it goes without saying, any mishap could cost you your position.  Contraction out!  Well, I don't know about you guys, but I got a good feeling about this.  Nice going, Norm.  And the next time someone asks for volunteers to host the Love  Muffin Service Awards, say your own name, Mr. Blabbermouth!  But, sir, I made all the arrangements for you.  Yes, and a fine job you did, too.  We are sharing the space with another event!  - What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with it?  Do you realize what would happen if all the other evil  organizations found out we were sharing? They'd be all:  ""Oh, look. There goes Love Muffin. They share.  ""They're gawky and uncoordinated, and they wear no name brand jeans.""  Well, maybe some people can't afford designer jeans, Julie!  - Wow, that was - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard it.  Well, don't worry, sir. No one will know it's our event.  We're registered as the ""Hatfield Wedding Reception.""  Well, let's hope nobody knows it's us.  Now, get out of my way, you perfunctory party planner.  Sir, may I offer you one of my budget-saver  hors d'oeuvres before you go on?  It's an old family recipe.  Strips of baloney and wadded up white bread.  - Where exactly are you from?   Hmm. Never mind, Carl. It's show time!  Hello, everyone.  Welcome to OWCA graduation ceremony.  Hello, and welcome to Love Muffin's first annual  I said, Love Muffin's first annual Disservice  Awards!  Awards!  - So, who's ready to have some fun? - What the heck is all that racket?  I'm just gonna go over there and tell them to keep it down.  I'll be polite, but firm.  Huh. What are the odds?  - Wait, you're the Capulet Bar Mitzvah? - You're the Hatfield wedding?  All right, everyone, take it easy.  Just calm down. There is no reason to get upset.  We've got a massive security deposit on this place.  So, everybody, just  Polly wants a street fight!  Hup! Sorry to interrupt. I'll come back when you're done.  We are so gonna lose our deposit.  Here's your stuff from the attic, Candace.  I don't know why you couldn't find it.  I don't know, Mom. It must've been behind something.  Candace, you didn't go up there at all, did you?  Oh, Mom, I just couldn't get up there. It's all gross and webby.  Candace Flynn, don't tell me you're still afraid of spiders.  Spiders? Are you kidding?  Why would I be afraid of an itsy bitsy spider?  - Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew - Oh, for crying out loud. It's a hair clip.  That looks nothing like a spider.  I knew that!  I'm just showing you how silly it is to be afraid of a little spider.  Mmm-hmm. Well, you got your box.  - Now I have to go. - Where are you going?  Your dad and I are going spelunking.  Spelunking? You mean, like, in a cave?  It's a journey of self-discovery while crawling around in a hole.  Your dad found it on a group coupon website.  Yeah, that sounds fun.  Just remember, you're in charge, Miss Muffet.  All right, Major, here's the cake Oh!  - Ateahoo! - Colonel Contraction, sir!  Major Monogram, I hold you personally responsible  for turning one of our most sacred ceremonies  into a grade A, countrified debacle!  - Debacle? - Debacle!  Now, normally, I'd be able to forgive this kind of thing  because of your tireless dedication and spotless record to OWCA,  but it's clear to me that you've totally lost our security deposit,  and that's something I cannot forgive.  I am forced to relieve you of your command.  I'll take that. And that.  - Actually, that mustache was mine. - Not anymore.  Debacle!  Carl the intern, until a replacement can be found,  you are provisionally in charge.  Congratulations, Provisional Unpaid Major-in-charge Carl.  - Major, I I don't - Carl, be strong.  I must step down. We must all do our duty.  And that is what our, I mean, your organization is built upon.  People following orders.  Oh, cool, my old tiara. Ooh, sparkly.  Hey, I don't remember this. Hmm, ""For Future Candace.""  Hey, wait a minute. I'm Future Candace!  There's gotta be a machine around here that still plays these things.  - Phineas! - Oh! Hi, Candace.  - Nice outfit. - Nice glasses.  Thanks. We're using them to simulcast ourselves all around the world.  No time. I need to watch this.  A video cassette? Wow, going old school, huh?  Right? So how would I watch it?  Well, Dad has a universal video player in the garage.  Where in the garage?  Twelve degrees Northeast of the washing machine.  Thanks. Carry on with your non-bustable activity.  Everyone, give it up for our sister, Candace Flynn!  Are you folks ready for a little adventure?  Oh, yes, we're ready for our journey of self-discovery  while crawling through the belly of the Earth.  - Say what? - Well, like the ad said,  - ""Inner Spelunking with Soul."" - What? Oh, no, no, no, no.  It's, it's supposed to be ""Saul."" S-A-U-L.  That's my name, Saul.  There will be absolutely no self-discovery.  - Aw. - You go on and self-discover, hon.  Keep the camera steady, Stacy!  Aw, look, it's me! Aw, I was so cute!  This is Candace Flynn.  I'm five years old, and it was an awesome summer!  But I didn't get to do everything that I wanted.  So I made a list of things I want Future Candace to take care of.  Oh, that's so cute. Of course I'll take care of those things, Past Candace.  First on the list, ""Invent an ice cream flavor,  ""win a first grade spelling bee, ride a unicorn.""  So if you're watching, Future Candace, don't  Candace, don't forget number four, ""Conquer fear of spiders.""  Okay, that one creeps me out a little bit,  but that should be no problem for you, Future Candace.  But, but, but, but But I'm Future Candace!  Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated   Just a minute. I'm mopping.  Oh, hello, Perry the Platypus. Long time no see.  Say, that was some morning we had, huh?  Too bad about Major Monogram,  but you know what they say, the show must go on.  Or a bird in the bush I don't know.  Ha! You like that? It's a gift.  Foam me to you! Get it?  As much as I like our little visits, you didn't need to come over.  Actually, I'm not even trying to take over the  Tri-state Area today. You see, I have a problem.  I am very fair skinned. I don't know if you have noticed.  I always have to use SPF 120 sunscreen even on a cloudy day, or I'll burn.  I mean, I'll actually burst into flames.  And I got this whole crate on sale, and, and look, it's all 110 SPF.  I thought I was getting 120. This is not gonna work.  So, rather than return this whole mess, which means I'll  have to get in a car and drive down there, wait in line,  then answer a bunch of questions about the delicacy of my epidermis,  I'm just gonna move the Earth away from the sun  just enough that the 110 will work. Simple.  And to that end, I have created, ta-da,  my Shift-The-Earth's-Position-Further-Away- From-The-Sun-inator.  I know the name's a little cumbersome,  but it's basically a tractor beam that uses the mass of Jupiter  as an anchor to pull the Earth just slightly away from the sun  to render my sunscreen effective.  I guess my fortune cookie was right.  I do tend to overcomplicate things.  I wonder if that means these lottery numbers are  Hmm?  You fired my inator  - Whoa! What was that? - We are rocking this place!  - Candace, what is that? - I don't know, but I can guess.  Phineas, what is going on out there?  I don't know. It wasn't us. But we can find out.  Irving, take over the concert for us.  All I know how to sing is one camp song.  - Then you rock that camp song, Irving. - Um, okay.  Here's a campfire song my mother taught me.  Oh, never lick a tree below the dog line   If it's brown and sticky do not pick it up Unless it's a stick   Banjo playing hicks should be avoided   And it's no joke that poison oak is not a friendly shrub   With a diddly diddly-doo and a doodly doodly dee   Something horrible will happen if you don't listen to me   Well, according to the pocket barometer,  the atmospheric pressure has lowered dramatically since this morning.  You checked the atmospheric pressure this morning?  Yeah. I check it every morning. After I brush my teeth.  - You brush your teeth every morning? - Well, yeah.  Huh.  He thinks he's better than us.  Oh, no, duck! No, I mean, like, a whole lot of ducks.  Look! They look like they're migrating south.  Guys, I think something is weird with the weather.  We should monitor the conditions in the upper atmosphere.  - I have a weather balloon. - Why would you have a weather balloon?  Buford, you have full-sized molds of all of us.  - We should use Baljeet's weather balloon. - Whoa! I didn't remember this list.  Yep, Stace, I promised 5-year-old me that I'd do everything on that list.  Well, let's see what you gotta do.  ""Invent a new ice cream flavor, win the first grade spelling bee,  ""ride a unicorn, and conquer fear of spiders.""  - Ha! Good luck with that last one. - What are you talking about?  Candace, everyone knows you're terrified of spiders.  Spiders? Are you kidding? Why would I be afraid  of an itsy bitsy spider? Get it!  - Oh, I remember this hairclip. - Ew, ew, ew,ew  Most people don't think life can survive down this deep,  but most people don't know gastropods the way I do.  Take a gander at this salamander. Notice anything unusual?  Oh, yes, his gills are on the outside of his body.  They are? Ew! Oh! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!  - It didn't have any eyes either. - Thanks for not mentioning that.  You may enter.  Psst! Agent P, down here.  Is that goat still eating out of the inbox?  - It's a good thing I hid the outbox. - Carl!  Oh, Agent P, what's going on?  It's like a zoo in here. Where is my dad?  - Your father's been fired. - Fired? Really?  Yes! And all the animal agents are going crazy!  On the upside, I've been promoted.  Yeah, I see the mustache.  - Looks like you've got a message. - It's intel from Agent Squab,  French Surveillance Pigeon.  Hmm, there's a small shift in ambient temperature,  there's civil unreasonableness at City Hall,  and Love Muffin is convening for a secret meeting!  Oh, no! Why did this have to happen on my watch?  Wait a minute, you got all that from this?  Yeah. That's how Agent Squab types.  - All hunt-and-peck. - Well, Carl, you're in charge.  - What are you gonna do about it? - You mean besides freak out?  Get a hold of yourself. You know this agency as well as my dad.  Maybe better. These agents just need leadership.  Think. What would Major Monogram do?  You're right! Agent G, quit eating those memos  and get out into the field.  Agent D, go see what you can dig up. Agent O, find out who's who.  Agent Possum, play dead.  Excellent! Agent B,  go in the woods, and see what's out there.  And the rest of you, get out there and fight evil.  Agent P, I want you to go out to City Hall and get a  reading on the situation there and then report back to me.  What about me, Carl? I can go spy on Love Muffin if you  Whoa, no, no, Monty, I can't let you do that.  That's That's crazy. You're not even an animal.  We've got no choice, Carl.  We're all gonna have to wear different hats today.  - And mustaches. - Hey, Monty?  - What? - Thanks.  No problem. Oh, and can I have a different hat?  - This one smells like a litter box. - Yeah, you should smell this thing.  Morning, your mission today is battle the forces of  darkness and keep the Tri-State Area safe from evil-doers.  - Uh, come again? - Oh, sorry,  Uh, force of habit. Here's your order.  Enjoy your Slushy Dawg.  So, um, how am I doing, boss?  Yeah, this is the part of the job I hate the most, but  Yep. Say no more, sir. I completely understand.  You don't have to fire me.  - I resign. - But  - Say no more. - But But  I was just gonna ask him to clean the bathroom.  Um, Dolores, this is the part of the job I hate the most.  Oh, for crying out loud. Just give me the mop.  Okay, let's see. ""Invent a new ice cream flavor.""  - Grilled cheese. - Check.  ""Win the first grade spelling bee.""  ""Clover."" C-L-O-V-E-R.  - Those kids never knew what hit 'em! - Check. ""Ride a unicorn.""  - Of sorts. - Dreams can come true, Stacy.  There's just one more thing on the list. Get over your fear of spiders.  No, I refuse. Quickly, Rainbow, we must away!  Fly now, fly! On, proud beauty.  Fly, fly!  Danville is in chaos. Summer has become slightly cooler.  Some sources even go so far as to say brisk.  We have word that the Mayor is about to address  this slight drop in temperature. Let's listen.  Citizens of Danville, I want to assure you  that your slight discomfort is of utmost importance to me,  and I will do everything in my power to  recommend you wear a cardigan or light sweater.  But all my sweaters are ugly and Christmas themed!  Well, then, just wear warmer clothes.  Warmer clothes? Do you know how dumb I would look  wearing socks with flip-flops?  Hey, his sweater looks nice and warm. Get it!  People, people.  Look, look, look, take, take it easy. I'm still your Mayor!  Thank you, good Samaritan platypus!  Although I'm not sure this is much of an improvement.  I mean, I really don't know how to get down from here,  and it is getting noticeably colder up here.  Oh, it's a good thing I wore my sweater.  Well, according to the conditions in the upper atmosphere,  we are in for a moderate cold front that shows  - absolutely no signs of subsiding. - That's odd.  I can't remember a single Danville summer where I needed to wear  - anything more than a t-shirt. - Striped.  - And shorts.   But the part that perplexes me the most is that,  for some reason, the sun algorithm  that I created keeps coming up with the wrong result!  - 'Splain. - The diameter of the sun  can be calculated from the distance between the Earth and the sun.  Since we know the time taken by the Earth  to go once around the sun, P equals one year,  and the distance traveled by the Earth in this process, two pi A  - Buford! - Stop 'splaining! Stop 'splaining!  - So that would mean the Earth has moved? - Apparently so.  Well, that would explain why it's noticeably colder.  Your sinew's torn apart   By a grizzly   Freezing! # Your large intestines #  Wrapped around a tree  Does anyone have a sweater?  I think we're gonna have to run some more tests.  Now, why do we always have to meet in drafty  abandoned warehouses?  I mean, why can't we meet in a drafty abandoned pool-side cabana?  - I'm bananas for cabanas. - Right?  Okay, enough of that.  Gentlemen, it's time we pooled our resources.  Both OWCA and City Hall are in a panic,  and I believe now is the time to strike!  Now, the last time we confronted those OWCA agents,  we barely got out of there with our lives.  It's time to play dirty.  We will stealthily capture them one at a time, and imprison  them here! Yeah, we'll gang up on them. That''ll be fun!  We can make it a musical number.  Secondly, no one, under any circumstances,  is allowed to say, ""Bananas for cabanas.""  - Noted. - And third, which one of you  moved the Earth away from the sun and changed the weather?  - Uh. That would be me? - Doofenshmirtz?  You've finally made an inator that actually works?  Hey, all of my inators work.  It's just that, you know, I, I don't use them properly.  I have poor planning skills. But it was me.  - I've have the blueprints right here. - Ah!  You see, yeah, just ignore the coffee stains and whatever that is, uh  - I think that's nacho cheese. - Gentlemen, we will now  begin our takeover of the world!  - What was that? - Maybe the building's settling.  So, to you, a building settling  - sounds like someone inhaling sharply? - Well. O own a strange building.  - I've got to warn Carl. - Okay, tell me you didn't hear that.  - I said it's building settling. - So our building has  the sudden urge to warn Carl?  Come on, Candace. It's the last thing on the list.  I know, I know, I know, I know. Okay, here I go.  I can't!  I don't understand what the big deal is.  It's just the legs, and the hair, and all those eyes.  - And why do they have so many eyes? - There's nothing to be afraid of.  Spiders are harmless. Look, I'm sticking my hand in the cage.  Hello, there, little guy. Huh!  Poor Stacy. My fear of spiders got Stacy bitten.  But saved me! Yes!  Looks like it's just you and me now, Rainbow.  All right, Isabella, let me have it one more time.   Well, according to our data, this is the relative position of the sun,  and this is where the Earth should be on its orbit this summer.  But for some reason, we're here.  Tennis balls don't lie.  Every test scenario we run comes back with the same results.  - It just seems impossible. - Oh! But it is true.  The Earth has moved away from the sun, and now the summer is gone!  Big deal! So this summer's over.  - There's always next summer. - No, Buford.  If we don't do something soon, summer will be gone forever.  What? I'm expressing how I feel, through music.  Huh?  Evil team up   Dastardly scheme up   Taking them to town   Gonna catch 'em   Throw 'em and fetch 'em   Put them in the pound   You kicked us around   You mocked and offended   The pages have turned   Your chapter has ended   Now, 'cause OWCA's goin' down   That's right   Don't eyeball me   Just look askance   Your team was run aground   You say you didn't eat those plans   But here's the ultrasound   Your agency's over The whole thing is ending   Check out our homepage   And see how we're trending   OWCA's going down   Distract!  OWCA's going down   Grab!  OWCA's going down   Lasso!  OWCA's going down   Nab!  OWCA's going down   And that's what would happen if we grew magnets  - under the Earth's core. - The credits were nice touch.  Well, there's so many people behind the scenes that deserve a mention.  I guess that's another course of action that's off the table.  Not too many ideas left.  But we have to figure out a way to save summer,  - or it'll be gone forever. - Well, Baljeet, what have you got?  I have composed a simulation for turning the Earth's  core into a gyroscope. Maybe that would  - And roll credits! - I sure hope this cold  weather isn't affecting Mom and Dad's cave adventures.  Okay, now we're gonna squeeze past this stalactite,  I mean, stalagmite. Wait! Which one is on top?  - Actually, I believe that's just a hole. - I seem to be trapped!  Turn away, folks. I'm gonna have to saw my arm off!  That was a close one. Now, follow me!  Do you get the feeling this might be his first time down here, too?  Dang it.  There we go. With that, we've captured all of OWCA's agents.  Almost all of them. Remember Perry the Platypus!  He's still out there somewhere.  Thank you for reminding me, Dr. Bringdown.  - Excuse me, I'm Dr. Bringdown. - Put a sock in it, David.  Time to get to our press conference. Soon, the world  will bow to us, like Doofy's neck bows to his back.  - His posture is poor. - Nice!  Come on, Slouchy. Let's make us some demands.  Hey there, little fella.  You're not such a tough guy, are you, Mr. Spider?  Oh, no, you're not. No, not a bit.  Ah, who ya kidding, Flynn?  To face your fear, you've gotta at least look.  Creepy crawly, creepy crawly, creepy crawly!  Get off me, get off me, get off me, get off me!  Ew!  Oh, I'm sorry, 5-year-old me, I tried. I really tried.  Snap out of it, current me! Summer's not over yet.  Hey, wait a minute. Summer's over?  Who did th Oh Phineas and Ferb.  Phineas and Ferb! What did you do to summer?  Your fall is ruining summer!  You made me buy a blanket with sleeves!  My toilet seat is cold!  Ladies and gentlemen of the press, kindly put a cork in it.  So, you've probably figured out  that the Earth has moved away from the sun.  And we at Love Muffin are responsible.  And now, we're here to extort you.  And to that end, let me introduce you to Senor Killbot.    You know, in case any of you extortees speak Espanol.  We just don't want to leave anyone out.    - Aw - Oh! It's cute.  And that's our new logo. Foreboding, yet comforting.  So, basically, if you want us to put the Earth  back in its proper orbit, you have to meet our list of demands!  ""Number one, the minimum height  ""to get on any rollercoaster will now be this high.""  I mean, that high. ""Number two, pretzels!""  Really? That's how you give demands?  What? What was wrong with that? I was gonna go for one of  - those big tubs from Lotsmo. - You sounded like a bashful Santa Claus  pitching softballs to a girl in a bikini.  ""All right, number four""  Wait, you don't know what that sounds like.  Stand aside.  Listen, you dogs, with one small inator  My inator.  we've moved the Earth into an early autumn.  Now, we, the collective scientific genius of Love Muffin,  have created an inizor 10 times the size and strength.  Capable of moving the Earth so far away from the sun,  we will bring about a new ice age!  So, if you value your puny lives,  you will meet all the demands on our list,  or pay the consequences!  Is it just me, or is this getting out of hand?    Seriously? Someone moved the Earth, and it wasn't you?  - Not this time, no. - Any chance it could  spontaneously go back to the way it was?  We can't take that chance, Candace.  We'll never have another summer if our plan doesn't work.  - Plan? What plan? - We're building this massive  rocket engine to put on top of Mount Danville.  One measly rocket on one mountain isn't gonna move the Earth, Phineas.  That's why we've enlisted the help of other kids around the world.  See? There's Floria and Abdul on Mount Kilimanjaro,  Ganash and Kabul on Mount Everest,  Vsevolod and Vanko at the top of Mount Elbrus,  and Lupert and Eorpwald on Mount Haggenhuge.  Eorpwald is the goat.  While they finish fine-tuning,  we'll move our rocket up to Mount Danville.  Then everyone turns them on, and the Earth goes back to the way it was?  Sort of, but the burners all need to be synchronized through this control panel.  Otherwise, we risk ripping the Earth's crust apart.  Do you think you could stay here and help control the thrust?  These look quite simple level controls.  Yeah, pretty much the same as a sound mixer.  Except this one controls five mega rockets  - capable of ripping the Earth in half. - Why can't Irving do it?  Oh, he would. But he's trending right now.  Scorpions, parasites, black widows, rabies   Sunburn, frostbite head trauma, scabies   Don't even get me started about mosquitoes   Malaria   Good morning, Agent P.  Good morning, Agent P. Well? What do you think?  Carl, the evil scientists of Love Muffin have captured all of our agents.  Ugh! My first day on the job and all my agents get captured.  - What am I gonna do? - Simple. Let's go get 'em.  But we're seriously outnumbered.  Maybe, but we have the advantage.  We have the best agent with us and we have the element of surprise.  - We can't lose. - You're right.  Perry, Monty, let's go rescue our agents.  Let's go rescue our agents.  Let's go Oh, I'm coming.  Oh, there's Kilimanjaro.  Phineas, Floria and Abdul's rocket is ready. That's all of them.  Okay, Candace, we're on our way to Mount Danville.  Lock down the capsule and stand by.  Oh, I sure hope there aren't any spiders in here.  Okay, Ferb, let's put it down right there.  Come on, everyone. Let's get this thing online.  I'm linking up with the other rockets. Is everyone ready out there?  - Mount Elbrus? - Check.  - Mount Kilimanjaro? - Check.  - Mount Everest? - Check.  Mount Haggenhuge? Mount Haggenhuge?  Uh-oh. Mount Haggenhuge,  your rocket has gone offline. Can you fix it?  - All systems are green. - Check. Firing up Mount Danville.  Okay, Candace, you're good to go.  Roger. Target destination activated. Engaging thrusters.  Phineas, it's working! The Earth is moving back into position.  Fantastic, Candace. Just a couple more minutes and we'll have our summer back.  Well, that was fun. We should go get ice cream more often.  Did you have to order for all of us, Rodney?  I'm not crazy about this new grilled cheese flavor.  You get what you get,  - and you don't get upset. - Wow, he's strict.  I think we've given the world leaders enough time.  Let's see if they've submitted to our list of demands.  Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?  Uh You'll be happy to know that we've,  uh, met all of your demands except for the, uh, pretzel thing.  What? How dare you? Do you know what this means?  Look, we're sorry. Uh, we had them, but the Vice President  left the tub on the roof of the car. And we, uh  No pretzels, no deal.  You have doomed the Earth to perpetual winter.  Uh, Phineas, the holographic thingie  shows that the Earth is moving in the wrong direction.  Well, that makes no sense. It should be working.  Maybe it needs more power. I'm increasing the burn.  No, Candace, don't! Never push it into the red.  That's a bad thing. Turn down the thrusters.  This must be a special episode. He's yelling at his sister again.  Uh, Phineas? What happened?  You must have overloaded the power relay on the control panel.  You're going to have to get a spare electromagnetic coupling fuse.  - Where would I find a thing like that? - Ferb has one in the box in the attic.  The attic? Where all the spiders are?  Yeah, the attic.  That's just the building settling again.  Now, the world knows that Love Muffin's  not an organization to be trifled with.  Yeah, meanwhile, you may have plunged  - the Earth into another ice age. - The world is ours for the taking.  But this is crazy talk! I'm an evil scientist, not a mad scientist.  There's a difference. Subtle, I grant you, but But still, you know,  I don't really like the new direction this organization is taking  and I think we need a little fresh air.  You also need a chiropractor, Slouchy.  Good one. Because he slouches.  And as an agent, you get to wear a nifty fedora.  I made that one out of an old newspaper.  Yes, sir, OWCA is perfect for a guy like you, but, sadly, not for me.  - Yeah, things are tough all over, bub. - What? Doofenshmirtz!  Wait, do I do I know you? Major Monogram!  Francis, what happened to you? Look at  You're a washed-up mess!  This whole weather thing is your fault, you know.  - My fault? - Okay, technically it's my fault.  But if you weren't sitting around in a cold alley,  whining to rats and feeling sorry for yourself,  this whole situation wouldn't have gotten so out of control!  Before, I was a regular evil scientist. And now, suddenly  I'm part of this big organization of super villains  bent on world domination. I'm not comfortable with that.  The point is you should have been there to stop me, and you weren't.  Huh, two cents.  - There's the warehouse. - Come on.  Oh  Guys, little help?  What do you say, Perry? Think we can take 'em?  All right, you goons.  You take two, and I'll take two.  Great. They have a cave troll. Run!  Perry, split up.  Thanks, Carl.  Ooh!  Wow, good work, Agent P.  Great.  Now we get all his health.  You play way too many video games, man.  Come on, Candace, you can do this.  What's a couple of little spiders compared to the fate of the world?  Oh, who am I kidding? I need support.  Stacy, I really need your help.  Sorry, Candace. No can do.  I have to stay put until the swelling goes down.  - Are you okay? - I'll be fine.  But until then, you're on your own.  Well, she's no help. I'm gonna have to do this myself.  It's just you and me, attic.  You and me, and about ten hundred gazillion spiders.  Oh, I can't do this!  Okay, I've had time to think it over, and we need to put the world back.  I, for one, do not want to live in a perpetual winter.  Scoot over, Rodney.  Your betrayal doesn't surprise me, Heinz.  - Step aside. - Hey, what are you doing?  Just to show you who's boss,  I am going to move the Earth even further from the sun!  There's Ferb's box, way over there.  Oh, who am I kidding? I can't go way over there.  Candace?  Phineas, how did you get up here?  I'm using the Ferbographic technology.  What's taking so long? Did you find the box?  Well, it's right over there, by all those spider webs.  Be a pal and grab it for me, will you?  What? No, I I can't pick it up. I'm a hologram.  - You have to do it. - But I can't.  Well, what's the matter, Candace?  It's my fear of spiders. I've been trying to overcome it all day.  Well, that is a valid fear. You should be cautious around some spid  Oh Phineas, you're not helping!  Come on, you've already done so many brave things.  Remember, when you helped   And what about that time you got that really big bird to quit pecking our house?  Or when you climbed up on the motor of our baguette boat  after I gave you a similar pep-talk?  Yeah! You know what? You're right.  If I could do that, then I should be able to walk across the attic, right?  This's been silly. Heck, I don't even remember what I was afraid of.  - Spiders. - Uh!  Candace, you forgot the box.  Here they are. They're heading to the roof.  We've gotta get up there and stop them from firing that inator.  Not so fast, Monty Monogram.  Take it easy. We don't want any trouble!  - What? - Now that we have all  of OWCA's agents, nothing can stop us.  - That's where you're wrong. - Major Monogram!  I'm back. And I brought some help.    Wait a minute!  This is the same brawl we had earlier.  - So? - No, I'm just saying.    He's right. Let's get out of here.  That's not what he said, but yes, we should get out of here.  - Candace, you're not giving up, are you? - No!  Today, I face my fear.  Back off, spiders! Candice is in the attic.  Now we're talking!  Ha! Take that, you little  Wow, I guess there are a lot of spiders up here.  It's alright, Candace. You're just gonna have to reach past that spider.  Are you kidding me?  Candace, the fate of the world is at stake!  Okay, 5-year-old me, here we go.  Gotta reach it.  A little bit further.  That's it.  - I got it! - Great work, Candace!  You go down and put the fuse in, I'll go back and tell the guys.  And well done.  In your face, arachnid!  Candace did it, Isabella. She got the fuse.  Uh, Phineas, one of the main locking bolts  - came loose on the rocket, and, uh - Huh. Yeah, we should  probably fix that before Candace puts the fuse back.  - Let me - Oh, this is just ridiculous.  You and I should just Oh, look, a horse in a bookcase.  A what?  Ha! Now to move the Earth into a new ice age.  Why isn't this thing going in?  What is it? ""Righty loosey, tighty-whitey?""  Phineas, this thing ain't budging.  Candace? Candace? Why isn't this com-link working?  The rocket is blocking the signal. We've got to get up there.  There, I've disabled the reverse switch and the self-destruct button.  So there's no  Nobody messes with my self-destruct button!  You make a pretty good fulcrum there, Rodney.  - Well, at least we're out of danger. - We've gotta get that  rocket into position, or the planet could be torn apart!  Come on, you stupid thing,  get in there.  It's in! The fuse is in. Okay, I'm gonna fire up the engines.  Whoa!  It's not moving, Phineas. It's like something's resisting our jets.  I was afraid of that.  Listen, push the rockets up above the red line.  But, Phineas, you said that would be bad!  Well, there is a slight chance of pulling the planet apart.  - That's a bad thing! - It's our only chance, Candace.  We should be okay if you just do it slow and steady.  Oh, just like the rabbit in the story.  Yes, exact Wait, no! Like the turtle! Like the turtle!  Slow and steady. Slow and steady.  Look, Doofenshmirtz is trying to destroy the inator.  Come on, he needs help!  - Hang on, sir! - Nice catch, Carl.  - I don't know what's going on anymore. - Phineas, what's happening?  Unless I missed my guess, the Earth is moving again.  You better shut down the rockets, Candace.  Gotta get to the controls. Almost th  It stopped. We're not moving anymore.  - Candace, you did it. - What? I did?  Huh, what do you know? I did.  Ah, summer. Welcome back.  Yeah, well, that's to be expected.  Come on, Rodenstein, you're coming with me.  - See you later, Slouchy. - Yeah, well, you  I can never come up with anything quick enough.  Doofenshmirtz, you just saved the world. Thank you.  You're welcome, Francis. Put her there.  Psych! I'm still evil.  Yes. Yes, you are.  - Well, Monogram, nice work. - Thank you, sir.  Unfortunately, we're still not getting our deposit back  on that rental hall, and that's really broken the budget.  I'm afraid we had to close OWCA.  - Sir, why don't you start a new agency? - Good idea. What do we call it?  Well, looks like the name OWCA just became available.  - Oh, it's over that old building! - Great!  We'll call our new organization that and move there.  - Good idea, sir! - And to keep costs down,  we're gonna have to cut some management positions.  Colonel Contraction, your services will no longer be required.  Yeah, well, that's to be expected.  - I think this belongs to you, sir. - You keep that one, Carl.  Welcome back, sir.  Everything's all right. We're all outside.  Oh, sweet sunshine.  - Yes, well - Terra firma! Lovely top soil.  Um, we'll, we'll just be going then, shall we?  Bye, Saul.  Ugh, kissed a bug.  There she is. The hero of the day.  Nice going, Candace. Hey, where did the command center go?  Probably the same place the last one went.  You really did a good job, Candace.  Yeah, not only did we save the world,  but I did everything I promised 5-year-old me I'd do.  Let's all pretend like we understood that.  Well, now that we have summer back, what should we do?  Oh! Oh! I got an idea.  Come on everyone   We're having a party   Dancing in the sun   We're having a party   And you know we're not done   We're having a party   Every corner of the world, yeah   'Cause it's summer  Summer all over the   Buford!  I think there must be something wrong with this program.  Everybody Doodly doodly dee   Dengue fever!  Diddly diddly doo   Whooping cough!  If you go into the woods   Then this will happen to you   Nature is gross. Thank you!  Thank you very much. My mom taught me that song!  Buford!"
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   Come on gang. Let's get started on building our mega-mondo  Ah! No can do, dinner bell. It's family day,  and the Van Stomms from the low countries are visiting.  - Buford is outtie, G. - Well, that's a bummer,  but we can come up with some workarounds.  - So if you two - No can do, Phineas.  I am taking an East Indian cooking class.  We are going to make goat vindaloo.  If we can ever find a goat. [GOAT BLEATING.]  Oh, there is one now!  Got to run!  Well, good luck!  Well, the plans will still work with just three of us.  I'm afraid your plans will have to wait  until after Ferb's dental appointment.  - Come on, honey. Time to go. - All right.  Wow, I've never seen Ferb so nervous.  Hmm Well, I guess it's just the two of us, huh?  [SQUEALING.] Isabella, are you all right?  Oh. Oh, yeah. We could spend the day together.  - That would be fun. Whatever. - Let's see, with only two of us,  we'd have to reallocate some weight in order to  Hmm. Well, maybe if we just reduce the amount of  [SIGHS.]  Nope, that won't fly either.  You know, this is a lot harder without Ferb around.  But he never says anything.  It's not what he doesn't say, it's how he doesn't say it.  Well, I could get the Fireside Girl Manual for inspiration.  That sounds great! Thanks!  Wow, even Perry's gone. But that's pretty normal.  CHORUS: # Dooby, dooby doo, bah Dooby, dooby, doo, bah #  Perry!   I see you've taken our new breakfast-themed lair entrance.  It's the most important lair entrance of the day.  Anyhoo, OWCA has surveillance footage  of Doofenshmirtz raiding thrift store dollar bins.  We're not sure if it's evil, but it's well, it's just kind of pathetic.  Get to the bottom of this and stop Doof's potential  poverty-driven criminal freak-out!  And, uh, how about you pick up a cup of coffee for him on your way over?  It's on me. Use some petty cash.  I feel bad for the poor guy.  [RINGING.] [GASPING.]  The Fireside Phone!  Gretchen at the ready, ma'am.  Commence debriefing.  Gretchen, we have a Code Pink!  Romeo is alone!  Repeat, Romeo is alone!  Roger that. Don't panic, we're on our way.  Reporting for duty, ma'am.  The troop is establishing the mobile tactical headquarters as we speak.  Nice hustle.  I know, right?

Gotta go! [CELL PHONE BEEPS.]  Okay, what are you doing and what does it have to do with my brothers?  Um, it's something of a delicate matter.  - Romeo is all go! - Delicate?  Well, you might not know,  but I have a little bit of a crush on Phineas.  GINGER: ""Little"" being subjective.  - Stand down, Fireside Girl. - Totally get the crush thing.  You know, I don't quite get the Phineas thing.  I mean, you do realize his head is a triangle?  - [SIGHS.] Yeah. It's so acute. - Whatever. I have got your back, sister.  I will stay out of the yard and keep Mom out of the way, too.  Like that should be difficult.  [DOORBELL PLAYING DOOFENSHMIRTZ EVIL INC THEME.]  Oh, it's you, Perry the Platypus.  What, for me? Oh! That's a nice gesture, thanks.  And you even used the doorbell,  instead of just crashing through like you usually do.  I really appreciate this, Perry the Platypus,  'cause, you know, money's a little tight lately.  I can't even rub two nickels together.  Although, if I had two nickels,  I don't think I would sit and rub them together.  It's  Oh, oh, yeah, you're  you're trapped, Perry the Platypus.  It's quick-hardening, non-dairy creamer.  Like I said, I'm on a budget.  I know what you're thinking, Perry the Platypus.  How could this happen to such a with-it guy like Heinz Doofenshmirtz?  Well, my ex-wife Charlene is out of the country  on one of those extreme eco-cultural exploration vacations.  I don't know what they do on those trips,  but I imagine it's very expensive.  Oh, she's got some nerve!  That's my alimony she's throwing away.  And the worst is, she keeps texting me these pics.  [CELL PHONE VIBRATING.] Oh, come on, really?  Anyway, the problem is, I've  already spent this month's alimony on my new inator.  And now I don't have enough money left to send Vanessa  to the Grievance Movie Marathon she wants to see.  They're playing all the Grievance movies in order.  They got The Grievance, they've got Grievance 2: The Gripe,  Grievance 3: Bone to Pick,  and Grievance 4: The Revenge of the Italian Jug Band.  Yeah, I don't think that last one is canon.  Oh, what kind of father am I?  Oh! Oh, the shame is overwhelming.  I can't even enjoy using my new Teleport-inator.  [OMINOUS DRUMS PLAYING.]  Nah, nah. I'm just not in the mood. Maybe tomorrow.  [DRUMMING STOPS.]  And it was such a stellar plan, too.  I was gonna use it to send City Hall,  and consequently my brother, Roger,  back to Drusselstein and out of his mayoral jurisdiction.  No fuss, no muss. Just ""bzzt"" and he's gone instantly.  [SIGHS.] If only it were that easy  to get Vanessa to the movie theater.  Wait Wait a second!  I could just add another setting to my Teleport-inator  and send Vanessa directly to the theater and completely  bypass those ridiculously inflated movie ticket prices.  Oh, man, am I good! That deserves a victory sip!  [SLURPING.] Ugh! Wait, what is this? Decaf?  It's like you don't even know me!  All right, Fireside Girls, initiating Operation Perfect Picnic.  Roger that!  Well, looks like the operation is in Phase Two,  and I am gonna make myself scarce.  Cadet Flynn is out. Peace!  Here we go. Well, let's just take a look  - You know, I'm kind of hungry. - Well, then why not just have a picnic?  Wow! What a great idea!  And I just happen to have a picnic basket right here!  Ooh, she's good.  Wow!  Way to be prepared, Isabella!  Just doing my Fireside Girl thang.  I packed it with some Mexican-Jewish delicacies, like  Gefilte-flan! It wobbles!  BOTH: Ew! [LAUGHING.]  That looks ridiculous.  [ALARM BEEPING.] Oh, no, we've got a Code Irving!  Strike team, deploy!  Let's see what else I've got. [GASPING.]  [THUDDING.]  Did you hear something?  Nope.  Mission accomplished.  Hello, ladies! [GROWLS.]  The fox hops over the log, the rabbit crawls under the log  Okay, got it!  Now, to send  [THUDDING.] [CLEARS THROAT.]  And now, to send my daughter to the movies!  [TRIUMPHANT DRUMS PLAYING.]  No, see, it just doesn't work in this instance.  You know what, you guys just take the rest of the day off.  - You wanna go see a movie? - Yeah, sure.  How about Grievance 4?  Hey, Vanessa, pumpkin pants, can you come in here for a second?  Good news, sweetie. I can send you to the movies after all!  Really, Dad, it's no big deal.  Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo!   Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo!   I did it! And now that my Super Dad status is intact,  it's time to take care of business!  And by ""business,"" I mean evil!  It's time to set my sights on city [GROANS.]  - Hmm - Oh, now I get it.  Huh. I didn't count on an oscillate function.  Somehow, I don't think this bodes well for my plan.  That one's one of my own creations. I call it the enchillatke.  It was delicious.  Now, here we are. Gladys, we have a runner.  [YAWNING.]  [GASPS.]  Hey, Ferb! You're back!  Brilliant!  See what I mean, Isabella?  Yeah, it's how he doesn't say it.  Let's get to work. This will be the biggest picnic ever!  I'll get the tools.  All right, girls, Union Jack is back.  Operation Perfect Picnic is now Operation Ginormous,  Nonromantic, Overblown Picnic.  Al flabahem abla flapabla.  It's all right, big guy. You guys just do what you do.  Looks like we're gonna need a change of venue.  How about the park?  What do you know, no more Perry the Platypus.  Transported to some random location somewhere.  Ow!  Ahhh! Ow!  [CHUCKLING.]  Thanks for introducing me  to the ironic enjoyment of Ducky Momo, Candace.  Ironic, yeah! [CHUCKLING.]  So, your dad was really raised by wild ocelots?  OMG, I wish that was the weirdest thing about my family.  Candace? Oh. You know, amusement parks really  aren't my thing, but knock yourself out, girl!  Ducky Mo, Ducky Momo   He's your very best friend   Okay.

Ow!  [SHRIEKS.] What happened?  Something just happened! I smell bitterballen!  Where are we? Hey, not bad!  I could totally go for a mid-afternoon nosh. What are you doing?  Curse you, Perry the  - Over here! You gotta see this! - Oh, Candace, you're right.  - I am? - That is just adorable.  - What? - Wow, I don't know where it all went.  It's a good thing we brought our own basket, huh?  [ISABELLA SQUEALING.]  [SLAPPING HERSELF.]  Yes. Yes, it is.  Come on, Candace. Let's go home.  But-but-but, a whole park!  - Yep, and just the two of them. - CANDACE: I get it. But, ew."
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   Okay, Stace. Let's try again.  No!  It's really more in the cheeks. Like this  - Nyang, nyang, nyang! - Oh, I give up!  It's a good thing you won that contest to perform back up with Love HÃ¤ndel.  Yes, in the ballad of Klimpaloon, I will be playing Klimpaloon.  - Check out my klimpy style. - Girl, I have already cashed  that cheque. And I don't even know what that means!  Girl talk!  Honey, the limo's here to take us to the award show.  - Be right there! I gotta go. - You go, girl!  Let's never speak of this again.  - Come on, boys, time to go! - You guys look great!  Well, Lindana and Max Modem have to look their best  - when presenting our category, don't we? - What's you got there?  This is the first journal of the famous explorer, Sir Alvin Shackleberg.  He was the first person to sight Klimpaloon,  the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas.  We got this to help Candace research her ""Nyang, nyang, nyangs""  - for the Ballad of Klimpaloon. - How marvelous. It reminds me  Sorry, dad, there's no time for that now.  We gotta go while I'm still in the zone.  - Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang. - She's good.  It's like Klimpaloon was right here in the room with us.  Whoa! Sweet limo!  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do tomorrow.  How do we do it? Hey, where's Perry?  Ah, Agent P. I see you got the memo.  It's transcendental meditation week. Namaste.  Doofenshmirtz has been spotted  Carl, enough with the drumming!  Sorry, sir, I just, sort of, got into a groove.  Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has been spotted as a seat filler  at the 4th Annual 24-hour Tri-State Area Music Awards.  As you know, Doof's brother, Roger, is emceeing the event.  We're not sure what Doof's up to, but we need you to suss it out.  That's the that's the cloud. Good luck, Agent P.  Live from Random stadium: Random Swimwear presents   4th Annual 24-hour Tri-State Area Music Awards. The Tristies!  Sponsored by Random Swimwear. Be wet, arbitrarily.  Tonight's musical guests include Love HÃ¤ndel,  Slamm Hammer, Tiny Cowboy, 2 Guys in the Parque,  Danny and the Jay-tones, the Paisley Sideburn Brothers,  Marty the Rabbit Boy and his musical blender,  and many, many more.  Seriously, many more, 'cause it's it's 24 hours.  Please welcome your host and lovable Mayor, Roger Doofenshmirtz!  We've got a lot of great music for you tonight,  and a lot of other music.  So let's get things started, shall we?  Please welcome to the stage our presenters for the fact-based song category,  the girl who just wants to have fun  and the guy who, I guess, wants fun to have him.  Lindana and Max Modem!  Yeah!  Go Mom! Go Dad! Yeah!  Just go, just go. I'll fix it later.  - Our first nominee for -  the fact-based song category is,  Slamm Hammer with their hit Trees are made of wood.  Wooow! Trees are made of wood!   - Oh! - The second nominee in fact base song category  - Excuse me. Pardon me. - The Hockey Hooligans with Hockey Z-9.  Excuse me. Excuse me, pardon me.  # oh, yeah #  Excusez-moi. Con permiso, por favor.  # Don't turn away I'm talking to you, sir #  Aha! Perry the platypus! Your timing is incredible!  And by that I mean completely credible!  But you've found yourself in a hairy situation.  Because of the trap, which is a wig.  Stop me if you've already made the connection.  Anyway, you're just in time for my latest inator!  Behold!  I know what you're thinking, and no,  I did not invent a spray bottle, Perry the platypus,  But just stay with me through my backstory, all right?  You see, I was reading the Danville city charter, again,  when I learned an interesting fact.  Back in 18-aught-5, Danville actually elected a warthog as mayor.  The public was fed up with the previous administration and thought,  ""hey, what's the worst that could happen?""  Nepotism, that's what. He filled the cabinet  with his uncles and brothers and distant cousins.  And all of city hall was full of swine! Except for one chair  that they kept empty so, you know, it wouldn't be so conspicuous.  So, it was decided never to allow another  warthog to be in a position of authority.  Perry the platypus, are you texting?  While I'm monologuing?  You know, I'm just gonna hold on to this until I'm done  'cause I can get your full attention.  Anyway, I'm thinking, ""nepotism, city hall, my brother Roger,""  And suddenly I knew what to do.  Turn my brother into a warthog!  So, through the use of pseudo-technology I created this elixir,  that, when sprayed on an individual,  actually transforms them into a warthog!  What? I said ""pseudo.""  Anyway, once I collected enough elixir, I put it in this,  my warthog-sprayer-inator! See?  There's a method to my lameness! I'm gonna find out when Roger's on stage  and then I'm gonna turn him into a warthog in front of everybody!  That will remove him from power because of the aforementioned  warthog nepotism act.  But, you know, the embarrassment's just a it's a cherry on top.  Right thos way Mr. Mayor.  Now's my chance! Peace out, Perry the platypus!  Love HÃ¤ndel with Candace Flynn! You're on in five!  Omg! Omg! Omg! Omg  I guess, just introduce the next act.  The last nominee in the fact-based category,  the ballad of Klimpaloon sung by Love HÃ¤ndel  Who are joined by contest winner  Candace Flynn!  Go, Candace!  Stop! I object!  This song does not belong in the fact-based song category!  Klimpaloon is not real!  What?  My nana told me stories  - about Klimpaloon! - Well, that's not good enough.  Seeing is believing. And no one has ever seen Klimpaloon!  Um, excuse me, but I have seen him.  That's right! You tell him, Candace!  I'm afraid that's not good enough either.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mittington Random!  Thank you, Max, uh, whoever.  Mittington Random here, sponsor of the show  and president of Random Swimwear. You're welocme.  According to the rules, if fact based song is called in the question,  physical proof must be presented here within 24 hours.  - How are we supposed to do that? - Well, actually, you can't.  - Wait, what? - Oh, Daniel.  The rules clearly state that the band along with the  presenters are to be locked in a sound-proof booth for 24 hours  or until evidence is provided, whichever comes first.  - Wait a minute. Why presenters? - I can't hear you  'cause you're supposed to be in the sound-proof booth,  - so move along. - Oh, okay.  Candace! You're in charge!  Okay, sorry for the inconvenience, folks. But it looks like  we're gonna have to move this category to the end of the show.  Phineas, Ferb! We need to find Klimpaloon and bring him back within 24 hours.  We're way ahead of you. Ferb's rounding up the gang.  Those darn kids! I'll stop at nothing to make  sure they don't prove the existence of Klimpaloon.  Nothing!  You're on next, Mr. Mayor, after  - the pork-based world music act. - Now's my chance!  No! Oh, Perry the platypus!  Swine Flute! You're on! Where's your tambourine player?  No show, man!  Look at you, Perry the rasta warthogipus!  Kid, you've got the goods!  And now, here's Swine Flute!  More tambourine, man!  Isn't anyone gonna talk about how we got here so fast?  Sorry, Buford, we don't have the time for that right now.  - Ferb? - Two words, travel montage.  I got two words for you, cli-chÃ©.  Oh, yeah.  Anyone else get the feeling we're being followed?  - No, not a bit. - Paranoid!  Okay, Ferb, where to next?  - That's it? -  We lost the auction for volume two.  - We've got sniped. - What about that cave  - up there with waving Klimpaloon totem? - If Buford is now   the brains of this operation, my life has lost all meaning.  Watch it. Long underwear makes the best wedgies.  Candace, make the sound!  Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang!  - Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang! - Whoa!  - It's him! - Klimpaloon! Yay!  - We found him! - Wish I could un-see that.  - Got him! - Mr. Random?  This unforeseen plot twist is brought to you by Random Swimwear!  Wow! I totally thought that shadowy figure was gonna be Slamm Hammer.  Welcome back to the Tristies.  Our next category  And then the hobo gave it back to me, quixotically.  And that was the day before we met.  So the next day at breakfast, I ordered poached eggs with salmon.  But I didn't have poached eggs with salmon.  I wonder how the boys are doing.  - Get us down from here! - Uh, that really doesn't align  with my plans, so not gonna happen.  Look, if you're going to destroy my chance at stardom,  I think I deserve an explanation.  All right. I do like the sound of my own voice.  So, for years now, I've wanted to find the elusive Klimpaloon.  And finally, after countless hours web surfing,  I found Shackleberg's journal on an online auction site  only to lose the first volume to you two!  I did manage to get his second journal,  but it only contains the last page of the map,  the map that you have in volume one.  So I concocted a long, convoluted plan  to get you to lead me right to him. Huh?  Hmm. Yeah.  - But why? - You see, sales have gone flat.  You can only reinvent the bikini and board shorts so many times.  But if I could convince the world to start wearing old-timey bathing suits again,  that's revolutionary!  But to do that, I was gonna need a gimmick.  - Nyang, nyang, nyang! - What a combo!  He's self-propelled, he's got a weird, disturbing face on his chest,  and he makes unintelligible noises.  Seriously, just the whole package is irresistible!  And he's all mine! He's all mine!  - You can't own him. - He's a living thing!  - He belongs to the ages. - Well, the ages should have kept  their receipt, because he belongs to me now.  And once I unravel his secrets, I'll make a fortune.  Ah, there's my ride. Brought to you by Random Swimwear!  We can't let him unravel Klimpaloon's secrets!  Unravel? I've got this!  Knot untying patch, check!  - Come on! We've got to save him! - But how?  Mr. Random is already miles away.  We have no idea where he is going and no way to get there  - except on foot! - Wow, what is with all the negativity?  Enough already. Time is running out  and I am not going to blow my big break.  Let's look around. Maybe we can find some clues.  See? Now that's constructive.  Look! It's one of Klimpaloon's threads,  and it's trying to find its way back to him!  - Follow that thread! - We cannot follow a thread!  Again with the negativity.  Maybe we can use it as a homing device. Ferb?  Let's go!  Is no one going to talk about where we got the snowboards?  There's no time for that now!  Come on! Come on! Come on!  Oh, man! Roger's not on until the end of the show?  - Can I get mics to him? - No. Who do you think you are?  - I'm his brother. - Nepotism will get you nowhere with me.  Yeah, well, maybe not yet, but wait till Roger's a warthog.  I do not know what that means.  That must be Mr. Random's fortress. Follow me!  - Now what? - Okay.  I'll just create a diversion here so that  Buford and Baljeet can flank them from the left.  Ferb can then use his intimidating shout to scatter them  so that Isabella can come in from behind.  That should work unless they have reinforcements.  What do you think, Baljeet? Can you give me  - a number crunch real quick? - Uh, give me a sec.  I am coming up with a 32.3% chance of success.  - Well, we've seen worse. - All right guys, let's do this.  Buford van Stomm!  - He just ran in. - Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!  - Dang it, Buford! - Stick to the plan, man.  Stick to the plan!  What the  What? I used gamer strategy.  Okay, now I just have to set the spritzer,  and the timer, and whoop, there he is!  My brother the warthog, mayor no more.  You know, it's not the same without Perry the platypus.  I can't believe he ditched me!  One lousy award and he goes all diva.  What the heck is all this?  That's just so wrong. They're just horrible!  You'll have to excuse me if this device seems incredibly threatening.  It's only because it is incredibly threatening.  Klimpaloon!  As you clearly saw, my previous attempts to create the  future of swimwear without Klimpaloon just were not working.  You fiend!  Look, I'm giving ""old-timey"" here a new twist.  Flash back to fashion forward.  It's a little high concept, but take a look.  We're flashing back to fashion forward   yes, the old is the new new   one size fits all with just a little stretching   be you 6'4"" or 5'2""   why rely on inspiration   when the old stuff's tried and true   we just revamped a tired idea   and made a new old-timey swimsuit for you   - Pretty catchy, don't ya think? - Yeah, if by ""catchy"" you mean  ""sucks the life out of the room and makes me wanna puke,"" then yeah.  Anywho, now that I have the original, I can figure out what makes him tick.  Which brings us back, obviously, to the incredibly threatening machine.  So, it's time to extract Klimpaloon's life force,  And, uh, then, of course, infuse it into my latest swimwear line.  - We have to do something! - How about this?  Aw, come on! Did we blow the breaker again, Fred? Fred?  Frederick, it's That stings.  Come on, guys! Now's our chance to free Klimpaloon  - Buford van Stomm! - Oh no, not again.  - So I did it again. - So what do we do?  Save Klimpaloon, of course.  - Nyang, nyang, nyang. - There he is! Follow his voice.  - Got him! - Ow! That is me!  Whoops. My bad. That wedgie was unintentional.  I got him! Let's go!  Guards! Don't let him escape!  Oh, they are too fast. We are never going to make it.  Ok, we gotta split up. Ferb, hide Klimpaloon  under your jacket to keep him quiet and I'll lure the  guards the other way with my ""nyang, nyang, nyang-ing.""  - Just get him to awards show. - But Candace, you'll miss your big chance to  Saving Klimpaloon is more important.  Now go! Nyang, nyang, nyang  All right, hold on.  That way! Follow that vintage swimwear!  Good thing they left the door open.  Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang  Oh! Cold! Cold! Cold!  Great, I'm reduced to yak transport.  Got it, boss. It's go time.  and that's how we met.  Okay, folks. On stage in five.  - Righty-ho. - Wow. What a great story.  Bobbi! Come on!  Huh? What? Wait up, guys!  And now to present our final award for the evening,  which of course was supposed to be our first award,  but you remember that whole ""does Klimpaloon exist"" hullabaloo.  Anyway, welcome again Lindana and Max Modem!  Unfortunately, due to lack of evidence,  it appears that love hÃ¤ndel has been disqualified.  So without further ado,  the winner of the award for best fact-based song is  Wait! We have the evidence!  I'm sorry, kids. The journal isn't good enough.  You need actual, physical proof.  But we do have physical proof. Ferb?  Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang.  I thought you said you'd stop at nothing to keep them from finding Klimpaloon.  That's right. I did nothing and stopped.  - How did you find him? - And why are you all in parkas?  There's no time for that now! Mr. Random is a ruthless venture capitalist  who captured all of us in his Himalayan fortress where he performed  inhuman experiments on bathing suits and tried to steal  Klimpaloon in pursuit of a revolutionary swimsuit sales gimmick!  Oh, Candace, not here. Not now.  No, Mom, really, Candace is telling the truth!  What an active imagination these kids have.  We don't really have time for that now. We need to present an award.  No, no, let's get the award done.  Tick, tick, tick, time's a-wasting. Shall we?  Well, obviously Klimpaloon is real.  So it gives me great pleasure to present the award  for best fact-based song to  Love HÃ¤ndel, for the Ballad of Klimpaloon!  Thank you. Thank you so much!  And a big thank you to all of the kids who brought Klimpaloon here.  Come on, Candace, take your place.  Oh!   oh!   oh!   he stands in winter he's striped and frozen   he is completely out of style   he got no hands he got no feet   all mouth and teeth but he don't smile   he's made out of wool he's itchy to wear   he's got broad stripes and savoir-faire   he's out of place almost everywhere   since 1883   he's a costume out of time   both ridiculous and sublime   seems innocuous, but I'm afraid he's scaring me   he's the magical old-timey bathing suit that lives in the Himalayas   they call him Klimpaloon   Klimpaloon   if you're between Tibet and Nepal   and you're quiet and you can hear the call   of Klimpaloon   Klimpaloon   Nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang, nyang  he stands in winter!   Wow! He really is magical.  Actually, he's being pulled up by a cable.  Thanks, Miguel.  - Let's hear it for Love HÃ¤ndel. - Look at them, enjoying them tryin'!  ""Ooh, we're so happy. We saved Klimpaloon. Let's all sing.""  Well, enjoy it now, because I will get my hands on Klimpaloon!  I'll unravel his secret even if I have to rip him apart, stitch by stitch.  And then the moronic people of the world will beat a path  to my door and beg for my cheap Klimpaloon knock-off line  'cause consumers are just like Lemmings, mrainless little  animals that I can manipulate right off the fiscal cliff  like the puppet master I am!  Uh, uh, um  - Was that thing on? - Yes! Yes, it was!  - My career's over, isn't it? - Yes! Yes, it is!  And I'm a warthog.  Curse you, Perry the  Well, I guess he doesn't really get credit for this one,  he was just playing tambourine with Swine Flute.  It's not really Well.  - Sort of anticlimactic for me. - So where is Klimpy?  Don't tell me he ditched us for one of those swanky after-parties.  I guess he's on his way back to the Himalayas.  - See you, Klimpy. - Safe travels!  I don't want him to go. I want him to stay with us.  Klimpaloon doesn't belong to us. He belongs to the ages.  I said that back in the Himalayas! Does no one listen to me?  Uh, how are we getting home?  We're flashing back to fashion forward   yes, the old is the new new   one size fits all with just a little stretching   be you 6'4"" or 5'2""   why rely on inspiration   when the old stuff's tried and true   we just revamped a tired idea   and made a new old-timey swimsuit for you   Pretty catchy, don't ya think?"

By hand!  Why don't you just text or call them?  [chuckles.] You kids know nothing of the lost art of letter writing.  Back when we were young,  we expressed our truest feelings in letters.  Yes! You could tell someone how much they meant to you  without worrying about getting interrupted, or losing your nerve.  Or hiccupping. That was my problem.  When I was young, I had a crush on a certain boy  and I wrote a letter telling him how I truly felt.  That boy ended up being your grandfather.  Wow, I've been wanting to tell someone how I feel for a long time now.  Really? I've got an extra pen and paper.  Now take your time, deeply search your feelings, express yours  I've been scripting this thing out in my head for years.  Perfect timing! The postman's here.  Add this to your bag, my good sir.  So nana, what he did when he got your letter?  Did he come running to you and sweep you into his arms?  What? Oh, no, I never mailed it! I'm not brave like you.  I mean, what if he had laughed at me or shown the  letter to his friends? Can you imagine the embarrassment?  Oh, boy.  Hon, why do you have all these boxes of take-out food thingies?  It's such a waste to get rid of them.  See? Look, chopsticks and ponzu sauce.  That's Japanese, but look, there's also a Chinese fortune cookie.  - That's what's known as ""fusion."" - Okay, I'm hungry.  Oh, let's go get some food. Would you kids like to come along?  No thanks, dad. We had fusion for breakfast.  Alright then! I'll clear all these drawers and boxes out later, darling.  - See you, boys! [door closing.] - Hey, Ferb, let's do dad a favor  and clear these drawers and boxes out for him.  Oh, look at this. It's like a spoon and a fork together.  What would you even called that?  - In the U.K., they call that a ""foon."" - They do not.  It's a perfect fusion of aesthetics and utility.  - It's like a little work of art. Ferb - What are you doing?  - Helping dad by clearing out this stuff. - You're doing a chore?  [chuckles.] No way are you getting all the parent points.  I've got chores to do, too. Carry on.  You know, the drawer in our kitchen is full of honey and ketchup.  Yeah, and ours has red pepper flakes and little tubs of grated cheese.  Well, go home and grab it, guys. We're gonna make some art.  Hey, where's Perry?  [chattering.]  Agent P, it seems that Doofenshmirtz is into astrology now,  and that makes him very dangerous to us. I know what you're thinking.  I was like you. I always thought horoscopes were a bunch of hooey.  But then I read my own horoscope. I'm a sagittarius.  It said, ""it's a bad day to get a haircut.""  How spooky is that? I had my hair cut yesterday!  Today would be a bad day to get a haircut.  How do they know that stuff?  If Doof figured out the astrological signs of our agents,  he could predict our every move!  Excuse me, sir, I believe horoscopes are meant  for entertainment rather than to be taken as fact.  Of course you'd think that, Carl. You're a capricorn!  You know what to do, Agent P!  Thinking: Oh, come on, Isabella.  What's so bad about writing a letter and expressing my feelings?  Feelings are natural. Phineas is natural.  We are both natural beings in the world  with feelings.  Oh  Did I really refer to him as ""my little crumb cake""? Who does that?  - [beeps.] Come in, Fireside Girls! - Go ahead, chief.  I just mailed a letter stating my true feelings to Phineas,  and we need to stop it before he reads it.  This mission is top priority. I call it ""operation Crumb Cake.""  Crumb cake? Is that what you called him?  [all giggling.]  Oh, boy, it's worse than I thought.  - Wow! Artsy! - Yeah, we're really getting into it.  Who knew that making an art piece  out of old take-out stuff would be so fun?  It is almost like Tadeshi Kawamata's  massive chair sculpture in Abu Dhabi.  Or the  sub lyric pile Killabuster with onion on marble  - in Salzburg, Austria. - Really?  Actually, I think he just made that one up.  Chorus: [singing.] Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Doofenshmirtz: Oh, hello, Perry the platypus.  Could you be a sport and shut the door?  It gets really drafty in here. Give it a good slam,  sometimes it sticks. [thud.] [laughs.]  Bet you never dreamt you'd get caught in a dream catcher.  Actually, Norm made that this morning. Who knew he was so crafty?  Anyway, my astrologer believes that when mercury is  in retrograde anything can go wrong and usually does.  And you know she's always right.  She has dark hair and bangs, and you know.  As it turns out, mercury has been in retrograde all summer!  No wonder my evil schemes keep failing.  And that is why I invented the Un-retrograde-inator!  You know, to reverse my bad luck.  You know, I know that un-retrograde is sort of a double negative.  It sounds like I'm making mercury go forwards,  but I'm actually sending it backwards from going  bachwards, which happens to look forward, but it isn't.  You know what? Basically it's a reverse-inator,  but un-retrograde-inator, it sounded more astrology-y.  Look, you know, I'll just show you how it works.  Oh, Norm, could you come over here for a moment?  I'm almost finished cleaning up your mid-morning pinata, sir.  Yeah, yeah, que bueno, Norm.  - Now just stand right there. - Okey-dokey.  Oh my! I have the sudden urge to dump  - your pinata pieces back on the floor. - It works!  Now I am going to push the giblets back into the chicken.  Isabella singing: # Postmaster general, please help me out #  I wrote a boy a letter now I'm filled with doubt   it was a sentimental notion   to spell out my emotion that way   before I have a heart attack I need my letter back   I need a retraction   a full-scale rejection   at least if I could edit it and soften the tone   please, just believe it I have to retrieve it   don't say my opportunity has already flown   Backup singers: # already flown #  oh, why did I ever sign my name?   I don't want to be forever stamped in shame   I'd have to move to Belgium and wear a really bad toupee   so before I have a heart attack   she needs her letter back   it could be in this very stash   she needs her letter back   it's hard to overstate this fact   I need my letter back   We'll never catch them this way.  But we will get that letter back!  No matter how nicely or politely we have to ask.  We'll cut them off at Phineas's house. Let's go!  Now I'm going to put food waste back on the dishes.  Yes, yes, thank you, Norm. Does this make sense to you? Listen:  ""Someone is secretly speaking on your behalf.""  Norm: Time to unmake the coffee.  It sounds positive for me and I like that, but who is speaking nicely of me?  Wait, was it you, Perry the platypus?  Next, I'll un-make my dream catcher.  No, no, don't do that!  You never let me finish my sentences.  Hey, look! Looks like we're here before the mail's come.  Okay, girls, let's seal up this area.  Holly, you go take up a scanning position one  half-click to the North. Ginger, you got the South.  The rest of you, fan out. We've got to intercept that letter.  I'm going in back to keep Phineas distracted.  - Any questions? - Yeah!  How long has this mailbox been here?  Oy!  Now to un-brush my teeth.  What am I doing?  Sir, the effect of your ray has worn off.  I'm so happy for you.  Listen, could you get this platypus off me?  Wow, is he hard to catch!  You're just noticing this, huh? Go get him!  Heya! [laughs nervously.] So what you doin'?  What do you think? The world's largest art piece  made entirely of takeout food packets and utensils!  - Oh, wow. Artsy. - Right? Can I show you around?  Sure!  Here, Baljeet has thoughtfully recreated  Gainsborough's the Blue boy  completely in red pepper flakes.  I wish I would have thoughtfully created an eye-wash station.  Sheesh!  Watch your step up the chopstick ladder.  From here you can see the whole neighborhood!  Phineas! Uh Look! Let's change places!  The light catches the foons so beautifully from this angle.  [Ferb whistling.]  Awesome. The mail's here.  Wonder if that comic book I ordered arrived?  No, no! Wait!  Hey! This doesn't look like a chore to me!  It looks like a bust!  The stamp is on the envelope.  Excuse me, but do you have a letter in your bag  addressed to Danville resident Phineas Flynn?  Hmm, looks like I do.  We demand that you hand it over to us immediately. Please.  I'm sorry, it is unlawful for a postal carrier  to deliver any envelope or parcel  into hands of anyone except the intended recipient,  as indicated in the address column of said envelope or parcel.  What about afterwards? Can we jump him and wrestle it  - out of his hands? - Honey, what you do with your afternoon  - is none of my business. - Phineas: Hey, Mrs. Ferguson!  - Did my comic book arrive today? - No, just this letter.  [gasps.] Oh, look! It's from you, Isabella!  Thinking: Well, Isabella, here it is.  He's finally going to know how you really feel.  There's no turning back now.  Come back here. Now I've got  rhythm?  At least you told the truth and you spoke from your heart.   I can accept this.  Phineas: ""Dear Phineas""  Aw, and there's a little heart!  Oh, no, I just realized  I may have put the giblets in the hamster.  Ha! Gotcha! See, I began to think,  ""if only I had a nickel for every time  ""you pushed my inator's self-destruct button.""  Then it hit me, you wouldn't have a nickel either,  because you don't have any pockets!  Wait, what are you Oh, I forgot about your hat.  Curse you, Perry the pla  See? You never let me finish my sentences.  Aw!  - Of course. - Phineas: Why did I do that?  There was, like, a whole bunch of stuff the boys were clearing out.  Speaking of stuff, what's up with your room?  Yep. I'm on it.  Well, I guess, we'll never know what was in that letter.  No, I guess not. And neither will your little Crumb Cake.  Millie! [whistling.]  Phineas: An almost perfect day to build another one of our inventions.  [beeping.]  Buford: Hey, dinner bell. Where do you want this crate  - of hoojimagawas? - Phineas: Right there is good, Buford.  Baljeet: How about these helicopter blades?  Phineas: Just lean them up against the tree for now.  - Baljeet: 10-4, buddy. - Buford: Why do you sound  like you're in a 1970s road comedy?  - There was a cable marathon on last night. - Buford: Oh, I missed it!  Isabella: Heads up! More random construction equipment  for an as-yet- unidentified project coming in.  [chattering.]  [footsteps approaching.]  At this rate, I'll be late for my creative writing class.  Agent P! No need to walk all the way down here!  I'll just give you your mission on the staircase!  Doofenshmirtz has been experimenting with image technology.  It's very suspicious. We need you to go check it out.  Good luck, Agent P.  [footsteps retreating.]  Idea for TV spinoff, ""Platypus in a staircase.""  Stace, the thing with boys is, I just don't get them. You think they're  saying one thing, but then you don't know if they really mean something else.  They're like those egyptian drawings that no one understands.  You mean, like, hieroglyphics? Those were deciphered  in the early 1800s after they found the rosetta stone.  Fine! They're like something else no one understands.  - Like, how do you know that? - I dunno.  Okay, take the conversation I just had with Jeremy.  I suggested we go to the movies later, and he said, ""cool.""  And what does that mean? I mean, did he mean,  like, ""cool, I totally wanna hang out with you""?  Or, ""cool, I really wanna see that movie""?  Or, ""cool, like I think you're being cold and distant""?  Not that one.  Chorus: [singing.] Doofenshmirtz Evil Incorporated!  Doofenshmirtz: Over here, Perry the platypus!  So, you fell for the old ""hat rack disguised as you nemesis"" ploy, huh?  Well, anyway, that was a very efficient use of my time.  I demonstrated my latest inator and trapped you all in one!  ""Trap Perry the platypus."" Check.  ""Demonstrate inator."" Check!  Uh, now that just leaves backstory, light lunch,  take over the tri-state area, and schedule painters.  Only 75% of my list left, I am on fire today!  All right, so let's get down to business.  Ever since I switched pizza places  you remember that whole pizza day debacle, right?  Well, okay, anyway, my orders now are all showing up cold.  Nothing I could do to change that because, you  know, I'm a lousy tipper. So I invented this,  the Impersonator-inator!  An inator so nice, I had to name it twice!  Rather than move or shell out extra cash, I can use  this device to create a holographic field around myself,  impersonate the pizza delivery boy,  and pick up my own pizza. It will still be warm.  But then I said, ""Heinz, Heinz, you're thinking too small.  ""Why not be the pizza boy's boss?""  But then I said, ""Heinz, Heinz""  and then I said, ""what? I'm right here, stop saying my name!""  And then I said, ""why be the pizza boy's boss  ""when you can be the pizza franchise owner!""  - Uh-oh. - Computer: Database image transferring.  Oops. One pizza delivery boy, comin' up! I don't who that was for,  It was just such a good line, it would've been a shame to hold it back. It's, uh  Oh, hush.  Seriously, Stacy! The boys are mystery.  I mean, what do they talk about when we're not around?  - Do you think they talk about us? - [scoffs.] I got no clue.  [sighing.] I guess I'll never know the real deal as long as I'm not a boy.  Stacy, there's a pizza delivery boy in my room!  - Is that code for something? - Get back! [grunting.]  Huh? There's no one there.  But he's in the mirror! But But  [gasps.] Oh no.  No, no, no, no, no, no! This cannot be happening!  Aha! Oh!  Oh! Oh!  Stacy! Phineas and Ferb have turned me  into a holographic image of a pizza boy!  Cool, can I have a veggie special with non-dairy cheese?  - Stacy! - Hey, too bad Jeremy didn't order a pizza,  then you could hang out with him and  - find out what guys talk about. - Brilliant!  [gasps.]  Just kidding, Candace. Candace!  Oh, boy. I gotta work on my delivery. It's way too deadpan.  ""Knowing what we're gonna do today."" Check.  ""Wondering where Perry is?"" Check.  We're on fire today!  [giggling.]  - Did you order a pizza? - Nope.  Maybe he delivered a pizza  before you even thought about ordering it.  Ferb, make a note for later. Time travel pizzeria.  And then I thought, ""why be a brigadier general  ""when I could be a major general?""  I mean, why not, right? I'm a modern guy.  And then I thought, ""maybe I'm still shooting too low.  ""Why be a major general when I could be a lieutenant general?""  And then I thought, ""why be a"" ahh!  What, do you have a blowtorch under your tail or something?  Ow! [yelps.]  Jeremy: 37-42-74 Hike! Hike!  Hey! Hey! I'm open!  - I'm open! - [in deep voice.] Pizza delivery.  Huh? [grunts.]  That didn't count. Pizza interference.  Candace: Pizza for Jeremy Johnson!  Uh, sorry, dude, but we didn't order any pizza.  You didn't. But your girlfriend did.  Yeah, that's some girlfriend you've got there!  I'd say you're probably the luckiest man alive  to have a girlfriend like that.  Wait a minute. You look familiar.  - Do I know you? - No.  [chuckles.] You really look familiar. Aren't you  No, just an average hamburger-eating,  football-playing, punchin', gamin' boy.  [hawking.]  [spits.]  - Boys spit. That's why I did that. - Wait! You're Gary Frank!  You were the popular senior two years in a row!  Dude, you gotta join us for a pizza break.  It'll be fun to catch up and talk.  Talk? Yeah! Talk!  [chomping.]  [belches.] [all laughing.]  [faking laughter.]  That was funny. Belching!  [continues fake laughter.]  It's so, uh, male. Right, bros?  But, you know, maybe we should talk  about something like, I dunno.  Does anyone have any deep thoughts they'd like to share?  - Nope. - What?  - Well, I think this pizza's really good! - Oh, I'm so glad!  Yeah. I figured you guys would like the supreme meat lover's choice.  Though I wasn't sure about the prosciutto.  Sometimes it can be rather tough, and when it gets in  between your teeth, it can be really embarrassing, like  - Um, that's how I feel about it. - What?  - I have a feeling. - Great, let's hear it.  I have a feeling if Jeremy doesn't wash that shirt soon,  it's gonna be reported as a health hazard.  [chuckling.] Jeremy: Oh, yeah?  Well, your face is a health hazard!  Your breath is a health hazard! [belching.]  I have really been underestimating Stacy's conversational skills.  Okay, I can tell by the way you're looking at me  that I'm suddenly the 26th president  of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt.  The downside is, I'll be succeeded by William Taft.  Blech! The opposite, Perry the platypus is  that the hero of San Juan Hill was a heck of a pugilist!  Put up your dukes! Come on!  Hmm, I guess the animal setting wasn't such a hot Ow!  Well, how did you punch me? The hologram is so much taller than  [groaning.]  Empathize: Logic.  Jeremy: Yeah, well, my fantasy league is killin' it this year.  Thomas got me two touchdowns, [sighing.]  23 points last week, and 189 yards.  I'm in first place in my keeper league.  You're lucky because I drafted Kimball,  - but he's out for two more weeks. - What?  So, uh, what else can we talk about?  Hmm, let me think. Uh Oh, I know.  - Anyone here have a girlfriend? - What?  I do. Her name's Stacy. She's absolutely the best  - Not you. I'm asking Jeremy. - Duh. Remember the whole  ""your girlfriend ordered the pizza"" thing?  Oh, right! Yeah, your girlfriend ordered pizzas!  [clearing throat.] So, yeah, what do you think of her?  - She's cool. - What do you mean, ""cool""?  - Like cool how? - I just mean she's cool.  So, cool, like, you like her cool?  Like, she's totally cool to be around cool,  or cool, like, she's cold and distant?  Uh, those first two. Not that last one.  - She's cool. She's sweet. - You mean, sweet like thoughtful,  or sweet like so sugary you're gonna be sick?  No, I just mean she's sweet. She's nice.  Nice like she's nice or what do you mean by that?  Just what I said. She's nice. She's cool.  So what you're telling me is that what you say is  exactly what you mean? Like, nothing more, nothing less?  You say it, you mean it. That's it?  Well, yeah. What else would I mean?  Nothing, I guess, 'cause we're, like, dudes.  - What? - Okay!  So, you know, um, I'm gonna go.  - Great hanging with you! - Yeah, unlikely  Wow, he is not like he was in high school. [belches.]  [all laughing.]  Oh, come on!  Oh, I get it. Pigskin.  Oh, great. My inator has a sense of  [screeching.]  Velociraptor power attack!  Oh, great. Where am I supposed to find a paleo-orthodontist?  Okay, Ferb, fire it up!  Ah! Congratulations, guys!  We're the first humans ever to taste blueberry air!  Eh. I'm more of a lingonberry kind of guy.  Hey, you're back! I'll take a large pie  with andouille sausage and chocolate chips.  First of all, ew! Why would you eat that?  And second, I'm not a pizza boy.  Oh, my gosh! It's Candace!  With what appears to be a holographic    Why are you surprised? Didn't you guys do this?  Nope. We were just making blueberry air.  Why blueberry? Why not lingonberry?  Exactly! What's that all about?  [groaning.] Well, how can I get this off?  Buford is, like, the eighth person to order pizza from me!  - And that's not even how you order pizza! - Well, we didn't do it,  but we'll be glad to undo it. Side project, gang!  No! No! Not the inator! I totally need that!  Who's this nincompoop?  Oh, right. Curse you, Perry the platypus!  And that football player,  the gorilla, and Lolo Jones,  and Blanca Dechan, and Director Diphthong.  Everybody! Curse you all!  Okay, we have everything we need  for a holographic field disrupter.  We'll build it, and you'll be totally back to normal!  Cool! Thanks, guys. Bust ya later!  I guess my pizza order isn't going in.  [shouting.] Won't someone think of the Buford?!  [phone ringing.] [beeps.]  - Hello? - Jeremy: Hey, Candace.  I just wanted to thank you for sending over the pizzas.  - That was really cool. - Cool! You liked it?  It was awesome. So, we still on for the movies tonight?  - Cool! - Cool!  - Cool! - Cool!  - # Cool! # - # Cool! #  - # Cool! # - # Cool! #  - # Cool! # - # Cool!

"1   Uh, uh, can you do it faster?  - Faster? - Yeah. And funnier, if possible.  Oh, faster? Okay. Um All right.  Uh, uh, yeah, yeah, no, no.  - What? What? - Forget the funnier.  Yeah, just go faster.  All right.  Bum, bum, bum!  Sounds creepy like that.  - That's good. I like it. - Thanks. Yeah, it was capitalized.   TK-582, I'm gonna need you to run these numbers again.  I took a third out of the budget already.  Orders from the top. There's nothing I can do.  Stop right there!  Oh, uh, it's work-related.  There he is!  - Captain, the Rebel is escaping! - Go after him!  Whoa!

Save, save, save!  We received your transmissions. So you have the Death Star plans?  Agent P, you never cease to am  Your highness, an imperial Star Destroyer has tracked our position.  You can look, but you're never gonna find a better place to be   than this little slice of heaven   tucked between the Jundland wastes and the big dune sea   we can surf through the canyons or train a pack of Dewbacks   build a giant hamster habitat for womp rats   or fire up our solar-powered sandcastle making machine   we're on Tatooine   yeah, we're living like kings out here   we got a two-sun summer the whole darn year   cruising Beggar's Canyon in our T-16   or just sitting on a rock eating blue ice cream   blue ice cream   'cause we're on Tatooine   # oh, we got two big suns count 'em, one and two #  - # and there's two Flynn-Fletcher boys # - # me and you! #  well, we're brothers!   we're step no, we don't share a gene   but we'll always be together here on Tatooine   jamming with the modal nodes racing turbo dust bikes   trading with the Jawas   trickin' out a droid or soupin' up the barge   for a trip around anchorhead tower   we can stop along the way and startle Tusken raiders   and still be home in time to fix the vaporators   I think you know exactly what we mean   we love Tatooine!   # yeah, we're living like kings out here #  we got a two-sun summer the whole darn year   cruising Beggar's canyon in our T-16   - # or just sitting on a rock eating blue ice cream # - # we love Tatooine #  I may be wearing my heart on my sleeve   but I can't understand why anyone would want to leave   we know our city pride may sound a tad extreme   but we're so happy here we tend to overstate this theme   overstate this theme!   'cause we love Tatooine!   ooh, we love it ooh, we love it   here on Tatooine   we love Tatooine   - Hey, Luke! - Phineas! Ferb! What's up, guys?  Ferb. Check this out.  Pod-racing engines? How'd you hook these up?  We just picked up some power converters at Tosche station.  Nice.  You need help with your moisture vaporator?  - We can trick it out like ours. - I wish.  But Uncle Owen wants to do things the old-fashioned way.  Even the droids he buys are used.  Hey, treadwell. Well, we'll catch you later, Luke.  We're gonna mosey on home for lunch.  Wow. When they mosey, they mosey.  What in  Is that a Star Destroyer?  Finally, some real Rebel-busting!  This is why I joined the Empire in the first place.  I am so excited, I can hardly contain myself.  - I told you to go before the raid. - That is not what I meant.  But now that you mention it  All right, lock it up, we got Rebels to bust.  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where do you think you're going?  Uh, space battle over that way?  Certainly not. You know your mission,  - to find socks for Lord Vader. - Yes, sir.  Socks?! This is a total waste of my potential!  Not me. This is about where I peak.  Agent P, I need you to make sure this R2 unit goes to Obi-Wan Kenobi  on Tatooine. But first, I need to record a video message.  Uh, be a dear and stand over by the bulkhead.  You're kind of in my shot.  So what color socks do you think he wants?  - Uh, black? - I'm just saying,   everything that guy owns is black. You think maybe What?  Oh, there's somebody doing something over there.  Oh, yeah! It's busting time!  Oh, commander!  Huh. We are never going to get those socks, are we?  Hey, I found a pair of socks.  Where? Right here.  - Ow! - Don't be a baby, you're wearing armor.  But it is plastic.  Commander! Commander! There's a Rebel  in a dress recording something into a droid!  Ooh! By chance, was this droid  - distributing socks of any kind? - Well, no.  Then it's none of your concern, is it? Back on sock detail!  Me? I'm an argyle man.  Huh. I would not think that from looking at you.  Hey! Where'd they go?  Danish head ran off, but the droids are over there.  Oh, no! I'm going to regret this.  - There goes another one. - Hold your fire. There's no life forms.  It must have short circuited.  - Coffee? - Yeah. Let's get some of that Sith Roast.  Sith Roast!   They got away!  We've got to follow them! Come on, we'll take the other escape pod!  - Um, Candace? - What?  Socks, socks, socks   sock-sock-socks sock-sock-socks   Look, if we catch those two droids, we'll  be promoted off of sock detail. Let's drift.  Technically, we will not be drifting.  More like violent ejection, plummeting through the atmosphere,  and crashing onto the planet's surface.  Mmm. That's good coffee. Did you know this is decaf?  Huh. I could not tell.  Sith Roast!   Decaf.  Fully operational Death Star!  How do you like that, Norm?  My beautiful invention floating out here in space,  and do you think i get any credit for it?  Your invention, sir?  Well, yeah. I designed it to be a nutcracker.  Here, look, look at this.  See? It works just fine. But the Empire took my idea  and made it so big, it's completely impractical.  - A walnut would be totally obliterated. - The universe is cruel and unjust.  Well, when they see my new invention, they'll be singing a different tune.  All I need is to get my hands on a little bit of force to get  it up and running. But where am I gonna find some extra force?  The force surrounds us, it penetrates us,  - it binds the galaxy - Yeah, I've seen the bumper sticker.  No more adventures. I'm not going that way.  Ugh. Tatooine.  Okay, my busting instincts are telling me  that the droids went that way! Now, come on!  Actually, I joined the Empire by accident.  I was trying to sign up for a physics camp.  Physics camp? Yeah, you're better off.  Hey, Candace, why did you join the Empire?  Don't you remember anything from orientation?  Rebels are cruel, heartless sub-humans who are  messing up the galaxy. And I'm all about law and order.  Ever since I was young you know I hated dissension   among my peer group, it caused a whole lot of tension   when the other kids were slouching I would stand at attention   and I've always looked so good in white   now I'm a bad mamma jamma, and I rock a mean helmet   if I see a Rebellion, then you know I'm gonna quell it   I'm a certified, full-blown, armor-wearing zealot   and it feels so good to know I'm always right   you can see exotic worlds across the galaxy   in the Empire   in the Empire   you can be all that they want you to be   you get a 401K and your meals are free   in the Empire   in the Empire   in the Empire   in the Empire   I don't know, but I've been told   the Rebels need to be controlled   we'll round them up and put 'em all in stocks   but first we gotta get Darth Vader's socks!   it's so not fair!   I mean, why am I still on sock detail when  Gladys from accounting got promoted to commander,  and she doesn't even know how to hold a blaster.  No, I mean, really, she failed that part of the exam four times.  She held it backwards and upside-down.  But, no, she's a second cousin of some midlevel Darth,  and so she gets a promotion? What about me?  if they would just open their eyes   they'd see that I've got everything it takes   I could be the stormiest Stormtrooper ever!   - You feeling better? - Yeah. Thanks.  You can see exotic worlds across the galaxy   in the Empire   in the Empire   you can be all that they want you to be   you can march to the beat of conformity   in the Empire   # in the Empire #  in the Empire   in the Empire   in the Empire   in the Empire   in the Empire   - Look, sir! Droids. - No. This is a bathtub stopper.  TK-90210, what are you doing out here?  Well, we followed some droids that ejected from the  Hup-uhp-uhp-uhp. The droids and the missing  Death Star plans are none of your concern.  - Death Star plans? - Never you mind. You go to Mos Eisley.  I'm sure you can find some socks for Lord Vader there.  Yes, sir.  - Look, sir! A magic flute. - No, that's a stick.  Hi, mom. Hi, dad.  Hello, boys. You're just in time for lunch.  So, what's on the list? Another day filled with big plans?  ""Herd all the nerfs into Beggar's canyon,  ""teach the Sarlacc to brush his teeth,  ""and giving a Bantha a shower."" That's awfully ambitious.  Just trying to make the most of each and every summer day!  Hey, we stopped by and saw Luke.  Ooh! Let me guess, was he staring wistfully at the horizon?  - Lawrence! - What?  Everyone knows that boy would rather be somewhere else.  What about you two? The crops are so far ahead,  would you like to spend the rest of the summer  - at swim camp on Naboo? - Sounds fun, but we'll pass.  Well, how about ski camp on Hoth?  Don't you boys ever want to see the rest of the galaxy?  Not really. We've got everything we want right here on Tatooine.  Sand, womp rats, brothers, and Banthas.  Why would anyone want to leave?  Wait till they discover there are no girls on this planet.  Lawrence!      Take these two over to the garage, will ya?  - I want 'em cleaned up before dinner. - But I was going  into Tosche station to pick up some power converters.  You can waste time with your friends when  your chores are done. Now, come on, get to it.  Well, come on, red, let's go.  - Uncle Owen! - Yeah?  This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!  Hey! What are you trying to push on us?  - What about that one? - What about that blue one?  We'll take that one.  - Okay, let's go. - Now, don't you forget this.  Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity.  Norm, bring all my gear down to my lair.  You mean the abandoned recycling compartment?  It's a lair!  Ooh, what do you know, a moving sidewalk.  Oh, ooh! Darth Vader!  Hey, I know that guy. It's Darth Vader.  Hey, hey, wha Wait up! Wait up.  Phew! Darth Vader, uh, uh, Heinz Darthenshmirtz.  I'm not sure if you remember me.  The Doof Star, the little nutcracker thing.  And then you sort of stole my plans.  Anyway, I got a new invention, and it's gonna knock your socks off.  I'm wondering if you could, uh, spare a little force?  I thought maybe you had a little extra lying arou  Okay. Uh, good talk.  Please, master Luke took off your restraining bolt, now quit complaining.  Now, I'm taking another oil bath. And I don't want to be disturbed.  Wow, that Bantha took a lot longer to clean than I thought it would.  We better get home.  Whoa!  Whoa, little fella! Sorry about that.  Say, what's a droid like you doing out here in the Jundland wastes?  Oh, cool, a movie!  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  Oh, she must mean Ben Kenobi. Hey, we were just there!  We have Jedi lessons with him every Tuesday.  He lives right at the edge of the dune sea. Do you want a ride?  Okay, suit yourself.  And remember, sand people travel single file to  hide their numbers. Oh, he probably already knows.      Ah, Agent P, our sources tell us that the R2 unit  is safely in the possession of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You always come through for us.  Great work. Now, take a well-deserved rest.  Agent P, I've got your next mission.  You need you to get to the Death Star immediately.  Darthenshmirtz is working on a new inator.  We need you to stop him before he can finish building it.  Good luck.  Okay, mom. See ya later!  Don't forget your two-sun sunscreen.  Way ahead of you, mom!  Hey, what's this? ""Death Star plans""?  Wait, I bet it belongs to that R2 unit that we sent  to Ben Kenobi's house. I wonder if he's still there.  No. He is on his way to Mos Eisley.  Oh, wow, can you sense that with the force?  No, I can see them. They're right over there.  You're right, Ferb. And Luke's with them. And so    Oh, you got me!    Phineas and Ferb! My best customers!  Hey, Blatto, we're trying to find an R2 unit  and give him back this data disk.  - Hey! - Let's take a look at it.  Wow! It's an imperial battle station the size of a moon!  And according to these schematics,  it seems to be designed specifically to destroy entire planets!  Whoa! I, I never imagined the Empire would go that far.  Huh, you're right, Ferb. One proton torpedo in that  small exhaust port and the whole thing goes blammo!  Uh, it's like it's got a self-destruct button.  What kind of idiot would design that?  Why can't I master this?  Wait, if the Rebels had this information,  they might stand a chance against this thing.  A small one-man fighter could penetrate the outer defense,  fly along that trench, and get to the exhaust port.  Hey, spoiler alert!  That droid must be part of the Rebel alliance.  We've got to get this disc back to him.  - Candace, did you get the socks? - Mission accomplished.  - I got a hoagie! - Are those the stolen  Death Star plans we are not supposed to be looking for?  I don't believe it!  Hey! You with the Death Star plans! You guys are so busted!  Uh-oh! Let's get out of here!  - And they're lost in the crowd. - Not on my watch! Let's go!  Hey, look, there's the droid!  You two! Stop right there!  - Buford! - Sorry! My bad!  My watermelon!  There's the droid. Let's get over there.  Stop that ship! Blast 'em!  - Chewie! Get us out of here! - Maybe we came at a bad time.  Oh, crud. This is going to be nothing but paperwork.  If we don't get these plans to that R2 droid,  entire planets could be destroyed.  Come on, we've got to find a pilot and follow that ship.  All right! Figrin d'An and the Modal Nodes!  Not a bad set, guys. Only one death and  one dismemberment. Not bad for a Wednesday.    I don't like him either!  All right, let's give her a big cantina welcome, folks.  Vanessa the Twi'lek.  - Um We're looking for a pilot. - Over there.  Well, someone said he shot first, but I could've sworn it was the other guy.  No, there.  I'd get out of here just as soon as I'm able   but my hyperdrive's on the fritz   just today the Mynocks chewed my power cables   and my life's one big Sarlacc pit   and I'm feeling so low   Oh, great.  What do you farm boys want?  I'm Phineas and this is my brother, Ferb.  We understand you're a pretty good pilot.  - For a price. - Well, we have a very important disc  we need to get to someone who just blasted out of docking bay 94.  - I know whose ship that is. - Whose?  Han Solo.  so low!   Solo's been a thorn in my side for years.  My ship, the Centennial Chihuahua, was on pace to finish  the Kessel run in 11 parsecs and that nerf-herder cut me off.  - # I'm feelin' so low # - Everybody loves Solo.  Twelve parsecs. If I ever hear his name again, I'll just  so low, so low, so low, so low, so low   Would you two excuse me?  Yeah, we should probably get going.  Well!  Here's my ship, the Centennial Chihuahua.  - Why'd you call it the Chihuahua? - It's personal.  It seems weird you'd call it something you didn't want to be asked about.  You're right. It was a call for attention.  - There they are! - Well, looks like we got it.  Move it! We gotta get outta here!  - Fire the cannon! - I think the barrel end slides in here.  But then the scope is on the bottom. That's not right.  Hold on, this is gonna be rough.  Give me that!  You're going down!  - Uh-oh! - I see it!  And you thought we were gonna die in space.  Move! Move! Move!  Gosh, Ferb, our planet looks so small from here.  - First time in space? - Well, yeah, now that you mention it.  - Yeah, your planet's over here. - Oh, that makes much more sense.  Mom and dad always did want us to see the galaxy,  but I don't think this is what they had in mind.  You might want to buckle up. I'm making the jump to hyperspace.  A little more warning would be nice.  I grow tired of asking this, but please tell me you have the socks.  Yes. Buford? With my compliments, sir.  Excellent. Now report to the Death Star for reassignment.  I'll deliver these to Lord Vader myself.  Finally! Now we're gonna see some action!  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not riding in here.  Uh, this shuttle's full. You can ride back to the Death Star  - on that bus pod. - What a piece of junk!  Wait, that's it! I've solved my force problem!  I can extract it from Vader's garbage. It says right here, see?  You can find anything on the internet.  Hey, check it out, Norm-3PO.  According to this real estate website, my timeshare on Alderaan is worth,  like, 10 times more than I paid for it six years ago.  Oh, I knew the value would go up.  It's just, it's such a peaceful place, and people like to  Wait, what? What's this? The The value is totally dropping!  Zero!  Hey! What you doing?  Isabella, did you know you have T-27 thermal couplings up here?  - Get down from there! - Ferb and I can reroute  their current to double up your power supply.  Just keep your paws off my ship.  Reroute thermal couplings.  I wonder what our family and friends are doing back on Tatooine.  It feels a little strange to be so far from them.  But at least we're making new friends. Like you, Isabella.  This is not a ""friend"" ship, it's a space ship. So don't invade mine.  We're coming out of hyperspace. Buckle up, ladies.  What do you think, Ferb? A girl like her and a guy like me?  Sure, why not?  As promised, the Millennium Falcon.  I should be able to catch him before he gets to that small moon.  That's no moon. It's the Death Star!  - Isabella, turn the ship around! - What have you guys gotten me into?  We're caught in a tractor beam! My engines can't pull us free.  Looks like we're gonna have to shoot our way out.  - I'm powering up the turrets! - There are alternatives to fighting!  I should've known getting this close to Solo was a bad idea.   Hurry it up back there!  We modified the deflector shield with a cloaking mechanism. Give it a try!  This had better work, or you two are floating home!  I don't think we could float all the way home.  I mean, we wouldn't survive 15 seconds  - in the cold vacuum of - It's a figure of speech!  It worked! It even smells like donuts in here.  - Nice touch, Ferb. - Okay, let's see if it fools them.  Uh, docking bay control, you got us  caught in a tractor beam here. Do you guys want donuts or not?  Oh, shoot! Sorry. Disengaging tractor beam.  Deliveries are in docking bay 427.  You're clear to land. So, donuts?  - Does Darth Vader wear a funny hat? - Dude!  Oh, relax. He can't hear us all the way down  Oh, no! I didn't Oh!  Gotcha!  Can you believe this? Making us ride the bus pod?  They better give us a real Rebel-fighting job this time  - and not just running some more errands. - Uh-oh.  I mean, how hard is it to deliver socks?  - Uh, Candace? - Yes?  I believe Buford requires your attention.  Oh. What is it, Buford?  Huh. Uh, Buford, I'm going to ask you a question  and I want you to think very hard before you answer.  - Thinking is always hard. - I know.  Here's the thing. If we have Darth Vader's socks,  - what exactly did we give the commander? - Uh  I find your lack of socks disturbing.  - Hello? Are you open yet? - Hope they have old-fashioneds.  - Those are my favorites. - I can't believe that worked!  I feel guilty, though. Maybe we should get them some donuts.  - Would you stay focused? - Uh, sorry.  Okay, let's find Solo's ship and the droid. And then I'm outta here.  Well, they landed in docking bay 327. And we're in docking bay 427.  That's not so bad.  What is it, Ferb? What's with the hand?  I feel something, a presence I have not felt since  - Perry! Hey, old buddy! - Who is this?  This is Perry the platypus. He used to be our pet until  we found out he was secretly an agent for the Rebellion.  We felt a little betrayed and hurt at first,  but bygones be bygones! Now we're good, right?  So you're probably on a mission right now, huh?  Hey! So are we!  Oh, uh, this is our pilot, Isabella.  So, uh, good luck.  - He looks good. - Ugh! Let's get this over with.  There ought to be enough residual force  in Vader's garbage here to power it up for, you know, at least one shot.  One man's trash is another man's bad idea!  Just put the garbage in the chute, Mr. Wisen Droider.  Well, well, well, it's Perry the Rebel-pus.  Oh, sorry about the door. I I put in a work order, but the  guy's not gonna get down here till, like, Thursday, so, you know.  You see, I did put a big red ""X"" on the floor and people will stand on it.  It's human nature. Or in this case, platypus nature!  What's wrong, Ferb? You got your hand up again.  - Perry is in trouble. - Oh, no! Let's go help him!  No. You must get that disc to the Rebels.  - We cannot risk our mission. - Split up? Really?  Just do what you need to do fast and meet us at the Falcon.  May the force be with you, and all that stuff.  Come on, we gotta find that droid.  There! It's just like art!  Yeah, nothing like a frozen platypus to tie a room together.  Now, allow me to tell you why I created my latest inator.  You see, the force with me is weak   I've never been that hip or chic   people treat me like a freak   sometimes they even boo and hiss   let me tell you, even though my midi-chlorians are low   I'll be the Death Star's CEO   when they get a load of this   it's a Sith-inator it's a really cool machine   my evil will be greater than Darth Vader's ever been   you ask all those haters from Naboo to Tatooine   they'll say, ""wow, that Darthenshmirtz is mean!""   when this is operational, I'll zap myself, and bam!   the force will be so strong with me, they'll all know who I am   and all those bureaucrats that used to point and jeer and joke   if I put my fingers just like this, they're gonna start to choke   Moff Tarkin will respect me, give me medals and a raise   with all my newfound Sith-iness I'll set the force ablaze   the Emperor who used to only greet me with a yawn   he now will say, ""I'm blown away, much like Alderaan""   it's a Sith-inator it's a really cool machine   my evil will be greater than Darth Vader's ever been   you ask all those haters from Naboo to Tatooine   they'll say, ""wow, that Darthenshmirtz is mean!""   it's my Sith-inator it's got evil moving parts   I'm a Sith creator, and my evil's off the charts   and my portrait will be placed on all the grandest evil hearths   and I'll no longer be the lowest of the Darths   I'll no longer be the lowest   the fastest, not the slowest   the yes-est, not the no-est   and you'll all be eating crow-est   I'll no longer be the lowest of the Darths   Darth Vader can kiss my Bantha!  Very good, sir. That was better than rehearsal.  All right, stay close to your comlinks, ladies.  And if all goes well, I'll have a victory number in the fourth act!  So, like I said, I'm going to make myself  super evil with my Sith-inator here.  But first, I'm gonna shoot you just to make sure it's safe  and, you know, I don't die or fry myself  and have to wear one of those masks like Vader,  'cause that would not be a good look for me.  Uh, you know, plus, if it works, you can join me on the dark side.  We can be Sith buddies! What do you think, huh?  Hold on, wait a minute, wait Who let a kid in here?  Hey, buddy, you okay?  Yeah, he's gonna have a headache. But with any  luck, he's gonna be so evil when he gets on his feet!  Oh, great, I used up all the force on this guy.  Hey, Norm, grab the trash can. We gotta go refuel.  Wait right here, Perry the Rebel-pus.  We'll be right back to turn you to the dark side, too.  And then you, me, and this kid in the cloak, I guess,  - can be the three Sith-keteers! - Who can I be, sir?  You can be the horse. Come on, let's go.  We gotta get some more of that super force-y Vader trash,  and I know just where to look.  We're all right now   TK-90210 reporting for duty, sir.  - Just a minute. - How are you?  - Ooh, tell him I'm doing great! - We're sending a squad in.  Uh, negative, negative. We have a reactor leak here, uh, now.  Give us a few minutes to lock it down. Uh, large leak. Very dangerous.  Who is this? What's your operating number?  Aw, I was just getting into that conversation.  All of you, go directly to level five, detention block AA-23!  - Yeah! Get some! - Buford, wait!  Finally, some real action!  Hup-uhp-uhp-uhp-uhp! I need you to stay here and guard this post!  - Wha But, but, but - That's an order!  Oh, Bantha droppings!  and no matter what, we always did everything together!  - Are you done? - Yep.  Good! Then let's get going!  Serious trooper. Happy trooper.  Enigmatic trooper. Sad trooper  It's down here around this corner, and then Uh-oh.  Hey, you're the ones with the stolen Death Star plans!  Run!  Hey, that's coming out of my salary!  This garbage chute is a really wonderful idea!  What an incredible smell you've discovered.  Come here, boy! Come on! That's it.  Now, what have you got for papa today?  Ooh! Is that Darth Vader's inhaler? Nice! Now we're talking!  And what's this? This looks like a perfectly good Bantha cheese hoagie!  Well, it's not good anymore, it's been underwater, but  Wow! According to this, it's reeking with dark force!  Vader must have touched it. Put it in! What else have you got for me?  That's not trash, dummy, that's a guy.  Just put him back. I've got enough.  Man, you can lead a Dianoga to garbage, but you can't make him think!  Ah-ah-ah! Don't forget to flush!  The walls are moving!  Don't just stand there! Try and brace it with something!  Man, someone needs to oil that thing.  Okay, come on, Norm-3PO, let's go make some Sith happen.  Oh, hey, they fixed the door. Must have been a cancellation somewhere.  I'm gonna go check on the Sith-inator, you go see if that kid's evil yet.  Where did we leave him? Behind this box?  Norm, what the heck are you standing around for?  I thought I told you Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  Oh, my spleen!  Hey! Get away from that!  Perry the Rebel-pus, you stay away from my inator.  Don't make  No, wait, wait, wait!  You know, I'm thinking about getting a saxophone.  Ah, good for you.  I would like to see you try that again.  - Uh, should we report that? - I'm not losing my place in line.  Hey! Get back here, you two!  Whoa!  Help! Help, somebody! I'm slipping!  - Oh, no! I have to help her! - Don't be a fool!  I got you!  Uh, but  Why would you save me? You're a Rebel!  You were in trouble.  I couldn't just leave you hanging. Literally.  - Well - Buford!  Watch where you're shooting that thing!  Seriously, why don't they put safeties on these blasters?  - Sorry, my bad. - Hey, don't worry about it!  I'm planning on hitting the wall and sliding down  until I catch on to a radio antenna.  Oh, no. Wait, that's Cloud City I'm thinking of!  Oh, crud!  But why would he save me?  You're either really brave or really stupid!  Well, kid, looks like your luck hasn't run out yet.  There's the Falcon. And the R2 unit!  It's getting away! But I've got to get the disc to  Quick! Back to my ship!  Wait! What about Ferb? We can't leave without him.  If we don't leave now, we'll lose the Falcon.  - But I can't leave my brother. - Tick-tock, tick-tock.  Isabella, you've got to take the disc back to R2.  - I'll go find Ferb. - If I leave, I'm not coming back.  Fine. Just make sure you deliver the disc to the R2 unit.  How do you know I won't just go back to Tatooine?  - I trust you! - Remember that ""brave or stupid"" thing?  I know which one it is.  What is that?  It looks like it was built by  Ferb?  Cool face paint!  - Oh, no! - What?  The disc is gone! The one with the  thing for blowing up the Death Star.  - Are you kidding me? - It's supposed to be right here!  - This is not happening. - Is it over there on the floor somewhere?  - Is it on the floor? - Oh, no. No, no. We are so dead.  Maybe it Maybe it fell out on the flight deck.  Okay, okay, hey, I know. We'll blame Jar Jar.  Jar Jar Binks That's a terrible idea!  He retired, like, 20 years ago.  Hey, it's not like we have a lot of options here.  Okay, here, let's do this.  You go get a thermal detonator,  and we'll put it right back here on the  No! How is that better than my Jar Jar idea?  Yo, tech support! Got something for ya.  - Oh, my gosh! Thank you! - Yes, thank you. You saved our lives.  Wow, that was a close one, huh?  Hey, where do you think she found it?  Hey, man, never look a gift tauntaun in the oral cavity.  Hey! Wait, wait, wait! I can't see!  All right, someone's getting a lightsabering now.  Oh, it's just a flashlight.  I guess my lightsaber's in the camping supplies.  Ooh! Ooh, look, I'm scary.  Whatever. Bye!  So, is there a face-painting booth around here or something?  And where's Perry? Were you able to find him?  I found this. The Sith-inator.  And I've modified it so I can create an army of Sith warriors.  Join me on the dark side, brother.  Shut up, Ferb! Come on, let's get outta here.  Isabella already left. We gotta find a ship so we can get home.  The dark side is my home now.  Whoa, Ferb! What are you doing?  Come on, quit messing around.  Hey, this isn't funny. I'm not gonna fight you.  If you will not join me  then I must destroy you.  Okay, I can see you're serious.  Ferb, this isn't you! We're brothers!  Hey, this is crazy. We would never try to hurt each other.  Is that the best you got?  Oh, we're allowing modifications, huh? Give me a sec.  Hey, Candace, what's up?  Um, I was just thinking, we're the good guys, right?  Yes, I believe so.  That's what they told us during the brainwashing.  - Orientation, Buford. - Potato, tomato.  And Rebels are bad. We know that.  Of course! The Rebels are always the bad guys.  - What about Robin Hhood? - That has not happened yet!  Well, what if one of the Rebels just saved my life.  He could've escaped, but instead he came back to help me.  Hmm.  And didn't we just blow up a planet?  Hmm. Yes, that is sort of difficult to justify, morally.  You're over there and I'm over here,  And never the twain shall meet.  So I guess you're just gonna have to give up.  Oh, I see, you're gonna swing across like a monkey-man.  Me swingy-swingy monkey-man!  Go ahead, knock yourself out.  There's no way you got enough cable to reach that.  Oh, I see what you were trying to  Ow! No, no, no!  Well, well, well. Han Solo.  All flight crews man your stations.  Hey, look, it's Isabella!  - Isabella, you've joined the Rebellion? - Not by a long shot.  Well, you should. You're a great pilot.  We need you. The odds are stacked against us.  The Empire has everything,  A Death Star, highly trained troops, Darth Vader.  And we're just a ragtag bunch of undertrained, good-intentioned  Rebels. And to be perfectly honest, Isabella, we're kids.  We are actual children, and they're letting us fly fighters.  That's how hopeless this situation actually is.  - So, you wanna help us? - Strangely, still no.  Worst rallying speech ever!  Shut up, Porkins!  I'll have one of those.  What happened, Solo, garbage scow tip over and dump you here?  What are you doing here, Isabella?  - Did someone run out of cupcakes? - Very funny.  - So where are you heading? - As far away from here as possible.  Yeah, I don't have any reason to stay here either.  I don't owe anything to anybody.  - I'm not in this to make friends. - Yeah, obviously.  What do you mean by that?  I've got friends. I've got plenty of friends.  Yeah? Where are they now?  Well, where are yours?    Put a sock in it, fuzz-ball!    Maybe you're right. Maybe I do have some place to be.  See you around, Isabella.  Ah, the Wookiee is right.  Ow.  It's good to be back.  Ha! You're too late! No stopping me now!  Hey, it's cold in here!  I've got such an ice cream headache.  Now, you will join me.  Step away from the Rebel!  Don't shoot him! He's my brother!  - Your brother's a Sith warrior? - No. I mean, yes.  I mean, it's a recent development.  Wait, why are you helping me? I'm a Rebel.  I had to. I couldn't just leave you hanging.  Hey, heads up!  Hey, watch it!  Hold it right there, pal!  Hey, you're gonna stretch out the elastic!  Ferb! Please, stop!  Now I really wish I'd bought the three-pack.  Oh, man, I really should have ray-shielded that.  Ferb?  Are you okay?  Ferb!  Found this perfectly good robe just lying around.  Has one hole, right here.  Hey! Look what else I just found! My hoagie!  I would not eat that if I were you.  Come on. Let's get off this battle station!  - But we don't have a ship! - I know where there's a bus pod.  Perry, great work! Hey, don't be a stranger!  You think maybe you can turn this thing over?  All the blood's rushing to my head.  Hey, it's Luke! They must've got the plans!  He should hit that exhaust port no problem.  I mean, it's practically as big as a womp rat.  Yeah, we should probably get outta here.  Come on, the bus pod is right through here.  Wait, wait! No, no, no!  Oh, no! That was the last ship.  - Yeah, we're toast. - Well, if we had to go out,  at least it was for something we believe in.  My only regret is that I spent so much time on the wrong side.  My only regret is that I ate that hoagie.  I guess if I have a regret,  it's that I never got reunited with my sister.  She left Tatooine when I was just a baby.  - Phineas? - Candace?  - Oh, I can't believe it! - Candace!  You got so big! I didn't even recognize you.  Hey, wait a minute! Why is this guy hugging us?  Oh, this is Ferb. He's our step-brother.  Mom remarried? What happened to dad?  Funny story actually. He  Wow, that was close.  Thanks for coming back to get us, Isabella.  Well, that's what friends are for.  Oh, but what about all those innocent baristas  and bank tellers and bowling alley attendants?  They're fine. The firestar girls got them out earlier.  We're okay!  Ah, Agent P! With you stopping Darthenshmirtz  and the Rebellion destroying the Death Star,  this day will be long remembered. Apparently, there are  still copies of the Death Star plans out there somewhere,  so still might have a teeny problem there, but, heh,  we'll blow up that battle station when we come to it.  Hologram out!  Ha-ha! So long, Perry the platypus!  Now I can live to fight in the sequel!  I probably should've thought this one through better.  I didn't realize the escape pod would be platypus-size, but  plus, I'm sitting on my keys.  The Wookiee is right.  Let's party!  All right, boys, let me hear some of that Rebel bass.  We don't often have a cause for a celebration   no, we don't always have a reason to smile   we've been knocked over, stepped on, straight-up oppressed   our resolve and endurance have been put to the test   we've been under thumb, undervalued and under arrest   and we haven't seen the sun for a while   but the tables have turned, the momentum has shifted   can't you feel the change in the air?   a new hope has returned   our spirits are lifted   go tell everybody everywhere   time to celebrate!   Oh, oh! Oh, oh!   Rebel, please, I think you ought to know   Oh, oh! Oh, oh!   if you've been waiting for a chance to party then   Rebel, let's go!   Rebel, let's go!   Rebel, let's go!   Rebel, let's go!   all the Wookiees in the house go   Hey, farm boy. We're not related, are we?  Oh, no, no. Not a chance.  - I only had just the one sister. - Good.  Mwah!  tell everyone we're back in full force   time to celebrate!   Oh, oh! Oh, oh!   Rebel, please, I think you ought to know   Oh, oh!

"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   Hi, Mom. Stacy and I are gonna have lunch here at the mall.  so we'll be hanging out a little longer.  I thought you probably would.  Candace: Are the boys doing anything bustable yet?  Not yet. Although, they are trying to figure out  how they can both use the push broom at the same time.  Candace: Okay, keep me posted.  Hey, Mom. We're going down to the park to fly our kites.  You guys want a ride or something?  I thought you had to meet with those landscaper guys.  Oh right! I forgot!  [reading.]  Chorus: # Du Bois landscape artists #  Also, that's yesterday's paper.  I thought the city council was getting a little redundant.  [car honking.]  [in British accent.] Hello. I'm Pierre Du Bois, one-day landscape artist.  Hi. Oh, it's not [pronouncing in French.] Du Bois?  No. It's just like it's spelled. It's French.  Chorus: # Du Bois landscape artists #  it's just like it's spelled, it's French   Except Floraine ain't French. He's from Dutch.  [speaking Dutch.]  That's Dutch for, ""it's nice to meet you.""  [chuckles.] To my American ears, it almost sounded like, ""where's Perry?""  Chorus: # Perry! #  [video game sounds.]  Ah, Agent P, special surveillance photos tell us that  Doof has been outfitting his skiff with something large.  - It's hard to tell what it is - Sir, I looked out the window at this   building just now and I saw the mysterious object was   - actually a bucket. A huge bucket - Carl!  Why didn't we just look out the window in the first place?  - I don't know, sir. - Doggone it, Carl.  We can't keep wasting our funds like this. Well anyway, Agent P,  I guess you can go over there and see what he's gonna do with that large bucket.  - Carl: Is he gone? - Yeah, come on. Let's go to Vegas.  Hey, Baljeet! Check this out.  It's a kite, but it totally looks like a pirate ship.  That is very nice. Have you seen my kite?  Whoa! Is there even gonna be enough wind for something like that?  There should be, with Phineas's wind amplification device.  So, how does this work again?  You start by blowing a bit of wind into the intake funnel.  [inhales, blows.]  [bubbling.] Then we add super cold liquid nitrogen to cool things down,  cold air sinks, until it starts to warm back up again.  And that's when we heat it up with a giant blowtorch. And then as it accelarates,  it sucks up more air volume and eventually blows it out of an acceleration cone.  [bird screams.]  But that was just one big puff of air. How can we fly kites like that?  Simple. Irving has volunteered to keep puffing air into the intake.  I've been eating mint all morning. You know, so it won't be stinky.  That's very thoughtful of you, Irving.  I didn't really do it for you.  So, here's the yard. I want something nice out here.  I think you know what to do. You are the landscapers, after all.  [speaking Dutch.]  Actually, we're landscape artists.  Do I need to show you the car door again?  - Chorus: # Du Bois landsca # - No, no, it's fine.  I'll be inside if you need me.  [speaking Dutch.]  No, I didn't get the money up-front.  Is everyone's kite ready?  - Baljeet: All set. - Isabella and Buford: Ready.  - Okay, Irving, let her rip. - Roger, wilco!  [inhales, blows.]  - Isabella: It's working. - Buford: Wow! Minty!  Ahoy and avast, ye swarthy dogs!  Wow, Buford, you look like a real pirate.  That's nothing. Watch this. Fire!  Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Hey, Phineas! Watch this, I'm jumping clouds! Whee!  That's awesome, Isabella! Watch this.  Now I'm in a car.  [bird screeching.]  Enjoy your little welcome to Danville luncheon, ladies!  For soon, Grulinda, you shall taste the wrath of my  Perry the platypus!  Oh, before I forget, I got you a little lair-warming gift.  [laughs.] You fell for the old ""spring-loaded cable trap hidden in a ring box"" trick.  What? That That's a thing.  Obviously. But I bet you're wondering why I'm spying on a garden party.  Okay, maybe you're not wondering, but I'm going to tell you anyway.  Doofenshmirtz: It all started when I was a child back in Drusselstein,  there was this mean girl named Grulinda.  Every day she would pour water on my head.  [cackling.] Ow!  - No matter where I was - Ow! [cackling.]   or what I was doing  [cackling.] Ow! Stop throwing water on me!  [father speaking German.]  But, by some wonderful twist of fate, she has moved here to Danville. See?  ""Grulinda Boubenweir moves to Danville.  ""Party to be held in her honor at Danville park.""  And the party just started.  I don't know how they got this picture in the magazine so quick.  Eh, guess they're trying to compete with the internet.  But I digress. I can finally have my revenge  with this! The sogg-inator! [laughing.]  Now, I will fly over her party  and douse her with a lifetime of soggy humiliation!  What? Oh, you think that it's petty  that I've held on to this grudge for so long.  Well, well, it's not petty. It's not.  It's evil or something. It's not petty.  Okay, guys. I'm dying to see what you  - [cat yowling.] What is that? - Well, it's not finished yet,  but it's a juxtaposition of the irrigated world of the suburban  lawn and the dryness of the natural summer environment.  A water bucket dumping desert cacti.  Honeysuckle basket, wheat grass handle,  extra spikey barrel cacti in place of the water.  That looked That's [grunts.]  [speaking Dutch.]  Not to worry. Great art always takes time before it's accepted.  [phone ringing.] Hello?  Mom. I need you to go into my closet and tell me whether  Candace, I Look, call me back in a few minutes.  - I'm a little ticked off right now. - What happened?  Du Bois have made a huge mess in the yard. They've ripped  up the lawn, there's a giant bucket and a bunch of cactuses.  I'm so mad! I gotta go.  Candace, what's wrong?  It's the boys. [softly.] They're busted.  I don't believe it, Stacy   the moment is here   my brothers are busted   put it on the blogosphere   I've been vindicated   there's no more to discuss   I did not anticipate it it's a straight-up bust   it's a straight-up bust say it all over town   things are lookin' up because my brothers went down   it's a brand new day may take a while to adjust   and it makes me wanna say,   ""everybody, it's a straight-up bust!""   Doofenshmirtz: We should be over Grulinda's party any minute.  Then it's soggy revenge time! Whoa! It's windy up here.  If that keeps up, I won't have enough water to dump on her.  [banging.]  What? Did you hear that?  [inhales, blows.] [drop.]  Uh-oh.  All: Whoa!  - Isabella: It's getting a little rainy. - Buford: A little?  - Looks like we'd better climb down. - Just remember, Baljeet,  the captain always goes down with the ship.  Oh, boy, a promotion! Hey!  All: Whee!  What's that noise? [screams.]  What the heck, man? You've been dumping out my water?  Well, this had better not be empty.  Pierre: Okay, Linda, I know you're gonna love this.  This is the irrigation wheel.  Each section represents a different section of the garden.  It's a comment on the capricious nature of our existence.  Some get water and live, others go dry and die.  This is ridiculous. I don't want to end up with a yard full of dead plants!  [speaking Dutch.]  - What did he say? - He said, ""great art takes time!"" in Dutch.  Hey, what are you Oh!  Hey, watch the ailerons. Whoa!  [crashing.]  [yelps.] Whoa, whoa, whoa!  [screaming.]  [continues screaming.]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, you!  [growls.] I almost dumped a giant bucket of water on you and your  party but then there was this whole mishap with a platypus  But I will get you next time.  Revenge is a dish best served soggy, Grulinda!  - Uh, Grulinda's over there, bub. - Oh, you're not [clears throat.]  - All right, Gru - Wait, is that hold on one second.  [gasps.] Soggybottom Heinz Doofenshmirtz!

I don't understand.  You picked on me all through grade school.  [laughs.]  I poured all that water on you because I liked you.  Really? Well, I guess you must have liked me a lot,  'cause there was a lot of, you know, water.  I've got more time to play   and this is totally a straight-up   my life's a big buffet   and this is totally a straight-up   I know this sounds cliche   but this totally a straight-up bust   Wait, what am I doing?  Stacy, get me off of this thing. I need to see what boys have done.  She holds the thorns, which symbolize the hardships of being a mom.  And she holds pink jasmine, which symbolizes the joy of children.  This is the most  sweet and adorable thing I've ever seen.  ""Sweet and adorable""? She's mocking us!  [speaking Dutch.]  It is so good to see you after all these years.  Just look at you. Oh, come here my little soggybottom.  - [stammering.] Yeah, well, you hug now? - Oh, why are you all wet?  [chuckles.] Funny thing, I was flying over your party  with a giant bucket of water and this platypus hit me with a  Why were you flying over my party with a big bucket of water?  - He was gonna dump it on you for revenge. - Okay, now you're on my list!  - Revenge? For what? - Well, you know, you did dump water  - on me when we were little - Heinz, I was eight!  Have you been holding this petty grudge all these years?  [stammering.] Well, no, it's not petty.  I was explaining to the platypus earlier. It's not petty exactly  Well, here you go, I pour water on your head! [groans.]  Wait, was that for the vengeance thing, or do you still like me?  Yeah, it was for the vengeance thing. [clank.]  Tell me! What did the boys do in the backyard?  - How much trouble are they in? - Well, at first I thought  Du Bois were the world's worst landscapers,  - but they're growing on me. - Landscapers?  Yeah, here, let me show you.  So, I figure we can attach the seat right here.  Here they are, mom.  - Show me what they did. - What did who do?  Whoa! Wait! Where did it all go?  - [humorlessly.] Ha, ha. - How is that even possible?  - Very funny, Mom. - It was all here just a second ago.  I have never been so insulted in my life!  She called it sweet and adorable.  [speaking Dutch.]  By the way, Floraine, I have no idea what you're saying.  Would you rather I spoke in English?  Well, yeah, now that you mention it. Yes.  I don't believe it, Stacy, the moment is here   my brothers are busted put it on the blogosphere   I've been vindicated there's no more to discuss   I did not anticipate it it's a straight-up bust   it's a straight-up bust say it all over town   things are lookin' up because my brothers went down   it's a brand new day may take a while to adjust   and it makes me wanna say, ""everybody, it's a straight-up bust!"""

Huh? - Oh, yes! It's an un-exist-inator.  What? Well Well, now I'm worried.  See? Communication works.  I can't hold on much longer!  The one day my  are in the wash.  Hurry, Mom! Come on, come on What?  That did not hurt as much as I expected.  Yeah, you're welcome, people.  So my own parents accidentally created a black hole and became obsessed  with containing it, eventually firing themselves into orbit for fear  that they would jeopardize the planet, but that even me in the process.  That is what motivated me to become evil in the first place,  and eventually build my un-exist-inator  which you destroyed tonight.  Wow, it really feels great to tell someone all this.  - Son! - Mom, Dad, you're back!  Aw  I want you guys to meet my nemesis, Peter the Panda.  - You have a nemesis? - Our boy's all grown up!  - Why is he a panda bear? - Bernie!  What? I was just wondering.  Come on, Perry the Platypus, let's go home.  I talk to you enough, right?  Yeah, you're right, maybe too much.  Why don't you come in for some snacks, kids?  And if you see your dad, tell him to join us.  But, but, but Fine.  You know, that was pretty intense, Ferb.  We could've blown up the planet,  or ripped open the space-time continuum or something.  I just hope we didn't cause any real damage.  Oh, hi, Dad. Mom has snacks if you want to join us.  Ah, jolly good, boys, I am a bit peckish.  Maybe there's some pie left.  Whoa, that was weird.  - Was that us? - Couldn't be.  That Phineas had four white stripes on his shirt and you only have three.  Good point, not to mention our dad isn't a polar bear.  Come on, come on Stace, cover me! We need to find the bridge  across the Dumbledown River before that stupid gopher!  I've got your back, girl.  - Coin! Come on, come on! - I'm on it.  Next. You did it, Candace!  Yes! Third on the leader board, baby!  That digital Ducky Momo trophy will be mine!  - Ours. - Ours!  Candace, oh, good, you're up. You have plenty  of time to tackle the list of chores you left piled up.  But Mom, Stacy and I are ""this"" close to kicking  leaderboard butt in Ducky Momo golden quest.  Well, your chores better be done before  - I get back from running my errands. - No problemo, Mom!  You're looking at the queen of multi-tasking!  Just make sure you hit the whole list, Your Majesty.  - See you later. - 'Kay.  Ooh, ooh, squirrel bandits!  Ha! You lose, bro!  Eye shifts count! You moved!  Actually, you did too, since our planet's orbital  speed around the sun is 67,000 miles per hour,  and you are on its surface, and speeding around the sun as well.  - Quit it! - Cool hat, Baljeet!  Thank you, I got it at Astro Camp today!  Quit turbocharging the orbital speed of my solar system!  What? I'm racing 'em against each other.  That's it!

I've been giving a motivational speech to the interns.  - And by interns I mean Carl. - Very inspirational, sir.  Anyway, Doofenshmirtz has rented out a conference hall at the  Danville Motel Inn and is giving some kind of motivational lecture.  Who would want motivation from him is beyond  me, but, well, that's beside the point.  Pick up your credentials at the front desk.  Good luck, Agent P!  I'm all hooked up and ready to multi-task.  First on the list, wash dishes. Now, where did we leave off?  I think we were heading into the forest of the Grizzly King.  Are you sure you don't want to wait until you've finish your chores?  Oh, please, Stacy, I've got everything under control!  Let's tackle the Mountain King's dishes!  Hey, Phineas, what you doing?  Ferb and I were just heading up to our solar system speedway.  - We're gonna have a planet race! - Cool!  The first one to complete 50 laps around the sun wins the Galaxy 5000!  Technically it should be the Galaxy 50,  but, you know, Galaxy 5000 sounds so much cooler.  Ferb is racing Mercury, the closest planet to the sun.  I'm racing Mars. I saved Venus for you.  Aw, because Venus is the goddess of love?  - Actually, I didn't even think of that, but sure.  - Ugh.  All right, racers, status check!  - Saturn, check! - Yu-rah-noose, check.  Buford, that is not how it is pronounced.  It is on this channel.  - Venus? - Intergalactic Planetary Racing Patch, check!  - Mars? - All ready!  - Earth? - Earth is ready to go!  - Neptune? - Check.  - Jupiter? - Check.  Pluto is go!  Albert?

There is always a way!  Isabella teaches the emergency preparedness class for the Fireside Girls.  She could build a generator in her sleep.  - Is that not right, Isabella? - Isabella? I I thought she was  Didn't anyone Who saw her last?  [SCREAMS.]  ""Buford, chill out! You're fine."" I'm vindicated.  [SCREAMING.] The computers are down!  MAN: There's no Internet!  - I've got to know what's going on! - Yeah! Print is back, baby!  Wait, this is all stuff that happened yesterday.  [SCREAMS.]  Lots of me, baby.  [CHATTERING.]  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  Lots of me!  Lots of me. Lots of me.  ALL: [CHANTING.] Lots of me.  Lots of me.  [GASPS.]  Lots of me.  No, I'm just kidding. It's, it's, it's me.  But those guys are annoying, aren't they?  Anyway, welcome to my startle space.  I wanted a panic room, but it was just prohibitively expensive.  I just had to get to a place where I could clear my head.  Those other MEs, they're really working my last nerve.  ""Lots of me, lots of me.""  One of me is fine, but I, uh, I can be  really be annoying en masse. I'll admit it.  So, uh, are you hungry? I got plenty of food.  Or maybe you wanna play a game.  I got some old Drusselstein board games here like,  ooh, Kleptocracy.  Vanessa used to love this game when she was [GASPS.]  Vanessa! Oh, no! She's still in the building!  We need to stop those MEs before they get to her!  Or, or she could turn into me! That's every child's worst nightmare.  Well, [STAMMERS.] not me, specifically.  Other children aren't afraid of turning into me.  It's just that, I'm saying, turning into your parent.  That's what's scary. [GASPS.] Vanessa! Vanessa!  ALL: Lots of me.  Lots of me. Lots of me.  PHINEAS: I can't believe we left her.  I hope she's okay. She's just got to be!  I'm gonna check the periscope again.  - Maybe she's back by now. - I will do it.  PHINEAS: Thanks, Baljeet.  Oh, nothing but pharmacists as far as the periscope can see!  Man, I hope she's okay.  [SIGHS.] If she's been turned into a pharmacist,  - I'll never forgive myself. - Do not worry, Phineas.  With all of her training, she will be fine.  Just last week, she earned her judo, hapkido, and jujitsu patches.  Judo? Hapkido? But those are all grappling techniques.  And if she touches one of them, then [GROANS.]  Uh, wait, wait, I bet she's at Fireside Girl headquarters.  - We've got to go there! - But that is all the way across town!  We can't go out there unprotected. We're sittin' ducks!  Since our rubberization machine is toast,  we're gonna need some sort of insulating armor.  Hey, Ferb, do we have any rubber lying around?  Two steps ahead, as always.  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do tonight.  Figures. The power goes out right in the middle of the movie.  Good thing I got the power generator package option.  Okay, let's see.  ""For your safety please make sure to wear included  protective gear when operating the generator.""  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  Great. Here we go.  Nice! Hooked up a video system and a generator.  I am good.  Don't touch me! I don't want to be a pharm [STUTTERS.]  Wait a second. That doesn't even make any sense.  You get touched by a pharmacist, you become a pharmacist?  I mean, you can't just grow a lab coat.  I don't know, perhaps the disease infects your clothing as well.  Infects my cl [STAMMERS.]  Are you insinuating that my clothes are alive?  That's scarier than these pharmacists saying  [GRUNTS.] Lots of me.  No, I s'pose I didn't really think that through.  Lots of me!  Lots of me.  Lots of me.  Agent P! Agent P! Do not come to headquarters.  It is ""life or Doof"" situation.  OWCA has fallen. I repeat, OWCA has  Agent P, we need you to find the source of the contagion  and protect those who haven't been infected.  You're our last hope.  You're the Omega platypus. But no pressure.  Good luck, Agent P. Good lu [GRUNTS.]  - Lots of me! Lots of me! - Lots of me. I used to be Carl.  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  Okay, guys. Fireside Girls headquarters is only a couple of blocks away.  Whoa! Look alive, boys!  Lots of me. Lots of me.  BUFORD: Oh, hey, it's a dog. Here, boy.  [WHISTLES.]  [BLEATS.]  [YELLS.]  [HOOTING.] What the  [CHATTERS.]  [SCREECHES.]  Oh, no! The contagion must have a different effect on animals!  [YELLS.]  [WHIMPERING.]  [SQUEALS.]  [SCREECHES.]  - They're following us! - BUFORD: Hold on. I'll try to lose them.  Feet up, Ferb.  [YELLING.]  - Looks like we lost 'em! - Yes! And no.  [BUFORD YELLING.]  DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Vanessa! Vanessa!  All right, all right, party's over!  I've had it up to here with you MEs!  You know, I'm really getting sick of the sound of my own voice.  Now I understand where Charlene was coming from.  ALL: Lots of me.  [DOOFENSMIRTZ SCREAMS.]  ALL: Less of me. Less of me.  Oh, typical, typical, yeah, turn on your creator.  You guys are all cliche, I'm just letting you know!  That should hold them.  - Okay, guys, we gotta figure out a plan. - We should totally split up.  I'm gonna go hide in the bathroom where it's safe.  I know! I'll run off to check out an obscure noise in the kitchen.  I'm going to slowly walk backwards into a dimly lit room.  Really? See, if they watch more domestic horror films, they'd know  LACIE: Ew. Whoa.  - Lacie, are you okay? - Oh, yeah.  - Feeling safer in there? - Lots.  Cool. Wait a minute!  ALL: Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  [GASPS.]  Lots of me.  BOTH: Run!  Oh, I knew we shouldn't have split up.  [GASPS.]  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  Katie, bar the door!  - Is she back yet? - No sign of her.  We've searched everywhere!  Where could she be?  She's probably still with Phineas and Ferb.  She'll make it. [CANS RATTLING.]  Perimeter alert! We have incoming!  Stations, everyone. Put out that light! Katie?  Yep. Friend or pharmacist?  - PHINEAS: It's us. Let us in! - ADYSON: It's Phineas and Ferb!  - And Baljeet. - Isabella? Are you here?  [GASPS.] We thought she was with you!  Isabella's still out there?  I told you, man. She's probably wearing a lab coat by now.  - It can't be! - BALJEET: I am afraid Buford is right, Phineas.  [TEETH CHATTERING.]  The odds of anyone surviving out there for this long are  - If anyone can do it, Isabella can! - It doesn't matter anyway.  Sooner or later, they're gonna figure out we're in here,  and then they're gonna come in here.  They're gonna come in here, and they're gonna come in here [SLAP.]  Lock it down, soldier. No one is gonna get in here, you hear me?  I am so in love with her right now.  Okay, I'm running out of ideas. I don't know where she could be!  [BANGING.]  [ALL GASPING.]  I'm right here.  Isabella! I'm so sorry we lost track of you  There's no time. We have a job to do.  ALL: Ooh!  We may be the only non-pharmacists left in Danville.  I think I figured out where this started.  And if we could get there, we might be able  to figure out how it started, and reverse it.  Wait, how did you find out where it started?  Well, I'm glad you asked.  Roger Doofenshmirtz   We know is six feet and two inches tall   And the beam that hit him   Left a weird impression on that wall   So I took the angle from the point   Of where I knew he stood   And I found the building just like that   Because I understood   - ALL: # Triangulation # - # That's how I figured it out #  - ALL: # Triangulation # - # Now I'm left with no doubt #  The only geometric process using data I possess   That could pinpoint the conclusion of my scientific quest   Triangulation   Cha, cha, cha.  That is a mighty upbeat song for a desperate situation.  PHINEAS: Huh, that building looks familiar.  Oh, I guess that's why.  You know, it might be a good idea to board that window.  Oh, so that's why there was so much wood leftover.  Lots of me. Lots of me.   And I definitely should've closed the window.  [SHRIEKS.]  ALL: Lots of me. Lots of me.  Now what?  We've got to make our way to that building!  I'm sure we'll find our answers there.  Lots of me.  Lots of me.  - Where are they going? -Doesn't matter.  They're distracted. Let's move!  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  [GROWLING.]  Lots of me.  In here.  [SIGHS.] Phew!  [THUMPING.]  - What's going on with your dad? - I don't know.  His schemes normally aren't this successful.  - Wait, Phineas and Ferb. - I'm pretty sure this was not them.  No, I know, but they'll know what to do about it.  [THUMPING.] Come on, come on.  - Let's move! - I'm right behind you.  ALL: Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  - ISABELLA: We made it! - Not a pharmacist in sight.  Now's as good a time as any to rush in blindly, don't you think?  Okay, guys. Let's go, quietly.  [SQUEAKING.] [CAR ALARM BLARING.]  ALL: Lots of me.  - Here they come! - BALJEET: They are all over the place!  Come on, let's go!  [SCREAMS.]  BUFORD: Sanctuary!  [GASPS.]  Whoa!  [GRUNTS.]  Lots of me  No! No!  - I'm going back for them! - You can't help them now!  [BOTH SCREAMING.]  Quick! Find something to block this door!  It ain't gonna be easy without ruining the feng shui of the lobby!  - Hurry! I'm exposed! - Phineas, use this!  Thanks.  Nice work, Bro. Thanks, Isabella.  - Are you all right? - I'm all right.  Buford, you okay?  - I'm okay. You okay? - I am fine.  [GASPS.] Lots of me.  [SCREAMS.]  Baljeet!  Lots of me.  - That's it! - Buford, what are you doing?  Look, I just lost my nerd!  I'm not gonna lose the rest of my friends, too!  - But Buford, that's - Come on, you freaks! Fresh meat!  [YELLS.]  Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks.  Yippee-ki-y  [GRUNTING.]  You know, he really could've been bait without  - taking his clothes off. - Oh, yeah.  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  [GROWLS.]  DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Perry the Platypus, need a ride?  Oh, oh, oh, wait, no, I mean, I should've said, ""Need a lift?""  That's what I totally missed it.  It's much safer up here, huh? You might still wanna buckle up, though.  This is my first time flying a helicopter.  That'll hold for now.  But we gotta move before  - Ugh, really? - Lots of me.  Come on, guys. Head for the stairs!  [GRUNTING.] It's locked!  - Now what? - Any ideas?  - ISABELLA: I got nothing. - Ferb?  I'm petrified beyond all capacity for rational thought.  - Candace? - Phineas!  - Candace! - Isabella?  Ferb!  - Candace! - Phineas!  - Candace! - Isabella?  Ferb!  - Candace! - Phineas!  Enough!  We have to get upstairs!  No way. The whole upstairs is crawling with  Stairwell it is.  What's with the rubber?  It insulates against the infection.  I don't even wanna know how you figured that one out.  No!  Don't walk into the kitchen, Grievance lady!  Oh Gosh!  How could she be so oblivious?  PHINEAS: Just keep climbing.  CANDACE: This is enough car cardio to last me a lifetime.  Man, I've had off days before, but this is a lulu, even for me.  I I never thought I could get so sick of myself.  Oh, well. You know, at least with a disaster  of this proportion, things can't get any worse.  [ROARING.]  [WHIMPERING.]  [GRUNTS.]  [YELLING.]  Uh, Perry the Platypus, when you get a minute,  grab the controls,  would you, please?  Aah! [YELLING.]  - This is it. My dad's floor. - Thank goodness.  ALL: Lots of me.  Lots of me. Lots of me.  Whoa, this place is crawling with them.  There it is! That must be where the ray came from!  [GRUNTS.] If only there was a way to get rid of all those zombies.  [CRASHING.]  [GROANS.]  Lots of  - Strange and unusual. - Same old, same old. Come on!  Huh! [GRUNTS.] Oh, I sure hope the poor slob  who lives here has insurance. That would be  Oh, crud.  - Vanessa! - Dad! It's you!  Okay, so what did you do?  Well, it was just a simple Repulse-inator,  you know, to, to make Roger ugly, but then there  was some sort of power surge, and this happened!  Well, that explains the electrostatic charge that's changing everybody.  But we need some kind of conductor that neutralizes it.  Well, water neutralizes static.  Yes. Water should  change everyone back!  Um, isn't that a bit of a leap?  No, I'm a scientist. I'm gonna go with them on that.  I might have a water pistol lying around.  - I can go get it! - Yeah, but we've gotta find  a way to get everyone in Danville wet at once.  Otherwise, the contagion could start again.  We can wait till it rains.  [SCOFFS.] We don't have time! And when does it ever rain here?  Unfortunately, the water went out with the power.  So we need to find a large supply of water.  Preferably elevated, so that gravity can work in our favor.  Yeah, I know. We just need to build a pulley system to get us over  there and some sort of giant sprinkler to spray the whole city.  There's always lots of spare parts lying around here.  - I like to tinker. - Let's get to work.  [WHIRRING.]  Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  Uh, fellas, I think you might wanna hurry up.  You guys, hold 'em off. And don't forget to rubber up!  [VOCALIZING.]  Dad, why are you wearing that? Aren't you immune?  Well, everyone else was dressing up.  ALL: Lots of me. Lots of me. Lots of me.  That's it. Everything's built.  Let's go over the plan. One, Ferb shoots the grappling hook,  which attaches to the service platform of the water tower.  Two, we send the vortex sprayer up the line.  Three, we all ride up in the basket lift.  Four, once we reach the tower, I'll climb to the top of the tank  - CANDACE: Talk faster! - And open the hatch.  Five, Isabella will attach the connecting claw to the open hatch,  which will move the vortex sprayer into place.  VANESSA: Phineas, we can't hold them much longer!  Whoever makes it to the vortex sprayer first  presses that button to activate it! All right, any questions?  Yeah. Was it worth the time it took to build this scale model?  Totally. Anyone else? Yeah, you in the back?  Lots of me.  Whoa! Hurry up, guys.  - Great shot, Ferb! - Vanessa, behind you!  - Oh, crud. Lots of me - Candace!  Lots of me.  - Nooo! - Come on, guys. We gotta go!  Hurry!  Man, what I wouldn't give for that kind of  single-minded focus. Hey, what's that over there?  [CHATTERING.]  - Lots of me. - No, not Perry the Platypus!  There's too many of them!  Dad?  No, not Vanessa!  Lots of me?  Nooooo!  That's it. That's it! That's it!  I've had enough of you MEs! All right, you freaks, fresh meat!  DOOFENSHMIRTZ: Yippee-ki-yay, you pharmacist freaks!  - Yippee-ki-yay! - Again with the clothes.  I know. What's that all about?  DOOFENSHMIRTZ: This is yet another call back to something I didn't hear!  Wow, look at that! We may be the only ones left.  [GRUNTS.] [SCREAMS.]  Oh, no. The line's breaking! We're not gonna make it!  We have to! If we don't make it, Danville falls!  [SCREAMING.]  ALL: Lots of me.  ALL: Lots of me.  - Is everyone all right? - I'm good.  And there's the vortex sprayer. Come on, let's go!  [ALL PANTING.]  We're not gonna make it!  No, you and Isabella will make it.  Ferb! No!  [GRUNTING.] BOTH: Ferb!  - Phineas! No! Don't touch him! - Ferb! I can't just  I know. But the only way to save him is to keep going.  Come on!  Phineas! [SCREAMS.]  Hang in there, Isabella! We're almost there.  It's just If this is the end, there's something  - I have to tell you! - Okay, shoot.  - For the longest time - Come on! There it is!  But, Phineas, Phineas, I like you!  I like you, too, Isabella.  No. I mean, ""I like you"" like you.  Wow, I mean uh, gosh, I I've always felt, well  [SHRIEKS.]  Get away from her!  Phineas! [GASPS.] No!  [GRUNTING.] Go!  Lots of me.  Oh, Phineas. [SNIFFLES.]  Get it together, Fireside Girl. It's up to you to save Phineas.  It's up to you to save Danville!  It's up to you to stop talking to yourself.  [SCREAMS.]  Got to go!  [GROANS.]  Lots of me.  [GURGLING.]  Is the ceremony over?  Lots of me.  Carl, why are we holding our arms like this?  Lots of me.  I don't know what happened here,  and I'm pretty sure I don't want to.  ALL: Lots of me.  - I still say this makes no sense at all. - I know, right?  Hey there, Candace. You okay?  Oh, yeah, totes. Just hanging out, rocking the wet look.  Oh, who am I kidding? Look at me.  Well, you were pretty cool under pressure.  - You weren't so bad yourself. - Thanks. It was good hanging with you.  We should do it again sometime.  Preferably without the threat of a zombie apocalypse.  - I'm not making any promises. - Well, see you around!  Definitely. Come on, Dad, let's go play a game of Kleptocracy.  DOOFENSHMIRTZ: That's my girl.  Isabella, are you okay?  - Yeah. Just a little foggy. - What happened?  I remember building the vortex sprayer,  but after that, I've got no clue.  Me neither. But whatever happened, it worked.  Yes, everyone seems to be noticeably lab coat free.  At least everyone within the walled city of Danville.  ISABELLA: Yeah, too bad about the rest of civilization.  ALL AROUND: Lots of me. Lots of me.  Pfft! Horror movies. Scary but so unbelievable.  L-L-Lots of me  L-L-Lots of me   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   At first I was thinking, ""Hey, this is great!""   But there's more of me than even I can tolerate   Plus, now I really notice I should lose some weight   Get a shave, get a trim, exfoliate   L-L-Lots of me  L-L-Lots of me   L-L-Lots of me  L-L-Lots of me   Watch you milling about like a bunch of lost sheep   Now everyone in town thinks I'm kind of a creep   I'm not philosophical I'm not that deep   But I guess what you sow  You kinda got to reap   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   Now there's lots of me Yeah, there's lots of me   If you wanna, you can play connect the dots with me   Tell all the haters who been taking pot shots at me   You gotta target what you fire There's lots of me   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   Lots of me L-L-Lots of me   What I'm trying to say is  There's lots of me"
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   - Hey! - # Or giving a monkey a shower #  Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent   - # Or driving our sister insane # - Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   - # before school starts this fall # - Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   - I am ashparash! - Our dimension is changed.  - What's that? - It's Elvish.  - I feel it in the water. - Yes, but what does it mean?  It doesn't mean anything. It's a made-up language.  - I feel it in the Earth. - Oh, then I want to try one.  I feel it in the little pieces of apple in my Waldorf salad.  Go ahead.  - Much of what once was is lost. - Sepulveda.  - What? - It's an exit off the 405.  For some now live who remember it the way it really happened.  Like all terrible things, it started  with small-minded people who became great.  Victory was near.  But small things can also be good, and can work against evil,  like how a tiny cat hair can ruin an evil sandwich.  The great empire fell and fell some more.  And what was once evil melted away  and was replaced by the love of a Choo-choo.  Soon all discovered that there was more to life than vigilance.  All but one.  War journal entry number Uh, I mean, Dear Diary,  it's been two months since the fall of Doofenshmirtz,  but every morning I think I'm going to wake up back in the underground.  I feel restless. I need a challenge.  I need a mission. I can feel myself getting softer.  Doofenshmirtz is in jail and everyone is trying  to embrace their new freedom. I alone know better.  I can feel evil still out there, getting stronger while  I sit in my room, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Hey, guys! I think I stepped on a slug.  - A slug, really? - Wait a sec  What do you call those things that eat nuts and live in trees?  - A squirrel? - Yeah. It was definitely a slug.  Where's your other shoe?  I don't know. I must have dropped it.  Hey, what's all this about the other shoe dropping?  Buford stepped on a slug.  Okay, but be careful down there. Call me if there's any trouble.  So, how's the ""summer fun"" coming along, Dr. Baljeet?  Well, since the Phineas and Ferb from the first dimension  suggested we make the most of our summer,  Buford and I have been experimenting with fun,  - and so far - So far,  I'd rather be breaking rocks for the state.  But in all fairness, I do love breaking stuff.  What about you? How have you embraced your freedom?  Fortunately, we've had a little help,  thanks to the coolest pet ever.  Here, boy.

So, yes!  As they used to say, ""Have a ball!""  Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!  We're gonna use these goods and play a game of ""sports!""  Nine hundred ninety-nine  Good, you're home.  Monogram?

I was busy.  Doing pull-ups in your room and watching your brothers?  - I like doing pull-ups. - There's no reason you can't do that,  but you have to make room in your life for other things like fun and  - And Jeremy Johnson? - Something like that.  In the meantime, I'd like to introduce you to a little thing  - the kids are calling ""ice cream."" - ""I scream?""  What is that? Some kind of weird yelling game?  Nice hit, Dr. Baljeet.  I believe that makes the score six kadooms to twelve rempars.  Eleven, if Perry can find the ball.  Perry!  Come on, Ferb, we got to help him.  What the heck is that thing?  Ow! Ow!  Candace, you have to eat the ice-cream slowly.  - What is that? - Giant mechanical ants!  My brothers are in trouble.  On your feet, kid. It's go time.  - There's a flying one. - I got it.  Whoa!  On your right.  Oh, no! They got Perry.  Are you guys all right?  We're fine. But cyborg animals have captured Perry.  The robot ants must have been a diversion.  Monogram, we just got ambushed at the picnic.  This has Doofenshmirtz written all over it!  Well, that's impossible. He's right here in our detention facility.  I just played checkers with him.  He cheats by the way.  These giant ants didn't send themselves!  Ask him about the cyborg animal agents!  The what? Was one of them a panda  and the other one of those shaky rat dogs?  Yeah, yeah, where'd they come from?  Ah, well, I didn't want to say anything before, but we kind  of lost track of some of the agents when Doof took over.  How many did you lose?  Carl, hand me that roster. Let's see, including Agent P  - Twenty-six, sir. - Twenty-six!  Ferb, if we can access Perry's location chip,  maybe we can ambush those cyborgs and rescue Perry.  Yeah, no way!  You guys are staying here where it's safe.  Candace, we can handle this. Who was it that got  past the security grid to free you from Doof's tower?  Okay. But take the Firestorm Girls. It could get hairy.  And while you do that, I'll go find out who's behind all this.  Come on, Ferb.  Ah, Choo-choo, look! We have company!  All right, Doofenshmirtz, what do you know about  robotic picnic ants and a fist-full of cyborgs?  Ants at a picnic?  So it's a It's a rhetorical question, is it?  Don't play smart with me, villain.  You're behind the attack at the park. Now, spill it!  What? You're blaming me?  I've been locked up in here with Choo-choo.  Isn't that right, Choo-choo?  Yes, yes, it is, see. He'll provide an alibi.  Don't lie to me. There's Doof-tech scattered  - all over that park. - Well, it wasn't me.  There is, however, another Doofenshmirtz.  Vanessa! I knew it!  No, no, not Vanessa. She's just in high-school.  And she doesn't show any aptitude for evil.  As a parent, I'm really disappointed.  No, I'm talking about the other, other Doofenshmirtz.  Charlene! Bom-bom-bom!  And who is that?  Charlene Doofenshmirtz. She's my ex-wife.  I guess you guys have never met. That kind of  takes away the drama of the reveal. But it's her.  Pinky? You're alive!  Don't you remember me?  Apparently not.  We're gonna get you out of here, Perry.  We got Perry. Everybody fall back.  Now, this is as much fun as busting rocks for the state.  We've had Doofenshmirtz moved to this interrogation room  so Candace Flynn can question him thoroughly.  Are you sure he can't see you?  It's a one-way mirror. Here, watch this.  You know, I can see you.  Oh, maybe it's just that he can't hear us.  - I can hear you, too. - Huh! Maybe I just  don't know how this one-way mirror thing works.  Coming through.  Oh, okay! Now I'm embarrassed.  All right, knock it off, glamour boy!  I just haven't seen a mirror for two months.  Did my hair always look like this?  Just park your caboose in that chair.  Choo-choo is not a caboose.  - It's an engine. - Clam it, wise guy.  You know why I'm here and you better co-operate.  Because there are worse things than sitting  in a cold, dank prison cell with your little Choo-choo train.  - Like what? - Like sitting in a cold, dank  prison cell without your little Choo-choo train!  - You wouldn't. - Try me.  - All right. I'll talk! - Tell me about your ex-wife Charlene.  - What do you wanna know? - Where's her hideout?  Sheesh! She's got a penthouse uptown, you can't miss it.  It has Charlene written in bright lights  - across the top of it. - How do I get in?  You would have to pass through the identification scrutinizer.  Only a Doofenshmirtz can get through.  Lucky for us we got one of those.  Yeah. Oh! You mean me, right?  Dr. Baljeet, we're back and we have Perry.  That is great. And I think I figured out  how to get this giant ant going again.  - Great! So everything's going to plan? - Hey, kids!  Where do you keep the silverware?  What's he doing here?  At ease, he's still a prisoner.  I'm just using him to get into Charlene's penthouse.  - Wow, cool restraints. - Actually, he asked for this stuff.  The mask makes me sound all creepy.  Here, check this out. Fava beans.  - Fava - Okay that's enough!  Hey, where's Ferb?  - Oh, well, I'm sure he'd just - Fava beans  We don't have time to wait for him.  We got to get over to Charlene's.  Phineas, Perry, you're with me!  Fava beans  Charlene's no longer married to Doofenshmirtz penthouse   Now, you, do what you have to do to get us in.  Okay. Okay.  Ah!  Wow, the identity scrutinizer is really thorough.  You have no idea.  Come along, people.  Uh, Mom,  Tony Marzulo asked me out to the movies. Can I go?  Didn't your father banish him?  Yeah, but Dad banished every boy that asked me to the movies.  - Besides, Dad's no longer in power. - The day isn't over yet, dear.  - But, Mom - I don't know.  What do you think?  - There's your answer. - Uh, thanks?  Okay, fellas, there she is. Let's get her attention.  What the heck is going on in there?  We got you now, Charlene. Your evil days are over.  Oh, how sweet!  Do come in and thank you for returning my husband.  Husband? I thought you two were divorced.  It was all a ruse, honey.  Wait, you two are pretending to be divorced?  - Why would you do that? - Naive child, let me explain.  When a dictator gets deposed   - # And then he's thrown into the dark # - Oy vey!  His wife is thrown beside him under key and lock   So to avoid a situation with such limited appeal   Me and Mrs. Doofenshmirtz, we struck a little deal   We told everyone around us we had split   Yes, we were through   So if they came to haul me off they wouldn't get her too   There's that and there's also tax advantages, of course   All the convolutes reasons we pretend to be divorced   We get double the amount of discount coupons in the mail   We have twice the junk to offer in our annual yard sale   We each have our separate bathrooms,   Bedrooms, living rooms and dens   We see each other all the time but through a telescopic lens   We don't agree on restaurants or where to holiday   But now for those activities we go our selfish ways   We spend so little time together conversation's never forced   All the convoluted reasons we pretend to be divorced   Okay, I get it. You're still married.  But why would you send the ants to the picnic?  You had to know we'd come after you.  Of course. And I also knew  you would use Heinz to get in the building,  bringing my husband back to me and getting you here,  so I could get the drop on you.  - A lot of convoluted reasons there too. - We've got another song!  - No, no, no, we're good. - And now, children,  we have prepared a nice cozy prison cell for you.  All the animal agents!  Wait, you haven't seen my newest one.  You villain!  You turned my brother into a cyborg!  Ferb-borg, relieve Candace of her weapon.  Take them to the holding cell to await cyborg reprogramming.  Oh, it's so good to have a cyborg that can actually speak.  Well, I usually only say one line per day.  One line? Really? Why?  Seriously? That was it?  Ah, weird kid!  Well, hon, shall we re-take over the tri-state area now?  Actually, I don't really want to be an evil dictator anymore.  I've got everything I need right here.  My Choo-choo, my family, this lovely penthouse,  my freedom and  Choo-choo!  Backstory reforming. Evil returning!  I, uh I'm back, baby.  Ugh, I'm sorry I got you into this, Phineas.  - Oh, that's okay, Candace - But we're gonna have to be strong.  Jail is a mental game.  They're going to try to break us, you'll see.  Seconds become hours,  hours become years, until the mere thought of freedom  flutters out of our consciousness like a dying butterfly.  You're right, that did seem like forever.  Look, it's the Ferb-borg!  Get behind me, Phineas. I'll hold him off as long as I can.  Please, Candace, you're being dramatic.  What? Ferb? You're not a cyborg?  Sorry, we had to fool you like that, Candace.  But we needed you to be convincing.  - But why? - Ferb figured that if Doof and Charlene  thought they had the leader of the resistance  and the platyborg under lock and key,  they would devote all their attention to the frontal attack.  That way we could come up from behind and  - Wait, what frontal attack? - That one.  That is not how to make it climb, Buford.  Oh, you want to climb the building?  Hey, looks like someone's coming late to the party.  That's okay, dear. I've got a little present for our unwelcome guest.  Wow, you know, Charlene, you're really on top of things here.  Tomorrow I'm taking you shopping for a new evil pant suit.  All right, everybody. Go! Go! Go! Go!  - So much for our ride home. - Wow, nice shot!  Attention all animal cyborgs.  Attend to our guests.  All we have to do is get these magnetic  deprogramming chips near the cyborgs' frontal lobes  - and they will no longer be evil. - How do we do that?  Look, we sewed them into these little hats.  Aw, that's so cute!  Everyone grab a hat. We've got cyborgs to reprogram.  Now finish him off.  Ah!  Give it up, Charlene.  Seems to me you're still outnumbered.  Seriously, how did he ever run this place without me?  All right, fan out.  Pinky, I just wanna  Okay, so you're not a hat guy. Take it easy.  Pinky!  Good to have you back.  Surrender or there'll be big trouble.  Oh, I think I'll go with that second thing you mentioned.  End of the line, kid.  What a shame! I'll make you an offer.  I could get rid of you right now or you could join me.  You could be the leader of my cyborg army.  Actually it looks like your cyborg army may have  - changed their minds. - Wait, what are you talking about?  No! My manicure!  Whoa!  It's all over, Charlene.  Now, surrender.  Ha! A Doofenshmirtz never surrenders.  We fight until the last man.  Hey, wait a minute! I'm the last man!  - Don't I get a say in this? - Oh, come on, honey. It'll be fun.  All right, hold it. Everybody just stop.  Excuse me.  Can I talk to my parents?  Listen, Mom, Dad, come here.  You guys, I'm only gonna say this once.  Run!  - Mom, Dad, this is Tony Marzulo. - Hey, Mr. and Mrs. D.  Hey, didn't I banish you?  Yeah, honey, you did, but nobody saw it.  Academy graduates, Doofenshmirtz is still out there  and no doubt he's planning a comeback.  But so are we.  We now have you, the animal agents of ALKA,  who will, without a doubt, prevail.  So as I step down from my position as head of the resistance,  I congratulate you all and wish you luck.  Whoa, wait! You're stepping down?  It's okay, Major. You've got your animal agents back.  - I think you can handle it. - But  Don't worry. If you ever get in a pinch, you  know where to find me. Now if you'll excuse me,  there's something I've been putting off that I need to take care of.  - Where is she going? - Unless I miss my guess,  I'd say she's making room in her life for other things.  Fifteen.  Sixteen. Seventeen.  - Eighteen. Hey! - Hey, yourself.   We told everyone around us we had split   Yes, we were through   So if they came to haul me off they wouldn't get her too   There's that and there's also tax advantages, of course   All the convolutes reasons we pretend to be divorced   We get double the amount of discount coupons in the mail   We have twice the junk to offer in our annual yard sale   We each have our separate bathrooms,   Bedrooms, living rooms and dens   We see each other all the time but through a telescopic lens"
"1 There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation   and school comes along just to end it   So the annual problem for our generation   is finding a good way to spend it   Like maybe   Building a rocket, or fighting a mummy   or climbing up the Eiffel Tower   Discovering something that doesn't exist   Hey!  Or giving a monkey a shower   Surfing tidal waves   Creating nano-bots or locating Frankenstein's brain   It's over here!  Finding a dodo bird Painting a continent   Or driving our sister insane   Phineas!  As you can see, there's a whole lot of stuff to do   before school starts this fall   Come on, Perry.  So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   So stick with us, 'cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!   Mom, Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!   - Hey, I'm Dan. - And I'm Swampy.  We're the co-creators of Phineas and Ferb.  - The show that you're probably  watching right now.  - Hopefully.  We get letters from kids all over the world asking us questions  - about the show, that we - No, that's, that's not actually true.  We don't get a lot of actual physical ""written on paper"" letters.  - What we get is a lot of emails - No, no, that's true.  - Digital, electronic. - Yeah, actually all of the emails  we've ever received fit on this flash drive right here.  But that's not as impressive as  No, this stack of, of letters here is much more impressive.  This is a prop, though, made mostly of, uh,  - foam, fiberglass, that kind of thing. - Yeah.  Not to say that we don't actually get letters from people,  physical letters, uh, like, uh, this one is for,  for instance, from, from Becky. This is a question we get all the time.  ""Are we ever going to see Perry the Platypus get a girlfriend?""  BOTH: No.  - No, not gonna happen. - No.  Here's another one. This one is from, uh, Donny.  It says, ""Are we ever going to see Phineas and Ferb as teenagers?""  - Yes.

Huh.  I haven't seen much of her this summer.  Why do parents buy such weird food?  Everything's light, low, non, free or diet.  - So she's leaving? - Yes.  Huh, I always thought the two of you would end up together.  I wish! I am so in the friend zone there.  BALJEET: You are kidding, right?  You do know she had a giant crush on you for ages?  - Uh, no? - Oh, come on, it was so obvious.  She came over to your house every day for 11 years  just to see what you were doing.  When she looked at you, her pupils actually formed little hearts.  Like, I do not know how that is physically possible.  She changed her eyeballs!  Wha I don't believe it. Ferb?  [CRUNCHING.] Mmm.  Uh, why didn't you guys ever tell me?  We are guys. We do not talk about feelings.  Did you see the new car Irving got?  - Can we eat yet?

It isn't evil.  It isn't even the Inator.  The Inator is this gold chain.  Once it's charged, I'm going to put it around my neck  and it will activate the insecurity parts of my brain  and trigger a full-blown midlife crisis.  Allow me to explain in song.  [PLAYING FOLKSY TUNE.]  All my friends have spray-on tans   And they get back together with their old rock bands    Guess their bland old lives are now filled with spices   They are having a midlife crisis   They're all getting sports cars and new toupees   They are borrowing against their IRAs   I've always had more than my share of vices   But I never had a midlife crisis   I'm sick and tired of being out of the game   Everyone's so discontent I wish I felt the same   It's not like my life has been a total delight   But something must be wrong 'cause I feel all right   Kazoo solo!  [PLAYING SOLO ON KAZOO.]  But now with my Inator I can be the same   My crisis will put all other crises to shame   I'm telling you now that it's gonna be twice   As good as any big gut suckin'   Sports car buyin' self-deludin'   Comb-over tryin' skinny jean wearin'   Wrinkle denyin' bucket listin'   Gray hair dyein' existential mid-life crisis   [CRASHING.] [GRUNTING.]  So just let me get this thing charged up and we'll be on our way.  [ZAPPING.]  Ready?  [ZAPPING.]  [PADDLES CHARGING.]  [GRUNTS.] Oh, wow! I feel pretty energized!  I want to do something exciting and fun, and also incredibly stupid!  Come on, Perry the Platypus, let's go have an adventure.  [MEXICAN TUNE.]  Ginger, are you texting Baljeet again?  Yeah, we're at odds deciding what movie to see later.  He wants to go to the one about that planet  - and I want to see the one with that guy. - Well, don't fight about it.  - Manipulate the situation! - Manipthewha?  [SIGHS.] Okay, ladies, listen up.  Pretend you don't care about your movie, but then hint that  it's playing at the theater next to the froyo place he likes.  The seed is planted, and he'll think it's his idea to go there.  Hi, guys! Food's up!  Aw!

Thanks.  - The restaurant is that way! - Thanks again.  GINGER: Isn't this fun? It's like when we were kids.  Building stuff in Phineas and Ferb's backyard!  We'll build the perfect dinner date for Isabella and Phineas.  Their favorite food, music  And when we get them to come back here and see it and each other,  they're bound to fall madly in love  like they were always meant to be! [CHUCKLES.]  You know, you can't force these things.  Oh, come on, we're girls! It's what we do.  When they first walk in, we'll play  the songs I put on this playlist. They're all about love  and it will trigger them to start thinking about love.  Then we have these streamers and balloons  in both of their favorite colors,  which will stimulate the romantic centers of their brains,  - making them think about love. - What if it doesn't?  Well, then, we have this sign.  Sure you don't have anything else that's more ridiculous or irresponsible?  - Nope. This is as dumb as they come. - All right!  Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!  [CRASHING.]  So, what else you got?  We've got another one just like it, but in yellow.  [GASPS.] You hear that?  It'll be like driving a really fast Ducky Momo!  Oh, yeah, it's the perfect romantic setting out there.  It will be like love kicked them both in the face.  Buford, the table looks great, but there is one thing  - that would make it perfect. - BUFORD: No! No way!  I'm not putting that stupid cupid outfit on again.  But it worked so well for me and Mishti!  [SARCASTICALLY.] Oh, Mishti, Mishti, Mishti.  Let it go, Ging.  I think the turbo kicks in when it revs abo Whoa!  [CRASHING.]  Oh, oh! Uh, it's okay. We're fine.  But we do seem to have picked up a passenger.  I'll shake it loose up here at the turn.  Now, drive safely, sweetheart. And call me when you get to school.  Okay, Mom. [SNIFFLING.]  I'm very proud of you and will miss you so much!  - I'll miss you too, Mom. - Oh!

But where's Perry?  Oh, good, Agent P, you're here.  You're probably wondering about all these pulley things here.  It's just that with Carl heading to school soon,  I'm gonna have to learn to run this place all by myself.  Anyway, with the seasons about to change, I suspect  Doofenshmirtz will be trying to close out the summer with a bang.  Oh, great, googly-moogly! Carl!  Oh, that's right.

Now, you just made it weird. - Anyway, we've gotta  make sure we've outdone ourselves on this one.  And there's only one way to do it.  You're right, Buford. Let's ride it.  Actually, I was gonna say focus group testing.  But ""ride it"" works, too.  Pa, pa, pa, pa   Pa, pa, pa, pa   Yeah!  You know we're going nowhere fast   And we got no destination   Nothing scheduled We got no chores to do   The sun is up, the wind is warm   And we're clear of all obligation   We're taking the scenic route   Just enjoy the view   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Pa, pa, pa, pa   There's no one that I'd rather go   Nowhere with than you   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Pa, pa, pa, pa   There's no one that I'd rather go   Nowhere with than you   We don't need a compass   We don't need a guiding star   We don't need a GPS   To tell us where we are   'Cause we know where we are   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Pa, pa, pa, pa   There's no one that I'd rather go   Nowhere with than you   Ooh, ooh, ooh  Pa, pa, pa, pa   There's no one that I'd rather go   Nowhere with than you   Aha!

I'm way too busy.  Don't you have stuff of your own to do before school starts?  - Yeah! Bust the boys! - Candace?  I guess I could return Vanessa's DVDs.  There you go, hon. They're not gonna return themselves.  They never do.  Ah, Perry the Platypus, snared in my traps!  Ha! Drum pun! I realized that all this time  I was planning to become ruler of the Tri-State Area,  never took into account the fact there is no actual position.  I should have spent my time creating one.  And if I create it, no one will know about it.  I will run unoppo Oh! That was close.  Then I'll easily win and take over the Tri-State Area.  With that in mind, beho  Behold the Tri-Govern-inator!  Wow, an actual drumroll.  Please. So over it.  Hi, Vanessa. Just came back to return your DVDs.  Sorry I had them so long. Can't say I understand French cinema.  I mean, why does that mime keep letting go of balloons?  I think it's symbolic.  Well, anyway, how's it going?  - I've been better. - Me, too.  You wouldn't believe the day I'm having so far.  I mean, really, like, I could go on. Like, I could tell you all about it.  - I mean, there's a lot that happened and - You wanna come in?  - Oh, wow, yeah. That'd be great. - I could use some downloading, too.  - I'll go make us some tea. BRB. - Awesome.  Oh, hi, Vanessa's dad, how's it going?  Have you seen my nemesis?  He was just here a second ago. He's about yay high and  You know what? No matter.  When the guy who's punching you,  suddenly loses interest mid-punch,  it's time to take serious stock of your life.  I can totally relate. Like, from the beginning of  today, it was pretty bad. Like, I'm all off.  - Uh-huh. - And you know every day of the summer,  I've been trying to bust my brothers  - and it's just not happening. - Uh-huh.  Do you know how frustrating it is  to have a single, unrealized focus in your life?  Well, that's just crazy. Gotta be some kind of teenage thing.  Same old, same old. Yada, yada, yada.  - That's been my day so far. - Don't sit on that!  And stop fussing with all of my inators!  Inators? Why what does this one do?  - Ah, that is my Do-Over-Inator. - What's a Do-Over-Inator?  Really? It says ""do over"" right in the name. It It does the day over again.  But I haven't worked out all the kinks yet.  Matter of fact, I gotta work out the kinks in a lot of these.  A Do-Over-Inator?  I know what we're gonna do today!  I know what  I know what we're gonna do today!  And I know what I'm gonna do today.  Bust you guys once and for all! Do your worst, or  You know, just make it big and bustable so I can show Mom.  Wow, that was awfully supportive.  Talk about dÃ©ja  You there, boy, what day is it?  Why, the last day of summer, of course.  Yes! Vanessa's dad's machine.  It worked! Which means yesterday is today.  Another chance to bust the booooys!  I didn't need to repeat this part!  Har-de-har-har.  Looks like the zoo's got a new tiger habitat.  - Good morning, Candace. - Mmm-hmm.  And so begins the last day of summer, again.  Which means back to school errands for me  and making the most of the day for you.  - Hey! - Hey! This is amazing!  Today is exactly the same as yesterday. It's repeating!  Very existential, darling.  You're getting philosophical as you get older.  - And bustisophical! - That's not even a word.  It is now. I made it up!  Didn't I disintegrate you?  - Wakey, wakey, chocolate cakey! - Really? Again? I  Didn't I tell you cake isn't for breakfast yesterday?  Hmm. I gotta check on something.  - Hey, Dad? - Hmm, repeating.  - You hava a minute? - Mhm.  - We really need to - Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.  - Dad! - Yeah. Yeah, everything is repeating.  That bang on my head.  The The thing with Norm and the stupid cake.  And And you. It It works.  My Do-Over-Inator must work.  Your little friend must have activated it yesterday. By yesterday  I mean today. Later today, your little friend will activate  and the days would probably keep repeating until I shut it off.  This is what I'm talking about! You're not even listening.  I'm moving out, Dad. I'm going to live at Mom's, full-time.  Door slams mean sadness.  Wait, what did she say?  I'm going to live at Mom's, full-time.  I can't believe it!  You surreptitiously record us?  And even more importantly, I'm losing my little girl!  Why would Vanessa want to move out?   Let's see if we can solve that little mystery.  Hey, Vanessa, hand me that cadaver.  Or  Honey bun, if you go into the living room  and see a pile of skin flakes, just ignore it.  - Okay. - Or.  I know you said the time machine in the bathroom was a bad  idea, but if you need to go, you should do it last week.  Okay, okay. I get it.  I get it. My daughter's moving out because she thinks I'm a loser.  - I like pancakes. - But, you know who isn't a loser?  The Tri-Governor! I just need to win that office  and Vanessa will want to stay with me!  And this little baby's gonna help me get it right.  They say you only go around once   They say that opportunity   It never knocks twice   But if there's one thing I can say   About the people who say that   They don't have this cool device   They don't have this cool device   I never even heard of dÃ©ja vu this bad   But everything today is so familiar   Like the best recurring dream I ever had   Like when you know what's gonna happen   But it's still gonna fool ya   If it keeps repeating, I should do something about it   I don't know the repercussions if I just let it run   If you told me there'd be consequences I wouldn't doubt it   But it's tempting just to let it go   And use it for fun   Use it for fun   I can get it right   Because today I have multiple chances   With just a little foresight   My means will justify my ends   My worries will be over soon   I'll rework my fate   Improve my circumstances   If I get it wrong this afternoon   I'll get it right today   When tomorrow is this morning again   If I get it wrong this afternoon   I'll get it right today   When tomorrow is this morning again   If I get it wrong this afternoon   I'll get it right today   When tomorrow is this morning again Yeah.   - There it is! But where's Perry? - Good, good, good, good, good, good,  good, good, good, good, perfect!  You guys built your sky-high mega-ride thingy.  I just wanted to double-check.  And this time, I'm not gonna call Mom.  - I'm gonna go get her. Ciao! - Bye, Candace. Sky-high, huh?  I think you're right, Buford. We can make this better.  And Candace has just given me a great idea how to do it.  Perry the Platypus should be coming in about three, two, one.  And drumroll. Missed me!  And skull! It worked! It worked!  And finally I get some use out of these old  Halloween decorations. I'm a master of ti  Oh, this really bites.  No, no, wait. Not my inator!  That's okay, Perry the Platypus.  I'll be the master of time tomorrow.  Ta-da! Huh?  - But But But - Look, Candace.  Most days I would humor you but not today. I'm way too busy.  I know, you're way too busy getting us ready for school.  So I'll just take care of the stuff I have to do  - before tomorrow. - Couldn't have said it better myself.  Well, no one can say I didn't try, twice.  Oh, it's a shame Candace missed out on the fun.  She did give us the cool idea to levitate it, after all.  I know what we're gonna do today!  I know what  I know what we're gonna do today!  No way!  You there, boy, what day is it, again?  Why, the last day of summer, of course.  Yes! The days are repeating!  Which means I still have a chance to  Oh, no. I'm not falling for that one again.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  But fool me three times and  Why do I even have three skates?  - Ooh. - There's tigers at the zoo. Rawr.  - And so we begin another day. - Yes, and you've got  errands to run 'cause they're not gonna run themselves.  They never do, never do. Better get a move on if  you're gonna be back in an hour and 27 minutes. Bye!  Ah! Ah!  - Wakey, wakey - Stuff it, Norm.  Dad, do you have a minute?  - It's really imp - Hush. I know.  Dad, I  I know exactly what you're going to say and I'm on it.  But right now, I need to study Perry the Platypus' every move.  Dad, this is the problem!  - Because of your stupid work - Hold that thought, sweetie.  I've really gotta go and improve Perry the Platypus' trap. BRB!  That's, uh, that's ""be right back.""  It's hip today to talk in acronyms.  I can see by the confused and somewhat annoyed look on your face  that your little mammal brain is working overtime  trying to figure out how I anticipated your every move.  Not to mention, the purpose of this hamster ball.  Well, simple. See, this protects me from when  you eventually escape from that. Like, like that.  But you can't punch, kick, or otherwise bruise me  because I'm safe inside of the  - It's muffin time, sir. - Later!  Maybe I'll get lucky and time will loop before I  No such luck.  I know what we're gonna do  - Alarm.

You know, like  Oh, do you know the muffin man   That lives on Drury Lane   Drury Lane, why would anyone buy a house on Drury Lane?  It just sounds so It sounds dreary.  Even though it's not actually dreary, it's Drury.  Though entertaining, your muffin song did not  - stir my memory bank, sir. - Mmm, that's peculiar.  I suppose it could be some type of anomaly  caused by messing with the space-time continuum.  Might even be dangerous.  Ah, I have to ignore that at my peril because now that  I've gotten a full 30 steps ahead of Perry the Platypus,  I'm free to take over the Tri-State Ar  Vanessa, where are you going? Don't you wanna talk?  Actually, I really do, but you seem busy.  Aw, honey, that's very perceptive of you.  Yes! Let's just put a pin in this.  I'm kind of racing against the clock here.  I know it seems like I'm putting you second,  but it's only so I can put you first eventually.  - Whatever, Dad. - Vanessa Oh, you'll see.  This is going to be my moment to take over the Tri-State Area.  And then that I'll prove to you  I'm not as big a loser as you think I am.  Okay, no pressure.  Tri-State Governor's mansion, here I come!  Sweet! Now, I've just gotta get someone to vote for me.  Anyone, actually, 'cause I'm running unopposed.  Voting today!  I didn't know there were elections today.  Oh, get in the booth and do your civic duty.  I am so gonna get it right today!  I can feel it in my Um, ever hear of a spoon?  Spoon? Hmm, no. Can't say I have.  Hey, I hear there's a new tiger habitat, darling.  Tiger?  That's a funny-sounding word.  Oh, these teenagers and their slang. I'd better go run my errands.  They're not gonna run themselves.  Mom, what happened to your Capri pants?  Capri pants? Now, I think you're just messing with us.  No spoons, no tigers, no Capris?  Uh-oh, something's really going wrong!  Vanessa? Vanessa! I need to talk to you about your,  you know, wanting to move out.  - Wait, you know about that? How - Honey, just watch.  Apparently, for the first time in Tri-State history,  a Tri-Governor has been elected.  And the voters have chosen  My brother, Heinz Doofenshmirtz?  Yes! See, Vanessa, I'm not a loser anymore!  Now, you'll want to live with me  at the Tri-Governor's mansion, right? Right?  - Dad, it's not the - Oh, wait, wait. Hold that thought sweetie.  As long as my Do-Over-Inator is on,  this day could start all over again.  I could lose it all.  So So, you know, go ahead and start packing your stuff,  I'm just gonna run over and turn off my inator.  We We're moving on up, kiddo!  Hey!  Well, uh, I didn't see that coming.  But it's gone so I guess that's the end of the looping.  And now, everything's gonna be hunky-dory  'cause I'm in charge, baby.  Guys, guys, I really need your help!  There's this really weird thing that's happening.  Days keep repeating because of a machine thingy  that Vanessa's dad made. And there's this wagon.  And now, things are disappearing.  - Like tigers and spoons and - What's a spoon?  - What's a tiger? - See, that's my point, stuff's disappearing!  And once it goes, nobody remembers it  ever existed.  Mom!  It took them! Like the spoons!  Mom, Phineas and Ferb are gone!  I'm sure it's going to be all right, dear.  But, who are Phineas and Ferb?  How can you not know who Phineas and Ferb are?   Let me guess, they're your new favorite boy band?  No, Mom! You see, later on today,  which is kind of like last month to me,  Vanessa's dad invents this thing which he says doesn't  work, but actually, it does because, well, here I am.  But it also doesn't work because they're not here.  So, even though every day repeats,  not everyone or everything repeats  because you don't even know what Capri pants are!  Capri pants, is that a boy band?  They're  Check out your First Daughter suite!  - Not too keen to move out now, are ya? - Yeah. Very, very nice, Dad.  - But, listen, I have something I need - Pardon me, sir.  I hate to interrupt, but your schedule is jam-packed today.  Sorry, sweetie, but, apparently, there's a lot of stuff I have to attend to.  Look on the bright side, you can brag about your dad  to all your friends until I get back.  This is so weird. It's Danville, but it's not.  Oh, my gosh! Ferb, spoons! Now I totally remember  how we forgot about them when they disappeared.  Which means we must have disappeared.  Orange, you glad we have something eat?  You're right, you're right. We gotta figure out a way out of here.  - I hope whatever that is likes oranges. - Or at least orange-related puns.  But I'm telling you, the sun's rays will make you crazy.  - I'm not gonna buy your hat, Buford. - Great, you're all together.  Look, I need you guys to help me find my brothers.  - And you are? - She's my neighbor from across the street.  - But I thought were an only child. - No, no.  I have two little brothers, and all of you are best friends.  But then Vanessa's dad built this machine,  and now the days are repeating, and things like spoons  and little boys like my brothers are starting to disappear.  And the worst thing is nobody remembers them!  You should stay out of the sun.  Doofenshmirtz Tri-Governor's mansion!   Okay, Doofy boy, time to Govern-inate.  Right on time, Perry the Platypus! This concerns you.   I have just made it illegal to thwart the Tri-Governor  of the Tri-State Area. Which, ipso facto, is me.  Go ahead, read it. It's all perfectly legal.  Looks like your thwarting days are over, Perry the Platypus.  You know, I really miss our good old thwarting days already.  In fact, your presence here is making me far  too sad and nostalgic, so maybe you better go.  Just leave the way you came in. I'll bill you for the carpet.  No, no, don't give me the puppy  dog eyes, you're gonna make me cry. Sheesh.  Pardon me, Mr. Tri-Governor. The Mayor is on the line.  Put him through. Hello, Roger!  Heinz, did you steal my secretary?  Yes. Yes, I did.  What makes you think you can do a thing like that?  Well, it's easy. Because, I'm the boss of you. Nyah!  Ah, this has already been a very productive day.  What's all this?  More legislation that requires your signature, sir.  But I hate homework! I'd rather just play with this snow globe!  Ooh! What? Oh, man, this is serious!  I, I thought for sure my machine would have turned  itself off when it disappeared, but it's still  creating rifts in the space-time continuum.  Melanie, bring me another snow globe.  Um, what's a snow globe?  Wow, this stuff is pretty random.  I hope no one at home is planning to baste a turkey  while wearing suspenders and Capri pants!  You're right, Mr. Keene is having a very bad day.  And so are we!  Run, Ferb! It's raining snow globes!  And the tigers, they are also a reason to run!  No, I really do have two brothers,  and you guys are really best friends.  - I can't believe you don't remember! - That's impossible! Right, Baljeet?  Huh? Uh, sorr, I am too preoccupied with today's  wild fluctuations in the space-time continuum.  With pressure readings like this,  I could potentially get sucked into a rift,  and then none of you would remember I ever existed.  Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?  Sorry Agent P, I've received confirmation that Doof's  anti-thwarting legislation is completely legal and official.  So I guess we're the bad guys now. And I guess this  means you're on hiatus, at least till his term is over.  Monogram out.  Perry? What are you doing here?  Problems with my dad, too?  Welcome to the club.  I've been trying all day to tell him that I've  been accepted by OWCA's internship program.  But that I can't join if I'm living with OWCA's  public enemy number one. Okay, number three.  Well, I'm just gonna have to tell him  and try to convince him to see things my way.  Thanks for the chat, Perry! Wish me luck.  And at the destabilization point, the vortex collapses in  on itself and it becomes an actual ""hole"" in space-time,  sucking the nearest person or object into it,  - and they are lost in the void. - Oh, please stop talking!  Okay, tigers aren't much more than big house cats, right?  So what've we got that'll distract cats?  We don't have a ball of yarn,  but we do have a big bouncy ball of Capri pants.  That'll hold 'em for a while.  Come on, Ferb! We gotta figure out a way back home.  Sweetie-pie, I'm back! Sorry, it took me so long.  Who would've thought being Tri-Governor would be so involved?  Dad, I got an internship at OWCA's, so I have to move out.  What? But that's the opposite of what I  They're the good guys! I thought for sure now  that I was Tri-State Governor that we'd be okay.  Dad, you're totally missing the point.  You spend all of your time working on your ridiculous inators,  - and I can't - Oh, well, first of all, they're not ridiculous.  Convoluted and ultimately pointless, maybe.  Oh, come on, Dad, you build them just to exact  petty revenge, trying to prove you're evil.  - What? I'm evil. I am evil! - No, Dad.  You're basically a nice guy who's pretending to be evil.  And, you know, it seems like it's all out of obligation to your  backstories, not something that truly comes from your heart.  Wow. So, it's, it's  it's really not about the success-loser thing?  Dad, look, this OWCA internship is something I really wanna do.  And I don't think this lifestyle choice is making you happy either.  - Is it? - Wow again.  Look, all I'm saying is try something different.  - Like a, like a new inator? - No, like try to be a good guy.  A good guy? Me? I could be Well, I guess I could.  I could, I could be a do-gooder, doing good  just for the sake of doing good, or  - What exactly do good guys do? - Well, they  Ah, it doesn't matter. Anyway, I get it. I understand now.  There's just one thing I gotta do before the whole day starts all o  Oh, man, I gotta start all over again!  Oh, man! I looped too soon and I didn't have time to be good.  Wakey-wakey!  - Norm, stuff your cake! - Stuffing it, sir.  - Hey, Dad. Do you have a minute? - Vanessa!  Yes, yes, I know, you, you'd like to move in  with your mother, and you want to intern at OWCA,  - and my being evil creates a conflict. - Um, yeah. How did you know  Let's just leave it at I know and I vow to be good from now on.  - So your worries are over. - Wow, you're kind of freaking me out.  Yes, yes, I'd be obnoxious if I wasn't so charming.  Anyway, I have one more inator to complete,  and I've got to do it fast, so I could really use your help.  - What's the inator? - The Time-Straighten-Out-Inator.  It straightens out time and keeps it from looping.  - I think I'm looping. - Exactly.  I am coming.  Morning, Baljeet! Got to get an early start today.  You kids chat, I'll get the thingy.  - Um, who is that girl in the bathrobe? - I was so asleep.  - She made us come over here. - Yes, but who is she?  Got it! Here, Doctor Genius Boy.  Take this and check out the space-time continuum.  I do not know what that will prove.  The space-time continuum is a remarkably stable, and  - Oh, my goodness! - Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you could  disappear forever, and so could every memory of your existence.  So, here's the part you need to pay attention to.  - Are you listening? - I am totally listening!  - I am so not listening. - Me neither.  I have two brothers, and you guys are all best friends.  But now they're gone and nobody remembers them  because of the space-time continuum thingy.  Now, this is the part of the conversation  when you tell me how you're gonna get my brothers back.  Well, they must have disappeared through a temporal rift.  If we could calculate the location of the next rift,  we could just throw in a rope with a life preserver  tied to the end of it and pull them out.  Oh, really? A little donut-shaped pool toy  is gonna save the universe?  You had me at donuts, lost me with everything else.  So what you're saying is the days are repeating  and you're the only one that notices.  Well, maybe that little friend of yours, too,  'cause she was inside the bubble.  - What? - Not important. Check it out.  Perry the Platypus should be coming in three, two, one.  Perry!   Perry the Platypus!  That's right. Take it in, Perry the Platypus. No traps.  And no, telling you that there are no traps is not  part of a trap, though that would have been genius.  Oh, I missed that one! I'm actually not doing any evil today.  Seriously! I promise!  So, what do you say? How about lending an old nemesis a hand,  huh, Perry the Platypus?  Your eyes say no, but your hands say yes.  Isabella, what is the resonance reading on the top meter?  - 42.16! - Candace, what is the cosine of 84.7?  Let's see. 17.  Buford, did the light just change from green to red?  - Why should I tell you? - Okay.  Right there!  In fifteen seconds, that is the point of maximum disturbance.  So it should be appearing right over there!  Wow! Crazy how it sucked  - up that groundhog, huh? - The what?  If things from Danville pass into this dimension  when a rift opens, maybe the door swings both ways.  If we can calculate the rift openings,  then we can get back to our Danville.  Heads up, Ferb! Incoming!  Huh. Groundhogs.  I hope that doesn't mean six more weeks of Nulville.  - Ahhh! - Talk to me, Baljeet!  By my new calculations, the next rift should appear right over there.  Quick! Throw the life preserver.  Phineas! Ferb!  If you can hear me, grab the life preserver and we'll pull you back.  - What's a life preserver? - I have no idea.  You guys are just gonna have to trust me on this  Whoa!  Who'd have thought we'd be such a good team?  My daughter, my nemesis and my hot beverage.  Mmm, counter-clockwise on that jib bolt, Perry the Platypus.  Okay, stop. Perfect. It's done.  The days won't loop anymore, and I'll have my daughter back!  My life will be on a new path and the world will be saved.  Thanks to brand-new good guy, Heinz Doofen  Oh, shmirtz! I was so close!  - Wakey, wakey - Eat it yourself, Norm!  I gotta get Vanessa, and we gotta do everything faster.  Hi, guys! So good to see you.  Phineas!  Hey, Phineas.  Spoon!  - Oh, how I have missed spoons! - Orange.  Nah, not really getting a big rush of emotions over this.  - And here are the Capri pants. - How can you tell they're Capri pants?  Maybe they're just regular pants for someone with shorter legs.  - The important thing is - Hey!  My brothers are here and they're safe!  I'm so glad that you guys are all right.  Thanks, Candace. It's great to see you, too.  Wow, I guess now that we're gone, too,  Mom and Dad don't even remember having children.  Their lives must be so dull and empty.  Walk the Platypus walk   Everything here is so gray and lifeless.  This place must exist outside the flow of time.  Candace, you were the only one of us outside the loop.  Were the looping intervals decreasing in chronological amplitude?  No, they were, um Wait, what does that mean exactly?  Were the days getting shorter?  Yes, the days kept getting shorter and shorter.  The time pocket is dissolving!  And where does that rate on the good-bad scale?  Buford! When the time pocket ceases to exist, so will we!  See what I mean? One woman's Capri pants is another's  What'd I miss?  - Vanessa - Dad, I have to talk to you  - Help me build my inator. Hurry! Quick! - What are we doing?  Building a Time-Straighten-Out-inator!  Dad, we really need to talk.  There you are! Perry the Platypus, grab a screwdriver and help us.  Perry!   Okay, this paper towel represents the space-time continuum.  Normally it moves in a straight line. But something has disrupted the flow.  Now time cannot move forward and it puts enormous  strain on the fabric of time and tears the fabric.  So now there is a little less space-time fabric to work with.  The days are getting shorter.  Now, you take this shortened piece of space-time and loop it again.  Do this enough times and pretty soon you do not have anything left.  What I cannot seem to figure out is what could have possibly  caused this space-time disruption in the first place.  And an even bigger conundrum  is how Candace is standing outside of the space-time  interruption and somehow knew about its effects.  Yeah, that's a puzzler.  But you know that old saying,  ""Never question the source of a temporal time-space loop thingy.""  - Really? - Yeah, I've heard that.  Well, we have to build something to close the hole and stop the looping.  But it will require Einsteinium, tungsten wire  - and micro-crystal plasma resistors. - Well, stuff keeps getting sucked into this place.  Maybe we can find a hi-tech machine, or some lab equipment  - that uses all that stuff. - What about this machine right here?  Wow, strange that we didn't notice that.  Einsteinium, tungsten wire, plasma resistors.  Wow. This is awesome!  Don't touch that thing! That's the machine that started all of this.  So, uh, yeah, you gotta be careful with that thing.  - And you know this how? - When I was at Vanessa's,  I may have accidentally, intentionally, pushed the button.  Okay, I was having a rotten day, one crummy thing after another kept happening,  and when he told me that this thing can make the day start over again,  I just couldn't help myself! And then the days just keep looping.  And I know I should have said something sooner,  but I kept coming so close to busting you guys!  And I swear I had no idea it would do any of this.  I thought I'd get one do-over and that would be that.  But then I saw that it was creating problems and  making things disappear, and making people forget,  but by the time I tried to stop it, it was too late and I lost you guys.  - And I don't know how to fix it. - Well, if this thing is the problem,  maybe we should press this big self-destruct button.  No! If time stops looping there will be no big tears  in the fabric of space-time and no way for us to get home.  We must find a way to get ourselves and that machine  through one of the rifts and back into Danville.  Then we can push the button and blow up the machine.  - I call pressing the button. - Come on, gang!  - We know what we have to do today. - Yeah. Run!  When you're running out of time   It's hard to know how fast you're going   You could be a minute or an hour late   There's just no way of knowing   And when I say we're running out of time   I don't mean time is depleted, no   No, we're not running late   We're just physically outside of the flow   Why do we need chronological time   We gotta get back in time   We gotta get back in time   We've gotta get back in time   We gotta get back in time   Gotta, gotta get back   Gotta, gotta get back in time   Gotta, gotta get back in time, yeah   I mean we have to get back into the flow of time   But also that we have to do it fast   Because we're running out of time   But not the way I said that   Earlier   Well, it's not pretty, but we did it.  I dub thee, ""The Buford van Stomm Time Catapult.""  I won the naming rights, fair and square.  Come on, guys! No time to lose!  - How's it lookin', Baljeet? - It looks like the next anomaly  will appear any second now. I am working on the exact  coordinates, but there is significant interference.  It looks like there may be multiple rifts coming.  As long as we can hit one of them.  Stand by your hand cranks, people.  Here they come!  It's cars! Baljeet, what are those coordinates?  Got them! 34 degrees, 10 minutes, 15 seconds North.  15 minutes, 0 seconds West.  Launch now!  - Where's the tear? Where's the tear? - Any second!  How ya doin' back there, Perry the Platypus?  Takes care of that.  Let's plug this baby in and get her going!  - Are you sure it'll work? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.  There's a guaranteed 55 percent chance of success,  so we're, we're good to go.  Wait, so there's still a 45 percent chance that it won't do anything?  Of course not! It's not gonna do nothing.  There's also a 45 percent chance it'll destroy everything in existence.  What? Dad, you have to tell us things like this!  - Is everyone okay? - Aw, my muffins got smashed.  Come on, no time to lose! Literally!  Okay, Baljeet, just to confirm, destroying the machine  will put the space-time continuum back to normal?  Yes, and we need to do it quickly.  The time loops are accelerating exponentially and  Oh, we're starting here now. Hey, it has been  brought to my attention that I should tell you guys,  there's a 55 percent chance this will work,  but a 45 percent chance that it'll destroy reality as we know it.  - What? - Absolute worst-case scenario.  - Okay, what happens if we don't push it? - If we do nothing  there's a 100 percent chance that the time pocket will dissolve  and it will destroy every You know there's a whole illustration  I can do with a paper towel and a hook, but I don't have time.  Okay, we have to take a moment and think about the  Oh, man! That was quick.  The days must be compressing to this exact point!  No time to lose! Move, move, move.  Hurry, guys!  Okay, here's the odds. Save the day, 55 percent.  Destroy the universe as we know it, 45 percent.  But do nothing at all, a 100 percent chance of the end of time.  So, what do you say?  - Whoa! - Good answer.  How about you, Perry the Platypus?  Come on, if you got something to say, now's the time.  The time loop is getting too short!  - What if I throw Baljeet? - You are just using this as an excuse!  Okay, I gotta tell you, there's a lot of risk involved,  but we've discussed it over, like, three loops already  and I think this is our only option.  - Are you with me? - Yeah, I am.  Okay, I should have  just about enough time to press this button,  if I'm not too overly dramatic about it.  We can't reach it! There's just not enough time.  Did it work?  Okay, kids  pie is almost ready.  Anybody want some fresh orange juice in the meantime?  I used a spoon to squeeze them!  - Orange juice! - Yes!  There's the emotional attachment to oranges I've been lacking!  Well, we're not destroyed, so that's a good sign.  - Uh, but did it work? - Mufffin time, sir!  We are back in business, baby girl!  Yes, Dad, I'm so proud of you. You did it!  Aw! I'd do anything for you, pumpkin pants!  After we dismantle this thing,  I don't know what I'm gonna do with myself.  I've got no experience being a good guy.  Well, I'll stick around and help you figure it out.  I hear OWCA is looking for a few good animals.  Well, I was raised by ocelots.  - Now that was an eventful day. - That was an eventful summer.  - What was your favorite part, Phineas? - Of the summer?  Yeah, what was your favorite thing we built?  Memories.  - Oh, come on! - Oh, really corny!  No, I'm serious. We've done a lot of great stuff.  How can I choose?  Yeah. Remember that time we went into space?  - Which time? - The time we made the ice cream. Duh!  And remember the roller coaster we were  Summer is done   And we've had our fun   But this isn't the end of our story   So for nostalgia's sake   Let's just take a break   Sit back and take inventory   We've done so many wondrous things   And there's still so much to do   But I make the most of every day   Whenever I'm with you   Because   It's not about the summer sun   Or even all the things we've done   It's not about the change in the weather   It's just about the time we spend   With our family and with our friends   It's just about the time spent together   It's just about the time   Not the weather   It's just about the time   Spent together   It started real simple With a cool roller coaster   An awesome beach party, then we raced our cars   We were one-hit wonders with a big hit song   And in a special two-parter we sent Candace to Mars   We built a treehouse, robots, hunted Bigfoot and a mummy   Got the band back together And our parents, too   When my brothers got busted it was only a dream   But who had that dream? Was it Perry or you?   Actually, I think my dream was inside of Perry's dream.  My mind is blown.  There's been a hundred and four days of summer vacation   We had a lot of fun and sung a lot of songs   So now it's time for a big celebration   'Cause it's been a great summer and we thank you for coming along   Thank you for coming along   Just wanna thank you for coming along   I'm six foot two and I fight a little Platypus   You think I'd be victorious Just every now and then   I've had a whole lot of schemes   And a lot of inators   But I failed over and over   And over and over and over and over again   Oh, but it was fun, though.  We spent a day fighting pharmaceutical zombies   Would have saw a full vision Looked at fashion instead   With the Klimpaloon and me and the Lake Nose Monster   But we still baffled by the giant floating baby head   We played Hockey Z-9 and Football X-7   We went around the world and to the very edge of space   We met our doppelgangers in the Second Dimension   Isabella kissed me, but I got my mind erased   - Wait, what? - You just wait ten years.  There's been 104 days of summer vacation   We had a lot of fun and sung a lot of songs   So we think it's time for a big celebration   And it's been a great summer   So we thank you for coming along   Thank you for coming along   Thank you for coming along   Thank you for coming along   Thank you for coming along   - Anyone want some pie? - Yes. Yes, we do.  It's just about the time   We spent together   It's just about the time   We spent together   With you"

Whoa! Whoa! Agent P, stop right there.  Shut it down. Stop the exercise!  Agent P, nowhere in the OWCA training manual does it say,  ""Abandon your team and apprehend the suspect by yourself.""  You're not a lone wolf anymore.  Your team lacks focus, and they need your leadership.  Learn to drive, you jerk.  Heck, one of your trainees didn't even show up  No, no, I'm here. I'm here.  Just a little late, I'm here. Phew!  But it's okay, I made this to help.  You can't shoot that at a suspect! Are you crazy?!  - It would blow them to smithereens! - What's the big deal?  I blow up all the time.  Nevertheless, individually, your scores look promising,  but there's still a big problem with teamwork.  Hey, bub, it's just a piece of clip art.  And, Doofenshmirtz, you're lucky you're legally  considered an ocelot, or you wouldn't be here at all.  Yeah, I'd say that's probably the first time  anyone has described my being abandoned by my parents  and raised by Central American wild cats as lucky.  You're gonna be wearing that thing in a second.  - Besides, I've, I've given up evil. - Look, if you guys can't  pass this training exercise, there's no way you'll complete  Town Square Riot, Freeway Assault,  or Escape the Ancient Ruin.  Agent P, your trainees need to learn how to work together as a team  or they're never gonna earn their black hat bands.  And, uh, Karen?  Karen the Cat. Pay attention. Karen. I'm over here.  Follow the light. That's right.  Now, you're going to have to do the entire training exercise again.  High five!  No, I'm not approving overtime. We'll run it without you day players.  Come on, let's just storm out  as if we have somewhere else to go.  Carl, when you're finished with Agent P's team on the back lot,  - return to headquarters immediately. - Sorry, Agent P, gotta go.  Carry on. And remember, teamwork!  Uh, can we still use this thing?  Well, you know, hopefully that didn't hit anything important.  The dust clears, and here we are! OWCA Secret Headquarters.  - Doesn't look very secret to me. - Be that as it may,  today is the day that we will become OWCA's first insect agents.  But they never responded to our applications.  Yes, and I can't understand why.  We mailed them in on time, right before the year-end deadline.  Three, two, one!  Happy new year!  It's possible that our applications have fallen through the cracks.  Which is why we are following up with a personal visit.  That's how you get noticed. And that's how we will become agents.  Imagine fighting international supervillains, traveling to exotic locales.  And I'm gonna get all kinds of cool spy stuff, like a jet pack,  a tuxedo, and scuba fins!  Yeah, that ought to do it.  Napoleon! I can see your house from here!  How about you, Floyd? What do you want?  Uh, a fountain pen that shoots lasers?  - Or a car that shoots fountain pens? - I want a monkey.  Mmm, yes. For whatever twisted reason,  - you shall acquire your primate. - Monkey.  Yes, a monkey is a You know what, never mind.  My point is, now that we're here, all we have to do is get someone's attention.  Ah, here comes a helpful looking lad now. Excuse me, sir  Obviously we need to try a different approach.  I still want a monkey.  Carl, this new facility is really impressive.  Tell me again where you found the money for all these improvements.  I just solved a small ongoing accounting error.  You kept putting decimal points where you needed to put commas.  Oh, I see! Improper punctuation.  - Say, how is Agent P's team shaping up? - Well  Great! Agent P is the best we have.  - If anyone can get that team in shape, it's him. - Yes, sir, but I  Carl, isn't it time that we talked about the elephant in the room?  - What do you mean, sir? - Well, what exactly is he doing?  - Obviously something's itching him. - And Agent W, too.  It's really taking a toll on our brand new facility.  I don't understand all the itching.  I handed out the new flea collars this morning.  Then something's not right because OWCA is infested with fleas!  Carl, activate emergency flea protocol 993 alpha.  Agent C, activate emergency flea protocol 993 alpha.  Okay, everyone.  When the sensors stop detecting the presence of fleas,  the doors will automatically open.  Agents, prepare for flea fogging.  This must be our first test, gentlemen!  As agents, we must know how to elude things like deadly toxic clouds.  - Just for the record, that was not me. - Yes, Wendell, I  Let's just get down in that drawer.  Look at all this spy equipment.  Some sort of giant cutting device, latex bands,  miles of insect rope, giant fly  Ahh! Whoa!  What is happening to me?  Look at this magnification apparatus that Floyd has found.  This could be just the thing we need to get noticed.  - Okay, that was you. - Guilty. Sorry.  Fogging sequence complete. Flea problem solved, sir.  First, the flea collars don't work, and now the fogging doesn't take?  What kind of fleas are these?  Agent D, would you mind? Hmm. Gotcha!  Let me see something.  Okay, gently lower it into place.  Now, all we have to do is get up there  Aw, nuts!  - Look out! - Whoa!  There, you see? It's a good thing we let go,  otherwise we would've ended up just like that peanut.  Whoa!  Oh, my gosh, it's a tiny robot!  What kind of a freak would make robot fleas?  Hello! Francis Monogram.  Great googly-moogly! Who are you?  I am Professor Paren-thesis. Although, I'm not really here.  This is a holographic image.  Major, I'm looking up Professor Parenthesis in our database.  There's not much on him.  It's Paren-thesis, not Parenthesis.  - Are you sure? Because it's spelt P - You would think I would know  - how my own name is pronounced. - Yeah, you'd think.  - Why are you here? - You don't remember me.  We were in biology class together long ago. You barely noticed me.  You're not that guy who kept eating his own hair, are you?  No, that was Jeffrey Stovel.  Were you the kid who got his chin stuck in that graduated cylinder?  No, that was Jennifer Stillwell. And she was a girl!  All you need to know is that I'm the one who sent those flea collars.  Oh! Are you the kid that wore that Robin Hood hat  - and passed out in the drinking fountain? - Billy Youjeka!  - And can we move on, please? - Yeah, sorry.  So, why did you send those flea collars?  Well, it's taken me 30 years to come up with a plan this diabolical.  Five of those years were spent in villain's academies.  Then, after school, I started working on that screenplay I always wanted to write.  But revenge was always on my mind, Francis Monogram.  - Stop saying my name like that. - Did you ever finish that screenplay?  This is my screenplay! Right here.  - I'd love to get your notes. - Oh, I'd be happy to.  Seriously? You don't remember this jerk?  - Were you the kid who - The robot fleas were actually  inside the flea collars that you put on all of your agents.  Now this remote will give me complete control over all of them.  And now, Francis Monogram,  say goodbye to your precious OWCA!  Seriously, though, I'll email you the screenplay. Tell me what you think.  Sir, he's turned all of our animal agents against us!  Carl, are you familiar with the term ""duh""?  - What are we gonna do, sir? - Do we have any agents on the outside?  Anyone without a collar?  Agent P. Come in, Agent P.  Oh, good, you're all right. We need your help.  OWCA's on lockdown. We're trapped!  And all of the agents are being controlled by a sinister fiend  named Professor Parenthesis.  - That's Paren-thesis, sir. - Oh, right.  Anyway, Parenthesis is using robot fleas  - to control our agents' minds. - Left turn!  Whoa! He snuck the fleas into OWCA headquarters  - by hiding them in a shipment of flea collars. - Right turn!  And now he's Hey, Carl! Whoa!  Anyway, he's controlling them with a small remote device.  It's up to you and your team to find Parenthesis and destroy that remote.  - You're all we've got on the outside, so - Wet floor!  Whoa! Great googly-moogly!  Wow! That sounds kind of serious.  Guess the first thing we should do is start looking for clues. Huh? Huh?  Shipment of flea collars!  It's the box those flea collars came in.  And there's his return address, the ""Bottom of the Grand Canyon""!  Hey, hold on a second. Parenthesis! I know that guy!  I met him at an evil convention about three years ago!  Walks around in those pink slippers pushing his screenplay  on everyone. Sure. And now we've got his home address.  Perry the Platypus, we should go to your secret lair and get your hover car  Okay, fine, just Just remember, it was my idea!  Well, that did not go as planned.  Hey, Napoleon, there's peanut butter over here.  Floyd, your head is upside down.  There's peanut butter over here, too.  There's peanut butter all over!  Yes, well, there's always a silver lining, isn't there?  I think the problem is we need to be up on their eye level.  Like those guys up there?  Uh, yes and no.  Tell my wife I love her.  While their position is not advantageous,  they are illuminated by a light, which gives me an idea.  Man, you guys are you guys are fast.  Ah, so this must be your, your host family's house.  What's with all the rocketsin the Oh, those are mine!  That must be where they landed! What a coincidence.  Well, it's a good thing they're not armed or, uh  Don't worry, Perry the Platypus. Everything is gonna be okay.  If I can get a ladder, I can diffuse them before they blow up.  Ah.  Well, on the bright side, now we don't have to find that ladder.  Wow, what a mess!  But don't worry, Perry the Platypus, OWCA's got plenty of money now.  They'll, they'll fix this place up before your host family even gets back.  And they'll, they'll replace all this junk with,  you know, pretty much identical junk.  What?  Ah? See? A cat always lands on my feet.  Ooh, Perry the Platypus, is this your lair? Nice!  At least it, it would be if it wasn't so, you know, blown to smithereens.  Oh, hey, an underwater diving capsule.  Man, I see why you never use it. Fragile.  And is that a pressurized space suit?  'Cause that is not what you wore when we were in space.  Hey, check this out.  Oh, you look so young. Who's a wittle pwatypus?  Where do you think you're going?  No, no, no, look, look. I know you might be a little upset,  what with your house and your lair so exploded and all, and  and I have to admit that I feel slightly responsible  Yeah, thanks for the recap, Maggie.  Anyway, you can't just go off and solve this without me.  I was getting to you guys. I mean, without me and them,  and the cat, wherever the  Hmm.  Anyway, I know we can't all fit in this, but if we work together,  there's a lot of blown-up stuff lying around here, and I'm,  I'm sure we can jury rig something that'll carry, you know, all of us.  Like a well-bonded machine.  Okay, these welds aren't really bonded on this  machine, so, you know, try not to move around too much in flight.  Grand Canyon, here we come!    Yeah. If anyone happens to see a canyon  that looks sort of grand-ish, just speak up.  Or maybe not speak up, maybe meow up, or squawk  Whatever it is that you do, up.  Are we there yet? Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?  Yeah, are we there yet?  I have no way of knowing, because I've never been there,  - and you don't talk. - Are we there yet? Are we there yet?  Man, these guys are really annoying. Don't you think?  I'm right, aren't I? Annoying. Yeah, I'm right.  Beautiful lunchtime at my secret lair   In the Grand Canyon   Ah, I'm starving!  Well, that was delightful. I couldn't eat another gram.  Well, well, it appears someone has flown into my airspace.  Perhaps we should send a welcome party.  Ah, the Grand Canyon, it's nice.  You got the Colorado River, you got the giant robot fleas,  you got these nice red rocks Wait a second!  The Colorado River? I thought we were in Arizona.  And wait another second! Giant robot fleas?  Yeah, those are definitely the attack drones of an evil scientist.  Yeah, you're gonna wanna punch it.  All right! Nice one! Oh, let me help.  We gotta have some weapons around. What does this lever do?  No, no, no. That, uh, it doesn't seem to do anything.  Give me something to hit him with. Thanks, Harry.  - Take that! - We lost the cat! We lost the cat!  Oh, relax. The cat's right  Take that! And that!  One for you, too. There you go.  Uh-oh, where's Harry? Oh, there he is.  I see a bright future for that kid. Well, you know, if we survive today.  Oh, and there's Karen. Hi, Karen.  The access vent won't take us any farther.  The hallway is crawling with compromised agents.  We're gonna have to do some creative sneaking, Carl.  Follow my lead.  The cobra.  Andalusian dog.  Violin and candlestick.  - Garden party. - Garden party?  Just give me your ankles.  There. That should be sufficient wattage to illuminate us.  - Why do we wanna be laminated? - Not laminated. Illuminated.  It means to have light shown upon us.  - Like a grape? - Yes, like Like a grape?  Yeah, I saw a grape this morning.  - And there was light shining on it? - You saw it, too?  Moving on. Do we have enough power for all these lights?  Yep, we're all plugged into that plug collector thingy,  - and all we have to do is turn it on. - Well, let's do that, then.  Yes, and then we can all be laminated.  No, it's illu You know what, never mind.  Floyd, when we get up on the box, you throw that switch.  I like laminated grapes.  Come on, Carl, let's get out of here. Carl! What the heck?  Well, it never occurred to me that  the emergency exit would be locked down, too.  Isn't that something you should've checked before we crawled  - through all that duct work? - I suppose. But, I was  just having so much fun sneaking around with you.  Actually, I was kind of having fun, too.  Nevertheless, this isn't a situation to make light of.  Okay, Floyd, make some light.  Whee.  Oh! Uh, we went that way!  Uh Additional misdirect.  Down here! Look down here! Please! Hello! Hello!  - Can you see, and/or hear us? - Friends, we need you!  Floyd! Focus the beam!  Stop, drop and roll, sir.  Well, you know what they say.  Any landing where you don't get stabbed with a fork is a good one.  And I didn't get stabbed with a fork. Any of you guys? Hello?  Harry?  Oh, there he is.  Impressive!  You know, as, as evil lairs go, I give that, like, an eight.  It, it looks like a classic mid-'60s megalomaniacal design.  And the water feature is very nice.  Fortunately, I know a thing or two about Sheesh!  Oh, heh. Yeah, great way to get the ball rolling there, Perry the Platypus.  I see you're going to use the  Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique, or SEFIT.  Man, these guys are really bad at acronyms.  Good choice, though. W-W-What do I get to do?  What's my part?  Oh, I'm the coffee guy. Good start!  We're gonna need to stay sharp on this one.  Okay, I'm back. Uh, who had the double espresso? There you go.  And a caramel macchiato? Maggie.  And I guess that means that Perry the Platypus had the  Yes, the oolong tea, of course.  And I got a scone, but it was, like, five dollars, so I only got one.  Oh, you got little figurines.  There's Harry, and Maggie, and, uh where's my little guy?  Ah, that's sort of nice  Oh, while you guys do that, I'll just be back  All right, well, I guess I'll just be over, over here, if you need me.  Ooh-woo-woo-woo   Yeah, yeah, yeah   They look so focused   They're making plans   They're talking strategy   That doesn't include me   They made a model of the hideout   And little figurines   But now my little guy   Has got shattered dreams   They don't want me, they don't need me   Now, I'm all alone   Sittin' with this coffee   And a five dollar scone   I could help but my hands are tied   They left me standing outside   They don't want me, they don't need me   They left me standing outside   They don't want me, they don't need me   They left me standing outside   Ooh   Woo-woo-woo   I could've helped.  I understand the Standard Evil Fortress Infiltration Technique.  Step one, diversion.  Jason, Shirley, water is no longer coming out of my hole!  Get down there and see what you can do about it.  Step two, immobilization.  Step three, infiltration.  They'll take them completely by surprise.  They'll just walk right in the door, past that giant lava lamp, and  Why would there be a giant It's a trap!  Ah, Perry the Platypus and friends, right on time.  Actually, you're a little early.  Ah, now, you're on time!  Well, well, well, now that you're all bottled up,  I'm free to go to OWCA for the culmination of my evil plan.  In 28 minutes, my fleas will have worked  their way into each agent's neuro pathways.  And then my mind control will be permanent!  I will single-handedly take control of every OWCA agent!  Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, to the Parentho-copter.  I hope you find my accommodations uncomfortable.  And, yes, soon, it will be worse.  Ah, looks like you might need my help after all.  Lucky for you, I brought a rope with a dream-catcher on the end.  That's what you call style.  Anyway, all right, here, catch.  Uh, Karen, I don't think you're grasping this whole ""grab the rope"" concept.  Can someone else get this one?  Oh, great, now it's tangled in  Wow! Did you guys see that? I almost got  All right, minor setback. No problem, I'm just  gonna have to come down there and get you myself.  See, this is why I brought the raft.  Okay, I might have a little bit of a  Get back, you, before I get all Creole chef on you.  Come on, you guys, jump. I got ya. I got ya.  I got Ahh!  See, a cat always lands on my feet.  Wait, nobody move. Here.  That's going on my blog.  Well, uh, that can't be good.  Whoo-hoo!  Yeah!  Whoo!  I did it! I saved you guys, and now we're safe.  Except for the fact that it's, you know, raining alligators.  And secret lairs.  Good thing we found a hiding place, Carl.  - What is this, a dining room table or something? - It's a desk, sir.  A desk we can both hide under?  - Whose office is this anyway? - It's mine, sir.  Yours? This is at least ten times bigger than my office!  Sir, that's not important now. We need to find a way to escape.  - And how do you rate your own bathroom? - It's actually a gym, sir.  - Is that a chocolate fountain? - Sir, listen. I've got an idea.  If we can get to the evacuation wing, we might be able  - to use one of the escape pods. - What's up with the giant bear?  Oh, that was a gift from our contractor.  That gives me an idea. But this conversation isn't over.  You might have sugar, you might have spice   But ain't nobody's got a friend like mine   - I can't see back here, sir. - You drew the short straw, Carl.  Just a little higher. Ahh. We have finally reached the summit.  Come, gentlemen, it's time to get noticed.  Oh, boy! Oh, sorry, Floyd, are you okay?  Wendell, I've had an epiphany!  In order for us to obtain our noble goal, we must evaluate the  - Ow! - Sorry, Floyd, did you say something?  I like trains.  Oh, my! By my larva making mother, would you look at that!  It's like the floor is frozen. But it's warm. It's like warm ice.  Did we discover this? We should call it wice.  Actually, it's called glass.  No, I think it should be some combination of warm and ice.  Floyd, come take a look at this.  I need a face shoe.  - So, what's your plan, Napoleon? - Ah, it's quite simple, actually.  We are standing atop a giant duplication device.  A device that will not only copy our images, but will enlarge us as well!  I simply need to program in the right size.  Let's see, 200% enlargement.  Okay, men, get on the glass platen and get ready to be enlarged!  All set, Napoleon!  And, copy!  Everyone, smile for the camera.  Excellent! Now we just have to wait for the toner to do its work.  Wow, it's a good thing that lid didn't fall on us. That would've hurt.  Well, yes, Wendell, that was fortun  You know, it, uh, it could've been worse.  Uh, don't, don't all thank me at once.  Knowing my talent has served my fellow agents is thanks enough.  Lousy rescue!  I wouldn't call it lousy, per se. A little off, maybe, but  Oh, come on, Harry the Hyena, it was a good rescue, wasn't it?  Nah.  Karen the Cat? Anything? Uh, no?  What did you think of the rescue, Perry the Ow!  Hey, Perry the Platypus, you're, you're leaving us?  Knock it off! Hope that's not permanent.  Oh, I get it! Hey, you guys, come back.  Come back! Let me just explain.  They say there is no ""I"" in teamwork.  But there's an ""M"" and there's an ""E"", that's me.  I mean, you can't have a team without individuals, on that we can agree.  Wait a minute, guys. Bear with me just a second here.  Okay, watch this. Ready?  You take the ""T"" from the end of Doofenshmirtz   And the ""E"" from Karen the Cat   ""Harry"" has an ""A,"" and then Maggie's got an ""M""   So we're a team, my friends, that's that   Wow, that was easier than I thought it would be.  If only we had a ""W,""  - we could spell out teamwork. - Macaw!  That's right, Macaw has a ""W"" in it!  So we can do it. Okay, here from the beginning.  You take the ""T"" that's buried deep in Doofenshmirtz   The ""E"" from Karen the Cat   Harry's got an ""A"" and then Maggie's got an ""M""   So we're a team, my friends, that's that   So, macaw gives us a ""W""   We get an ""O"" from ocelot  That's me!  We get an ""R"" from Harry, and a ""K"" from Karen   And teamwork's what we've got   That's right Teamwork's what we've got   So we just need to work together Cooperate and trust   'Cause there is no ""I"" in teamwork but there are bits of all of us   Okay, big finish!  So we just need to work together   Together!   - # Cooperate and trust # - # And trust! #  There may be no ""I"" in teamwork, but   - # There are bits # - # There are bits! #  That's right, there are bits   There are bits!   Of all of us!   Okay, now let's spell out collaborative alliance.  There's a ""C"" in No, no, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. Come on back.  Hey, uh, guys, you, you forgot the cat.  They forgot you. And you're the cat.  There it is, sir! The escape pod!  Great! Let's get out of here.  Okay, sir, but be careful, there's a huge set of stairs  - That went well. - The sarcasm isn't helping, sir.  Ah, there we Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!  Okay, this button launches the escape pod.  Uh, Carl, how does the escape hatch work with,  you know, this whole lockdown thing?  Ow!  Well, well, well, Francis Monogram!  It's hostile takeover time!  Carl, how was he able to override the lockdown?  Well, it opens from the outside, sir.  Okay, you made your point, Parenthesis.   Apparently I didn't notice you in school. Sad story. Boo-hoo.  - But why are you here? - I'm here to make your days  the darkest of grays, and your nights the blackest of black.  I want to see your smug smile melt away like the candles  on a sad little abandoned birthday cake.  - Sounds like he's here to bore us to death. - As soon as my mecha-fleas  completely override your agents' natural instincts, I will release  them out into the unsuspecting world where they will wreak havoc.  And all you'll be able to do is sit and watch as the people  of the world grow to deride and despise Francis Monogram  and his monstrous OWCA as much as I do!  - How about now? - No, I still don't remember him!  Wow, Napoleon, we're huge!  Yes, this is bound to get us noticed.  So, how do we get them to see it?  Well, it would be preferable if it were at their eye level.  We could build a paper airplane.  If we could find a staple remover, some dental floss  - Wait, Floyd, what did you say? - I want a monkey?  - No, what did you just say? - I want a monkey.  What were the last words out of your mouth?  Well, actually, those were the last words out of his mouth.  You asked him, ""What did you say?""  And he said, ""I want a monkey.""  - He said it twice, if you count this last time. - Well, I, I  Okay, Floyd, immediately before you said, ""I want a monkey"" twice  - I don't want two monkeys. - Is this about the face shoe?  Oh, forget it, we're making a paper airplane.  Almost out of time.  The suspense is delicious. Don't you think?  Hey, Parenthesis, I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you.  What?  Nice upholstery job, Agent P.  We got this guy. You take out Parenthesis.  Agents, you know what to do.  Excellent! Soon all this will be mine!  First thing I'll do is put that sofa back  up there on the atrium where it belongs. Then, I'll  Oh, my gosh!  Does that mean what I think it means?  - No, it means Parenthesis was a robot! - All right. Well, now I'm confused.  What did you think I thought it meant?  There! This seems aerodynamically sound.  Now, all we need is a big rubber band and two palm trees to launch us.  - You watch way too much TV, Wendell. - Oh, just the one show.  But perhaps some form of propulsion would be beneficial.  - Hmm. - Uh, guys  I think I got a paper cut.  - Wendell. - I'll go get the gauze.  Well, I guess that's that. We should get that remote device and  Whoa!  Oh, no, I can't  What?  - Aloha! - Wait, you're a flea?  - Recognize me now? - Why would I recognize a flea?  See, see?! There's that attitude again!  You've always looked down your nose at me.  Well, now who's beneath who?  He's getting away. He'll ruin everything!  Hold these, guys.  Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, you're with me!  Napoleon, how are you steering this?  I'm not, Wendell. We are at the mercy of the wind. Yee-haw!  Get him!  Where did the platypus go?  Connie! There you go. Let me just straighten your collar.  To the freeway!  How about a little oncoming traffic, you portentous platypus?  Yes, finish him!  What's this?  Here, little semi-aquatic mammal.  Here, boy.  Nowhere to turn now.  Oh, look, I'm wearing glasses. I'm a hipster.  Okay, end of the line, platypus.  You've got nowhere to Ooh! Cotton candy! Give me some of that.  Does anyone see him? He's small, teal, wears a hat.  Oh, come on. How hard is it to find a small platypus in a carnival setting?  Don't say it! I just heard myself.  Oh!  Yeah! Great throw, Harry!  Whoa!  Mmm, got it!  Whoo-hoo!  Thanks for believing in your team, Perry the Platypus.  You think this cage can stop me?  I have you now!  - Oh, great, Karen's here! We're saved! - We're dead!  Come on, Karen, do your thing.  Oh, I forgot the feline.  Susan, Jim, Tracy, Connie, take the cat out.  What? No! You'll pay for that!  Ahh!  My slippy!  Ahh! No!  Hey! Ow!  Ahh!  Ow!  Oh  Well, you guys do work well together. But to no avail.  I may be boo-boo'ed and bruised,  but I still have control over OWCA's agents!  Ha! And it all becomes permanent in just five more seconds!  Hey, Napoleon, our motor came off.  And, gotcha!  Well done, team! You've earned those black hat bands.  You are now officially OWCA agents.  - Look, Napoleon, they got to be agents. - Yes, and not us.  - Whoa! - We should take this as a sign.  Bugs are not meant to be agents.  Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure serving with you.  Whoa!  Oh, hey, now that we're agents  when do I get to use this thing?  Whoa!  Oops. Sorry.  - Carl? - There's still money in the budget, sir.  I don't believe it! We've landed safely.  I take this as a sign, we will be the best agents that OWCA has  It's the OWCA Files It's the OWCA Files   It's the OWCA Files It's the OWCA Files   It's the OWCA Files It's the OWCA Files   It's the OWCA Files    Are these new plates? I mean, they look the same,  but it feels as though they were replaced by exact copies.  Yes, and the tree in our backyard is now a pine."
