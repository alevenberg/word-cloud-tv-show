points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well

long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the

badge three years ago i told you nothing would give me more pleasure than to see you reinstated and i meant that but you're obviously not ready is that you talking or the uniform i am the uniform monk

you're having some problems what are you talking about karen and i are fine we're 100 yes sir my mistake um never been happier to be wrong hey monk come here how did you know that you missed a spot shaving karen would have caught that and your necktie she always ties it for you she used that double slipknot conclusion you dressed yourself and uh the ramada inn cup send her some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to

who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter

consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he

don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey

you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first

intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can

lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with

everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned

you say you and your wife you're having some problems what are you talking about karen and i are fine we're 100 yes sir my mistake um never been happier to be wrong hey monk come here how did you know that you missed a spot shaving karen would have caught that and your necktie she always ties it for you she used that double slipknot conclusion you dressed yourself and uh the ramada inn cup send her some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last week if i could have i would have taken that bullet myself you have to believe me mrs st claire i have to listen to you i don't have to believe you i'm

lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with

front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a

don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that

bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted

lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last week if i could have i would have taken that bullet myself you have to believe me mrs st claire i have to listen to you i don't have to believe you i'm

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last week if i could have i would have taken that bullet myself you have

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter

consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of

going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought

don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey

you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of

is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first

intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he

claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like

on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court

the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned

look monk when i took your badge three years ago i told you nothing would give me more pleasure than to see you reinstated and i meant that but you're obviously not ready is that you talking or the

you say you and your wife you're having some problems what are you talking about karen and i are fine we're 100 yes sir my mistake um never been happier to be wrong hey monk come here how did you know that you missed a spot shaving karen would have caught that and your necktie she always ties it for you she used that double slipknot conclusion you dressed yourself and uh the ramada inn cup send her some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you don't have any of your own let's get this over with i have a fundraiser in denver

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last week if i could have i would have taken that bullet myself you have to believe me mrs st claire i have to listen to you i don't have to believe you i'm

roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with

senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this

to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the

what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i

santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa

are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned

lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter

consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of

going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter

the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please

questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are

is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he

don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey

you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of

we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no

this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn

some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she

no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first

intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can

lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with

discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers

with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you

appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey

you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of

don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and

look monk when i took your badge three years ago i told you nothing would give me more pleasure than to see you reinstated and i meant that but you're obviously not ready is that you talking or the uniform i am the uniform monk you didn't understand that back when i was your watch commander you stay out of my way and we'll be fine yes sir and i'm sure you and karen will work things out what did you say you and your wife you're having some problems what are you talking about karen and i are fine we're 100 yes sir my mistake um never been happier to be wrong hey monk come here how did you know that you missed a spot shaving karen would have caught that and your necktie she always ties it for you she used that double slipknot conclusion you dressed yourself and uh the ramada inn cup send her some roses maybe when we get in there you don't say anything no no no forget it we're four points behind with ten days to go i am not putting my man in a box nobody wants to put anybody in a box mr lloyd all we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance the mayor would love that maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement how about that gavin that's not fair the captain's just doing his job mr st claire can you think of anybody who might wish you harm a disgruntled employee or an ex-wife or a union official i know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us christmas cards you boys have your work cut out for you a man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat warren you're sure you want to go through with this after yesterday no one would blame you if you quit jesse you used to say quit was a four letter word excuse me we haven't been introduced i'm sorry who are you uh jesse goodman i work upstairs senior vice president slash concerned friend i couldn't make this run if jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store baby do you need that yes i do somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me monk excuse me what what are you doing i was just straightening up oh my god excuse me that's color coded by voting precinct it took me three weeks to set this up sorry monk what department are you with ma'am this is adrian monk he's no longer with our department he's here as a private consultant i'll put them all back the way they were no stop you can't possibly remember how everything was yes he can yes he can it won't take too long no it'd take one second adrian let go of the board so captain you said he's no longer with the department he was given a 315 psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension psychological discharge it's a temporary suspension he's up for a review next week is this a joke someone tries to kill my husband and you send in rain man mrs st claire i can assure you mr monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case is he uh no no um it's a form of anxiety disorder a severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident someone hit him with a shovel his wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb there unbelievable wait there now i'd like to see where the shots were fired from what's he doing i love this part he does this zen sherlock holmes thing what he used a drawstring to steady his shot i've seen it before in the field manual for the green berets special forces it's possible captain could you grab this it'll just take a minute hold this up like a rifle right how tall are you six foot no really 5'11 our guy was taller 6'3 maybe 6'4 just like santa clara just like what the homicide in santa clara we've been consulting on it i read about that it's a completely different m.o you think there's a connection because this guy might be tall lieutenant get the warriors on the line i want to talk to antawn jamison see if he's got an alibi for thursday morning captain do you know the percentage of men over 6'3 no do you maybe 0.5 the odds of two men in this city in that category committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical all because of a twisted venetian blind cord monk that's a stretch even for you that and he wore slippers and he smokes newports this isn't police work this this is vaudeville he's already killed two two oh it's nothing he just has a little problem with heights okay we just gotta find an open computer and then i can check up the name oh right here yes vas ques nicole vasques i don't know her but that doesn't mean anything i've only been here a couple days but let's see well she's not a volunteer and she's not on staff sorry what's your name jake jake my name's adrian monk here's my card if you think of anything you give me a call okay sure well what does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him mere words like thank you seem so hollow when i heard jason had passed this guy is too good to be true maybe he's a decent man isn't that possible and then i talked to risa jason's mother and she reminded me her son was no quitter you know what i think i think he did it who st claire you can't buy this kind of publicity right right see it through or why begin at all well what do you think i think this case and the girl in santa clara are connected somehow so who someone who knew them both someone uh what are you doing do you have my keys i can't find my keys i don't have your keys why adrian calm down did you put them in your bag no i don't touch your keys cause if i touch your keys you'd freak out calm down john donne said the democracy of death adrian just stop it just a second everyone who knew jason remembers him and loves him let's remember jason as he was i got them okay i got them right here okay such a relief you know in a few seconds we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to jason forever adrian it's okay we'll make new ones just it's okay it's the key chain the key chain it was trudy's i gotta i gotta i gotta have those keys that packet right there just give it to me no you are going straight to hell i am in hell may his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers why don't we take a moment and meditate silently now old friend we turn and salute you one last time we gotta pull the car around he's ready to go you should be ashamed of yourself do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign now miranda no ma'am i try not to think at all these things happen hell for a minute i thought i had a new campaign slogan vote for st claire he can raise the dead where's my boy here sir make sure miranda gets home of course mrs st claire a couple of questions let me ask you a question how can you investigate anything i'm told you're germophobic afraid of the dark heights crowds and milk we're working on the milk he's making good progress on milk mrs st claire i sense that you're a little upset but i can tell you why i dropped my keys i've been a bit preoccupied with another case a girl was murdered in santa clara a nicole vasques did you know her no no no sir did you know her uh nicole vasques uh no should i no no reason you should excuse me jesse ma'am if you could take another look nicole vasques i don't know anyone by that name what i do know is if my husband is elected mayor you will never work in this town again let's go are you registered to vote i never vote it only encourages them let's get out of here she makes me sick do you know how much her husband's worth no 150 million here they were talking about it on the radio that's a lot of motive yes it is miranda st claire called the mayor personally you couldn't just buy another key chain trudy gave it to him it's irreplaceable captain we just got the forensic report back the bullets were hollow point designed to deform on impact those can't be traced yeah but we caught a lucky break one of them was still intact they i.d.'d the weapon it's a weatherby fibermark rifle which is british it's british long range preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups that's right he's right well start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales yes sir could you crosscheck that against nicole vasques who the homicide in santa clara sir your 10:00 the cases don't overlap monk she worked for the dmv he was a candidate for mayor she was behind on her rent he has houses all over the world she was stabbed he was shot let it go are we gonna let it go hell no what are we gonna do now we're gonna follow the money i've always wanted to say that the queen said to the royal doctor i'm so worried about the princess she has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom but she never laughs who can make the princess laugh so they called the court jester the court jester as everyone knew was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was with a jingle and a jangle he rolled into the court my queen calls he sang out as he bowed jester said the queen the princess has forgotten how to laugh and i am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court when shall i start he asked just then the princess entered the court and everyone fell silent now is as good a time as any she said the jester turned and greeted the princess and he bowed he rolled end over end and when he stopped flowers appeared in his auuugh are you okay yeah i'm better where is she i don't know just give me a moment please there she is hey you're great with the kids yeah well it's easy when you don't have any of your own let's get this over with i have a fundraiser in denver tonight sure sure i uh only have a couple of questions mrs st claire just basic background stuff really um uh do you have any bank accounts in your own name no do you wanna maybe take some notes here no i'll remember it yeah it's probably better to write it down you don't think i can remember how long have you uh and warren been married five years must be tough he's so busy and now he's running for mayor i would think that would be kind of kind of stressful you've been married right yes uh i have then i don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful that's why they call it marriage is there anything else yeah are you uh are you going to be seeing mr goodman later jesse jesse why do you ask well if you see him you know uh just would you tell him to call me because i just i'd love to talk to him and you know if you see him are you accusing me of something mr monk i don't know are you guilty of something mr monk you seem like an intelligent person on occasion warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me last week if i could have i would have taken that bullet myself you have to believe me mrs st claire i have to listen to you i don't have to believe you i'm

killed somewhere else maybe you could tell me where this murder took place that would be very helpful cole avenue and 17th street how could you possibly know that we were meeting at my house he probably took cole i'm thinking he was killed at that stop sign on 17th street why 17th there's a homeless shelter there they wash windshields for spare change i'm thinking somebody approached the car
