"The stove. Over here. It's in the kitchen. No, I mean my stove. I think I left it on. It's okay. I, uh, checked it as we were leaving. Are you sure? Did you turn the knob? Yeah. - The little knob, though? - I turned all the knobs. The stove is off, Adrian. Excuse me, sir, we believe it was a burglary gone sour. She walked in, she surprised him, he panicked, - No. No. - He left there from the kitchen. No, no. No. No. This - This was no burglary. - It wasn't? He tried to make it look like one, but this guy was cold as ice. He wore her slippers to avoid leaving shoe prints not something your neighborhood crackhead is prone to do. Adrian. Adrian. He was in here. He was waiting. Waiting for what? You know, for her. He was here at least an hour. He was smoking. You can still smell it on the curtains. Menthols. Salems. - Possibly Newports. - Maybe she was the smoker. No. No, she was a Dutch Calvinist. They don't smoke. They consider their bodies to be a holy a holy chalice of Sorry, I'm having trouble concentrating, because I think I smell gas. Did you hear the click? You gotta hear the click, not just feel the click. Hear it. Anyway, uh, - after he killed Miss, uh - Nicole Vasques, 25. Yeah, Miss Vasques, he hung around. He was, uh, looking for something. He was looking for what? I don't know. He checked something on her computer. He could have erased a file. What about the pilot light? - Because sometimes it goes out. - The pilot light is fine. Do you remember the last time it almost went out? Do you want me to drive back to the city and check the stove? - No. - Is that what you're telling me to do? No, no, no. Would you? Could you? That would be great. Oh, excuse me, gentlemen. Just one second, okay? Just - Who is she? - Just his nurse. Forget about the damn stove, okay? You are on a job here. - You're a private consultant. - I know, but I smelled it and I think You gotta shut up. The department thinks you're nuts. You're never gonna get reinstated, you're never gonna get hired again, and we are both gonna be unemployed. Do you understand the importance of what I am saying? Now, pull your twisted self together, concentrate and be brilliant. You're brilliant. Excuse me, sir, I'm sure that you're right, but how do you know all of that? - I mean, about the computer - It's patently obvious, isn't it? There are no prints on the keyboard, not even hers. Why? He used it. He wiped them clean. Right. And you said that he was tall. The victim's short, maybe 5'4"". Look at the chair. It's lowered almost all the way. We've been here all morning, and nobody even noticed that. Sir, if you can stick around for a bit, the coroner's on his way. No, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I'm pretty sure I smell gas. Gentlemen, you know where to find us. Just call. - So that's the famous Adrian Monk? - Yeah, the living legend. If you call that living. Monk - Season 1 Episode 01 Mr. Monk and the Candidate, Part 1 Doc, I'm feeling great. Dr. Kroger I'm doing great, Dr. Kroger. You can't You can't sweat the small stuff. Just keep going with the flow. It's a new me. It's a whole new me. And thanks to you I owe it all to you. I feel like I'm back in the saddle. I owe it all to you, Doc. Took your advice, Doc. I'm going with the flow. So going with the flow? Good. Good for you. You've been, what, doing some consulting? Yeah, in Santa Clara. I have an old friend there who's a second lieutenant and called me in. Well, how'd that make you feel? I mean, you know, being called in? It feels great. It feels like old times. Back in the saddle. Well, do you think you're ready to go back full time? No, I don't mean consulting. You know I mean back on the force. Definitely. Absolutely. Do you think I'm ready? That's That's the question. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You keep looking at that pillow. If you want to fix the pillow, it's okay. No, no, no, I was just thinking about No, I'm I'm fine. How are you sleeping? Are you still having those dreams? Well, Trudy and I were married for seven years. It would be weird if I if I never dreamt about her, right? You're testing me, aren't you? You You left it like that on purpose. Did I? Okay. Okay. Yeah, so, anyway, um, I've I've been feeling Excuse me. Hold it. That That one's just There. Then, uh Okay. No big deal. Where were we? You people sound like you're ready for a change. Am I right, or am I right? The band doesn't start playing until the balloons go, okay, right? San Francisco has a simple decision to make. Wait for my cue. Do we tread water, or do we move ahead? But, hell, that's all right. Hey, how we doing? I'm getting lockjaw, Gavin. When can I stop smiling? I'm afraid you're gonna have to get used to it, Miranda. I told you when I signed on, city hall is just the beginning. I am your Moses, and I am gonna take you and your husband to the promised land. - As my old man used to say - I've seen Sacramento, Gavin. It's hardly the promised land. Forget Sacramento. I'm talking about the White House. And don't forget, when you elect me, you're getting two mayors for the price of one. My wife, Miranda. I'm not just talking the talk. I'm ready to walk the walk. Are you ready to walk with me? Yeah! [ gunshot .] [ gunshot .] [ gunshot .] He's up there! Up there! Okay, I'll call you back. I'll call you back. St. Claire just issued another statement. - Is he blaming us? - Not yet. Just rah rah stuff. He will not be silenced. He will not be intimidated. He will be blaming us soon enough. Everybody does sooner or later. We gotta make a statement too. - Is the press here? Who's here? - The girl from channel 3. - The pretty one? - No, the other one. - It's okay. / - Good. Who do you want on camera? Me. I'll do it. I think it'll reassure people to see me taking point. - Yes, sir. / - Anything on the shooter? Say yes. The forensic boys are still on site, but nothing so far. Incoming: Deputy mayor. Oh, Sheldon Burger, who let you off your leash? I just came from the hospital. Bodyguard didn't make it. Mayor's on his way back from Sacramento. Look, I don't have to tell you, Captain. We're on a bus to hell. - I understand. - If we don't slam dunk this, - It's gonna look like we're not trying. - I'm not an idiot, Sheldon. I've got every available man on the case. No, you don't. Mayor wants you to bring in your old friend. Monk? - Bus! Bus! Bus! - I still can't believe this. The mayor asked for you personally. There's a bus on the right. Oh, this is great. This is gonna get you back on the force. I'm telling you. I already have a job, remember? The girl in Santa Clara? Merging! Merging! Everybody's mer - You want to drive? - What lane are you in? You want to drive? I'll sit there and yell and point and drive you nuts, 'cause you're driving me nuts, Adrian. Sorry. It's red! It's red! Come on, it's red! Be cool. No, not today. You can't today. Look who's here the defective detective. - Hello, Monk. - Captain. - Sharona. - Hi. You look good. Dr. Kroger says you've been getting out some. Oh, he is really doing great. I can't even keep up with him. Thanks. Excellent. The candidate is waiting for us upstairs. I wanted to make this crystal clear. You're here because the mayor thinks you can walk on water, but you're a civilian now, Monk. You have observer status only, okay? When I'm in there, I talk. You say nothing, understand? Look, Monk, when I took your badge three years ago, I told you nothing would give me more pleasure than to see you reinstated, and I meant that. But you're obviously not ready. Is that you talking or the uniform? I am the uniform, Monk. You didn't understand that back when I was your watch commander. - You stay out of my way, and we'll be fine. / - Yes, sir. And I'm sure you and Karen will work things out. What did you say? You and your wife you're having some problems. What are you talking about? Karen and I are fine. - We're 100%. - Yes, sir. My mistake. Um, never been happier to be wrong. Hey, Monk, come here. How did you know that? You missed a spot shaving. Karen would have caught that. And your necktie she always ties it for you. She used that double slipknot. Conclusion you dressed yourself. And, uh, the Ramada Inn cup. Send her some roses maybe. When we get in there, you don't say anything. No, no, no. Forget it. We're four points behind with ten days to go. I am not putting my man in a box. Nobody wants to put anybody in a box, Mr. Lloyd. All we want to do is limit your public appearances and not announce your schedule in advance. The mayor would love that. Maybe we should move the whole campaign and run it from the basement. How about that? Gavin, that's not fair. The captain's just doing his job. Mr. St. Claire, can you think of anybody who might wish you harm? - A disgruntled employee? - Or an ex-wife. Or a union official. I know a couple of ex-business partners who no longer send us Christmas cards. You boys have your work cut out for you. A man who hasn't made any enemies hasn't done squat. Warren, you're sure you want to go through with this? After yesterday, no one would blame you if you quit. Jesse, you used to say ""quit"" was a four letter word. Excuse me. We haven't been introduced. I'm sorry. Who are you? Uh, Jesse Goodman. I work upstairs. Senior vice president slash concerned friend. I couldn't make this run if Jesse wasn't upstairs minding the store. Baby. - Do you need that? - Yes, I do. Somebody tried to kill my husband yesterday right in front of me. - Monk. - Excuse me! What What are you doing? I was just straightening up. Oh, my God. Excuse me! That's color coded by voting precinct. It took me three weeks to set this up. - Sorry. - Monk! What department are you with? Ma'am, this is Adrian Monk. He's no longer with our department. He's here as a private consultant. I'll put them all back the way they were. No, stop. You can't possibly remember how everything was. Yes, he can. Yes, he can. - It won't take too long. - No. It'd take one second. Adrian, let go of the board! So Captain, you said he's no longer with the department? - He was given a 315. - Psychological discharge. - It's a temporary suspension. - Psychological discharge. It's a temporary suspension. - He's up for a review next week. - Is this a joke? Someone tries to kill my husband, and you send in Rain Man? Mrs. St. Claire, I can assure you, Mr. Monk's involvement is an indication of just how seriously we are taking this case. Is he, uh No, no. Um, it's a form of anxiety disorder. A severe case like this is usually triggered by a single traumatic incident. Someone hit him with a shovel? His wife was murdered four years ago a car bomb. There! Unbelievable. Wait. There. Now I'd like to see where the shots were fired from. What's he doing? I love this part. He does this zen, Sherlock Holmes thing. What? He used a drawstring to steady his shot. I've seen it before in the field manual for the Green Berets, Special Forces. - It's possible. / - Captain, could you grab this? It'll just take a minute. - Hold this up like a rifle. - Right. - How tall are you? - Six foot. - No, really. - 5'11'; Our guy was taller 6'3"", maybe 6'4"", just like Santa Clara. Just like what? The homicide in Santa Clara. We've been consulting on it. I read about that. It's a completely different M.O. You think there's a connection because this guy might be tall? Lieutenant, get the Warriors on the line. I want to talk to Antawn Jamison, see if he's got an alibi for Thursday morning. Captain, do you know the percentage of men over 6'3""? - No. Do you? - Maybe 0.5. The odds of two men in this city in that category, committing premeditated murder within two days of each other are astronomical. All because of a twisted venetian blind cord. Monk, that's a stretch, even for you. That and he wore slippers. And he smokes Newports. This isn't police work. This This is vaudeville. He's already killed two Two. Oh, it's nothing. He just has a little problem with heights. Okay, we just gotta find an open computer, and then I can check up the name. Oh, right here. Yes. - VAS - QUES Nicole Vasques. I don't know her, but that doesn't mean anything. I've only been here a couple days. But let's see. Well, she's not a volunteer. And she's not on staff. Sorry. - What's your name? - Jake. Jake, my name's Adrian Monk. Here's my card. If you think of anything, you give me a call. Okay, sure. Well What does a man say about a friend who took a bullet that was meant for him? Mere words like ""thank you"" seem so hollow. When I heard Jason had passed This guy is too good to be true. Maybe he's a decent man. Isn't that possible? And then, I talked to Risa, Jason's mother, and she reminded me her son was no quitter. You know what I think? - I think he did it. - Who? St. Claire. - You can't buy this kind of publicity. - Right. Right. See it through, or why begin at all. Well, what do you think? I think this case and the girl in Santa Clara are connected somehow. So who? Someone who knew them both. Someone, uh What are you doing? Do you have my keys? I can't find my keys. - I don't have your keys. - Why? - Adrian, calm down. - Did you put them in your bag? No, I don't touch your keys, 'cause if I touch your keys, you'd freak out. Calm down! John Donne said, ""The democracy of death"" Adrian, just stop it. Just a second. Everyone who knew Jason remembers him and loves him. Let's remember Jason as he was. I got them. Okay. I got them right here. Okay. Such a relief, you know? In a few seconds, we will be closing the casket and saying goodbye to Jason forever. Adrian, it's okay. We'll make new ones. Just It's okay. It's the key chain. The key chain it was Trudy's. I gotta I gotta I gotta have those keys. That packet right there - Just give it to me. - No. - You are going straight to hell. - I am in hell. May his loving spirit live forever in our hearts and in our prayers. Why don't we take a moment and meditate silently? Now old friend we turn and salute you one last time. We gotta pull the car around. He's ready to go. You should be ashamed of yourself! Do you lie awake at night thinking of ways to disrupt my husband's campaign? Now, Miranda No, ma'am, I try not to think at all. These things happen. Hell, for a minute, I thought I had a new campaign slogan: ""Vote for St. Claire. He can raise the dead."" - Where's my boy? - Here, sir. - Make sure Miranda gets home. - Of course. Mrs. St. Claire, a couple of questions. Let me ask you a question. How can you investigate anything? I'm told you're ""germophobic,"" afraid of the dark, heights, crowds and milk. We're working on the milk. He's making good progress on milk. Mrs. St. Claire, I sense that you're a little upset, but I can tell you why I dropped my keys. I've been a bit preoccupied with another case. A girl was murdered in Santa Clara. A Nicole Vasques. Did you know her? No. No? / No. Sir, did you know her uh, Nicole Vasques? Uh, no. Should I? - No. No reason you should. - Excuse me. Jesse. Ma'am, if you could take another look. Nicole Vasques. I don't know anyone by that name. What I do know is if my husband is elected mayor, you will never work in this town again. Let's go. Are you registered to vote? I never vote. It only encourages them. Let's get out of here. She makes me sick. Do you know how much her husband's worth? - No. - $150 million. Here. / They were talking about it on the radio. - That's a lot of motive. - Yes, it is. Miranda St. Claire called the mayor personally. You couldn't just buy another key chain? Trudy gave it to him. It's irreplaceable. Captain, we just got the forensic report back. The bullets were hollow point, designed to deform on impact. Those can't be traced. Yeah, but we caught a lucky break. One of them was still intact. They I.D.'d the weapon. It's a Weatherby Fibermark rifle, - which is British - It's British. Long range, preferred by mercenaries and paramilitary groups. That's right. He's right. Well, start a list of weapons and/or ammunition sales. Yes, sir. Could you crosscheck that against Nicole Vasques? - Who? - The homicide in Santa Clara. - Sir, your 10:00? - The cases don't overlap, Monk. She worked for the DMV. He was a candidate for mayor. She was behind on her rent, he has houses all over the world. She was stabbed. He was shot. Let it go. - Are we gonna let it go? - Hell, no. - What are we gonna do now? - We're gonna follow the money. I've always wanted to say that. ""The queen said to the royal doctor,"" ""'I'm so worried about the princess."" ""'She has all the emeralds and rubies and riches in the kingdom"" ""but she never laughs."" ""Who can make the princess laugh?"" ""So they called the court jester."" ""The court jester, as everyone knew,"" ""was the silliest and funniest court jester that ever there was."" ""With a jingle and a jangle, he rolled into the court."" ""'My queen calls, he sang out as he bowed."" ""Jester,"" said the queen, ""The princess has forgotten how to laugh,"" ""'and I am giving you the job of bringing back her smiles to this court."" ""When shall I start?"" he asked. ""Just then, the princess entered the court, and everyone fell silent."" ""'Now is as good a time as any,"" she said. ""The jester turned and greeted the princess, and he bowed, he rolled end over end,"" ""and when he stopped, flowers appeared in his"" Auuugh! - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm better. - Where is she? - I don't know. Just give me a moment, please. There she is. Hey, you're great with the kids. Yeah, well, it's easy when you don't have any of your own. Let's get this over with. I have a fundraiser in Denver tonight. Sure. Sure. I, uh, only have a couple of questions, Mrs. St. Claire. Just basic background stuff Really. Um. Uh, do you have any bank accounts in your own name? No. Do you wanna maybe take some notes here? No, I'll remember it. Yeah, it's probably better to write it down. You don't think I can remember? How long have you, uh, and Warren been married? - Five years. - Must be tough. He's so busy, and now he's running for mayor. I would think that would be kind of kind of stressful. You've been married, right? Yes, uh, I have. Then I don't have to tell you every marriage is stressful. That's why they call it ""marriage."" Is there anything else? Yeah. Are you, uh, are you going to be seeing Mr. Goodman later? - Jesse? - Jesse. Why do you ask? Well, if you see him, you know, uh, just would you tell him to call me? Because I just I'd love to talk to him. And, you know, if you see him. Are you accusing me of something, Mr. Monk? I don't know. Are you guilty of something? Mr. Monk. You seem like an intelligent person. On occasion. Warren is the first man in my life that never gave up on me. Last week, if I could have, I would have taken that bullet myself. You have to believe me. Mrs. St. Claire, I have to listen to you. I don't have to believe you. I'm leaving now. There's no doubt in my mind that witch did it. Hello? Adrian, it's for you. Okay? Yeah, this is Monk. Mr. Monk, it's Jake from the St. Claire campaign. I think I found something. - I'll be right there. - Actually, I was about to leave. I can drop it off. I'll be there in a half hour. Good. I'll meet you there. - Is that a personal call? - No, sir. - Good! - I may be a little late. - All right, my beautiful people, I love every one of you, but these envelopes will not get stuffed by themselves. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no! No, thanks. No, not today! Come on, I just cleaned it! Come on! All right. Fine, fine. That's fine. Hey, Captain. Captain. Captain, we got the preliminary. Probable accident severe blunt trauma to the head. - Uh, huh. Okay. - Captain? Captain? Are there any documents in the car, like a notebook? No. - Uh, Captain? - What? - Check his hat. - What? He used to carry things in his hat. Was there a hat? They didn't pull anything. He wasn't wearing a hat! What are you doing? Come on down. The accident scene's down here. He's not wearing the right shoes today. Not wearing the right shoes today. Well, look, there's nothing to do here. The port authority's calling it. It's a single car accident. No, no. No, this was no accident. There's no skid marks on the road. It's wet! You're not the only detective here, Monk. I checked for skid marks. It happens all the time on this hill. You hit this curve at 85, 90 miles an hour. Ftt! Boom! No. No, this was staged. He was killed somewhere else. Maybe you could tell me where this murder took place. That would be very helpful. Cole Avenue and 17th Street. How could you possibly know that? We were meeting at my house. He probably took Cole. I'm thinking he was killed at that stop sign on 17th Street. Why 17th? There's a homeless shelter there. They wash windshields for spare change. I'm thinking somebody approached the car, started washing the window and then attacked him. You can see the windshield even better from here. The driver's side's clean. The passenger side's filthy. Go check the windshield. Go, Adrian. Excuse me, Officer. Son of a bitch. Adrian, this officer is gonna drive you home, okay? Thank you. Behave yourself! He's armed. Why? Where you going? I have a date. I told you about it. Oh, I thought you were joking. You thought I was joking? Why? You don't think I could possibly have a date? - No, I didn't mean that. - What is so funny about me dating, Adrian? Nothing. Sorry. It's just It's Tuesday. It's chicken potpie night. Don't be such a baby. My 11 year old kid can bake a chicken potpie. I'll see you later, okay? Okay. Okay. Slow down. Slow down one second. All right, then you said Who are you on the phone with? - No one. - Give me the phone. Monk, is that you? Okay, I'm hanging up now. And don't call back. Benjy's got homework. Lots of it. Don't hang up. No! Benjy, call me back! He sounds certifiable. - It's the worst job I ever had. - Yeah? So why don't you quit? Well, because it's also the best job I ever had. I'm having adventures. I can't believe it. I'm putting bad guys behind bars. I feel like, um What is her name? Superman's girlfriend. Oh, Lois Lane. - I'm Lois Lane. - Yeah. I mean, how many practical nurses can say that? Not many. You see, that looks so fine on you. What, the dress? The smile. Oh. Thank you. Five six Seven eight nine ten. We have some new footage of the event that was taken by a tourist. I should warn you, some of this is very graphic. Make way for the mayor! [ gunshot .] [ gunshot .] To moderation in all things, hmm? Except love. Hey. Monk, what are you doing here? I was watching the news. There was a videotape of the St. Claire thing. Something about it just does not add up. Mr. Monk, I presume? You must be Carl from the health club. Well, uh, why don't you join us? No, he shouldn't. You know, two's company, three's a crowd, and Monk hates crowds, don't you? I feel okay when you're around. Boy, this is nice, isn't it? I forgot. What were we talking about? - England. - Oh, my God, that's right. Um, Carl said that, uh, he was talking about living in England. - He was a Rhodes Scholar. - No kidding! Yeah. He graduated magna cum laude. - Cum laud. - Right. I know. And now he has a private practice. He's an entertainment lawyer. Guess who he represents. Can I tell him? Yeah, sure. Francis Ford Coppola. Yeah, but it's no big deal. A tabloid wrote something about him that, you know, he was drunk at the Oscars, so now we're suing them for slander. I don't know what to do here. Uh, I'm no good at this. Okay. This man is lying to you. He's not a lawyer. What? Oxford doesn't have a magna cum laud, and you sue a newspaper for libel, not slander. I'll just shut up. Forget I said anything. It's no big deal, Carl. Well, that looks What the hell is that? What should I have done? Just let him lie to you? Yes. Yes. It was a first date. Taxi! Everybody embellishes their resume. It's called ""human nature."" Do you think I told him about Benjy? About that summer I spent dancing in Atlantic City? No. What kind of dancing? I can't do this anymore. - I quit. - Not again. No. No. I mean it this time. - I'm sending my sister over for my stuff. - You know you're just gonna come back. Don't tell me what I'm gonna do. You think you know everything? Believe it or not, you don't know me that well. All right. Let's just go back inside. No. No. It's too late. Look I have responsibilities now. I got a kid. And I think I have to find a normal job before I go completely crazy. Like me. Like me? Well, I'll never forget you. You never forget anything. Valencia and 28th. Okay, make me happy. We found it wedged under the passenger seat, uh, in his hat. - Third name from - I see it, I see it. She was a part time volunteer. She quit two months ago. That's why her name didn't come up. So Monk was right. There is a connection. How does he do it? I mean, I have two eyes. I see everything that he sees, but I I don't see what he sees. Sir, if I may, what Monk does, it's a parlor trick. I mean, can he do all this? Can he organize a citywide investigation, inspire the troops, motivate people? Adrian Monk isn't half the cop or a third of the man that you are, sir. Thank you, Lieutenant. Nonetheless we need him now. Go get him. He's not home. Well, then he's at Sharona's. Call Sharona. I tried her. She said she quit. Sharona quit? You mean Monk's alone? Out there in public? - Hello? - Are you Benjy? - Yeah. Who are you? - I'm Sheldon Burger, Deputy Mayor. Hey, you like skateboarding? Mom, something happened to Monk! Forget it. Monk's been one step ahead of us all the way, but the man can't function without you. The city of San Francisco would be eternally grateful. Wow! These are really good. Did you make these? They're Oreos, Sheldon. - They are? - They say ""Oreos"" on them. Oh, yeah. Exactly how eternally grateful would the city be? You tell us, Sharona. - Whatever you want. - A skateboard track. Mom, make them build a skateboard track in the park. Okay. Here's the deal. I'll find Monk and bring him back, and you'll owe me one. - One what? - Someday there'll be a knock on your door. Whatever I say, whatever I want, you'll have to say yes. Within reason. - Then forget it. - Okay, okay, okay, not within reason. [ oboe playing .] That was our song. I'm sure she heard you. I don't see how. She's been dead for four years. Welcome back. Well, don't pretend you're surprised. You know, you were right about the cases being connected. Nicole Vasques did volunteer work for the St. Claire campaign. How does it feel, always being right? Terrible. Come on. Let's go. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to pull this off. Adrian, you're gonna be fine. So, are you ever gonna tell me what kind of dancing you did in Atlantic City? Ballroom. Really? Campaign volunteer. Campaign volunteer. What did she do there? Oh, this and that. Mostly helping the bookkeeper. She quit after seven weeks, which, I'm told, is not unusual. Pretty small crowd. How many times you need to watch that, Adrian? We're missing The Price Is Right. The rally. I mean, why would Gavin Lloyd set it there? A weekday in the middle of the financial district. They were just talking about Gavin Lloyd on the radio. Apparently, he was this hotshot political genius, and now the national parties won't even touch him. Why not? Well, he was never officially charged, but the word is some campaign contributions Gavin collected were there one minute and gone the next. Oh, right. That was a senate race, right, in North Carolina? Adrian, what are you doing? It was dented. Where? You can't even see it. I am what I am. Do you want it? Of course I want it. I'm not the mental case. Oh, look this one's dented, too. - That's funny. - I know. I don't know why you shop at that place, Adrian."
"Harry! Thank God you called. Kate, where are you now? Oh, I'm on the way. I'll be there in 20 minutes. How is she? I don't know. The veterinarian won't let me see her. Well, what did they say? She was hit by a car. That's all they know. Oh! Oh, God. They think her back legs are broken. My poor baby. I don't know how it happened. How did she get out of the yard? Maria must have left the gate open. I don't think so. I checked it myself. Where are you now? Oh, I'm, uh I'm going past the ranger station. Oh, God, if something's happened to her, I will never forgive myself. Just hurry! I'm I'm going as fast as I can. MONK Season 1 Epi. 03 Mr. Monk and the Psychic - Whoa. Press pass? - No. - Are you on the list? - No. Sorry, I can't let you in. Officer, this is Adrian Monk. Sorry, sir. I didn't know. Can we stand over there? We don't like to be touched. Adrian. Adrian! Come on. As you can imagine, the past three days have been very difficult, very painful for the entire department. has asked to say a few words. Commissioner. It's been 72 hours since my wife Katherine disappeared. I wanna thank everyone for their prayers and good wishes. It's meant the world to me. There's someone out there who knows what happened to my wife. I'm asking you to look into your heart and to come forward with any information you might have. To Kate. If you can hear this, hang in there, baby. I love you. Don't give up. Monk, what are you doing here? I wanna help. You wanna help? Say a prayer for the man. I can do more than that, Captain. You know I can. Can you imagine what that man's going through? Yes, I can. Come on. Follow me. Commissioner. Harry. - Adrian Monk. - Yes, of course. How are you, Detective? - Former detective. - Not for long, I hope. We miss you. Thank you for coming. Sir, if there's anything that I can do, I'm available 24-7. I appreciate that. I've become pretty familiar with this type of crime. There is no crime yet, Monk. This is a Missing Persons case. Of course. I know. I know that. And I'm sorry. Adrian. I just mean, if worse comes to worse, and I pray it never does, I think I could be a real asset here. You won't be sorry, sir. He is the best. Well, how can I not accept an offer from Adrian Monk? Leland, see that he gets a copy of the file and full access. - Yes, sir. - Welcome aboard, Detective. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Where am I? Where the hell She was calling me. She led me here. See, that's the way it happens sometimes. I was driving the car, but her aura was guiding me. Write that down, Lieutenant. It was her aura. And then I woke up, and I was right here. See, she wanted me to find her. She didn't want to lie for the rest of eternity under all that mud. - Can you blame her? - And you never met Mrs. Ashcombe? No, never met her not until this morning. And do you know her husband at all? Never had the honor. Is there anything else you can tell us, Miss Flint? Hell's bells, Captain. You can call me Dolly. - You've known me for 20 years. - Hello, Dolly. Did he tell you? He arrested me three times bunco and fraud. You always thought I was a quack, didn't ya, huh, Captain? Never thought I'd actually find somebody. Oh, hi! Excuse me? Can you get a picture of me with the car? / Hey. - I'm just gonna - Hey, no, Dolly. Dolly. He is a police photographer. He's not from the National Enquirer. - Right this way. - Can't I just have one shot? - What are you doing? - Look at this. What? / Looks like something was maybe dragged along here. Something metal. That could be anything. But you see where the car ended up. If you imagine the trajectory, it doesn't make sense. Don't complicate things, Monk. She was probably doing 70 or 75 miles an hour when she missed the turn. Hey, did you hear who found the car? I heard. Dolly Flint. Crazy Dolly. Can you believe that? No, I can't. Monk doesn't believe in psychics. I believe in what I can see. I believe in what's in front of me. You know how I found out that my ex was still seeing his old girlfriend? Please, tell us. A psychic told me. And that's a true story, and it was the best 35 bucks I ever spent. Thirty-five bucks? There have been cases documented cases where psychics have found missing kids, bodies. - It happens. - Of course it happens! A thousand psychics making 10,000 predictions a year, two or three of them have to be right. Here he is. You know, I was the best man at their wedding. / Really? This is gonna kill him. Kill him. God. - That's strange. - What? She went off the road here, but look at the tree. The tree's intact. No broken branches. Harry, I really don't think you should look. Why not? Because you should remember her like she was. Leland, I have to see her. I have to say good-bye. Katherine! Hi. / Commissioner, this is Dolly Flint. She found your wife's body. Yes, of course. It's amazing. I can't thank you enough. I just wished I could have found her before she crossed over. Adrian, don't you want a closer look? No, l-I can see from here. Would you like us to move the crash site a little closer to you? No, I'm fine. Hi! - You found the body? - Yeah. Are you a reporter? Miss Flint? Hello. My name is Sharona Fleming. And this is my friend oh, excuse me my boss, Adrian Monk. He was consulting on the case before you showed up to solve it. Why is he, uh, staring at me? I know. It's a little creepy if you don't know him. Excuse me. Uh, Miss Flint. I just have to say that it is an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how much money I have wasted on those TV psychics. But you really have the power. I mean, a gift. Well, apparently. Can I call you sometime for a private reading? Oh, yeah. But listen. The rates on my card no longer apply. They've gone up, as of about two hours ago. Here's one for you, Mr. Monk. I'll take it to him. Maybe I could help you with, uh, one of your cases sometime. - Ciao. - Bye. Hold still. Hold still. It's not the end of the world. Did you see that? It's just a little mud. No. She moved her seat forward. When she got in the car, she moved her seat. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was my office. Yeah, see, I'm confused because my name is on the door. Don't Don't blame Sharona, Captain. I have no intention of blaming Sharona. I was just following up on the Ashcombe case. What happened here? I took the liberty of straightening up a little. - Where is all my crap? - It's in your drawers. And, of course, I had to throw some stuff away. I'm sorry, sir. I tried to stop him, but There is no Ashcombe case, Monk. The inquest is over. This is what happened. It was raining. She was a terrible driver. She went off the road. A mud slide covered the car until.. Until the biggest flake in North America just happened to find it. And you can't stand that, can you? Dolly Flint showed you up, and you can't stand it. Adrian, sit! We have Dolly Flint's file. I know she has a jacket. I made three of those collars myself. Fraud, trespassing, reckless endangerment. Yeah, she has a sleep disorder. She walks in her sleep. She's got, um what do you call it som Do you know how many cases Dolly Flint offered to help with and failed? Two hundred and twenty. So, she's one for 220. It's possible. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. She was photographed going through a red light last night. She was alone in the car. It happened. I'm not good at parties. It's not a party. It's a memorial service. This is a nice place. Obviously, whoever lives here doesn't work for you. The late Mrs. Ashcombe was richer than Canada. Commissioner, I thought this might help. When I lost Trudy, l I read it every night. ""Ralph Waldo Emerson."" - Yes, sir. - Thank you, Adrian. And thank you for coming. It means the world to me. It looks like we won't require your services after all. But I want you to know how much I appreciate your offer. Thank you. - Hold on. - No, no, bathroom. Bathroom! - I need to wash. - Just try upstairs. Did you see that? It was a two-hander. I saw it. Just don't make a scene. The guest bathroom is down the hall. Commissioner! I'm sorry. Uh, I was I was, uh I was I was just I mean, later after you know, before when we l Okay, here's the thing. I can remember when you began this sentence. Everyone gets lost. The house was always too big for Katherine and me. We didn't buy it. It was a wedding gift from her father. Ah. You understand, right? I mean, you lost your wife. Uh, understand what, sir? The natural desire to pack her things away. You don't want them around to remind you. I guess I had the opposite reaction. I haven't thrown anything of Trudy's away. Not even a hairbrush. Not even a hair from a hairbrush. Really? So, uh, what, he leaves the house like twice a week now? What kind of question is that, hmm? He leaves the house all the time. He's not disabled. He just gets a little anxious about Every single thing. Well, you know, the fact is we're getting offers from all over the country every day. I had to disconnect my phone. It was driving me crazy. Sure. What are you doing? You can't look through people's mail. I'm not stealing anything. I'm just combing through. I don't wanna live in a world where a person can't comb through another person's mail. Just hurry up. ""Jennie Zeppettelli."" Smell that. Perfume. Shalimar. It's very expensive. Obviously, an old girlfriend. She loved him, but it's over now. How do you know all that? I've never underlined anything six times. Have you? I agree, Jennifer. He did waste the best five years of your life. How did you know what I was thinking? You were looking at the empty bottles of Beaujolais. They're dated, one for each of the last five years. They obviously represent anniversaries. And I saw you feel your ring finger, which doesn't have a ring. Are you a psychic, Mr. Monk? He is a psychic who doesn't believe in psychics. Jennifer, we know you were having an affair with Harry Ashcombe. - Is it over? - I wised up. It only took five years. I realized Harry was never gonna leave his wife. And not because he loved her. I mean, he despised her. He just couldn't live without the money. When did you see him last? About four months ago. But he calls me all the time and he sends me gifts. I mean, what happened to his wife, it wasn't my fault. He's just He's crazy. You mean the accident? You don't believe it was an accident? I don't know. All I know is that Harry Ashcombe is a very dangerous man. I hope you know what you're doing. Do we know what we're doing? Relax. I've been handling refrigerators since I was 15. No. I'm talkin' about the case. The former commissioner isn't just another suspect, Adrian. He is connected. He is the man, and you better be sure about this. I'm as sure as I can be without any, you know, proof. All ofher stuff was packed up. He couldn't wait to get rid of it. But that doesn't mean anything. There were boots in the closet that were covered with mud. ""Good until July 22."" ""Sell by July 20."" You really think he forced his wife off the road? - Yep. - Any idea how? Unless I'm crazy, he put something on the road that sent her over the side. Now, that was the easy part. The hard part came later. What's that? Getting that loony tune, Dolly Flint, to find the body. That's the real mystery here. - How did he do that? - Well, you can ask her. I got a reading with her at 3:00. Why don't you come along? Maybe I will. Hmm. Very positive person. Very spiritual. That's true. / Mm-hmm. Hmm. But you've been troubled. You're having trouble sleeping. Am I right? Yeah. Yeah. / Uh-huh. You can tell all that from the bumps in my head? It's called phrenology. See, the shape of your head is like a spiritual road map. - You just have to know how to read it. - Feels good. Shh. Okay. There's a young man in your life. That would be my son. His name's Benjy. / Oh. And another man. He's not young, but he's he's like a child. That would be my boss. / Mmm. This is a very difficult man. - He's causing you a lot of anxiety. - Yeah. I just don't wanna talk about him right now, please? / Okay, all right. Yeah, this is another man a new man. - Oh, honey, this is a real man. - Really? Yeah. What was that? Wait. Let's Let's talk about that man. Where's your friend, Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk. I thought you were in the waiting room. I was thirsty. Yeah? Well, you should have asked. Excuse the mess. My cleaning girl got herself knocked up by some guy from Paraguay. Can you believe it? What do they call them anyway, ""Paraguians""? Here you go. You know what? I'm fine. It was It was just a cough drop stuck in my throat there, but I'm fine now. - Thank you. - Suit yourself. Why don't you come and join us? Hmm. Mm-hmm. The Chariot. You are a very restless soul. Oh. Now this is interesting. The Knight of Pentacles. Is that good? Well, it confirms what I felt earlier romance. You know anyone with a British accent? - No. - You will very soon. A British accent, huh? He's not gonna look like that, is he? No, I don't think so. No, he's gonna be tall, and his name is Derek David. Congratulations. I'm sure you'll both be deliriously happy. Miss Flint, about finding Mrs. Ashcombe I didn't find anybody. Her spirit led me to her. Of course. Yeah, of course. Did you know her before she died? No, I never met her, and I've been through this about a million times. - No, I understand - Excuse me. Um, about the man with the accent, how will I know it's him? Oh, well, you'll know, like all women know. You just have to keep an open heart, Sharona. - So, she wasn't a client? - No. Uh, Dolly? You said soon. You mean, like this week or next week? / Um I'd say before the next full moon. I'm sorry, but, uh, uh, here on the planet Earth, there's a dead woman and somebody is responsible. It was an accident, Mr. Monk. She drove off the highway. Right. What exactly do you remember about that night? Do you know what you are, Mr. Monk? You are, what we in the spiritual world call, a ""buzz kill."" Thank you. / Fine! It's your money. I went to bed. I have insomnia. I took my pills. I finally got to sleep at about, uh, 3:00. No, it was 3:30. I was watching Law & Order. Go on. And that's it. I woke up next to Mrs. Ashcombe. Now I go to bed with my coat on holding my car keys, just in case. Okay, are you happy now? You happy? Dolly? Dolly, what does he do, like, for a living? He has a job, right? - Sharona, please, please. - What? I'm I'm working here. I'm working here. What did you do? Are you insane? - I need I need a wipe. - In the car. Don't do this to me. Give me a wipe here. Go to the car and get the wipes. Go to the car. Um About this David or Derek, he's not married, is he? What is he doing? I don't know. Did you finish all your math? You have a weird job. Benjy, just finish the math. Mr. Monk, you were right. - It's a perfect match. - Really? They're made by a company called Decorative Gravel. Now that particular color is called Volcanic Tuff. It's not very popular. It's from New Mexico. I talked to the bookkeeper, and she said they only did one, maybe two driveways in the area. So, if this came from somebody's car, and this one came from somebody's driveway At some point, that car was on that driveway. You can bet the farm. Customer service to paint department, please. So? Ashcombe said he never met Dolly Flint, and she said she never met him. Maybe they both just forgot. Nobody move. Nobody move! Hello. Hello. My name is Adrian Monk. I'm working with the police on a homicide investigation. There is a very valuable piece of evidence somewhere in this store. It's a small pebble. It's about the size of a small pebble. If you could all just just stop, please, and look around What What What are you doing? Sweeping up. Okay, where's the rest of it? - It's not in here.! - Keep looking. It's a small, black pebble. God! Wait a minute. I found it. - I found it. - Where was it? It was in my It must've It must've flown. God! I don't believe I listen to you.! You're driving me nuts.! Adrian, are you sure about this? Well, no. You better be right. I swear, I'll kill you. Monk! What are you doing here? Your housekeeper said we might find you here. Is the dog okay? The dog's fine. Actually, I was just giving her away. Oh, my God. Why? Well, she was Katherine's dog. I'm not much of a pet person. She'll be happier here. You, uh You You didn't return my calls. Well, I assumed they were more calls of condolences. Was I wrong? L l I had a couple questions, uh, about your wife's death. Well, I send you a transcript of the inquest and the coroner's report. Anything else? She She was insured, wasn't she? / Yes. There was a $2 million accidental death policy. Now, I know that seems like a lot of money to some people, but considering the lifestyle that we enjoyed, it was not at all excessive. - Is there anything else? - I found this this piece of gravel in the tire of your car. And, uh, it matches the gravel outside the psychic's house. Can you explain that? Are they unique? Oh. Yes, very. I don't have to explain it. Can you explain it? Not yet. You know, it's no big deal, sir. We were just curious about the gravel. Uh, Adrian, I think we better go. We're gonna be late. You'd better listen to her, Monk. You're in my way. That's right. I am. Dolly? Ready to go in five minutes. Okay. What do you want from me, Monk? Did that director have a British accent? I think so. What's his name? Forget it. He's gay. He doesn't know it yet, but forget it. What do you want from me, Monk? How 'bout the truth for a change? I have been telling you the truth. Okay? I fell asleep. I woke up. Hello! There's Mrs. Ashcombe. There's no smoking. There's no smoking. - I believe you, Dolly. - Thank you, sweetie. - What's his problem? - My problem is simple. It's not possible. Well, how do you explain it then? Miss Flint, this is not a game. If you are somehow involved Involved? How? With your friend, Harry Ashcombe. I met the man once for 30 seconds. You were there! He's been to your house. - Impossible. - I can prove it. I think I'd remember. Dolly, we're talking about premeditated, first-degree murder. I think Ashcombe killed his wife, and then recruited you to find the body. That's accessory after the fact, aiding and abetting these are very serious charges. - I am not a criminal. - I've seen your rap sheet. You're not exactly Mother Teresa. That is just nickel-and-dime stuff. Come on.! You wanna know the truth? I'm not sure my heart could take it. Come here. Mr. Monk, when I woke up on that hill, I couldn't believe it myself. The truth is I'm a fake. I never really had the gift. Don't tell the girl. I wanted it. I pretended to have it. Once in a while when I was a kid, I thought I actually did have it. But the only gift I had was telling people what they wanted to hear. It was a sham my entire life. Until Tuesday. That was the real deal, Monk. I swear on my sainted mother's eyes, Mrs. Ashcombe led me to that car. I always wanted to help the cops, you know. Like really help them on a big case. And I did it! Maybe I'm just a late bloomer. Whatever the case, this time I am telling you the truth. We got a break in an hour. Let's try and get it together, please. - What is wrong? - You wanna know what's wrong? I'll tell you what's wrong. I believe you. Hello? - Have you been talking to the police? - No. Don't lie to me, Jennie. Hey, Monk. Monk, I've been looking for you. How did you know we were here? Sharona's kid told me. I have a message for you. Benjy wants to have a sleepover at Drew Cunningham's house. - Are his parents gonna be home? - I don't know. - Did he call from Drew's? - I have no idea. You've been talking to the commissioner. - Where did you park? - Where did I park? I parked up top. Monk, I told you not to talk to him. The man just buried his wife. Why didn't you take the service road? It comes all the way down. I couldn't find it. The last time I was here, I had a driver, okay? Couldn't find it. Yeah, neither could we. - So what? - Dolly Flint found it. She'd never been here before, and she found it. Before dawn? How is that possible? She's psychic. A little bird told her. I don't know. / Leland. I'm talking to the best cop I know. You gotta get on board here. Ashcombe was sleeping around. That's common knowledge. Sharona, could you take a break, please? Please? He had muddy boots in his closet. I have muddy boots in my closet. Look, I knew you were crazy, but I didn't know you were suicidal. Did you accuse Harry Ashcombe of murder to his face? Not in so many words. Well, there goes your career. What career? / Exactly. And you wonder why you're not wearing a badge. Here's what happened. Ashcombe did his wife, but he had a problem. There was a mud slide that night. The car was buried. He couldn't collect a dime until they found her. What could he do? He couldn't just say, ""Maybe we should dig over there."" Somebody else had to find her. - So he paid Dolly Flint? - Too dangerous. She'd never keep her mouth shut. Ashcombe arranged for her to find the body. Right. But how did he do that? I think I know. Can you prove it? Only if you help me. Everyone, please concentrate. - Ah, it's faint. - What is this? It's coming through. Leland, what's going on here? Who let you in? You did. I talked to your lawyer, Harry. We have full unrestricted access. I thought you were just gonna look around. Shh, please. Her aura is very strong. She's here. I can feel her. Complete the ring. Mr. Monk, complete the ring. Uh, I think the ring is fine. Mr. Monk, we need you. Complete the ring. Who am I speaking to? Tell me. What is your name? There's a woman reported missing in San Anselmo. A travel agent. A 32-year-old Jennie Zeppettelli. Jennie? / Yeah. We contacted Miss Flint after the success she had with your wife. - We thought we'd use her again. - And? And she's been on her trail all day. We followed her here. We think she's in your house. - You can't be serious. - Jennie? Is that you? She's here. Oh, she's in pain. I can feel her. There's something in this room. Look! Sharona, don't touch it! A sandal, size six. - What? - According to her sister, she was wearing sandals when she disappeared. - Is that blood? - Yeah, it looks like it. - Bag it. - This is insane! How did that get here? She's close. She's very close. Are you all right? Stay away. It's Jennie. She's here. There's nothing here! What is it, Dolly? What is it? It's blood. And hair. Human. That's impossible. - Lieutenant. - I got it. Jennie? She's calling me. I'm coming! Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, dear God. No.! / Jennie.! Oh, my God.! I swear Stand back, Commissioner. This is a crime scene. He did it. He killed her. Me? Are you crazy? I loved this woman! He invited her here. She said it was over. He exploded. She tried to run away, but he chased her down. No! / He grabbed the poker. And then he straddled her, and he was just pounding just pounding her! - No, she's crazy! - She says now at least she can be with Abigail. Abigail is what she named her unborn baby. Last summer, you made her have an abortion. How do you know that? She knows everything. She's psychic. Leland, don't listen to her. This This is some kind of a trick.! She's a fake.! - She's not a fake. - Yes, she is! - She found your wife's body. - No, she didn't! - She did. I was there. - No, no, no! She didn't find anything! I drove her there! You drove her? Is that what you said? - Did you hear that, Captain? - L l Look, Leland Hello, Harry. I told you you'd be sorry. When I told Jennie what we were trying to do here, she was anxious to help. She knew you had to be stopped. A mud slide that was your problem. Somebody other than yourself had to find Katherine's body. So you went looking for just the right psychic. And Dolly Flint was the perfect choice. From her file, you knew that she took medication to help her sleep. What did you use, chloroform? Something to keep her sleeping. You put on a wig. You drove her to the crash site. You even ran a red light or two to make sure you were seen. In the morning, she woke up and found your wife. I have nothing to say. That's quite all right, sir. You've said enough. Harry, I'm going to advise you of your rights. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court oflaw. How did you know she was a fake? Who? Dolly? Dolly Flint? They're all fakes. You gotta be a little skeptical, Sharona, otherwise, you end up believing in everything U.F.O. S, elves, income tax rebates. Well, it's better than believing in nothing. - I feel sorry for you. - Thank you. - Don't pet Don't pet Don't pet - Oh, it's so Come here. - Winston. Here, boy. - Is he yours? - Yes, he is. - What kind of dog is he? Not worth the trouble. That's what kind. Are you British? / Guilty. Oh, God. I'm Sharona. / Hi. And this is my friend Adrian. Adrian Monk. And, um, you are? - Daniel. - Oh, Daniel. With a ""D."" Adrian, I notice you touching all the poles. Is that an American thing? Yes, that's an American tradition. I'm touching all the poles because I'm proud to be an American. Excuse my asking, but are you two together? Me Me and Monk? No. No, we're not. It's not It's not that funny. Yes, it is pretty funny."

Get up. They hang out, relax, eat brunch. They don't stay at home vacuuming their rug 40 times. Mom, we're not exactly normal. We are compared to some people. Okay, who do you want to be? Okay. Oh, boy. Honey, remember we talked about how Mr. Monk has trouble making decisions? Oh, yeah. Okay, you'll be Colonel Mustard. - Good. - Now, you remember how to play? You write down all the clues on your pad. I'm ready to guess. Adrian, you have to play the game. You have to go around the board from room to room collecting clues. - I know who did it. - We haven't started yet. Come on. It was Professor Plum in the dining room with a rope. He's right. We played this game last year. I remember what cards everybody was holding and how they were put away. And then, just now, - I was watching how Benjy shuffled - That's it. That-That is the last time I ever play a game with you, Adrian. You are just no fun. / Okay. I mean, don't you ever wonder why you never get invited anywhere? - No, not really. - Well, this is why. - Okay. - I think it's awesome. Mom, can I bring him to school, please? Like for show and tell? You can take him every day. Hello? Oh, hey, Captain. Yeah, he's right here. Stottlemeyer. Oh, well, actually, uh, we were just finishing up a pretty big case. It was this nasty homicide, um, This woman was found murdered in her dining room with a rope. Yeah. Hold on, let me check our schedule. It's a job. Hey, Monk. Glad you're here. Miss Fleming. ""Glad you're here?"" God, you must really be desperate. Usually the mayor's office has to shove us down your throats. Fact is, the mayor's office did call, but this time I did not argue. We have an unusual situation here. Yes? What do we have? Homicide with a baseball bat. You know the exact time of death? We know because she was on the phone with 911 at the time. - Adrian. Wait, wait. - What? Uh, Captain, before we get started, could you just initial this agreement? - It's our standard consultation fee. - It's what? Our standard consultation fee. Could we take care of that later, Sharona? Not now. / Adrian. I prefer to take care of business first. Bet that's not the first time you've said that. Bite me. Give me that. Whoa, look at these prints. This was a big guy. Yes, he was a really big guy. Parked nearby, maybe around the corner. Walked through here and went in through the side door. Yeah, and the lock's still intact. It wasn't jimmied. She must have left it open. And what's all this? These are rocks from the garden. Killer left them like this. It's a message. He's toying with us. Some sort of code, but I haven't been able to figure it out yet. You think the killer stopped here in plain view of the neighbors, went rooting around in the garden, collected a few rocks and then arranged them carefully on the grass? What do you think? I think he was looking for a hide-a-key. I found it. Oh, man. Oh, God. I don't feel so good. This is like a feng shui nightmare in here. Adrian, you gotta calm down. You're rambling. Come on. Monk, Monk, Monk. Was there a fire? L-I smell something. In the kitchen. Hey, hey, hey. It's a crime scene. Okay. I know. I'm just It's okay, I'll knock it all over again. Don't worry. How many intruders? Are you guys gonna tell me what's going on? Not yet. - Adrian, please. - How many intruders? - Just one. - One. Just one. - Just one - Monk, leave it. What's-What's with this? That's a smoke alarm. She was in the kitchen cooking something when he broke in. It started to burn. A little girl across the street saw the guy turning it off. So there was a witness? She's 10 years old. She didn't see much. So the perp breaks in. He goes berserk in here. The victim runs upstairs and calls 911. - It's strange. - What's strange? The phone. He didn't take the phone off the hook. So, what, he just let her call 911? Any prints? Nope. Nothing so far. So she's here cooking. He breaks in. He's a big guy. Lot of noise. He must have cornered her in here, and then chased her out and caught up with her in the bedroom? I would've grabbed a knife. - Why didn't she grab a knife? - I don't know. She was over here on the phone. Severe blunt trauma to the head with a baseball bat. - Has this phone been touched? - No. No. The scene's intact. The antenna has to be up to get a signal in here. So? Somebody lowered it all the way after the call. You don't usually see that when someone's getting bludgeoned to death. - Oh no, this can't be the victim. - Yep. I recognize her. Wasn't she a judge? Katherine Lavinio. State Superior Court. We should check the court records. Somebody probably just lost a case and held a grudge. We don't have to check anything, because we know who did it. - What? - The judge identified him by name on the phone. Then why are we here? Because the man who did it couldn't have done it. I'm sorry, Mr. Biederbeck, that's out of the question. / Hold on. Now is it Danny or Daniel? Danny, sir. Fine, Danny. If you screw with me, I'll eat your heart on a stick. - Now the S.E.C - My boss is busy right now, sir. I know your boss is busy, Danny, I'm watching him. Tell him Dale Biederbeck wants an answer - now, not later. - Yes, sir. Now, is he in or out? If he's in, tell him to clean his glasses. Congratulate the congressman, he's just been reelected to a fifth term. Oh, it's better than the Home Shopping Network. Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not finished! This stuff will kill you. I'm not gonna die. You won't let me, will you, Doctor? Ooh, ooh, ooh. Right on time. Dale Biederbeck? They call him Dale the Whale. I never heard of him. He spends a fortune every year making sure nobody ever hears of him. He buys newspapers just to keep his name out of them. All right. I want everybody to be careful in there. This guy is smart. He's gonna try to bait you. Assume you're being videotaped. Do not accuse him of anything. Monk, I don't have to remind you that this bastard's got deep pockets, and he's got a platoon of lawyers and he loves to use them. You met him? What happened? Good afternoon. I'm Christiaan Vezza. I am Mr. Biederbeck's personal physician. I'm Captain Stottlemeyer, Lieutenant Disher, Adrian Monk and Sharona Fleming. Sharona, enchante. Could you spell your last name for me, Doctor? V-E-Z-Z-A. Mr. Biederbeck is expecting you. Really? Well, I didn't tell him we were coming. Mr. Biederbeck is never surprised. Well, my, my, my, it's the boys in blue. And the former boy in blue. Forgive me if I don't get up. Now, now, now. Come on now, Bentley. I'm sorry. He hates cops. Mr. Biederbeck, I am Captain Stottlemeyer. This is Lieutenant Disher and this is Adrian Monk. Oh, I know Adrian Monk. - How long has it been, my friend? - Seven years. Seven years. You look good. How do I look? You look great, Dale. Hardly recognized you. Mr. Biederbeck has lost 104 pounds since March. It's my own patented diet. High-protein juices and shakes. Of course, the hard part is keeping it off. And this must be Sharona. The little nurse that saved his life. Come here, my dear. Let me get a look at you. Come on. I won't bite. Come closer. Tell me, are you still doing house calls? Um, l-I don't do that anymore. Oh, that's a shame. Call me if you change your mind. You know, my night nurse just quit. Didn't give notice, can you imagine? Excuse me. Excuse me, putz? You're blocking the view. It's really all I have. Mr. Biederbeck, we are investigating the murder of Judge Katherine Lavinio. - I believe you knew her. - Knew her very well. She was a political slug, and I wasn't shy about saying so. Her antitrust ruling cost me $210 million, and this was back when $210 million was a lot of money. Whoever killed her did the world a favor. Is this your bat? Captain, do I look like I play a lot of baseball? Well, how do you explain your initials, D.B., on the handle? Well, the question really is, how do you explain it, Peewee? Maybe you put them there. Are you accusing us of tampering? Wouldn't dream of it. But I could probably convince a jury of it. The first 20 numbers on my speed-dial are all lawyers. Shall I call one? Adrian, by the way, I was very sorry to hear about Trudy. I know she was your beloved, and I heard that during our little difficulty, you never left her side, not even once. Where were you last night, about 10:30? Last night. Let me see, 10:30. Um, oh, yes. I was here. I haven't left this bed in 11 years. Even if I could, I can't make it through the door. I'm five-and-a-half-feet wide if you haven't noticed. More of me to love, Sharona. I know what you're thinking. Is he really that big? What's under those covers? I would confirm and swear under oath that my patient weighs over 800 pounds. He's not faking anything. Excuse me, are you my lawyer? - Are you my lawyer? - No, sir. Then shut up and stop defending me. Your job is very simple. You keep me alive. Can you handle that? Yes. / Good. Where were we? Bread and butter. - What? - Bread and butter. Those were Trudy's last words, weren't they? The transcript of the coroner's inquest is a matter of public record. The Internet, Monk, it's the fat man's best friend. It's been troubling me for years. What could she have meant? Bread and butter. Go to hell. No doubt I will. I just hope it's handicapped accessible. No, no, no, no. Nunca me interrumpas. Dije que no.! Afuera! Afuera! A trained monkey could do better. Mr. Biederbeck, this is not a joke. We have evidence, and it's overwhelming. / Is it? Yes, it is. You have motive. You were identified by name on the 911 call. A child in the neighborhood saw you in the judge's house that night. Oh, my God, that sounds like a strong case, Captain. What do you think, Monk? I think you killed her. Prove it. There's no way. Forty-five inches. There's no way, Captain. The elevator's even smaller. What do you think? He did it. That's all I know. How about a crane through the window? A construction crane lowered him to the street? Without anybody noticing? It's impossible. Gentlemen. Sharona. Welcome to the freak house. Excuse me. Doctor, how long have you worked for Biederbeck? I met him nine years ago while I was writing an article on the morbidly obese. He funded my clinic and all my research. In exchange, I am on call 24 hours a day. I sold my soul to the human wrecking ball. Will you excuse me? Helicopter. How about a helicopter? I thought you could use this. Thank you. - So you're a nurse? - Mmm. I was. Where did you intern? Modesto General. So you knew Michelle Bletched? Oh, oh, my God, yes. ""The Wretched Miss Bletched."" Attention, everyone. Attention. This is not a drill. God. That-That is amazing. You sound just like her. Yes, you should hear my Katharine Hepburn. That's very good. Very good. Well, uh, thank you. Thank you. I would, uh I would love to buy you a real drink sometime. When do you get off work? In December. No. Little joke. Excuse me, Doctor. Now, if Biederbeck is too big to get out of the room, how'd he get there in the first place? He's like a ship in a bottle. Well, when he first bought the apartment, he weighed a mere 422 pounds. He could still walk. On a good day, he could see his toes. Then his mother died, and he had a complete breakdown. He started bingeing. He would call restaurants and order everything on the menu. He topped out at 927 pounds. That was a decade ago. He has not left the room since. Like I said, it's just not possible. Request denied. Your Honor, this is a very unusual case. - If you'll just let me explain the details - Denied, Lieutenant. How can I issue a search warrant? Your so-called primary suspect can't possibly be guilty. He can't leave the room or go down the elevator. - Adrian. - It's all right, Miss Fleming. Mr. Monk is an old friend. Your Honor Your Honor, Mr. Biederbeck may not weigh as much as he claims. I have a deposition here from Dr. Vezza, his personal physician. As well as two other physicians. Did Biederbeck ever threaten the victim? - No. Not exactly. - He confess to the crime? He's too smart for that. But he did it, Judge. And he wants us to know he did it. He's rubbing our faces in it. Your Honor, he was identified by name on a 911 tape. I don't like this any more than you do, Lieutenant. Kate Lavinio was a friend of mine. We had dinner at Tuscany's the night she was murdered. But the law is the law. You tell me how Biederbeck could have possibly committed the crime, and I will serve this warrant personally. Uh-huh. Yes, sir. That was Captain. He said it's okay to go ahead with Plan ""B."" What's Plan ""B""? Sharona going undercover as Biederbeck's nurse. - What? - Thanks for consulting me. She still has her license, right? I mean, Biederbeck needs a nurse. The other one just quit. No. Absolutely not. I forbid it. - Sharona, she's not a police officer. - Well, neither are you. - What? - What, you don't think I can handle this? What are you talking Forget this. I know Biederbeck, you don't. He's dangerous. This man is capable of anything. He weighs 804 pounds. What is he gonna do, break wind on me? Let me explain the arrangement here. I'm the employer. You work for me. I get to say what goes, and I say no. Yoo-hoo, Sharona? Come out, come out wherever you are. I know you can hear me. Hello. Oh, my God. Florence Nightingale? I need food. Crap. Oh, there you are. Didn't you hear the buzzer? I'm starving. - I'm wasting away here. - Sorry. Where were you? I was in the kitchen. I couldn't find a tray. Liar, liar. Remember, there are no secrets in the house of Biederbeck. You should know that. Hold on. You know, Conroy is looking tired. Why don't you put in a left-hander. Oh. You know, most of my other nurses sit on the chair. You must be attracted to me. Look, l-I'm just trying to do my job. Okay? So, did you find what you were looking for? What do you mean? Don't be clever with me, Sharona. You're not up to it. I know that Monk sent you here to spy on me. No, he didn't. You decided to come on your own. - Fantastic. - That-That's not true. Of course it is. Hey, did he tell you about his wife and me? - I know all about it. - No, you don't. He didn't tell you. He's too ashamed. See, nine years ago, his beloved Trudy wrote a piece on me in which she said I was the Genghis Khan of world finance. So I sued her and the rag that published the piece. Now, I knew I couldn't win, but I dragged things on long enough that eventually Mr. And Mrs. Monk had to sell everything. Even that cute little starter house they lived in. You know who owns it now? You. / Mm-hmm. I use it to store my pornography collection. Which reminds me, are you interested in earning a little extra money? Oh-Oh, come on, now. Don't be like that. I mean, after all, Sharona, I know how you paid your rent back in Miami. What kind of dog is that? Sweetheart, if you want to feel my stomach, all you have to do is ask. No, I wasn't trying Of course you were. You were thinking, ""My God, can he really be that big, or is it a trick?"" Let's find out, shall we? Totally Â¢Ã Alfresco Â¢Ã Oh, my God. Mom, are you okay? You've been in there all morning. Go away.! Mr. Monk is here. Tell him I hate my job and I quit. I've never seen her freak out like this. I told her not to go! In case you're wondering, yes, he really is that fat, okay? He's Orca! He's horrific! He also had videotapes of the judge. What kind of tapes? Interviews she did for TV. He had about 10 of'em. Wait. Hello. Yeah, he's here. It's for you. - Hello. - Bread and butter. Bread and butter. It's been driving me crazy. What could she possibly have meant? Bread and butter. I figure it was a message. A secret message just for you. What can I do for you, Dale? Well, I'm a little worried about Sharona. She sort of fell apart on us last night. I'm really not sure if we can count on her, Adrian. You have other things to worry about. You can't scare me. Don't even try. You're meek. Meeky, meek, meek. Ooh, ooh. Gotta go. The Munich markets are closing. Toodle-loo. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm eating my lunch, but, you know, I only take 20 minutes for lunch. No, no, no, no. I appreciate you squeezing me in. Okay. So, uh, we were talking about Dale the Whale. His name is, uh His name is Biederbeck. Yeah, I know. He owns my building. I'm not surprised. He owns half the city with, uh, you know, with an option on the other half. Well, do you think he had like-like a vendetta against Trudy? It was grueling. I would find her sitting in the car in the driveway crying. It was the worst year of her life. She only had 34. He stole one of them. So now he's a suspect in this homicide case. - How does that make you feel? - L-l-I hate the man. Is that wrong? No. No. I think it would be unusual if you didn't What, is there something wrong? Uh Yeah, um, tomato sauce on chin. Okay. Good. Thank-Thank you, Adrian. What is that? That is a doggie bag. My wife and I went out for dinner last night. And you couldn't finish? - You were full? - Yeah. That's right. You were full. You-You brought the rest home in a doggie bag. Am-Am I missing something here? Adrian, do you know who asked me out? / Hmm? I'll give you a hint. He's a doctor. Kervorkian? Very funny. Christiaan Vezza. I just love that name, Christiaan. You know who he's named after? Christiaan Barnard, who performed the first human heart transplants. Yes, I know who Christiaan Barnard was. Help me out here. She lives alone. She's about to start cooking something. Stir-fried beef. That's a meal, not a bedtime snack. So? Why? Maybe she was hungry. No. She went out to eat that night. Remember? Doggie bags. She couldn't finish her dinner, so why was she cooking? I have no idea. Maybe she wasn't. Maybe after she was dead, the killer came back downstairs to cook something himself. - Why? - To make smoke. To set off the smoke alarm in there. My God. That's Dale Biederbeck's housekeeper. You worked for the judge. You cleaned her house? Then what happened? - The man, el gordo - Adrian, stop it. The fat man. The big whale, he called me. He offered me more money. More than double to work for him. Adrian / I know. I know. And then, the man the fat man He was always asking me questions about the judge. When did she work? Who were her friends? How late does she sleep? I tried not to answer. But he kept asking. Did he ask you how she locked her doors? Yeah. And you told him about the hide-a-key? The key in the rock? Oh, Senor Monk. Lo siento. Perdoname.! It's okay. - You know what, we gotta go now. - Shh, shh, shh. - Don't-Don't No, no. - Thank you very much. Thank you. - It's all good. - We're gonna go now. - We gotta go. - We have to go. Sharona, just give me one more second. What time is it? No. Don't ask. Whew. Oh Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe we're looking at this all wrong. Maybe he killed her in his apartment, and then he somehow moved the body back to her house. No. What about the 911 call? She made it from the house. Right. - What about liposuction? - What? Liposuction. Yeah. He ""lipoed""himself down to, like, I don't know, like, 400 pounds. Down the elevator, crossed town, killed the judge. Well, how did he gain all the weight back? - Reverse liposuction. - Oh, my God. Yeah. He just pumped it all back in. You think that's possible? I don't know. Should I call a doctor? No. Let's keep our reverse liposuction theory to ourselves. Okay, Randy? Hi. Uh, which one of you is Sue Ellen? Hi. My name is Sharona, and this is my friend Mr. Monk. He just wants to ask you a couple of questions about what you saw the night that the judge was, um - Brutally slain. - Yeah. That's right. - Is he a policeman? - He was. - What happened? - I had a breakdown. I was nearly catatonic for about three and a half years. I already talked to the real police. Three times. I know, but Mr. Monk has a different way of looking at things. Make them buy some lemonade. I'll only talk if you buy some lemonade. That's the rule. Oh. Okay. He has to buy some too. No-No, thanks. Buy some lemonade. Okay, fine. I'll just have a small very, very small. Yeah, that's It's our own recipe. Mmm, that hit the spot. Thank you. Okay, now it's your turn. I want you to think back to that night. You were walking your dog. Yeah, I was walking my dog by the big house over there. Like I do every night. The smoke alarm went off, so I looked. And what did you see? You familiar with the term extortion? Just drink it. Go on. So I looked, and I saw this really fat guy in the house. No, I mean like, really fat. Like, fat fat. Yeah, fat. Then he opened the curtains, stood on the chair and turned off the alarm. Okay, Sue Ellen, I just want to be absolutely sure. The alarm sounded, and then you saw the curtains open up? Oh, look at that. Is that right? Smoke alarm and then the curtains? Yep. Why would he open the curtains before he turns off the alarm? He was putting on a show. What kind of show? He was putting on a show for you. Adrian. Adrian. Sit and stop it. Okay. / Just sit! Adrian, you know how much I like this guy, Dr. Vezza, right? - Uh-huh. - Okay. Now, look at me, please. I know you're gonna embarrass me, and I know you can't help yourself. But I am just asking you No, you know what, I am begging you, if you can just try not to embarrass me too much. / Uh-huh. Just one or two questions and you're done. Hello. Oh. Doctor. Doctor, sorry to bother you. I hope this isn't a bad time. Actually, I'm in the middle of a session, but, uh, yes, I think I can spare a few minutes. - Hey there. - Hi. I'm, uh, really looking forward to Friday night. - I hope you like Thai. - Oh, I love Thai. Oh, good. Because there's a new place at the Embarcadero that I hear is just fantastic. Doctor, uh, just wanted to ask you, uh, / One. A couple of questions about your benefactor Mr. Biederbeck. Miss Fleming was at his apartment last night / I heard. Whatever he paid you, it wasn't enough. While she was there, Miss Fleming happened to notice some videotapes of Judge Lavinio. Do you know anything about them? Yes, I recorded them. They were, uh, TV interviews, uh, news clips. We're fine with that. You're done. Yes, and do you know why Mr. Biederbeck wanted them? He was absolutely obsessed with her. He wanted to know everything about her. - And, Doctor - Oh, my God. What is that? Ah, this is the self-esteem mirror. It's one of my inventions. Now, this is what you look like, and this is the inner you. This is the you we're working toward. L-I love this. Best bud, right? Excuse me. I see you found another of my inventions. - The empathy suit. - Dr. Vezza? Who had a birthday? Oh, mine, actually. Last week. You missed a great party. You're 37. Yes. I was conceived during the big blackout of 1965. Would you excuse me? We really have to work on our ""Not embarrassing Sharona skills."" - Thirty-seven. - What? He's 37. So what? If he's 37-years-old, then I know how the judge was killed. Did you get the red dress I sent you? This is too weird just talking to a camera. Do you want me to wear it? That's the idea, sweetheart. It's Captain Stottlemeyer. - Hello, Mr. Biederbeck. - Captain. I really wish you would've called. I'm a little busy at the moment. I'm here to arrest you for the murder of Judge Kate Lavinio. That's a warrant. Duly sworn. Sweetheart, I'm gonna have to call you back. Doctor, will you call Howard Klein and tell him we're suing the city for malicious prosecution again. I have hired a local construction company to take out this door. We're gonna get a crane here and lower your fat ass down to the street. A crane? Oh, that's rich. But would you mind explaining to me how I'm supposed to have killed the bitch? I can't leave this room, remember? Mr. Monk. Well, my, my, my. It's the defective detective once more. Lay it on me, Einstein. These two chairs are from the judge's house. The killer stood on one of them when he turned off the smoke alarm. A girl in the neighborhood saw, quote, a very, very fat man standing on it. But there's something funny about the chair. It's not broken. This is Sergeant Cargill from the 14th Precinct. Sergeant, how much do you weigh? - 265. - Would you mind? So how could a very, very fat man have stood on it? There's only one explanation. He was a fat man. Not a heavy man. Lieutenant. I visited your clinic today and borrowed one of your empathy suits. Fat, but not heavy. I believe we have another warrant to serve. You're joking. You were in it together. You killed her. Fat man planned it, but you did it. It was brilliant. You killed her, and then you left clues behind to make it look like Biederbeck did it. Why? Because he's the only person on Earth that couldn't possibly have done it. You wore enormous boots to leave big footprints. Breaking in was no problem. The housekeeper told you about the hide-a-key. I admit I was confused until I figured out the sequence of events. First, you killed the judge. Then you ransacked the house. Of course, you needed a witness. You put on one of your fat suits, set off the alarm, then waited until you were sure somebody was watching. And, finally, you called 911. And you're great with voices, Doctor. He's in the house. He's right downstairs. Biederbeck even supplied you with videotapes of the judge so you could practice. This is insane. Why would I risk everything? You really didn't have a choice, did you, Glenn? I knew Christiaan wasn't your real name soon as you said you were 37 years old. You told Sharona that you were named after Christiaan Barnard, but he wasn't famous until 1967. After you were born. I put the F.B.I. On it. They were looking for you. Your real name is Glenn Q Sindell. You killed a child five years ago. Accident. You were operating on her so doped up, you couldn't see straight. Accident. Convicted of manslaughter and reckless endangerment, you were looking at 15 years minimum. You jumped bail before sentencing, and then you disappeared. Until now. And somehow, somehow, Biederbeck learned your secret. From that moment on, he owned you, didn't he? Listen, I just have to say, fantastic work, really. Both of you, kudos. And-And for the record, I am shocked, shocked, that my personal physician is both a fugitive and a cold-blooded killer. Shocked. But you can't really tie me to the crime, can you? Well, now, that really depends on Mr. Sindell. What do you say, Glenn? Would you like to talk to us? It'll be my pleasure. I'm looking forward to testifying against you. Maybe once and for all, I can redeem myself for everything I've done. All the pain I've caused. I detest you. - Do you? - With every fiber of my being. Biederbeck, you're an abomination. An odious, gluttonous, putrid freak of nature. Wow, it's been a long time since anyone's called me that. Listen, by the time my lawyers are through with you, you're not gonna know which end is up. There's not a prison in the country that can hold me. There's very few shopping malls that can hold you. But, nonetheless, we're gonna give it a try. You What's he doing? I think he's trying to kill me. Wasn't really much of a fight, was it? Adrian, can I ask you something? And if it's none of my business, I promise I'll shut up. I doubt it. What did Trudy mean by bread and butter? Whenever Trudy and I were walking somewhere, we'd hold hands. If there was a lamppost or somebody walked between us, and we had to let go for a second, she'd always say ""bread and butter."" So when she died? Yeah, I think it was a message for me. She was saying, ""I have to let go now for a little while but it won't be forever."""
"I don't like it. You oughta be wearing a wire. Oh. Listen, Leland, we don't even know what he's got. Well, look, maybe I should hang and watch your back. Oh, come on. You worry too much. You always did. Leland, go home. Get some sleep. Past your bedtime. Look, Adam, could you do me a favor? Yeah? When we're in public, you call me Captain, okay? Oh, I'm sorry, Captain. Still can't say it without laughing. How about a photo? Here's your ticket. You can pick it up when you leave. No thanks. John Gitomer? You Kirk? Something you wanted to tell me? No, no, no. I said I had something to sell you. Oh. Okay. What? Shipment of purple haze, I know where, I know when, I know who. You interested? If it's righteous, I'm interested. Okay, but not here. No, this is fine. Hey, hey. Hey! Get your hands off me, man! Listen. You got a problem? I can't talk here. Why not? Up there. No. I don't think so. Who told you to call me? I'll tell you up there. Hey, somebody call the cops.! Hey.! This guy's trying to kill me.! What are you yelling about? Hey.! For God's sake, stop the ride.! Hey, pal - He's killing me.! - Calm down. - He's trying to kill me.! What are you talking about? - Help! - Cut it out. - Help! - Hey.! Calm down.! Somebody call the cops.! - What? I'm not - Hey.! He's trying to kill me.! - Stop the ride.! - Stop the wheel. Let me off. You're a sick puppy. Police officer.! Step back.! Everything's all right. What did you do? Somebody call 911. I didn't do nothing. I was MONK Season 1 Epi. 05 Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2002/08/02 Lieutenant Adam Kirk is, of course, no stranger to controversy. Six year ago he was suspended for using excessive force Have you been drinking? I don't know. A taste. Amphetamines, anything? They're gonna want a blood test. Bring it on. And he was in the news again recently when alleged killer Leonard Stokes accused him of police brutality. - Captain, we got to - Give me 30 seconds, all right? All right. Internal Affairs is gonna try to rip you apart. Well, they've been trying for years. Look, Adam, is there something you wanna tell me? He pulled a knife, there was a fight, it was either you or him? Leland. Leland, I never touched him. There were bruises on his chest. Well, he must've stuck himself. He stuck himself. All right, look, from this point forward, you don't say anything. Mm-hmm. No. You don't speak English. I'm gonna call Sam Dwyer from P.D.A. - And he'll send somebody over. - Leo, I never touched him! Not a word. I'll talk to you later. - Captain. - All right. Let's go. Paul? Well, he was stabbed in the aorta. He was gone before he hit the ground. Self-defense? Maybe. What about the bruises? There was a fight. That's all I know. When I get him down to my beauty parlor, I'll know a little more. Thanks, Paul. All right. I need the lab to run the knife as soon as possible. Yes, sir. And I need Adam charged and booked. Have Parko do that. What am I supposed to do? Two guys go up alone, one of them comes out dead. What do you want me to do? Captain, what about Monk? He might see something that we're not seeing. Monk is no good to anybody right now. He's going before the review board tomorrow. You know how he gets when he's under pressure. He's gonna be a basket case tomorrow. Former Detective Monk, we've been reviewing your file, which includes a statement from your psychiatrist, Dr. Kroger. Now, he says you're still obsessed with the murder of your wife to the point where you are emotionally paralyzed. Do you agree? Well, she was my wife. You can understand. It's not just another case. How's that investigation going? We're stalled. Frankly, it's a dead end. However, there is some good news. Kroger says that you've been showing some significant progress in some of your other problems. Yes, I've been working hard. Since your suspension, you've been working as a private investigator. Is that right? Well, it hasn't made me rich, but, you know, it's what I do. It's what you do. I like that. You feel that you're ready to do what you do for us again? I mean, officially? I think I'm ready. As you know, I've been doing some consulting work for the department. Yes, on eight occasions. It's very impressive. Although, isn't it true, Mr. Monk, that on more than one occasion your phobias have hindered the investigation? For example, last February your fear of heights allowed a suspect in San Anselmo to escape. Well, no officer is without fear of some kind. That's true. We all accept that, as long those fears don't interfere with the performance of his duties. We'll be making a formal recommendation by the end of the week. We have to speak with two or three more people, including Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. Captain Stottlemeyer. As your commanding officer for years, his testimony is crucial. Thank you for coming in. Mr. Monk? Thank you. Thank you very much. We'll reconvene tomorrow at 5:00. How'd it go? It went great! - I was amazing. - Yes. Yes. I was Fred Astaire. Did you remember to bite the tip of your tongue to help you focus? I bit the tip of my tongue. - I was great. - Yes! Get in the car. What are you doing? I'm driving. Get in the car. No, you're not. Sharona, they could be watching me right now from the Don't look from the window right now. Don't look. So what? So I can't let them see you driving me. I'd look like an invalid. So get in the car. No. Get in the car. Will you get in the car? Do you even know how to drive? Yes, I know how to drive. I've never seen you. There's about 15 things that I can do that you've never seen me do. Like what? Drive. I can drive. Get in the car. - Don't - They're not watching! Look, what are you doing looking? What are you doing? Do you even have a license? Of course I have a license. Is it valid? You know what? I'm gonna show it to you. In the car. I just put in a new $1,200 transmission. I'm not gonna wreck your precious transmission. Get in the car. I have an idea. Start yawning. Yawning? Yeah, to make it look like you're too tired to drive. Why would I be too tired to drive? It's 10:00 in the morning. I'm not in kindergarten. I'm trying to get my badge back here! Everybody gets tired. You don't think cops get tired? It's too late to start yawning now. I would have had to start yawning when I was upstairs to set it up. It is not too late to stop yawning right now, because you have to start yawning at some point of the day. Everybody yawns all day. There's no rules. Yawn. Mr. Monk. You're still here. Yeah. Yeah, we're leaving though. We're going. Here we go. Sharona, you coming? Keys. Keys. Good parking spot, though, don't you think? I mean, lucky, lucky. Can't beat it with a stick. Okay, I got it. See you next time. What were you thinking? You said, ""Turn,"" so I turned. No. I mean into the parking lot! Look at my headlight, Adrian! It's nothing. Nothing? It is totally smashed. Look at that! Hello? Yes, he's right here. Now? Okay, we'll be right there. Stottlemeyer. He says it's very important. No! No! Adrian! I'm driving. When hell freezes over, you can drive again. No. You know what? Even if hell freezes over, I'm still driving, because I don't want you driving on the ice. Get in the car! Your Honor, this is not Lieutenant Kirk's first offense. We have a case, docket 4-5-5. Adam Kirk v Leonard Stokes, in which Lieutenant Kirk is accused of police brutality. This is obscene! Don't touch Stokes, but you can string me up right here? Lieutenant, can you or can you not control your temper? I can, Your Honor. Then do it on the street and in my courtroom. Mr. Dwyer? We request that Lieutenant Kirk be released on his own recognizance. Adam Kirk is a decorated officer, and the claims against my client in this case and the case involving Mr. Stokes have not been substantiated. I don't know how much more substantiated a case can get. Bail is set at $50,000. So what do you think? They're on a Ferris wheel alone. The Ferris wheel stops. The guy's dead. I know it looks bad. ""Bad"" is not the word. ""Guilty"" is the word. Kirk has got a temper. We're not denying that. You couldn't deny it. I've seen it firsthand. There's something not right here. He swears up and down he did not touch the kid. Maybe he blacked out or something, you know, like you do. What do you want me to do? I want you to do your thing. I want you to do that thing you do. I've known Kirk for 20 years. He's a great cop. You used to say that about Adrian. Could we not make this a personal thing? This is not about who daddy loves more. Monk, I need this. You do right by me and I'll owe you one, all right? I'd like to talk it over with Sharona. Sure. - What do you think? - I think you should do it. The captain's gonna testify in front of the review board tomorrow. This may be good help. I agree, but let's stay here a minute, make it look like it's a tough decision. Okay. What should we talk about? I don't know. How's Benjy? He's good. What grade is he in now? - Fifth. - Fifth grade. Failing math. It's driving me crazy. Yeah, but - Hey, Monk. - Yeah? We can hear you. All right. Here's the deal. This has gotta be done under the table, all right? - Off the book. - Internal Affairs is all over it. They don't want any outsiders poking around. Okay? Good, Thank you. It's okay. I saw that, Adrian. Look at them out there. Trying to get a picture of a killer cop. Too bad I can't charge them rent. Did you talk to them? I just told them I was a friend. Thanks for lying. You know, I don't hold what you did against you. Why would you? I told the truth. From your point of view. I was there, Lieutenant. - I saw what you did. - It was resisting arrest. I was there. Well, that makes your being here now mean even more. You know what really kills me about this is, uh, I'm supposed to testify against Stokes next week. Best thing I ever did was getting that butcher off the street. Now he's gonna walk. Why would he walk? He claims that I beat a confession out of him. This makes his case. What are you doing? If you don't mind, it helps him think. Oh. Knock yourself out. Wanna tell me what happened on the Ferris wheel? Yeah, that was stupid. I get a call from this punk, Gitomer. You knew him? No. I never met him. I check him out. He's got some punk stuff possession, stolen vehicle. So he wants to meet at the carnival busy place, lot of people. Meet about what? He's got something on a shipment of purple haze. So we meet, he starts hemming and hawing, and then he says that he'll talk, but only on the Ferris wheel. The Ferris wheel's his idea? Oh, yeah. His idea. So we get on. I don't get out word one, he goes postal. You didn't do anything? Hand to God. He starts throwing himself around. He's screaming, ""Help! Help! He's gonna kill me!"" So the operator shuts down the rig. I get off. I walk 10 feet, I hear screaming. I turn around and there's Gitomer on the deck with a knife in his chest. Whose knife was it? Not a clue. And you didn't touch this guy? No, I didn't touch him. Maybe he shoved you, you shoved him back. No, I didn't touch the guy. Things got out ofhand. It happens. No, it doesn't happen! Not to me. Not anymore. How's Anita? Oh, she's good. Thanks for asking. Where is she? You just missed her. She's just out shopping. She should be back, oh, any minute now. Listen, friend, if I'm gonna help you out, y-you can't lie to me. - What? - You two had a fight. She moved out. Now, who told you that? The woman is obviously into gardening, but every plant in the place is dying. Well, she always comes back. I'm done here. You're gonna make somebody a wonderful wife. I can't make any promises. Understood. Okay, remember, we're not officially on the case, so be cool. Yeah. I'll be as cool as you. Mom, how many tickets can we get? I don't know. Okay, let's get a whole sheet, which is $40. I don't know, Benjy. I work for a very cheap man. - How many? - Ten? That's true. She does. He's also a very naive man who doesn't know when he's being used. Hmm? What? Who's being used? You are. Kirk's no good and you know it. He's Stottlemeyer's ex-partner. The captain will do anything to save his ass. He just wants you to come up with one of your convoluted theories so he can parade you in front of a jury. Are you listening to me? What's wrong? The Ferris wheel it's kind of big. I can't go on it. Well, you have to. It's a crime scene. - Nah. Nah. - Benjy, the bumper cars are over there. Uh-uh. Come on.! Please.! We gotta find Stottlemeyer. Hey. Hey. You remember Benjy. Yes. How you doing, Benjy? You're in Little League, right? Yeah. I think my kid beaned you last year. Hey, folks.! How about a photo? - No, thank you. - Come on. It's a souvenir. It's a carnival. One big happy family. - Thank you very much. - Here's your ticket. - You can pick it up on your way out. - Thank you. Let's go. Monk? Adrian? Monk, come on. Here you go. Unclaimed from the day you were asking about. This is everything. Adrian, I promised Benjy I'd take him on the bumper cars, so we'll meet you later, okay? Just stay close to the captain. And if you get lost, find a policeman. - Promise? - Bingo. Look at the sweatshirt. I was thinking the same thing. Zipped all the way up. - But it must've been 95 degrees that night. - Yeah So they meet over there, walk through here, get on the ride, go round and round, it stops and the kid's dead. Did you question the other riders? Oh, yeah. I grilled everybody in the park. I got a list of Internal Affairs. - Hey! - Look, you just happen to be here, okay? It's your day off, understood? - Hey, Walt! - Captain. How are you? Mr. Monk, Walter Cauffel. How's it going? Ah, it's a bitch, bitch and a half. What are you doing here? I'm here with my assistant and her kid. I never figured you the amusement park type. Oh, sure. I love it. It's so, you know, edgy. Heard you're up for reinstatement. Good luck. Thank you. I really should be going. Have you seen Sharona? Yeah. Sharona's right over here. See you. Now, give me a couple minutes and I'll get rid of him, all right? What should I do? Just have fun. - Fun? - Yeah. Look, you've seen other people have fun. Imitate them. I am so hungry. Well, get a hot dog. No. No, thanks. No. Mom, can I have two dollars? Wait. What for? It's a contest. There's a big jar of jelly beans, and if I guess how many are in the jar, I win a boom box. What? That's how many jelly beans are in the jar. Have you seen the jar? How can you guess if you haven't seen the jar? Benjy, 8,385. Okay. Thanks, Mom. Okay. Now you owe me two dollars. There's I.A. Don't look. Come on. We gotta look like we're blending in. Let's go. Yeah. We'll blend. Thank you. No problem. Just take it. Come on. It's good. - Whoops! - Ow! You having fun? I think so. My head stopped throbbing, but too many clowns. Just way too many. Come on. Relax. - Hey! - Oh, my God. Where did you get that? I won it! It was that jelly-bean contest. Mr. Monk was right. You were only off by eight. Adrian, how'd you do that? Lucky guess. No, I'm serious. How'd you do it? Adrian. Adrian, I'm talking to you. Come on, come on. We got about an hour. I sent them to that stripper bar on Baker Avenue. I told them Kirk hangs out there. Hello, Kitty! Aw, hell. I thought you guys were gone. I'm trying to make a living here. I'm sorry. This will only take a minute. Adrian Monk, Kitty Malone. She's been working the Ferris wheel for seven years. Never had a problem, never had an accident till last night. I suppose he wants to hear the story too. Yes, please, if you don't mind. The freakiest thing I ever seen. Two guys got on. A few second later, one of them starts screaming. You mean, Mr. Gitomer? I don't know names. The soon-to-be-dead one. He's screaming, ""Help! He's trying to kill me!"" I looked up. Basket four is rocking back and forth. I figure they're either fighting or falling in love. You You couldn't see what was happening? Nah. You can't really see what's going on up there. So I stopped the ride. You know, I always stop for crying babies and guys knifing each other. Any way, I pop the bar, the cop gets out. He's pissed. He's screaming, ""I didn't do nothin'!"" Where was he? Over there. And the other guy? Doubled over in his seat. He's got a knife in his chest. Then he falls over right there. Come on.! Let's go.! Get it moving.! Two more minutes, then I gotta start charging you guys. Okay, but could you just - Could you take your hand off it. - It's not gonna move. - She's got her hand by the - It's not gonna move. She's right by the control. It's okay. Hurry up.! Thanks, Kitty. Thank you. -  Come on.! -  Let's go.! - Hello. - What? What is that? A tarot card or half of one. Well, anybody could've left that. I think I need to see Gitomer's place. What's it mean, half a tarot card? I don't know. It's a tarot card. Look, Mr. Crenshaw, does it mean anything to you? Yeah. It means you're wasting my time. Mr. Gitomer used tarot cards? I don't see what anybody does. I'm only the landlord. The peepholes on the door face the wrong way, that's what I always say. How long did he live here? Oh, nine weeks, but he paid for 10, so I guess someone has a refund coming. What's this? Mister, you wouldn't believe what I've seen hanging from those fans. Adrian. This is weird. He keeps his batteries in his socks? Oh, my God. What is it? It's a weapon. They use them in prison. It's torn here. Could you Hook it? Stand back. What the hell is that? I think he hit himself with it. All he had to do was ask. I would've been happy to beat the crap outta the kid. I knew he was trouble. Never paid the phone bill, but always had money to go dancing. He went dancing? Yeah. Every night. That club over in the park there the Luna Lounge. Up! We're not open yet! Is this your claim check? Actually, I got something I can show you in the back. Here it is. It's been here for awhile. How long would you say it's been here? - I can't hear you! - I need to know how Thank you. Captain Stottlemeyer, you have used former Detective Monk several times over the last two and a half years. Yeah, that's right. On a consulting basis. Have you been satisfied with his work? Yes, absolutely. He, um He has helped me solve five no, six very difficult cases. He has a unique way of looking at evidence even after a scene is cold. In your professional opinion, do you think Adrian Monk is ready to be reinstated? He is an excellent investigator. I believe we've established that. The question is do you believe he should be reinstated to the San Francisco Police Department? He is reliable. He, uh, has an encyclopedic knowledge of the strangest, most arcane things. Like book binding. - There was a case before he got - Captain, this is a ""yes or no"" question. Now, in your opinion, is he or is he not ready to be reinstated? Yes or no? The people are asking for a continuance, Your Honor. Of course they wanna postpone. Lieutenant Kirk wasn't one of their witnesses, he was their only witness. Now he's accused of murder. Your Honor, my client Leonard Stokes has been in jail for 14 months based solely on his testimony. Mr. Zweibel, are you presenting Adam Kirk or not? We can no longer vouch for Lieutenant Kirk. Then you leave me no choice. Without your witness, the statements that Mr. Stokes made in the back of that squad car are inadmissible. Mr. Stokes. I'm dismissing this indictment. So I'm free to go? I'm sorry to say that's true. Bailiff. I need the yellow copy. Are you gonna tell me how you did thejelly beans? - You know you're gonna tell me, Adrian. - Stokes, Leonard. I need the yellow copy. Wait here. Excuse me. Leonard Stokes? Can I talk to you? It's a free country at least it will be in about 10 minutes. My name is Adrian Monk. I'm investigating the death of John Gitomer. - Did you know him? - No. This is his cell phone. We found it in his knapsack. Mr. Gitomer received two calls from this facility from the phone bank in your wing on the day he was killed. So what? You were calling him. I checked the records. They log in every outgoing call. Sign here. That's a nice watch. Yeah. Gitomer. I remember. He was here. I knew his name. That's all. Why were you calling him? I don't recall. What difference does it make? It's just interesting. You two knew each other and his murder is the basis for your appeal. What's that? It's from my Straight and Sober group. Three-year pin. Very nice. Congratulations. Look, I know where this is going. You're working to clear your pal Lieutenant Kirk. No, no, no. I'm not on the force. Oh, come on. Sure you are. I can smell it. Just looking for the truth. Lieutenant Kirk is a killer cop. That's the truth. Just not the truth you want. You could be right. Is there someplace that I can reach you? No. See you around. Gee, he's a charmer. Oh, my God! Is that the right time? - Stottlemeyer's testifying! - Oh, my God. You look great. I haven't worn it since Trudy's funeral. You sure you're not getting your hopes up? Of course I am. That's what hopes are for. I was gonna smooth it out, but it's I know, I know. Oh, no. Oh, no. You didn't recommend me. - Look, Monk - You son of a bitch. I thought you were gonna do the right thing? I think I did do the right thing. He saves your ass all the time and he never asks for anything in return. He closes case after case, and then he goes home and watches you on the news taking all the credit. I wanted to recommend you, I tried to recommend you, but I just couldn't do it. Adrian, you are not ready to carry a gun. You're not ready to have other cops depend on you under fire. In your heart, you know you're not ready. At least your friend Adam Kirk has the decency to stab people in the front. You okay? I just wanna be alone. Okay. I'll come with you. Hey. Uh, how did it go this afternoon, sir? It was rough. Well, I'm sure that you did everything you could. You, uh, wanna go grab a drink? No. I'm good. Hey, Randy. Did I ever tell you about Monk's first day as a detective? No, sir. Have a seat. He didn't have a partner, so I got stuck with him. Was he you know. No.He was a little wound. He used to wipe off the windshield and rearrange the glove box before we'd roll. Anyway, we're the primaries on a body in a hotel in the Castro. A hooker had swallowed a bunch of promazine you know, the big sleeping pills? Horse tranquilizer, sir. I said, ""Suicide."" Every cop on the scene said, ""Suicide."" Medical examiner said, ""Suicide."" Monk walks in, says, ""Murder. Where's the water?"" The room had no water. Simple. Eight people in the room, but nobody saw that. Well, I'm sure you would've seen it eventually, sir. Don't kid yourself. There is only one Adrian Monk. You're gonna wear out the carpet. Have you seen the downstairs? He cleaned the whole basement. Damn! Damn it! Damn! Damn it! Damn! What happened? Aw. I knew it! Damn. I knew it. I knew this was gonna happen. Ohh. Why me? Every single damn time. Adrian, what happened? I solved the case. Captain? Yeah? Here's your sandwich. Thank you. Ham and cheese on rye and your soda. Goody goody. Want your pickle? Not anymore. Oh. Oh, Sharona Fleming is on line two. Uh, tell her I'll call her back. Well, she says it's important. - Hi, Sharona. - Captain, Adrian knows what happened on the Ferris wheel. Do you want to meet us at the carnival? Let me talk to him. He wants to talk to you. Ohh. He's shaking his head ""no."" Was it Kirk? Was it Lieutenant Kirk? - No. - No. This is crazy, Sharona. Put him on the phone. Adrian, he really wants to talk to you. I'm not talking to him. If you wanna hold the phone up, fine. Hold on. It was Leonard Stokes. He planned the whole thing from prison. His trial was coming up and somehow he had to get his confession thrown out. The only chance he had was to discredit the cop that arrested him, and that was Adam Kirk. Stokes called his pal, John Gitomer. He convinced Gitomer to lure Kirk onto the Ferris wheel and then make it look like Kirk beat him up. The bruises on Gitomer's chest were self-inflicted. That's why his sweatshirt was zipped up all the way. Okay, what about the stabbing? Captain says, ""What about the stabbing?"" I'm getting to that, aren't I? Turn it back. It turns out, Gitomer only knew half the plan. He was the real patsy. Stokes had another partner, someone who worked at the carnival. Someone who loved him. Someone who would kill for him. The Ferris wheel operator? Wait. How does he know it was the Ferris wheel operator? They were both wearing Straight and Sober buttons orange ones. Every chapter has their own color. Took me a while to put it together. Stokes didn't want to make Lieutenant Kirk look corrupt or hot-tempered. He wanted to make Kirk look like a killer. Kitty was there to finish the job. They've been here all week. I've been questioned, like, seven times. Shh. Kitty, baby, I got a plan. Yeah. Yeah, we're here. We're by the Spider. Don't do anything, don't go anywhere. We're on our way. Okay. Okay, they're on their way. They're on their way. Something's wrong. Call an ambulance.! Who is it? Excuse me. - Oh, my God. - I don't know. I heard her scream. He's still somewhere in the park. There's no way he can get out of here now. We should go up on the Ferris wheel so we can see everything. I got a better idea. You go on the Ferris wheel. You can see everything. Do you know how to work it? How hard can it be? Adrian, stop! It's perfect! Looking for me? Well, here I am. You better hang on. - Adrian! - This ride's gonna get pretty wild. Oh, God. Adrian! Adrian, he's up here! Get me down now! What? Stokes is up here! Get me down.! Now.! The man's getting up.! Whoa.! What's he doing? Adrian, get me down! Please hurry! - Hurry up.! - I'm trying.! Look out.! What a stupid place to hide. No wonder this guy spent halfhis life in prison. You just told me down there that you knew how to do this! Look, I am not familiar with this particular model! Do something and do it fast.! Oh, my God. Damn it, he's gonna get me! - It's not working! - Hurry up! Will you stop thinking and do something? Adrian.! He's got a knife.! - Ohh. Oh, my God. - Adrian.! Adrian! Help! What am I doing? What am I doing? You're saving me! Police.! Turn off the damn Ferris wheel. Give it up, Stokes.! I've been looking forward to this. I'm sure you have too. Your badge and your gun. They don't belong in my desk. They belong with you on the street where you can do yourjob. Thanks. Welcome back. Your reinstatement is effective immediately. All right. Vacation's over. Back to work. Just a Just a second. Monk, thanks. Don't give up. Wait a minute. Is that an order? Yes, it is. How'd you guess thejelly beans? Sharona. Sharona, just give me the shoe. No. Not until you tell me. Come on. This is not funny. I can't walk. How did you do it? All right, I'll tell you. As we walked into the carnival, there was a pile of garbage. Pile of garbage? Yes, and I noticed that they were throwing away some empty jelly bean boxes. They were labeled. Each one contained 1,400 jelly beans. There were six boxes, so that's 8,400 beans. You figure the kid who ran the game ate a couple of handfuls, so that's 8,385. Now, can I have my shoe, please? You remembered how many empty boxes you saw? Yes. It's a blessing and curse. Please don't ever take my shoes again. It's not funny. It never will be funny. It won't be funny the next time you do it. Stop laughing."

I shouldn't even be here. I know you you probably have heard that before. Why don't you grab a seat, and we'll talk about it. This is a test, isn't it? What do you mean? You want to see which chair I pick. No, Adrian, it's not a test. Just grab a seat. The left chair. Very interesting. I'm just kidding. Relax. It's just a joke. That's a marlin, isn't it? That's right. It's one of two things I managed to catch in Mexico in '97. - What was the other? - Dysentery. What about last week? Did you catch anything?

But how did you know it was specifically a fishing trip? You have a blister on the index finger of your right hand just above the knuckle.

That's what I do. I'm a detective. - Really? - Seven years, Sonoma County. Lieutenant, second-grade. Homicide. Really? This is unbelievable. That's a lot of laundry for a guy who just got here yesterday. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Come on. Let me give you a grand tour. The cafeteria closes at 7:00. It's buffet-style. This is the Music Room. And if you go through these doors, down the hall, that'll take you to the infirmary. This is the Monkey Room. Funny story about how it got its name. What is it? We don't know. We just know there's a funny story. What's all this? They're tearing down the old walls. They're bringin' it up to code. It's a pretty big project. I used to be in construction myself. - Before you became a cop. - Exactly. Yeah. Who's this? This is Doris Medford. She was the first director here. These are all the other directors. Dead. Dead. Dead. Not dead yet. - Hello, Wurster. - Torch. She burned her boyfriend's house down. This is the Quiet Room. Don't get sent here. Oh, boy. What's this? This is the Medical Supply Room. Gives me the creeps. Why? There was a murder here. Oh, really? A murder? An unsolved murder. Conrad Gould, the assistant director, well, he was killed right here four years ago. He was a great guy. Gave me magazines. Playboys. - Right. - Hey. Hey, maybe we can solve it together, huh? Yeah, sure. Great. What What happened exactly? Well, Dr. Gould was taking inventory, like he did every night. A patient named Bill LaFrankie was waiting for him. Hey. Capped him in the chest. Then he fled S.O.C. ""S.O.C.""? Yeah. ""Scene of the crime."" It's cop talk. They found him in the woods the next morning. He was dead. He shot himself up with Demerol. Uh, I'm a little confused. Why would you call it an unsolved murder? Well, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the official version. - You weren't? - No, sir. They never found the gun, first of all. Plus, Bill LaFrankie was my roommate. He was a devout Buddhist. He wouldn't hurt a spider. Speaking of spiders, there was a guy here named Jim Robertello about two two years ago. No. About three years ago. No, no, no. Two years Two or three About two and a half years ago maybe. It doesn't really matter. / It doesn't really matter how many years ago it was. But he had a spider named Jesse Jesse the spider. And Jesse Every time you played a Willie Nelson record, he would start dancing. He'd get into it. Fabulous dancer. Cha-cha  He'd get all his arms What's goin' on? Oh. Hey, Oliver. / This is a restricted area, Wurster. You know that. I was just telling Mr. Monk about Dr. Gould. That's ancient history. Mr. Monk has enough problems. You're late. Time for art therapy. Hey, fellas. Carry on. Remember, this is supposed to be a self-portrait. How do you feel about yourself? Look deep inside. There's no right or wrong. It's a little erogenous. Very good. I love those eyes. Excuse me, Doctor. Is there a sink nearby? l I need to wash up. Will you shut him up! He has been whining since he walked in here. ""It's too hot. It's too cold. I have charcoal on my hands!"" Jane, what did we talk about yesterday? Controlling the urge to lash out. Do you have something you wanna say to Mr. Monk? Sorry. That's okay. I do have a little charcoal on my hands. Dr. Lancaster, Dr. Lancaster, guess what I'm painting. - Santa Claus! - All right, all right. Well, you know this is supposed to be a self-portrait. - That's me. - Why are you so small? Everybody's small compared to Santa. He actually sits up every night and waits for him. I have a feeling he's on his way. It's definitely getting colder outside. It's August, whack job! Is there a problem, Mr. Monk? I'm having a little trouble getting started. Do you know why? Maybe it's because you're afraid it won't be perfect. And you're right. It won't be perfect. Not everything is going to be perfect. But, come on. Why don't you just draw something? I've only got you for 48 hours. I like it. How does it feel? It feels good. Into the Quiet Room! She's gonna need more meds! Call Dr. Lancaster and tell him that Jane's losing it! Try his cell phone! Santa. I went to the Stop & Shop, but instead of walking home up Divisadero street, l I turned left and I walked down Trudy's old street to her house. Door was open, so I walked in. And how did you feel being in the house again? Content, not a care in the world. Adrian, when did this urge begin to manifest itself? John, I'll run the therapy session today, okay? Fair enough. / And later, you and I can talk privately. About Monk? / No. About your tendency to over-empathize. I feel like I'm back in medical school again. Dr. Lancaster, can I go next? Just a minute. Just a minute, okay? Go ahead. I, uh, I really feel sorry for the Haskells. Who are the Haskells? Who are the Haskells? The couple that live in the house. Nick and Josie. Sweet people, and, uh, l My wife had a necklace exactly like that. Well, I'm not giving it to you if that's what you're getting at. Dr. Lancaster, can I please go next? Last night, I saw Santa Claus. All right. I'm sure we'd all like to hear about it. Go ahead. Okay. It was around 4:00. I was asleep in my room. I heard sounds outside. They were footsteps on the roof. And I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. It was him, as big as life. He was standing by the big chimney getting ready to slide down. Then his cell phone rang. His cell phone? He answered it, and then he started talking to somebody. It's true. I can prove it. I took his picture. You-You took some pictures? Yeah. I always keep my camera by the window. I'm sure we'd all like to see them when they get developed. And who's next? Well, that's not a pair. Actually, that's a jack, and this is a king. Close enough. - What are you looking for? - My camera. I put it down right there. I know I did. Manny, what time did you see, you know, Santa Claus last night? I made a note. You wanna see where I saw him? Everyone thinks it's just a children's story. Of course, the Macy's Parade guy and the department store Santas are actors. I'm not an idiot. But there have been over 400 documented sightings of Saint Nicholas scientifically documented. It's on the Internet, so you know it's true. Look. That's an actual picture. Well, Manny, that could be anything. It's Santa Claus. - What happened here? - Mr. Richter. He didn't wanna move. He had this room before me. He put up a big fight. - This happened recently? - Last week. I've been on the waiting list for this room for 11 years. Last week, Dr. Lancaster said I could have it. I wish I had my camera. I had real proof. This This is where you saw him, huh? He was standing right over there. And then his cell phone rang. He answered it, and then he went back that way out of sight. What's that? - Where? - On the chimney. It looks like a rag or a piece of cloth. Manny, just don't fall. Falling is bad. You know that, right? Be careful. There's a lot of, you know, gravity out there. Can you reach it? I think so. Okay, Manny. Look around. Are there any footprints? - I see mine. - Besides yours. Yes! They're all over. He was here! This is proof, isn't it? This is evidence. Oh, I can't wait till my next session. This'll shut 'em up. Actually, Manny, I think we should probably keep this just between you and me. No. Why? Well, maybe we'll find more proof. And then they'll have to believe us. - Fine. - Good. And by the way, Manny, were you here when Dr. Gould was murdered? Oh, yeah. They quoted me in the newspaper. I'll show you. I saved all the articles. ""An unidentified patient stated that Dr. Gould was very popular and would be greatly missed."" Uh-huh. That's me the ""unidentified patient."" This table needs to move over here, out of the way. Perfect. - Okay, this is the medical closet. - That's the arts and crafts closet. I know, but we're pretending it's the medical closest. That's the arts and crafts closet. Okay, Manny, you're Dr. Gould. You're making your rounds. You're coming down the hall. He used to clean his ear, remember? You enter the Supply Room. There's the cabinet. You unlock it. Okay, Johnny, you're Bill LaFrankie. / Yeah. You're looking to steal some drugs. / Yeah. You sneak up on the doctor. And Bang. / Bang. Bang. And Dr. Gould is dead. LaFrankie goes to steal the drugs. And you run away. Run away. Okay. Let me think. The keys. Manny left the keys in the door Which is what anybody would do. But look at the picture. Look at where the keys are. The keys are still in the doctor's pocket. I don't think he ever opened the locker. Maybe LaFrankie shot him, took his keys and then opened it. Why would an addict desperate for drugs return the keys to the doctor's pocket? I don't think LaFrankie did it. I think the killer had his own keys. You mean he worked here? What's going on? They're killing Dr. Gould. Now listen to me, Mr. Monk. Not only was Dr. Gould my colleague, he was my best friend. And I do not appreciate you joking about it. I wasn't joking. Do you know what a delusion is? It's a false belief sustained despite clear evidence to the contrary. The fishing line. Pardon me? What? There was a fishing line in this rod. - Where did it go? - What do you think happened to it? You think I used it to strangle somebody on the ward? Dr. Lancaster! I'm sorry to interrupt, but I heard he was in here. Where is it? What? / You know what. My necklace, the one you said reminded you of your wife. - He stole it. I know he did. - This is ridiculous. I took it off in the infirmary. That's the last time I had it. - You were in there! - There's a simple way to solve this. Adrian, empty your pockets. Oh, my God. Thank you very much! How did that get there? I swear I don't remember taking it. I know you don't. I know. I'm sorry I yelled at you. I was just like you when I got here. I was seeing things that weren't there. The night Dr. Gould was murdered, I saw Bill LaFrankie running with a gun. You did? I was trying to get to a pay phone. But in my mind, I saw Dr. Lancaster with the gun, like I was projecting my rage for Dr. Lancaster onto Bill LaFrankie. I see. Dr. Lancaster was trying to help me. I resented him. Me too. Welcome to my world. Time for your medication, Mr. Monk. Dr. Lancaster's orders. I'm slipping away. What's wrong with me? Hold on, Monk. Hold on. If anything, his behavior has deteriorated. We may have to keep him here longer than we thought. - Well, how much longer? - That's hard to say. It could be a month. A month? / It could be as long as a year. Adrian is bipolar, he's delusional and he's paranoid. He sees murder mysteries everywhere he turns. In fact, he's befriended another patient, and the two of them are trying to prove that Santa Claus really does exist. Santa Claus? They went out on the roof collecting evidence. It would be funny if it wasn't so dysfunctional. Adrian, look who's here. Hey, boss. - How you feelin'? - Ah, I feel good. I can't I can't wait to get home. Well, we were just talking about that. Adrian, would you mind if I showed your friend some of the artwork that you made yesterday? Oh, here it is. Wait a minute. Did I draw that? You don't remember? Isn't that Trudy's grave? Dr. Lancaster said that you saw Santa Claus. No, we didn't actually see him. Manny took a picture, but he lost the camera. But we found a piece of a red suit. We'd love to see it, Adrian. It was in here. It was here. It was in here. A little piece of fabric, you know, of Santa's Santa's, you know, suit. Okay. No, no. It was a piece of fabric, and Doctor? - Can I talk to you privately? / -Sure. - Like Santa's suit. He's not himself. He needs me. Look, I could be here two, three times a week, okay? I still have my license. Maybe they can give me a job here. Sharona, I know you mean well, but the less contact Adrian has with his old life, the better. You can write him a letter. You can bring him something from home. I'm sure he'd like that, but no visits. Look, Adrian l Listen, l I can't take you home right now. Sharona, look at his shoes. Just look at his shoes. They're smudged. Could be soot. Those are boat shoes. They're made for traction. And I think he has been walkin' on the roof. Adrian, just try to listen to Dr. Lancaster, okay? He's a good man. There was a doctor murdered here about four years ago / Adrian, - will you calm down? - Named Gould. Conrad Gould. Please try and stay calm and sit. Just relax. I think I think Lancaster had something to do with it. Am I losing my mind? Medical Library - Excuse me. - One second. Hi. I'm told that Dr. Conrad Gould left all of his papers to your library, and I need to see his journals from 1998. Do you have an I.D.? Not on me. I left it in my car. - I can look you up. - Uh, well Here's the thing. I'm not actually enrolled here at the present time. Well, the library's for students only. Really? Is there a Chet that works here? - I'm Chet. - Oh, my God. This is so funny. I was told to ask for you. See, I met this guy at a party who said that you were really cool and that you would let me do a little research here as a favor. Uh, what guy? He was, um Oh, he was tall, wore glasses. - Ross Kelton? - That's right. - That's right. Ross Kelton. - Ross Kelton said I was cool? Was he wrong? You wanted Gould's personal journals, right? Mind if I ask what for? Ross said you were cool. Uh, right. Right. Sorry. ""Dr. Murdock has assured me that I am next in line for the directorship, a decision bound to be met with anger and derision by Dr"" Oh, my God. Is it okay if he has a picture of Trudy? Maybe it'll calm him down. I think he'll like that. Here you go. Thanks. Nice to see you. - Thank you very much. - You bet. Thank you. - I'll see you soon. - I hope so. Sometimes I wish I'd joined the Rolling Stones when they asked me. Lights out! Hey, check it out. Monk, you're not crazy. What's it say? You're in danger! Get out! It says I'm not crazy. Anything there about me? What the hell? There you are. I warned you not to play detective in my hospital. This is Bill LaFrankie's file. There's no way this man killed himself like they said. He's in here! He suffered from belonephobia. He had a pathological fear of needles. You're a smart man. Let's see what kind of witness you are with a functioning I. Q of 17. Mr. Monk came here to try to kill me. / What? Wait. I think he needs some time in the Quiet Room, Oliver. - No. Wait! - It's for your own good, Adrian. - How much? - Two c.c.'s of Thorazine. - Make it four. - Four? Are you sure? He can't weigh more than 160 pounds. Did you just graduate from medical school in the last 45 minutes? No, sir. / Then do what the hell you're told. Give this patient four c.c. 's of Thorazine. I gotta go upstairs and get some more. Make it quick. What the hell? Hey! Hello? I know who did it, Sharona. I can prove it. Call the police. I borrowed Mr. Carruthers's camera. It has eight pictures left. See the numbers? Is Santa really coming? Oh, yeah, he'll be here. What do you want for Christmas? I just want two and two to be four again. It's him! Santa Claus! I knew it. Well, what's he doing? - He's going fishing. - For what? The gun, Manny. He has to find it before the construction crew stumbles onto it. Then he'll get rid of it for good, and I'll never be able to prove any of this. - I love you, Santa! - Manny. Manny. Manny, no. No. No. No. Stay here. I need you to take pictures. I don't understand what he's doing. Don't look down. Don't look down. How's the fishing, Doctor? Monk. How did you get up here? Santa Claus! This is why you put Manny in that room, 'cause you knew you could spend all night up here and nobody would ever believe he really did see Santa Claus. Nobody but you, Monk, and who's gonna believe you? You're clinically insane, remember? We'll find the gun, Doctor, right where you dropped it. And that's all the proof I'll need. You couldn't stand it. The board of directors gave your job to Dr. Gould. - You killed him. - Dr. Gould. You stole some drugs to make it look like a patient did it. You needed a fall guy. LaFrankie fit the bill. You probably got LaFrankie all doped up, then lured him into the woods where the cops found him the next day. You only had one problem the murder weapon. It was registered in your name. You had to get rid of the gun before the cops showed up. And you found the perfect place to hide it. Hey! You can't talk to Santa Claus like that. Manny. Manny! - Santa! Help me! - Well, well, well. What have we here? Manny, hang on. Just hang on. Wait a minute. You're not really Santa Claus. Monk, be careful! He's not really Santa Claus. Gun's been lodged in that chimney for four years. I'm guessing the chamber and the metal firing pin are completely oxidized. Oh, look! Drop the gun, Santa! Put your hands up! Adrian! By the way, in case we don't get a chance to talk later, I just want you to know except for the murders and your trying to kill me you really were the best doctor I ever had. Hang on, Manny. They're coming to get you. And merry Christmas. Hello? Sharona. Don't laugh, okay? I just need to be sure. Is there a skinny oak tree by the window? Yes. Is there an armoire by the closet? And is Trudy's picture on the nightstand? Yep. Adrian. You're in your own house. Now go to sleep. Thanks. Good news. I'm seriously considering you for Employee of the Month. Thanks, boss. I'll see you tomorrow."
"﻿Sidney? Where are you going? Oh, I didn't tell you? I have a lecture. Another lecture? They're gonna have you on the faculty. I don't mind. It's good to give back. You don't owe them anything. You just gave them a half a million dollars last year. That's just writing a check. I won't be late - I'll try not to wake you. - You can wake me. Good night, Maria. - Good night, Caroline. - Have a pleasant evening, sir. Mrs. Danvers. Good evening, sir. Are we all set? - I think I'll drive myself tonight. - You want the Volvo? No, I think I'll take the Ford. - I'll bring it around. - Thank you. Â¢ÃBad to the bone Â¢Ã Â¢ÃB-B-B-B-Bad Â¢Ã Â¢ÃB-B-B-B-Bad Â¢Ã Â¢ÃB-B-B-B-Bad Â¢Ã Â¢ÃBad to the bone Â¢Ã Â¢ÃI broke a thousand hearts Â¢Ã Â¢ÃBefore I met you Â¢ÃÂ¢Ã - So what did you think? - hate to go first. - Tell me what you thought. - I liked it. I liked it too. I really liked that actress. What was her name? / Jean something. - Okay, where's my car? - It's over there. - Give me your wallet.! Now.! - Oh, my God! Okay. Everything's cool. Don't be a hero. Hey, what are you MONK Season 1 Epi. 07 Mr. Monk and the Billionaire Mugger - Um, no. - My paycheck bounced, Adrian. - The lamp - What are you gonna do about it? Guess I'll just have to sweep it up. No, I'm talking about the money. I thought Leo Otterman paid us. He gave me an I.O.U. He said he was a little short. No, no, no, no. Leo Otterman is not a little short. Wejust recovered one ofhis Picasso paintings that is worth over $2 million. He said that he wasn't liquid or whatever. He had some cash flow thing. Adrian, this is a business with clients and expenses. I know money doesn't matter on Planet Monk, but I have a kid that expects three meals a day and sometimes gets sick. If you miss another paycheck, I'm quitting. This is very important, so I'm gonna say it again. If you miss one more paycheck, I'm quitting. Would you hold that? Hello? / It better be a job. Now, don't give in. Okay? A 10 percent raise isn't asking for too much. You're right. You're right. Ten percent? You can't argue with that. And don't solve anything until they agree. As soon as you tell them who did it, we lose our leverage. You're right. You're right. Captain! I see the circus is in town. Oh, yes. It's gonna get a lot worse. Captain, Adrian wants to talk to you about our fee. That the shooter? Yeah. Archie Modine. He's an ex-cop. He was second lieutenant in Palo Alto. I already checked him out. He was a straight-up good cop. Now he's the head of security at CK Pharmaceuticals. Uh, Captain? About our fee, we want  /  Sharona. - We want to talk - Sharona, please. Walk me through it. It's pretty routine till we get to the punch line. Modine and his date are walking to their car over here. The, uh, perp is over here. Now, the perp pops out with a knife. Modine pulls out his piece. .38 caliber. I already called. He's licensed. Bang, bang, bang. Three in the chest. So I just have one question. What am I doing here? Here comes the punch line. Our perp is Sidney Teal. The computer guy? - Get out of town. - Take a look. That's what $5 billion looks like. Get out of town. What in God's name was he doing? I think maybe that this is how he got his kicks. That kind of money can make a person crazy. Yeah, I wouldn't know. Yeah, right. Anyway, that's my theory. If you've got a better one, - I'd really like to hear it. - Well / No. No. Captain, we can't start working until we talk about our fee. Sharona, could you give me a second here? You know, this is insane. Yeah, it's crazy. It gets crazier. Check this out. - This guy's wearin' knee pads. - Knee pads? Yeah, and he's got elbow pads. Was he planning on going Rollerblading after? - I live right up there. - Sir, sir, sir. Excuse me. Just step back. Okay. So you were coming out of the theater and heading toward your car? That's right. I had my keys out, which now I can't find. Excuse me, sir. - Are these yours? - Yeah. That's great. Thanks. I appreciate it. Hey, Mr. Modine. Uh, what happened next? Well, he came at me with a knife, and hehe said something. - He said, ""Don't be a hero."" - ""Don't be a hero?"" Yeah. / Anyway, I pulled my piece and I got three rounds off. Guess he didn't realize he was messing with a second lieutenant. I just live right up there. I saw the whole thing. That's exactly what happened. Hey, Lieutenant. Is that really Sidney Teal? - I'm afraid so. - Geez. Five hundred dollars a day, plus expenses. Well, I think that's more than fair. He's never had a raise. I can't authorize an increase like this, Sharona. You're gonna have to take this downtown. Talk to Shelly Berger, your pal. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. We'll deal with it later. Can I say something? I'd like to file a complaint against one of your cops. Excuse me? / There was a cop standing right over there who saw the entire thing. After Archie shot the guy, the cop just turned and ran away. - Did you get a badge number? - I'm afraid I didn't. Captain! /  Do you have a policy for a police officerjust to flee like that? I have no comment because it's ridiculous. All right? There is not an officer on this force that would run away from the scene of a crime. It is inconceivable. I know, but I saw! He ran away! - I saw it too. He ran away. - Why would an officer flee the scene? Are you covering something up? What's going on? Captain, what's going on? - Speed limit's 35. - I am going 35. Thirty-seven. Thirty-eight now. Why couldn't you just hold out for the raise? I can't believe you folded like a cheap suit. Tent. For the record, I folded like a cheap tent. - Did you call Leo Otterman? - I haven't been able to reach him. - ""Yield."" The sign says ""yield."" - There's nobody there. I mean, you're the best detective in the free world, and you can't find one deadbeat client? What's that noise? - It's the alternator. - Why don't you have it fixed? Oh. Okay. Here's plan ""B."" We are gonna solve this case as fast as we can, okay? A billionaire with too much time on his hands went crazy. I don't know. What about the knee pads? No, no, no. Forget the knee pads. A billionaire went crazy, and that's it. We're gonna take credit for it this time, get a little publicity, and then I'm gonna call Sheldon Berger in the mayor's office and demand a 10 percent increase. Speaking of money Whoa! We are in the wrong business. Not just us. Everybody in the world, except this guy, is in the wrong business. We're building a guesthouse in the backyard. I was supposed to meet with an architect today. Do you know what I did instead? I made funeral arrangements. I know it's a terrible time, Mrs. Teal. We We just have a couple of questions. Yeah, um, the police think - that Sidney was having a midlife crisis. - That's true. It started about a year and a half ago. Sidney just changed. He started trying new things, crazy things renting motorcycles and bungeejumping, skydiving. He said he loved the rush of it. - He loved the rush? - Well, I used to say I married Batman. I never imagined in a million years that he'd do anything like this. Robbing someone with a knife. I don't know what he was thinking. Adrian, my sister has this same painting on her shower curtain. Huh. And did he go out often at night, alone? The police asked me that same question. Um, recently he started going out late. Once or twice a week. He always had a good excuse. I feel like an idiot, really. Why do you think he was wearing knee pads last night? I have no idea. Oh, I'm sorry. I must look terrible. Oh, no. No, no. You look fine. - Thank you. - I just have one more question. When did your husband start wearing eyeglasses? About three years ago, I guess. Why? No reason. Why did you ask about his glasses? So I could tell which photographs were the most recent. There are about 200 pictures in that room. - They documented everything. - And? No bungee jumping. No skydiving. The most exciting thing Sidney Teal's done in the last two years is go to Disneyland. - Not exactly Batman. - This guy? He was What's the opposite of Batman? You are. Damn it, I hate this car! Damn it, damn it, damn it! Why don't you try saying  ""Damn it"" a few more times? That might help. And how long have you worked for Mr. Teal? Seven years. Who am I talking to? - Oh, I'm not a cop. - I knew that. - Cops take care of their cars. - He's a private consultant. The police call him in whenever they're stumped. / Oh, yeah? Well, join the club. I'm stumped too. - Could you hold that? - Excuse me? Could you hold that for a sec? So do you believe what they're saying that Mr. Teal had a dark side, a secret life? Mr. Teal didn't have a life except for his computers. Boy Scouts used to laugh at him. You know, he didn't drink, he didn't smoke, he wouldn't even let me start the car until we both buckled up. Did he have much of a temper? Huh? No. Mr. Teal He was a pussycat. Here's an example. Last year there was a there was a break-in down the street, and Mr. Teal bought a gun for protection. - Wait a minute. He owned a gun? - He owned it, but he never used it. I drove him to the practice range, right? He couldn't even pull the trigger. He just froze up. So, how do you explain last night? Must have been hypnotized, most I can figure out. - That could make sense. - No, you can't hypnotize someone to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do. What about Mrs. Teal. Would you say she was a pussycat? No, she's more like a tiger. But I never worked for her. I worked for him. She made that clear. Look, truth is, I'll be out of a job soon, so if you're looking for a driver, let me know. - Hey, is he a good boss? - Well, my last paycheck bounced. I can't take a vacation because he can't live without me. And two nights ago he called me at 4:00 a. M because he saw a cockroach. It was pretty big. / Yeah. Try it now. - Ah, that should be all right for a while. - What do we owe you? You want to thank me? Find out what happened to my boss. You know, it's funny. Mr. Teal had it all. More money than God, a beautiful wife. But he was the loneliest man in the world. I was the chauffeur, and I felt sorry for him. You felt sorry for your boss? I can only imagine what that would feel like. / Get in the car. - I'm gonna do what I can. - Thank you. Captain. / You just missed the deputy commissioner. Guess what he wanted to talk about? Murder rates sparking? The Sidney Teal investigation? No. All he wanted to know was what we're doing about the runaway cop. Fraidy Cop. - Excuse me? - That's what they're calling him. We, uh, sort of pieced together the route he took. I don't know. Okay. After the shooting, three people saw him running west towards the park here, and on 19th, here, he flagged down a taxi. - He took a taxi? - Yeah, it gets worse. He, uh, threw up in the backseat. But we did get his blood type from the vomit. The taxi then, uh, dropped him off at a bar upon Geary Street there, where he sat in a booth at the back, apparently drinking bourbon and crying. - He was crying? Oh, dear Lord. - About midnight, an older woman in a brown station wagon was seen picking him up. Possibly his mother. He called his mom? / Yeah. Well, that son of a bitch better hope I don't find him first. Why don't you put those, uh, over there? Thank you. - He certainly had a lot of friends. - It's been overwhelming. These are from Bill Gates. Those are from the governor. And look at all these letters. Excuse me. What are you doing? This one was sticking up. You'll thank me later. How long have you worked for Mr. Teal? I was with him from the beginning the very beginning, when he was working out of his garage. He was probably happier there. We only had two phone lines. We had to fill all the orders ourselves. That's his autobiography. You can have one. Sidney loved signing them for people. Now what are you doing? I made that one too short, so now I have to cut the others. Make 'em all even. I'm sure you understand. When was the last time you talked to Mr. Teal? / That evening. Um, he called on his way home to ask about Tony Bennett. Not The singer, Tony Bennett? Myra's a big fan. Sidney was taking her to Vegas to see his show. He was arranging for Tony Bennett to meet them at the airport. - Wow. Tony Bennett. - He was going to surprise her. He loved doing that. Mrs. Butterworth, do you have any idea what Sidney Teal was doing in that parking lot? No. I still can't believe it happened. I'm still in denial. Mugging somebody. For what? Maybe $40? Well, maybe he went crazy. Do you think that's possible, Mr. Monk? For a man to be normal one day and then suddenly go crazy? Yes! I meant the This is the fifth store, Adrian. I have a good feeling about this place. Oh. What about this one? Nah. The other one was silver and it swiveled. - You don't have to buy the exact same lamp. - What do you mean? - You could buy a different lamp. - Different lamp? Yeah. Adrian, what about this one? This is great. Yeah, but it's not silver. The other one was sliver. It's just a lamp. If you were blindfolded, you wouldn't know the difference. If I was blindfolded, why would I need a lamp? Okay, that was a bad example. Look, they're all basically the same. - What about this one? This is great. - Yeah, but it doesn't swivel. The other one swiveled. I think you should try something different for a change. They probably don't even make your stupid lamp anymore. - What do you mean? - Maybe it's been discontinued. Discontinued? Why don't you buy a lamp factory and make your own? It'd only cost you $500,000, but at least you'd have your precious lamp. There it is. This is it. - You're buying three? - Two are backups. Why don't you fill out an application? / Maybe I will. $95.75. - Would you mind? I'll pay you back. - Where's your wallet? I'm having it, you know, buffed. Oh! / Look at that face. There's no way this guy walked on the wild side. No way. I don't know. People surprise you. You know, when we were in his office, I saw some flowers from his old fraternity, Phi Beta Tau. I used to date a guy from that frat. It was pretty intense. He told me about two guys who almost died during initiation. There was, like, these secret ceremonies and weird handshakes. Look who I'm talking to about weird handshakes. / Excuse me. It's declined. We accept cash. Adrian, this is unacceptable. It is just unacceptable. You have to pay me. Did you try calling Leo Otterman again? Huh? Did you? What's wrong? On his key chain he had an insignia, Phi Beta Tau. W Well, who did? The guyThe guy who shot Teal. Archie Modine. They were in the same fraternity. Oh, my God. / What? They knew each other. This was a lot more enjoyable when I was on that side of the table. Oh, you're on the right side of the table, Modine. Look, Captain, I'm not lawyering up here, am I? I'm talking to you. All right? I screwed up. I admitted it. Oh, yeah. He screwed up. I withheld information. I filed a false report. All right? L-l I knew the guy. Yeah, why the hell didn't you tell us that before? I was protecting a friend. Mrs. Teal. That's right. I mean, I just didn't want to drag her into all this. You understand that. Maybe not. I just didn't think anybody would connect us. I mean, how did you find out? We had a little help. Sidney Teal was two years ahead of me at Cal State. We were in the same frat, but I didn't really know him. - How did you meet his wife? - Fund-raiser for the college. You know. Sidney was in the spotlight, but my interest was more in Myra. And as the kids say, we hooked up. It was a fling. I mean, I hardly remember it. Teal must have found out and-and, you know Oh, come on, Captain. He came at me with a knife. What would you do? Sidney Teal did not suffer a nervous breakdown. The incident on Harrison Place was, in fact, a crime of passion. We believe that Mr. Teal was, in fact, trying to murder Mr. Modine, who was linked romantically at one timewith Mr. Teal's wife, Myra. Over the next 10 days, the D.A. 's office is going to decide whether or not they want to press charges against Mr. Modine for filing a false report. Any questions? Captain, is there any news on Fraidy Cop? No comment. There's a story in today's Tribune that says the department knows the identity of Fraidy Cop but is refusing to release it. Is that true, Captain? No comment. All right. Hey, hey. Hang on. I have another statement. Here it is. The next reporter that asks me about this so-called Fraidy Cop is going to be banned from all press conferences for a year. Here's our invoice for the Teal case. We'd like to get paid. - Don't you usually just mail this in? - We're in a rush. - A little short, huh? - Yeah. So are you. Just initial it where it says, ""job completed to satisfaction,"" please. - What are you doing? - No, no, no, no. It's not over. Don't do this. The case is closed. You heard the press conference. - He owned a gun. - Who did? Sidney Teal. If he wanted to kill Archie Modine in that parking lot, - why didn't he bring the gun? - I don't know. He brought a knife. It wasn't a very big knife. It only had a four-inch blade. And I don't think Teal knew about that affair. He was planning a romantic getaway with his wife, remember? Look, we need to get paid. I need cash. The stores in my neighborhood insist on money. I'm sorry. I'm really, really sorry. I can't. There's more to it. If you don't submit that invoice, I'm quitting. Now, I'm going to give you until three. No, not 3:00. I'm counting to three. One, two, three. Call me the minute you grow up. What should I do? I don't know. No. Tell me what to do. - I can't do that. - Well, can you find somebody who will tell me what to do? So this Fraidy Cop situation is getting out of control. The San Francisco P.D. Just bought a bunch of new squad cars that only go in reverse. You know what I heard: Every officer is being issued some new equipment a white flag and a diaper.! But they better do it up tight, 'cause there's a cold snap coming. A drive-by shooting? Do they have any leads? Nothing on the bullets. They found the car a few blocks away. Stolen. A hundred percent clean. No prints. You know, you-you-you don't seem very upset. Well, it means I'm making someone very uneasy, and that's not such a bad thing. Well, Sh-Sharona must have been terrified. She quit. We had an argument about money. She took a job at a lamp store on Prospect Street. She'd rather sell lamps than work for me. Let me ask you something. Two weeks ago, she bought me this mug, it said ""World's Greatest Boss."" Are you allowed to do that buy someone a mug and then just quit? See, I don't think mugs are legally binding, Adrian. I never had to think about money. Trudy used to pay all the bills. While we're on that subject, there-there is something that-that I have to say. Oh? Now, you see, this can't be good. Well, no. The-The-The-The fact is that, um, you see, I haven't been paid for the past nine weeks, nine sessions. - Now, that's a lot of money. - Oh, my God. - You're gonna leave me too. - No, no, no. I did not say that, Adrian. I'm gonna be all alone. What a time to be me. Adrian, I promise you, no one is leaving you. Sharona did. Are-Are-Are you okay? I hate owing you money. I just I just hate it. Listen, until until we get squared away, I'm gonna have to start seeing you twice a week. Uh, excuse me? Miss? We're closing. - Now? - That's right. - What for? - The holiday. What holiday? It's Lamp Day. How was your day? I bought a lamp. Three, actually. I've been meaning to buy the book. Did it really mention me? Drink your milk. Yeah, it was just one line in chapter three. He said he loved you. I'm surprised he even remembers me. We only dated, like, two or three times. Sidney was a junior. You know, you could already tell that he was gonna be rich or famous. The guy was a genius. I should've married the schlub. Wait, wait, wait. Uh, hold on one sec. - He was a junior - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Is this your first case? Uh, no. But I usually work with a partner. I'm looking for Kelly Street. Oh, Kelly's not home. I'm her sister, Bonnie. - Ah. My name - It doesn't matter. Come on in. Thank you. Kelly should be back any minute. Can I get you anything? We have, uh, Hi-C or grape juice. Oh, how about some homemade applesauce? No. I'm fine. I'm just perfect. So, you say your wife was a writer. Yeah, she was a columnist for the Examiner. She died four years ago. She was murdered. Oh, dear. What's the world coming to? I don't know, ma'am. I ask myself that every day. This This was from from her appointment book. See, this was her last entry. I always thought that 530 Kelly Street was an address, but then this morning It hit me. It's a name Kelly Street. Well, her real name's Katrina. I was the first one to call her Kelly. Right. And-And the 530 is not a house number. It means half past 5:00, of course. So Trudy must have been planning to meet your sister on that day. Something about a Mr. Simon. You see? Who Who is that? Is that a friend of the family? - Mr. Simon was her dog. - Dog? When Mr. Simon passed away and died, Kelly couldn't bear to bury him, so she had him stuffed. Some people found it peculiar Your wife was probably writing a little story about her. Um, do you mind if I touch him? Oh, of course. Taxidermy always fascinated me. - What are you doing? - That That's not Mr. Simon, silly billy. - That's the Colonel. - The Colonel. This is Mr. Simon. Oh.! Company.! Oh, thank God. Are you Kelly Street? Mrs. Kelly Street? You don't remember me? I'm-I'm sorry. Mr. Monk, you've been here three times. You come every year asking about your wife. Oh, dear. You should write it down, Mr. Monk so you don't forget. You're right. You're right. I must have blocked it out. In the book, Mr. Teal said somebody mugged you on your first date, but he didn't really give any details. Technically, we weren't mugged. We were almost mugged. I was scared to death. I just froze. - He had a knife. - He had a knife? But Sidney, he lunged at the guy. - They started fighting. - Come on! I couldn't believe it. Sidney really stood up to him. I didn't think he had it in him. Did he say anything? Who?  /  The mugger. Oh, geez. That was 20 years ago. Uh, I think he said, you know, ""Give me your money. Don't be a hero."" He said that? ""Don't be a hero""? Yeah. Is that important? Oh, yeah. That is That is very important. Um I think I just busted this case wide open. That's better. Leo? Leo? Leo! Leo! - Leo.! Leo Otterman.! Hi. You remember me? I'm I'm Adrian Monk. - Of course I remember you. - Yeah, yeah, l-I found your Picasso, and I still have not been paid. I told you, I need a little more time. Yeah, Leo, and I'm telling you that that is not good enough, sir, okay? Okay, look, Leo. Sharona quit again, and I went to see Kelly Street because I thought she was an address, but she's-she's not an address. She's-She's a woman. I've been there before three times. Forget that. Just forget all that. Sharona was not there. I can't pay her, see. And I cannot do this without her. Thank you for sharing. I'm sure it's all very fascinating. Call my office and we'll work something out. No, Leo. Leo. Wait, Leo. Wait a second. All right, lookLook, Leo. Hey. Okay, look. Leo, I'm not moving. You think I'm bluffing? You're gonna have to run me down. Or back up. One or the other. Adrian! Adrian? - Sharona. - Ohh! Oh, my God. I've been looking all over for you. Are you okay? Yeah, that was Leo Otterman. I tried to stop him, but he got away. - I wanted to pay you. No, no, no. - Just forget about that jerk. - Look at this. - What have you been doing? Investigating. I went to see Angie DeLuca. She used to date Sidney Teal in college. Adrian, you're not gonna believe this. There was another mugging 20 years ago. It was the exact same thing except Sidney Teal was the guy being mugged. What? Now, get this. The mugger from 20 years ago said, ""Don't be a hero."" Really? That's interesting. / See? I knew it was interesting. I mean, I didn't know why, but I knew. I know that look. You got it, right? Are you sure about this? Yes. / You hesitated. Why did you hesitate? I was thinking about something else. Mr. Modine. Thank you for coming. What the hell is going on, Captain? Mr. Monk wants a few moments of everybody's time. - I think that's not too much to ask. - Capt. Stottlemeyer, - any leads on the Fraidy Cop? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You want to ambush people, you join the army, okay? The captain's trying to work here, people. He doesn't have time for your crap Now, step back, please. Step back. - Well done, Officer Moratta. - Thank you, sir. I wish I'd known you were coming. I could've had Mrs. Danvers prepare something. This isn't a party, Mrs. Teal. I guess you can't believe everything you read. Newspapers said the investigation was closed. Theirs was. Ours wasn't. My attorney says that I can file a harassment case whenever I feel like it. Mrs. Teal, your lawyers are gonna have enough to do to keep you off of death row. You'll be needing an attorney too, sir, for the murder of Sidney Teal and the attempted murder of me. - The drive-by shooting. - Both of them? They were in it together, Captain. I'll tell you what troubled me from the very beginning the knee pads and the elbow pads. When your husband left that night, he wasn't planning to mug anyone and he wasn't planning to kill anyone. He was just going out to have a little fun. Maybe roll around on the ground. He thought he was gonna help you impress your date, Mr. Modine. - That's ridiculous. - Is it? You did it before 20 years ago. He wrote about it in his book. Back in college, Sidney had a big date with Angie DeLuca. He wasn't much of a ladies'man, and he was trying to impress her. - So the two of you cooked up a plan. - Yep, you cooked up a plan. Would you like to tell it? No, no, no, no. You're-You're-You're-You're better at telling it. Yeah, but go ahead. You can tell it. No. You tell it. I'll tell it next time. - For God sakes, somebody tell it. - It was a harmless little prank. You pretended to mug Sidney Teal and his date. And for a minute the mild-mannered computer geek got to look like Superman. And I'm sure you both had a big laugh about it later on. You are a nut case. No one's gonna believe him. On occasion I've been known to believe him. Don't stop now. - Where was I? - Twenty years later, Sidney brought Myra to his college fund-raiser, and that's where you two met. And you met again and again and again. Are you sure you don't want to tell it? No, no, no. You're doing great. Just go. Ayear goes by. You decide that life would be perfect without Sidney Teal around. So you two hatch a plan. You contacted Sidney, and you reminded him of the time you helped him impress his date, and you asked him ifhe wouldn't like to return the favor. You knew he wouldn't say no. It was a chance for him to relive one of the best nights ofhis life. And it worked like a charm. To the rest of the world, it appeared that an eccentric billionaire had a nervous breakdown. And if worse came to worse, and anyone connected you with Sidney Teal, you just had to admit that you'd had an affair and claim that the shooting was self-defense. That is one hell of a story, Mr. Monk, if you could prove it. He always went the extra mile. That night, your pal Sidney had a little surprise of his own. - Really? - Yes, sir. You see, he'd hired an actor to pose as a cop. So after you scared off the mugger, the cop was going to run up and commend you for your heroism. - Oh, my God. - Fraidy Cop. I'm afraid so. You see, Captain, I remembered what you'd said that no cop in your department would ever run from the scene of a crime. And it occurred to me, maybe Fraidy Cop wasn't a real cop. I checked all the local costume shops. There was only one cop uniform rented that night. Hey, what are you doin'? Gentlemen, I'd like you to meetJoseph Moratta. Very promising young actor. / You? Joe wanted me to mention that he can be seen in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the Harris Webley Dinner Theater all next week. You know, when I heard the shots, I guess I kind of panicked. I'm sorry if I caused you guys any problems. Problems? Kid, you have no idea! I swear, I didn't know anything about this. This is all his idea. Lying bitch! Stay back! Stay back! All of you! - Stay down! / Archie - Give me the arm! Modine, you're under arrest for the murder of Sidney Teal. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can be used against you in a court oflaw. He's got a gun.! Look out.! Fraidy Cop, just a couple of questions! Please! - Shoot him. - I can't do that, sir. Then shoot me. That's all I have. You didn't have to call the cops. Here. / I I prefer not to handle cash. Nice doin' business with you, Leo. Next time, sir, just pay your debts. Wait a minute. I know you. You were on the news. No, no, that was No, no! / Fraidy Cop.! Hey.! Come back here.! - Do you know who I am? - Look at him go. He's an inspiration. - You cowards.! - I was gonna give him a couple of bucks. Oh, you can send it to him. He'll be in Canada by tomorrow. - Oh, God! - I'll kill you!"
"﻿Jerry, I'm a reasonable man. You're a semi-reasonable man. You talk to Mr. Kramer. I'll talk to Mrs. Kramer. Maybe everybody can move an inch or two on this one. Hang on a second. - Who's the lucky guy? - None of your business. You okay? Yeah. Okay. Jerry, you say that again, and I'm gonna take you to court to support it. Yeah. Oh, God! Take anything Take anything you want! Wait! Ugh! Lou? Lou? MONK Season 1 Epi. 08 Mr. Monk and the Other Woman She's always with me. Every time I close my eyes. She's always 34 years old. She's always wearing the same dress. And she's always so Adrian? I have something to say. It's been four years since you lost Trudy. That-That's a long time. - It is? - Yeah. Have you ever considered dating again? No. I've thought about thinking about it. And what? You don't follow through because It's inconceivable. I can't think about anything life, other people Adrian? Oh, it's a pebble or something. It's been driving me crazy all day. W-Would you say that Trudy was the perfect woman? You know that phrase ""my better half'? I never really thought about it much until she died. She was my better half. I love that phrase. My better half. My better half. Ah, yes, there it is. That's it? Sensitive feet. Do you have a copy of the case file? No, not an extra one. We're supposed to have a copy. Can I ask you something? Why are you even here? We're here because the victim was a friend of the mayor's. Yeah, I know. They were golfing buddies. Well, I guess His Honor wanted to make sure you didn't screw everything up. - This scene is cold. - Yeah. The party's pretty much over. It all went down on Monday night. Forty-eight hours. I really needed to be here from the beginning. Adrian, Adrian, that is not true. There must have been a dozen cops through here. Adrian, you promised the mayor. Okay, look at look at me and stay calm. Okay? You're the best. There was a struggle. The victim was stabbed. Yeah, that's right. How do you know he was stabbed? I mean, he could've been shot. No. You can smell gunpowder residue in a room this size for four days. - You can? - He can. And then the victim was strangled too. / Yeah. You wouldn't happen to know with what? A phone cord. You can see. It's-It's stretched out. Oh, yeah. We, uh We must've missed that. What happened here? His assistant must've walked in on it. She was stabbed too. D.O.A. At the hospital. Two victims? I wanna see more. This is all moot, Monk. We already have a suspect. Who's that? His name is Lawrence Grayson. Pratt was his attorney. They lost a case about a year and a half ago. I guess, uh, Grayson wasn't a very satisfied client. A year and a half? That's what I call holding a grudge. - He burned something? - He burned his own file. The guy was a moron. There were duplicate copies all over the office that he didn't even touch. Why didn't he just take the file with him and burn it later? The captain figured he panicked. It doesn't make sense. What doesn't? The whole thing. I want to talk to this Grayson. Okay. But I should tell you, Captain Stottlemeyer's not very happy you're on the case. - Did he say something? - He didn't have to. I've been working with him for four years now. I know him. You pick up little signs. - What is your name? - Stooben. Everything with the lawyer's name on it, you bag it. You don't walk around with it. You bag it. Understood? / Yes, sir. Okay. How am I doing, Monk? Fine. Oh, if you talk to the mayor, tell him thanks very much for this vote of confidence. You can'tjust barge in here. And rip my house apart. How do I know I'm gonna get this stuffback? You'll get a complete inventory when we're through. Oh, yeah? I'm calling my lawyer. Your lawyer's dead, sir. That's why we're here. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Do you mind? Please. Hang on! Another step, and I'll arrest you for obstruction. That's a very impressive collection, Mr. Grayson. Thank you very much. Yeah, I'm a collector. Everything in there's legit, okay? I got paper on everything in there. It's a hobby. I'm permitted to have a hobby, am I not? Excuse me. Is that your truck parked out front? Yeah, that's my truck. You own your own security company? Yes, I do. Now, why would I kill Lou Pratt, okay? He's been my lawyer for 22 years. There are 4,000 files in that office. The killer went out of his way to burn just one of them yours. Mine? Okay, so he burns my file. So what? - You owed him some money. - Yeah, 400 bucks. I'm suing the bitch next door, he screws up the case, I refuse to pay him. I'm gonna kill him for 400 bucks? I don't think so. Can I have permission to walk my dog? - You guys are making him goofy. - Permission granted. - Thank you. - Keep an eye on him. Here, Bobo. Come here. - What? - That guy owns a security company. He could've picked any lock in that office but he broke a window. Yeah, this guy is not stupid. He knows we know he can pick a lock. He tried to throw us a curveball. It doesn't make any sense. Does everything have to make sense, Monk? Well, yeah, it kinda does. See that? They're in my house right now. They're ripping the whole place apart. It's not my problem. You made it your problem when you built that thing, sweetheart. What is with you and my garage? It's over, okay? You lost the case. Garage. That thing is a shopping mall. - It's not a garage. - Oh, come on! You understand what ""setback"" means? You understand what rules and regulations are? / Is that the neighbor? Monica Waters. She owns a travel agency in Westbrook Mall. You're like this broken record. You just keep going on and on. I see you got your own address on there now. Pretty soon you're gonna qualify for its own zip code. - Who are you to talk about regulations? - Excuse me? That dog of yours is a public menace. It's never on a leash, and every kid in the neighborhood is frightened to death of it. Don't give me that. This is a champion show dog right here, and it's bred for temperament. Oh, right, right. I'll try to remember that when I have to unfasten his jaw from my leg! Excuse me. This dog is no show dog. What are you saying? Show dogs have to be purebred. This is not a pure Rottweiler. You can tell by the paws. They're They're too big. - The paws are too big? - They're too big. My hero. Okay, Mr. Grayson, why don't we take that little walk now? I'd love to come back and visit you sometime about that badge. Bring your little buddy there too. Not a purebred. - Let's go. - Let's get away from here. Monk, are you coming? L-I think I'll check out the garage. Are you okay? Mm-hmm. You know who she looks like in a weird way? Trudy. You think? / Mm-hmm. What's he doing? It's his It's his thing. When was it built? Two years ago. That's about the time your husband moved out? How did you know that? Pachysandra under the basketball net. About two year's worth. Wow. That's twice you've impressed me. A new world record. I'm Monica. Monica Waters. And you are? Um, me. Um - Monk. - Monk. Adrian Monk. Hi. Oh, it's, uh It's I, um Could I take a look inside the garage? Yeah, sure. You'll need this. Thanks. He's a detective? A private consultant. - Is he married? - No. He's wearing a wedding band. He thinks about his wife a lot. You know, she's deceased. - Oh. He's ""germaphobic""? - Yep. With classic obsessive-compulsive tendencies. How did you know that? - Oh, my God.! Oh, my God.! - What? Oh, my God! What's wrong? It's perfect. It's immaculate. You see, it's divided into different sections gardening, automotive. You made little labels so that you always know where everything goes. My husband was very organized, so I guess it kind of rubbed off. Hold it! Hold it. May I? That's got it. May I say something? If I ever have a garage, I want it to look just like this. Well, is there anything else? No. No, not not really. Okay. Well, it was very nice meeting you, Mr. Monk. Uh-Uh, however, in the future, I might have quite a few questions. Okay, so how does that work? Should I come to your precinct? Well, no. I don't really have an office there. We could have coffee, or or do you eat dinner? Yes, l-I've been known to eat dinner. Do I eat dinner? Yeah, you eat dinner. We both eat dinner. Then it's a date. ""It's a date""? This place has really changed. You've been here before? We used to come here all the time. You and your wife? Yeah, it's so different. That blackboard was over there, and I think the salt and pepper shakers are new. Is that it? Yeah, that that's it. You don't like change, do you? I have no problem with change. I just don't like to be there when it happens. Hi. I'm Vickie. Hi, Vickie. I'm Adrian Monk, and this is Monica Waters. Hi. / I'll have the Caesar salad and some coffee, please. Great. / And I'll have the veal. Okay. - And, uh Oh, never mind. - Okay. Excuse me. I wonder, could I get separate plates for the potatoes and the vegetables? You want them all on separate plates? - Please. - Okay. You don't like your food to touch? I believe most people don't like their food to touch. They just don't have the guts to admit it. And I bet you bring your own silverware. No. Please. I'm not a fanatic. So, you said you had quite a few questions. That may have been an exaggeration. How many do you have? None. I have none. Don't you want to ask me about Grayson, the neighbor from hell? No. I don't think he did it. I don't I don't buy the motive. Then what are we doing here, Mr. Monk? I'm not sure. Okay, then I have a question for you. Sharona said after your wife died, you never left the house. That's not true. I went outside to get the paper twice. And now you're a famous detective. Oh, far from famous. The other cops certainly respect you. The mayor calls you and depends on you. You're obviously out of the house. How did you do it? Captain Stottlemeyer was worried about me, and he hired a nurse to take care of me. She showed up one day and just never left. You got lucky. You found the right person. That's a secret, isn't it? How long were you married? Oh, look! A jukebox! D-7. Â¢Ã I don't know if it's cloudy or bright Â¢Ã Â¢Ã I only have eyes Â¢Ã Â¢Ã For you Â¢Ã So how did it go last night? Fine. What did you talk about? Mostly we talked about me. She-She kept asking me questions. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I think maybe she's interested in me. - Okay. - Is that impossible? That a woman like her could be interested in me? Sharona. I'm thinking. Talk about nerve. He kills the guy, then shows up at the funeral. I don't think he killed anybody. Did you get a look at that ring he wears? - The guy was a Green Beret. - So? You saw the crime scene. It was a mess. That was a real struggle. It must have gone on for three minutes. How could a 65-year-old man fight off a former Green Beret? He didn't want to die. Good afternoon. Thanks for coming. We gather today on this sad day to say good-bye to our dear, departed friend, Lou Pratt. That man who committed his life to the principles of reason has been taken from us in such an unfair manner Is irony in its most bitter form. Anyone who knew this tough, hard-nosed attorney knew Lou Pratt's most well-guarded secret. The man was a teddy bear. It is why many of you have come here today to say good-bye to a man who was always there for you. As an attorney, Lou Pratt was a man who always let you know where you stood. Excuse me. - Can I help you? - Thanks. We're fine. Most of us preferred to stand with him instead of against him. Sir, please! Enough is enough! about Lou was his belief in the concept of compromise. / Thank God. - And heaven help the man - Can you believe this guy? He's hacking up a lung. A guy's got his limits, right? That was mine. I just couldn't help myself. Do you see how assertive you were? It actually does feel pretty good. Hey! You! You should be ashamed of yourself. I am, 24-7. Do you know what tomorrow is? Thursday. Tomorrow is my uncle's birthday. He would've been 90 years old. - Hey, he didn't mean to kill him. - He was coughing on my neck. He was my hero. I could feel the spray on the back of my neck. Monk! Where's Grayson? He's still inside. Monk doesn't think he did it. Oh, really? Well, this should interest you. Grayson bought a bunch of knives online a year ago that match the murder weapon. A million people buy knives online. And we know Grayson collects weapons. What do you got? ""Something's wrong, Captain. It doesn't make any sense, Captain."" Huh? You got nothin', Monk. Grayson is the guy. If I had a farm, I'd bet it. - Let's go home. I need a shower. - Who needs this? Okay, Sherman, let's go. Come on! Sherman? Come on, boy. Come on! Let's go. Come on! Oh, no. Sherman! Come on. Where are ya? Sher Here, boy! Sherman? What are you doing in her garage? What's wrong, boy? What's wrong? Sherman, what are you doing in here? What's going on in here? Adrian? Adrian? Hey. Hey yourself. How did you sleep? Mmm. You know, I don't think she looks anything like me. That's what I've been saying. Are you attracted to her? Of course not. It's okay if you are. You're only human. I'm not attracted to her. Adrian Monk, you're the world's greatest detective and the world's worst liar. Hello? Are you there? - Adrian, if you're there - Pick up the phone. Monk, hello? Where are you? If you're there, please pick up. - Hello? - Oh, thank God. Monica? Grayson is dead. He was in my garage. I found him. - I didn't know who else to call. - It's okay. It's okay. They've been questioning me for the last hour and a half. Adrian, what's happening? Who's doing this? I don't know. They think I'm involved. Do you need a lawyer? I have a lawyer. What I need is a friend. Stand back, ma'am. How'd that happen? She must've called him from the station. He's like a bad cold. Ma'am, could you excuse us, please? It's okay. Captain. How's your friend? She's a little upset. Yeah, I'll bet she is. Well, that's it for Grayson. He's no longer a suspect. But I think we're in the right neighborhood. / Uh-huh. Somebody used his dog to lure him in here. The murder weapon. He was struck from behind. - Any prints? - No. Negative on the shovel. Negative on the dog collar too. Probably wearing gloves. Please don't touch that. Any ideas, Monk? 'Cause I have a few. - Most of'em involve your girlfriend. - She's not She has means, motive. They've been feuding for years. And threatening each other. Now he turns up dead in her garage. He's dead. The lawyer's dead. Lawyer's secretary's dead. A whole lot of dead people. That light with the motion detectors. It's all smashed. Yeah. Probably with the shovel. Our killer preferred to work in the dark. Why didn't he just turn it off? No, the killer couldn't find the switch. Why? Because he'd never been in the garage before. Or she was hiding near the light, it came on, she freaked out and she smashed it with the shovel. That's possible, Monk. - Isn't that possible? - It's possible. Yes. Here's the situation. Your friend Monica Waters is a suspect in three homicides. Oh, no, no, no. Yes. Monk, you're not seeing this clearly. You're too close to her. You've got a big blind spot. - I just don't - Adrian, listen to me. She is not Trudy. Miss Waters, your garage is an active crime scene. It's off limits. Understood? Yeah. You're not planning on leaving town, are you? No. / Good. Adrian, what's going on? Am I a suspect? They're just They're just doing their job. I can't believe this is happening. What if they're still out there? What if I'm next? Well, I can't stay here alone. What the hell am I supposed to do? I could stay here tonight. You would do that? Can I have a sleepover? First aid kit and toothbrush. Backup toothbrushes. Backup bristles for the backup toothbrushes. I am not coming to get you in the middle of the night. You won't have to get me. I'm not a child, Sharona. I can't find my P.J.'s. Gently. Adrian, I don't have a good feeling about her. Underwear. Four pair should be enough. - I think she's dangerous. - I think you're jealous. I am not jealous. I am scared. Three people are dead. The only danger I'm in tonight is running out of talcum powder. Oh! Talcum powder. Hello? Hi. Uh, I'm right down the hall, and this is you. Right down the hall? Wow! Wow, this is a great room. This is Derrick's This was Derrick's study. - Moist towelettes. You didn't have to. - So you're all right, then? Are you kidding? I may never leave. I mean, you know Uh, the couch folds out, and there are clean sheets. Oh, I brought my own. Adrian, I have sheets. Well, as long as I brought my own, I might as well might as well use them. It's no big deal. Um, the only thing I need is a pillowcase. - Pillowcases. - That's a lot of pillowcases. Yeah. Derrick never used the same one twice. That must have been hard - living with somebody like that. - Yes.. and-and no. I'll put them here for you. Well, dinner's about ready. I hope you're hungry. Oh, yeah. I'll just, uh I'll-I'll be right with you. I just want to, uh, go and freshen up. Okay. Captain! Captain, look at this. Derrick Waters, Monica's ex-husband. Give me a quarter. His credit cards were never canceled. The last thing he bought was on March 11. - Then he just disappeared. - March 11. When did she start building that garage? March 14, same year. Son of a bitch. He's under the garage. Should we call Monk? No. Let him read about it in the paper. - Maybe we should call him. - Why? I just talked to Sharona. He's there. He's where? Monica? Monica? There you are. - Oh. Should we eat? - Are you okay? Fine. Let's eat. Adrian, you were in the bathroom for, like, two hours. I don't think so. It's 9:30. I don't think so. I knocked on the door, like, five times. You did? You kept saying, ""Just a minute."" I did? / Then you recited the lyrics to ""Duke of Earl."" Really? I guess I'm a little nervous. And then for, like, 20 minutes, you were gargling or something. Sorry. Why don't I pour you a glass of wine? It's certainly had a chance to breathe. Hello? Monk, it's me. Get out of there. What? / Listen to me. She's a killer. You're in danger. Get out of the house. What did you say? She is a killer, Monk. Get out of there. - Who is it? - Sharona. Is she standing right there? That's right. Listen to me. Her husband disappeared two years ago. Two days later, she started building the garage. Monk, she killed him. She buried him under the garage. We're getting a court order tonight. We're gonna dig him up in the morning. Of course I'll be there. I wouldn't miss it for the world. Just get out of there, okay? Bye. That was Sharona. Her son got the lead in the school play. Oh, really? What play? Gandhi. Gandhi? Is that a play? I think they added a few songs. You wanna come? Oh, I think I'll be having a headache that night. To new friends. Well, I've been keeping dinner warm in the kitchen. Are you all right? Yes. Perfect. I love these dishes. They were my grandmother's. When I was four years old, she told me I could have them when she died. I said I can't wait. You're not eating. I ate in the bathroom. I had some mints. Try my salad. I made the dressing myself. Okay. Mmm. Mm-mm. Delicious. You didn't taste it. Sure I did. And it's very good. No, you didn't. Open your mouth. Let me see. Okay. I promise I won't be upset. Just tell me the truth. Are you trying to kill me? - What? - It's okay if you are. L-I just need to know. Is this poisoned? Do you think I could hurt you? He's under the garage, isn't he? - Who is? - Your ex-husband. You buried him under the garage. - How could you say that? - Everybody's saying it. My husband, Derrick, is a schizophrenic. He had a complete breakdown two years ago. He's in a private institution. We've been trying to keep it a secret. He didn't want his family to know. Oh, my God! He's in Zurich, isn't he? At the Breinnhoff Clinic? How did you know that? It's the best hospital in the world for psychological disorders. I'd be there myself, but I don't fly. Oh. / And you have soap from different hotels in Zurich. I assumed you liked to take ski vacations. Who is it? Who's there? I've got a gun. No, you don't, Monk. Captain. Captain, listen. - You don't want to do this. - What is that? Pepper spray? Let me explain. Look, you don't want to do this! Hold him. Charley, hold him. Ma'am, we're in the process of getting a warrant. - We're gonna dig up your garage. - Why? I think you know why. Captain, before you say another word, Derrick Waters is not buried under that garage. He's in Zurich. He's in a private clinic. He's been there for two years. In Zurich? / Yes. I have a number if you want to verify it. In Zurich? Really? So where does that leave us? We're back at square one. Thank you. Thank you very much. Welcome to square one. What are we doing here? I know you told me, but I didn't listen. Okay, one more time. - The burnt file. - What? - Grayson's file. The burnt file. - Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh, God. It had nothing to do with anything. Absolutely nothing. - It was a decoy. - A decoy? The real answer is in one of these other files. Oh, you have to be joking. If I was joking, it would certainly be a lot funnier than this. We-We can't read all of this. Look at this! - Oh, this is gonna take forever. - Better get started. We have to think of something else. This is ridiculous. Wait! - What? - Wait a minute. ""Thomas Katterskill."" Who's that? That's our guy. ""To my beloved grandchildren, I leave $2.4 million to be divided between you. And the balance of my estate, totaling more than $97 million, I leave to my alma mater, Westmore University."" - Excuse me? - My alma mater, Westmore University. No, no, no. Wait a minute. This is a joke. There's something wrong. Well, son, I know it's a bit unorthodox No. It's wrong. This is not the right will. He left everything to me. How do you know that, Todd? I know you. You were at the memorial service. This is your uncle's will. Actually, it's a forgery of your uncle's will. But this is what you expected to hear today, isn't it? I don't know what you're talking about. It's dated October 4, kid. You screwed up. The notary public who was supposed to have signed this was on a cruise in the Caribbean on October 4. We were in the file room yesterday. You see the little tabs at the top? Some are on the left, some on the right, some in the middle. Mr. Pratt had a system. When he put files away, he alternated them left, right, middle so they'd be easier to read. And they were all arranged like that, except for this one. It's a middle, and it was right behind another middle. We all assumed that the killer broke in here to burn a file or to steal a file, but we were wrong. The killer broke in to add a file. Here's what happened. Your uncle was dying, and you knew you'd been cut out of the will. So you wrote up a phony will, where you inherited everything. And, of course, you had to kill Lou Pratt. He was your uncle's attorney, and he would've spotted the forgery. And after you killed him and his assistant, you put the phony will in the file, but you couldn'tjust stop there. The cops would've wondered, ""Why was Lou Pratt murdered?"" And they would've gone through every one ofhis files, and eventually they would have found your phony will. So you had to send them down the wrong road, and any wrong road would do. You picked a file at random, and you burned it. And it worked. Everybody was concentrating on Grayson and Monica Waters and the disputed garage. But when you overheard me at the funeral, you got scared. Because you knew I was having serious doubts about Grayson. So you killed him to push us even further down that wrong road. Oh! I forgot to mention we brought Mr. Grayson's dog with us. It looks like he remembers you. It's okay. Hey, Monk. I'm sorry. You don't have to say that. Yes, I do. The commissioner is making me. Adrian? Is it really over? I knew you could do it. Monica, l - I, uh - I just wanted I just have to Go ahead. I'm sorry. You go. I just wanted to say you're an extraordinary man. I had just about given up, but spending time with you reminded me of how things were with Derrick and l how I want us to be again. I'm flying off to Zurich this week, but I won't be coming home until he's better. He's a lucky man, Brace yourself, Monk. I'm gonna kiss you good-bye."
"﻿And there's the starting gun, kicking off the 25th annual Chronicle Marathon, San Francisco. Over 6,000 runners in the race today, and it is perfect running weather. And there is Tonday Mawwaka, number 534. What a story he is. The legendary ""Proud Lion."" He's a two-time Olympic champion, and he's come from his homeland of Nigeria to run in today's event, which he's referred to as his final lap. Of course, Tonday's threatened to retire before, but if this does turn out to be his valedictory race, it'll be quite a day to remember. We'll be checking in with his progress all through our continuous coverage of the marathon. - Two cameras? - Yeah. In case one breaks. Where is he? Well, he won't be near the front. - I mean, you know, he's 65 years old. - Sixty-three. He's my idol. Did I mention that? About a million times. No, seriously. Tonday Mawwaka is the greatest runner who ever lived. I saw him run in Los Angeles in 1973. He was 400 yards behind with less than a mile to go. He had nothing left, and somehow he just he just found it. It was the most amazing finish. I can't believe you never heard of him. What? That man. He missed a button. Don't worry about it, okay? Come on, just have fun. Sixty-three years old, he's still running the marathon. I've got to get into shape. - No. You're in great shape. - Nah. I used to be. Now if I can't find the remote control, I just watch whatever's on. Look at him. How can he stand it? Hold on to this. Excuse me, sir. - You missed a button. - What? You missed a button. - You'll thank me later. - Oh, oh! Adrian! Will you get the hell away from me? I'm trying to enjoy this race here. Here it is. It's no problem. - Adrian! - If you just - These are in the way. - No, they're not in the way. - You're in the way! - I'm very good at buttons. Get away! Get away! Go! Go! - There it is. Okay. - You missed him! You've just missed him! Look, he's wearing blue shorts. Look. There he is. There Oh, no, that's not him. Knowing Trevor, he probably stopped to sell someone a sofa bed. Lisa, what is wrong with me? I can't stand the son of a bitch, and I'm trying to catch a glimpse of him. This is ridiculous. No, I know. No, I know. That's why I told him he has to make up his mind once and for all. The guy can't have his cake and eat it too. Bye. Hello, Gwen. Trevor. What what are you doing here? I thought you were running the marathon. MONK Season 1 Epi. 09 Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man  I can't believe I missed him. I can't believe I missed Tonday. Well, it's your own fault. You should have ignored the stupid sweater. - It was askew. - So what? So what? Why can't you just let people be askew? - What are you, the askew police? - Yes, I'm the askew police. - What's going on? - Is that the captain? You got two out, two kids on, first and third, all right? - My kid throws a fastball like - Captain. Captain.! - What? - I just talked to the building manager. - He's on his way. - Okay, all right. Work the street. Get statements from everybody. - Let's get to it. This is not going to go away. - Yes, sir. This is supposed to be my day off! You're telling me. Monk, what are you doing here? You chasing ambulances now? We were just driving by. What do ya got? We got a dead girl. She lives on the 21 st floor. Either she slipped or she jumped or she had some help. - It was murder. - It's a possibility, yeah. No, that's what happened. It was murder. And how can you know that, Monk? You just got here. Her toenails. She didn't finish painting them. She was obviously interrupted. Isn't that the style now? Like you know. I think you might be right. Go ahead. Anyway, we'll know soon enough when the medical examiner looks at her. Gum? Thanks for dropping by. - Yeah. Good luck with this. - It's good to see ya. Yeah. As long as you're here, you want to make a few bucks? - Sure. - Good. - Contract. - Excellent. That's what I thought. Thanks, Paul. Boys and girls, listen up. That was the medical examiner. She was strangled before she went over the edge. This is now a homicide investigation, which means do not touch anything, don't lean on anything and be careful where you walk. What do you think? She lived alone? Yeah, she lived alone, but check this out. Excuse me. She has beer in the fridge and cigars in the humidor. Boyfriend. Yeah, and according to her neighbor, she had an ex-husband and a boyfriend who nobody ever saw. Well, somebody was paying the bills. She was on unemployment. And somebody was buying her a lot of gifts. She hasn't opened any of them. Maybe she was planning to return them. I mean, look at this guy's taste. What are you talking about? This stuff is great. I mean, look at this Sharona. Evidence. Oh. Do you smell that? No. - What is that? - Chamomile. It's an herb. It grows wild, like a weed. - I know what chamomile is. - Used to make tea. - Yeah. Check the kitchen for chamomile tea. - Yes, sir. Captain. Look at this. Her speed dial. Number three is blank. If she had a lover, and she was trying to be discreet She would not have listed his name. I've got it, sir. Wait. - Hello? - Hi. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer with the San Francisco Police Department. Whom am I talking to? Hey, it's me, Trevor McDowell. We've just opened a new furniture showroom right here in San Mateo, right off Route 101. Break! Hey, listen, if your family's like mine, the furniture in your house takes a real beating.! Okay, keep it clean! Keep it clean! Gloves up! That's why you need furniture that can go the distance. Isn't that right, honey? With low prices that'll knock you out! Like this couch. It's regularly 799, but with a quick jab from Tyler, that old price is T.K.O.'ed! - It's yours for only 649.! - You see that lamp there? It's got - Don't even think about it. - But it's not Stop. Stop. It's supposed to Normally it's 1399, but with a mighty blow from Luke, here Whoa! That old price is down for the count! It's yours for only 1299! Heavyweight furniture at featherweight prices. Tables! Chairs! Sofas! Lamps! Love seats! You name it! At McDowell's, if we can't beat the competition, we'll throw in the towel! - Cut.! Cut.! Who is that? - What? Get him out of there.! I'm sorry. It was a little Was l Okay, take two. Oh, my God. - Trevor McDowell? - Yes, sir? I'd like to talk to you. What's going on? Nothing serious. I think maybe one of his employees is passing bad checks. Honey, I'm sure it's okay. Take the kids inside and I'll see you in a little bit. Okay. Come on, guys. Good work today, guys. You've got a beautiful family, Mr. McDowell. You don't have to tell me that. Can I get you anything? Nothing for me, thanks. Have a seat. Water? Oh, no, thank you. It's okay. So, about Gwen, I heard about it on the news, but they said she was murdered. - Is that true? - That's true. Horrible. Do you have any leads? We're workin' on it. She was your girlfriend. Yes, sir. I really screwed up big time. How long have you been screwing up? I met her two years ago. She was an actress in one of my commercials. She was the girl in the water bed. Oh, my God. I remember that one. Yeah, yeah. I liked that commercial. - You're a natural in front of the camera. - Oh, thank you. Do you drink tea, Mr. McDowell? Uh, sometimes, yes. - Chamomile tea? - No. The building manager said you'd been paying her rent. He also said you called him a month ago to say you would not be renewing the lease. That's correct. I was trying to break it off when I realized I made a mistake. My family's my life. - Gwen understood that. - Did she? I thought she did. We talked about it. Do you have an alibi for 7:55 this morning? on Haight Street. Anybody see you there? Oh, yes, about a thousand people. See, I was running in a marathon. You realize we have several ways to verify that. Good, because the sooner you clear me, the sooner you can catch the bastard who did this. That's my card with my office number. That's my home number. If there's anything I can do to help, please don't hesitate to call. I'll be in touch. Good luck with the investigation. Okay, that's a wrap.! How'd you do? Excuse me? In the marathon. How'd you do? Three hours, 41 minutes. Personal best, actually. I've been training like a demon. Were you drafting or running open field? Open field. You a runner? Uh, years ago. High school. Made All-State. You ran? What? I just can't picture you on a track team. I had a life, you know, before we met. Oh, no, no. I know you had a life. I just didn't think it involved wearing gym shorts and showering with other guys. I didn't shower with other guys. I had a note from my doctor. I bet you had lots of notes from your doctor. As a matter of fact, I did. I had a whole, separate binder. What are we doing here when the captain already checked this guy out? He definitely ran the marathon. I know. I just I just want to make sure. Hello. Can we help you? Oh, no. It's a stampede. Get a wipe ready. Oh. I'm Adrian Monk. I called earlier. Oh, Mr. Monk. Please excuse the mess. After the marathon, wejust kind of hibernate for a while, you know. - This is my assistant Sharona. - Hi. Oh, I'm this year's chairperson, Angie Morrison. - This is Tillie Graves, Cicily Fraiser, - Hi. - And Brandon Connelly over there. - Got it. - Brandon Connelly, - hi. And this is CarlJenkins. He's our chief of security. - Hi, Carl. - Hi. Thank you. You got a problem with me? What? Oh, no, no, no. You don't want to shake a brother's hand, you just say so. You don't gotta go wiping it off. Oh, no. He does that to everybody. Am I blind? Do I look like I'm blind? I saw what I saw. I'm gonna go and lock up downstairs. If I stick around here, I might do something I'll regret. - We're all just people, Mr. Monk. - Of course we are. L-I always have to I'm not - Oh, no. He's not. - What can we do for you? I just need some information. - How many people ran in the marathon today? - 6,111. People of all colors and creeds. I'm sure they were. I wouldn't have it any other way. Um, how do you keep track of them all? Oh,That's all computerized. The runners are all issued one of these, and it attaches to the top of their shoe. There's a teeny, tiny little computer chip inside there. We've got scanners at the starting line and another at the finish line, and they read the computer chip. It's all very modern. We've got everybody's time right down to a 10th of a second. But what if someone left the race and then came back later? Well, we'd know right away. We've got checkpoints all along the route. We had scanners every mile to keep track. Um, we're interested in a runner named Trevor McDowell. Oh, McDowell, number 948. The police were asking about him earlier. There he is. Yeah, he ran it in three hours, That's a really respectable time. Quite respectable. All of our racers are winners, be they black, white or Latino. It takes many colors to make a rainbow. Yes, ma'am. L I'm a big rainbow guy. He loves rainbows. About Mr. McDowell, did he miss any checkpoints? Oh, let's have a look. Uh, no. He ran the whole course start to finish. Paced himself beautifully, though. Mr. Zaleski? How about I call you Arthur? - Well, you can call me whatever the hell you want. - Good. How long were you and Gwen married? Four years. She walked out, and you still loved her. Sure. I had feelings for her. I bet you did. Then she picks up with the dinette furniture salesman. TVguy. That's humiliating. You werejealous. You became furious. I'd feel the same way. I don't like this, being here. You're not supposed to like being here, Arthur. This is an interrogation room. It's not a sports bar. - I need a wipe. - Why? Do you have a wipe? So why were you harassing your ex-wife? We've got the phone records, Artie. You were calling her twice a day. I don't call my wife twice a day. I was worried about her. You call it ""worried."" Thejudge called it ""stalking."" That was three years ago. What happened, Arthur? You went over there to talk, right? You lost your temper trying to talk to her? Everybody has a temper. What is that? What is that noise? Excuse me. Come on. Okay, one more time from the top. - So how long were you and Gwen married? - How's it going in there? It's going great, except he wants to know what the little squeaky noise behind the mirror is. That might have been me. There's a smudge. I think it's on your side. You can get it when you go back in. I'm sorry. You think he's the guy? It's possible. He had a restraining order against him at one time, which apparently he honored. He says he was at home in bed at the time. I'd say he's a D-plus, a C-minus. What do you got? - Trevor McDowell. - No. He was running the marathon. - It checked out. - I don't know how he did it, but he's the guy. I'll tell you why. Because Gwen was killed first, then she was thrown off the balcony. That's the key. Why would the killer draw attention to himself? There's only one reason: To establish the exact time of death. He wanted everyone to know precisely when she died. Why? Because he had an alibi. An airtight alibi. What do you think? What do I think? I think it's not possible because he was wearing a computer chip. And he passed all the checkpoints. I know. You're right. That's right. Unless he took the chip off and passed it off to another runner. That's interesting. Yeah. Maybe he dropped it in another guy's pocket so it looked like he finished the race. That's very interesting. You are a genius. Anything else I can help you with? Give him a wipe. Just give him one. Smudge stays. You go. So now we're looking for two runners. That's right. We're looking for another runner who had the exact same time as Trevor McDowell. Right, right. Someone who was neck and neck with him for the whole race. Neck and neck. Okay. That shouldn't be too hard. Hi, Tillie. No. Sorry. Nobody else had the exact same time. Look, um, are we finished here? Just one more thing. Was there another runner whose time at all the checkpoints was close to McDowell's, like within a second or two? Close? Mm-hmm. Uh, well, look at that. There's a runner here who ran the whole race just a few paces from Mr. McDowell. Number 534. Here's the printout. Who is it? Sharona? Tonday. - Tonday? You know, I read an article about this hotel. - You know how much a suite costs? - Huh? $2,000 a night. You said Tonday was a simple, quiet man, like a poet. So? So how many poets could afford to stay here? What are you saying? I'm saying that he could have made some extra money helping a rich furniture salesman kill his mistress. Shh! That is not possible, okay? It is off the table. End of discussion. Don't touch anything. You're telling me not to touch anything? That's Tonday's fruit. Sorry to keep you waiting. Tonday Mawwaka. Adrian Monk. Ah, Adrian! How nice to meet you. Sir, l I have admired you ever since I was a very strong child - Young child. - Young child. This is Sharona, my my something. I'm his assistant. It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Mawwaka. Just call me Tonday. Please, come on. Let's sit. Make yourselves comfortable. Sir, I saw you run in Los Angeles in 1973. - The big comeback. - Yeah. I still don't know how I did it. Well, it changed my life. You You were You are a UmAdrian was a runner too. Ah, is that so? - What were you running? - L-l-I ran what you ran. Just not as fast. - You still run? - No. No, I quit. Why? There There was an incident. In high school, during a race. So they broke your spirits. You know, spirits are very fragile, easy to break, but not impossible to repair. I like that. You know, the hotel manager tells me that you were with the police? I'm helping the police. - Ayoung woman has been killed. - Oh. Have some tea! - Oh, thank you. - There you go. Tonday, we're interested in another runner Trevor McDowell. Do you know him? - No. - No. Okay. All right. Wait a second. Okay, hold on. Okay. Just try try that one. What? No. I tried this one already. It doesn't I tried it. Well, you're holding it the wrong way. You're not even Give it to me. No, let me do it. I can do it. Oh. There There it is. Thank you. That old man is me? That's you. And there's McDowell right behind you. According to the computer, he said that he was behind you or just in front of you for the whole race. Ok, And later later in the racehere you see, McDowell's disappeared. He doesn't show up again until the very end. Do you remember if he was near you the entire time? I'm sorry. When I'm running, I'm not thinking about other runners. I'm testing myself. Um, l-I really love this place. Um, does the marathon committee pay for all of this? You ask me if I can afford a suite like this? No. Well, a month ago, I signed a big contract with a big shoe company. Let me guess. Size ten. Did you hear what he said to me? ""From one runner to another."" Remember Tonday gave me some tea? Yeah. Well, I saved the tea bag. - What is it? - Chamomile. Let it go. It's a coincidence. You think it's just a coincidence that your hero, Tonday, - drinks chamomile tea? - Yes, I do. I love these sneakers. Oh, I see. I see. Whenever I think of something, it's just a coincidence. Whenever you think of something, it's a work of genius. Exactly. It was McDowell. He did it. - How? - Don't know yet. Okay. Well, according to this video, Tonday came through here at 47 minutes, 15 seconds, and McDowell was a few seconds behind him. Amazing. Am I touching the ground? Because I don't feel the ground. Did I mention these were a gift from my friend Tonday? What are you doing? I'm running circles around you. That's how fast I am. Oh, you think you're faster than me, huh? Okay, from here to that pole and back. Fine. This should be easy for you. You're good at touching poles. Oh, now I'm not gonna be able to run because I'm laughing so hard. Okay. - Ready, get set, go - All right, hold it, wait. This line's a little crooked. It's straight enough. Okay, good. - On your mark - Hold it, hold it. Wait. It doesn't have to be perfect. Oh, forget it! Just forget it. He's like He's driving me insane. That's it! I got it! It's perfect now. W-Wait. Okay, after this point, McDowell is no longer visible on the tape. This is it. It's a blind spot right here. You see how the path curves? No room for spectators. If he timed it right, he'd be completely alone. He could duck behind those bushes. Nobody would miss him. When were they here? Um, one hour and five minutes into the race. Start the watch. We're gonna time this out. Stop the watch. What is it? - Smell it. - Ooh. No. It's chamomile. We'll have the lab check for traces at the crime scene. What was he doing here? Changing his clothes. Start the stopwatch. What are you doing? Changing my clothes. Would you mind? Please. Then he had to get across town. Oh.! There's a road over there. He couldn't have parked here. This street was blocked off on Sunday, remember? He couldn't have parked anywhere. Well, maybe he didn't drive. Then how did he get across town? How are we doing? Seventeen minutes, twenty seconds. Excuse me. Why don't you sit down? Well, at least hold the pole. How do you explain this: I touch everything you're afraid to touch, and I never get sick. I can't explain it. It's inexplicable. No. You're inexplicable. So are you gonna tell me? What? Why you quit running. You said there was an incident. Uh, ancient history. Come on. You know you're gonna tell me. Okay, fine. May 2, 1974. Our high school track team. We had a great year. We made it to the All-State conference. It was the biggest day of my life. It was all tied up. It came down to the last event: The 1500 meter. Everyone was depending on me. Butjust before the gun, I looked down, and my laces were, you know, uneven. - It was the first time that I had a problem like that in public. - Come on! Never ran again. That must have been terrible. I got over it. No, you didn't. That's true. I didn't. Thank you. Ooh! This is our stop. Now we run to the top of the hill. - That hill? - Yeah. I thought you made All-State. Okay, it's been 24 minutes and 10 seconds. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. That was some hill. It didn't look that steep from the bottom. - You want to stop? - No. I don't think McDowell took an elevator. He wouldn't want to be seen, right? Just one more flight! Okay. One more flight. Why would someone choose to live on the 21 st floor? - Are you all right? - I'm good. Your eyes are crossed. - They're okay now. - Let's go. You don't think he knocked? No. He had his own key to let himself in. Okay, okay, you're Gwen. The TVwas on, so she's probably sitting here, doing her nails. I'm the killer. I let myself in. I let myself in. He sat on the couch? I can do it from here. Okay, okay. She hears him, she turns around. You're Gwen! She turns around! She turns Okay. ""Trevor, I thought you were running the marathon."" They struggle. Struggle, struggle. He strangles her. Drags her off to the balcony. Go.! Come on.! He's in a hurry.! Go.! Okay, over she goes. What's the time? Thirty-nine minutes. Thirty-nine minutes. Okay, let's go. What are you doing? Uh, I think he took a nap. Yeah, you wish. Oh, my God. I love this chair. It vibrates. Sharona, we are not here to shop. This is our primary suspect. Well, maybe we can get a primary suspect discount. Well, well, well.! If it isn't Mr. Monk and Sharona, am I right? What can I do for you? Do you have a minute, sir? I have all the time in the world. There's a sale on all the convertible sofas if you're interested. - No, thanks. - I'll make you a great deal. Free home delivery. We're not here to shop. Although, if it turns out you're innocent, I'd like to talk to you about that recliner. Sharona. Um Do you know Tonday Mawwaka? I know ofhim. I've never met him. I believe he was running behind me for most of the race. We checked the records. You never turned in your computer chip. I forgot. And then later I misplaced it. You're crooked. I beg your pardon? Show him the picture. Is that you at the finish line? Yes. You ran 26 miles, and you're not sweating? I don't sweat that much. You know, some runners don't sweat at all. Is that everything? But here's what's been bothering me. This is you around mile five. Look at your shirt. It's completely drenched. Here's what happened. You had a problem. Her name was Gwen Zaleski. She didn't want to break it off. Maybe she threatened to tell your wife everything and ruin your perfect little world. So you disposed of her. You tossed her off the balcony like a bag of garbage. Mr. Monk, I love my family. They're my life. Do you think I'm gonna let somebody like you or anybody else take that away from me? So, true or false, Mr. Monk? According to the computer, I ran that entire race from start to finish. True or false? True. Trevor, it's your wife, line two. It's your wife, Trevor. Line two. The Zaleski alibi checks out. He was in bed making a phone call at the exact time of death. Yeah, It's not the ex-husband. No, sir. So, uh, where does that leave us? It leaves us with McDowell. - The boyfriend? - Yeah. He checked out. He ran the whole race. Okay, let's say that McDowell did pass the chip off to another runner. - That was your idea, sir. - You're damn right it was. You're thinking Tonday. No, no. Their times don't match up exactly. Well, then who? All right. Here's my idea. Let's say there were six runners. - Six? - Yeah. Tonday, McDowell, and these four guys: Harvester, Blanchard,Crowe and Davidson. They pass the chip back and forth among them. They were all running in the vicinity and - Like a conspiracy. - Well, no. I've worked the time out on this graph. Passing it back and forth, the time works out almost exactly. What do you think? Yeah, this is worth looking into, sir. It's all No, it's not. It's insane. There is absolutely no connection between those six men. Yeah, you're right. It's I was just playing devil's advocate with that. Uh There is something you don't see every day. A runner in this race with four legs. - Hang on a second. Stop the tape. - What? What's that right there? Go back a little. - Is that a dog? - Yeah. It's a poodle. Maybe he put the chip in the dog collar. That's a little poodle. Can a little poodle run 26 miles? Maybe he drugged it. I mean, if it's on drugs, yeah. I can call a vet. And, of course, our cameras will be there at the finish line and our microphones as well. We'll have interviews with the winners, the lead runners and also coverage of the presentation of the trophy. And here comes the group that everybody's waiting for as they run through the Castro area. Once again, huge applause for the ageless Tonday Mawwaka, still running steady and acknowledging the fans and he's loving this, and why not? Let's get a shot now from our motorcycle cam, just ahead ofTonday's group. And once again, of course, Tonday has told us he's planning to call it a career after this. But hey, he's said that before. And besides, there are various rumors - Are you all right? - I'm fine. What happened? You said it was a matter of life or death. I know how he did it. What are you talking about? - Who? - McDowell. I know how he killed her. I figured it out. You couldn't tell me over the phone? Well, I wanted to see your face light up when I told ya. Okay, I'll take a rain check on that lighting-up thing. Come on, let's go. And in other news, a private memorial service was held this morning for Gwen Zaleski, the young actress who was slain this Sunday. A department spokesman said they have a number of leads and expect to make an arrest Cover the office for me. I'll be right back. Take the next exit. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Sharona, it was right in front of us. We were looking at it all wrong. We thought that Trevor McDowell gave his computer chip to another runner. Like Tonday. Like Tonday, but no other runner - had the exact same time, right? - Right. I was just watching the tape again, and I realized it wasn't another runner. There was somebody else who ran that whole race from start to finish. Who? The TV camera bike. McDowell never even attached the chip to his shoe. He stuck it somewhere on the vehicle. Maybe he taped it or used one of those magnetic hide-a-key deals. McDowell started the race like everybody else. He followed Tonday and the bike for a few miles. Then, when he got to the curve in the road, Trevor McDowell quit the race, but his computer chip continued on. It didn't miss a single checkpoint. He had a change of clothes hidden in the bushes. Near the batch of camomile. Exactly. Then, after the murder, he reentered the race just before the end. The finish line was mass confusion. It was easy to rejoin the race. And that was it. He had an airtight alibi. It was the perfect crime. But what happened to the chip? I think it's still on the bike. There was no reason for him to retrieve it. Nobody knew it was there. And even if they did find it, they wouldn't know what it was. Here! Here we are. - Looks like all the vehicles are parked back here. - Uh-huh. Oh, my God! There's McDowell! We gotta get to that chip before he does. - Ugh! - What's wrong? - It's all rusty. - Okay, okay. It's okay. I'll do it. - Give me a boost. - What? Just put your hands like this. You're gonna step in my hand? That's how you give somebody a boost. Come on. I don't think so. Adrian, that chip is the only thing that connects him to the murder. If he finds it, he'll destroy it and then we can't nail him. - Give me a boost! - Let's just think. Maybe we could build a little ladder. Out of what? You know, branches and rocks. He found it! He found the chip! - Will you give me the boost? - Hurry up! Hurry up! - All right, all right. - Come on! - Not thatNot that foot? - Why? - The other foot. You stepped in something with that one. Now go. Go! - You got it? - Wait, wait. Okay. Okay. L Wait, wait, wait! What? - He saw us! - McDowell! - Adrian, run.! - What? Adrian, Run after him! You're faster! You can do it! Go, Adrian! He's heading for the beach.! McDowell! Did you see that? Did you see that? He had about 40 yards on me! I know. Look behind you! What? Look behind you! There goes your evidence, Monk.! Officer, wait a minute. Do you know who I am? Yes, sir. You sold me a dinette set last year. - Oh. - Watch your head. Trev, you might want to make a note in case it ever comes up again: These new plastic hide-a-keys, turns out they don't sink. Yeah, they float. - Tonday.! - Hey.! You shouldn't have done this. I mean, I could have taken a taxi to the airport. It's no problem. - We wanted to say good-bye. - Uh-huh. - That right? - Oh, close. Adrian, did you solve your case? Ah! I knew you would. I remember thinking, ""This man is stronger than he thinks he is. You know, he can run the race!"" Here, I've got something for you. Tonday, I can't accept anything else. After we met, I had them send it to me. It's the It's the headband you wore in Los Angeles, 1973. Adrian, I can tell you're searching for something. Life is a long and difficult race. You must hang on, hold on to it. Amandla. Amandla. That means ""courage."" Thank you, my friend. Thank you for this. This means the world to me. I haven't worn it since the big race, or washed it. Baggie. Baggie. Baggie. Baggie. Just give it to me. But be careful with it. Don't wrinkle it, all right? Don't even look at it. You can You can glance at it, but don't stare. It's just a sweaty piece of cotton. Hey! What are you Don't You're crushing it now. Just give it back to me. Here. Just go in the car. Go in the car. Think it could be dry-cleaned? Courage. Yeah."
"﻿I think I'll go back to the room. Yeah, you don't want to burn. You've been out here for, what, 10 minutes? What happened to the bathing suit I bought you? I'm wearing it underneath. - You're not gonna even try? - I am what I am. Well, you do what you want. This is my first vacation in three years, and I'm gonna make every minute count. I tried doing that once making every minute count. - It gave me a headache. - What doesn't? Hey, Mom. You owe me an ice cream sundae. We had a bet. Mom said you wouldn't come outside even once.

He brings his staff here every year for a conference. How do we know the boy just didn't make it up? Oh, no. He's He's a good boy. He doesn't lie. - All children lie. - Not him. Not to me. Of course you would say that. You're his father. I am not his father. His mother works for me. Tony Landis, this is Adrian Monk. Adrian is a former homicide detective. I just talked to his captain in Frisco. He says we're lucky to have him. Miss Bronwynn, these people are on vacation. Okay, Tony. Tell you what. Why don't you let 'em out, and then you can tell the victim's family and the police why you let the murderer go. Fine. Check it out. As discreetly and quickly and discreetly as possible. You You said discreetly twice. Exactly. In fact, I'll say it again. Discreetly. Mitzi. Mitzi. Mitzi. Muy importante. Did anyone come out of Room 401? No, ma'am. Okay. Go in there, close the door and be very quiet. Mr. Fenimore, could you open the door, please? Hotel security. What? You want me to go in backwards? No, no, no. On three, I go in high. You follow me. - Stay low. - Got it. Do I have something on my nose? Oh. No. That's just from The Sting. What sting? No, the movie The Sting. They were always doing this. What does it mean? I don't know. Okay. One, two, three. Hotel security. Is anybody here? What do you think? It's gotta be the wrong room. Benjy pointed it out. He said, ""Fourth floor, last room on the right."" Well, do you see anything? Looks pretty clean. No, nothing. Not a thing. Tell me about Benjy. He's a good kid. He's He wants to be a writer. He draws comic books. He said it-it happened right here. He said she pulled the curtain down. Mr. Monk, all due respect. I've seen crime scenes. This ain't one. What the hell? Mr. Fenimore. How you doing? I'm Rita Bronwynn, hotel security. This is Adrian Monk. He's assisting me. Assisting you with what? There's been a report of an incident in this room. - What sort of incident? - A fight. Here? No. Someone made a mistake. When did you leave this room, sir? - About an hour ago. - And where did you go? Down by the lake. I fed some ducks. - With your wife. - No. I was alone. Where is your wife at the present moment? Drove into town to do some shopping. When did this incident supposedly occur? About 15 minutes ago. Well, then it couldn't have been Irene. She called me on my cell just now. You and your wife are having problems, sir? Why would you say that? You're not sleeping in the same room. There's a travel alarm on the end table and some slippers under the couch. You're a very clever man. Yes, we had an argument. We made up this morning. Twice, if, uh, you understand what I mean. Yeah. Mr. Fenimore, can you have your wife call the front desk as soon as she gets in? If you insist. Oh, sir, do you happen to have a picture of your wife? Yeah. Sure. Well? Is this the woman you saw? I don't know. Maybe. Sorry. Benjy, wait here for one sec, okay? Okay. What did you find? / Zilch. It was the cleanest room I've ever seen. - Really? - I'd stay there. - Adrian, I hate to say this - What? - Maybe he did make it up. - Why would he do that? To impress you. Maybe he's trying to get your attention. You're talking about me, aren't you? - I saw what I saw. - He saw what he saw. Okay. You two have fun playing cops and robbers. I'm still on vacation, and I'm gonna play tennis with somebody. - You made a friend? - Yeah. You should try it sometime. And there he is. - Hey! - Hey. I was just about to call your room. My Sharona.  Uh, no, no, no. That was That was the first time. Uh, this is my boss, Adrian Monk, - and my son Benjy. - Hey, how you doing, guys? So, - what do you think? - You look great. I won't be able to keep my eye on the ball. Exactly my plan. I'll take them. Okay, I'll see you two later. And don't let him get into any trouble. I won't. I was talkin' to Benjy. Good shot! Mom could have got that shot. - Do you think she's letting him win? - I wouldn't be surprised. You know, why do girls do that? Someday you'll understand. When you do, call me and explain it to me. Now, I want you to tell me again exactly what you saw. Okay. Do you see anything? No. It looks as clean from the outside as inside. Mr. Fenimore. He's talking to a woman. I can't see her face. But it's definitely not his wife. - Benjy, can you read lips? - I'm in sixth grade. I can barely read words. - Yeah. Are you still there? - Yes, I'm here. Fenimore, John P. Well, he's a big fish. Chief Operating Officer for Marin Bay Investments. Makes a lot of money for a lot of people, Monk. Oh, here's a red flag. He was indicted three years ago. Domestic thing. A fight with his wife got out of hand. She dropped the charges the next day. - Is that it? - Yep. That's it. So, uh, would you like to tell me what's going on? I think this time he might have killed his wife. Where are you staying, Monk? The Bates Motel? No. But I have a feeling this place is run by the same company. She can't just quit. Her boyfriend called from Buenos Aires. We have the Labor Day weekend around the corner and we're at full capacity. She can't quit now. - Is there a problem? - Lupe Olivencia just quit. We ought to start giving them gold watches after three weeks. Basta, tu ganaste. All right. Mrs. Garcia, everybody does double shifts and I'll pay the overtime. - Tony, I wanted to ask you something. - What's going on? Oh, nothing. Doors are open. People can come and go as they please. - Well, how magnanimous of you. - But we still have to search the bags. Why? / He's going to try to dispose of the body. - What body? - Mrs. Fenimore. And your theory is based on what? Benjy witnessed a murder. And I saw Mr. Fenimore flirting with another woman. Most likely his assistant. Her name is Nicole Young. She comes with Mr. Fenimore and his staff here every year. Look, the point is Mrs. Fenimore is M.I.A. Tony, remember last Christmas, that jewelry was stolen? You didn't listen to me. I believe you were reprimanded for that. Fine! All right. You have one hour. After that, the siege is over, and we're back to normal. Yeah. / Or what passes for normal around here. Are you happy now? I'm never happy. Listen, I might have to stay an extra day or two until we get this sorted out. Oh, impossible. Quite out of the question. - We're overbooked as it is. - Copy that. We're on our way. Monk. They're heading for her room. We only have one hour. Mr. Fenimore, sir. Hi. Remember us? Yes, unfortunately. We've got a couple questions to ask you. Can't it wait? The Hong Kong market's about to open. Oh, is that what they're calling it now? Actually, ma'am, the Hong Kong market's closed today. It's a national holiday what they call Liberation Day. Open the door, would you, ma'am? We can talk inside. Would you mind telling me what the hell this is all about? Mr. Fenimore, I am 65 to 70% sure that you murdered your wife. Surprise! Oh, my I forgot all about it! - Oh, my goodness. - Happy birthday, darling. Oh, thank you, sweetie. Mr. Monk, I'd like you to meet Irene my wife. Darling, Mr. Monk is a detective, and he thinks I killed you in our suite this morning. I think I'd remember. Anything else? Happy birthday. Miss Bronwynn is a detective too, just like Mr. Monk. And you know what she has? She has a shoulder holster. Really. That's good. Is that a new one? Yeah, it's, um it's called Captain Invisible. I like it. Okay, honey. I'll be back around 10:00. You're gonna stay with Mr. Monk tonight, right? Yeah. We're just gonna go to the arcade. That should be fun. Benjy. How do I look? Different. Good. That's what I was going for. - Mom. - What? You believe me, don't you, about the, uh, lady getting killed. You know, I, uh l-I've been thinking a lot about that, and maybe you were just using your imagination like you do when you're drawing comic books. I wasn't. Why won't you believe me? Hey, look, Benjy. There's no body. It was a mistake, and that's a good thing because it means nobody was really hurt. Mr. Monk believes me. So, what, you're giving up now or what? - Nobody's giving up, Miss Bronwynn. - Oh, you can call me Bronwynn. I just I just need to look after the boy for an hour or two. Oh, I can see it now. I'm gonna be all alone doing this. Mr. Monk, would you like a toothpick? I like 'em minty. You care for one? No, thanks. / You sure? They're individually wrapped. Okay. Did you check out Fenimore's room again? - From top to bottom. - Did you find anything? Zip. It's clean. It's like an operating room up there. I even rented one of these things. Spectra-light. - Infrared. - Yeah. L-l-I've heard of these. Yeah? Have you seen the new model? It's awesome. It checks 14 different bodily fluids. - Fourteen? - Yeah. Uh, blood, saliva, semen Okay. That-That-That's okay. Thank you. - How does it work? - I'll show you. Here. Wait. I gotta turn these lights off. Turn, plea Turn it off, please. God, please. I think I'd like to switch rooms. We're all booked up. - Front desk. - Housekeeping? You see them? Fluids. - Fluids? - Bodily fluids. I'm gonna need everything scrubbed. S-Scrubbed. How do you say ""scrubbed""? - Scrubbed. - Scrubbed. The curtains, the carpeting. And did you bring bleach? - Bleach? - Bleach! The white god. Dios blanco. Good. That's good. Okay, take your time. Don't worry. I'll pay extra. Whatever it takes. Don't you worry, partner. They're a team of experts. I'm going downstairs to look for the stiff. Good luck, ladies. Good luck, ladies. And God be with you. He's your boss, right? - So why do you two vacation together? - I don't have a choice. The last time I tried to go without him, I had to come home after two days. - Was he ill? - Oh, no, no, no, no. It was just a garbage strike. The bags were piling up on the street. He was almost catatonic. You know. - That's like a marriage. - More like a bad marriage. So, um, have you ever been married, or Me? Oh, no. I mean, I'm allergic to rice. That's blood. Come on. - Oh, it's too wrinkled. - Okay, here. Try one of mine. How do you keep it looking like new? Hand-washed, no bleach. Tumble dry, medium heat. Cool iron. Okay. You got it? Someone's glasses. They're prescription. You'd think somebody would come looking for them. What? / She was wearing glasses. Who? The woman you saw? The victim? - Yeah. - Like these? I think so. Okay, look, I'm gonna go find Bronwynn. - Put 'em right here. - Okay. Can I leave you here for a couple of minutes? - Okay. - You stay right here? Yeah. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen. Please help me welcome back to comedy night here at Hanover Lake Resort, the man on the top of the C.I.A. 's Most Unwanted List, Chuck Byrn. Thanks very much, folks. Thanks for coming. Have you seen Rita Bronwynn? No. / Could you page her for me, please? It's very hot. Unbelievably hot. It didn't say in the brochure this place was located five blocks from the sun, did it? Oh, I went down to I saw the strangest thing on the beach. I was down there, walking around on the beach and Oh, my God. That's the guy. I saw that guy on the beach today, and you know what he was wearing? The exact same thing he's wearing right now. I couldn't believe it. How are ya? What's your name, sir? - Adrian, don't tell him. - Adrian? That's his name. That's a nice whisper. I didn't pick up on it at all. Very quiet. Very effective. Adrian's your name. Good to see you, Adrian. Thanks for coming down to the show. Let's give Adrian a big hand for coming down here, huh? Good to see ya. You kind of looked like a little bit like a vampire out there on the beach today. I'm not a vampire. Good thing. We're all gonna sleep better tonight knowing that. What are you doing here with the peanuts here, Adrian? This bowl had more, and I was helping to even them out. Evening out the peanuts. It's an important job. I think we might have hit the jackpot, folks. Get comfy, Adrian. We're gonna be talking to you for a little while. Hey. I bet you it's not really broken. They just want to make you think that to play the 50 cent games. I gotta go. Now this is fascinating. You keep your socks in Baggies. I really don't think it's that unusual. You don't think it's that unusual? Really. Maybe we could ask around. Does anyone else here keep their socks in Baggies? No. Sorry, Adrian. I think you're a freak. Not so fast, Adrian. Not so fast. You don't leave a slot machine when it's paying off, my friend. All right? So, you brought your own soap to the hotel. That's right. I guess because the hotel soap, that that just wouldn't be clean? Towels. Did you bring your own towels? - Yes. - Sheets? - Pillowcases? - Of course. Of course, yeah. You realize most people show up at hotels, they show up so they can steal that crap? What are What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Just There was a little fuzz on it, a little lint. Yeah, but that's my lint. You can't take my lint. That's my lint. That's my area. That's where That's where I keep my lint. That's my safe lint spot. You really want to pull it off of there, don't you? It's breaking you up inside, isn't it? Adrian, forget the fuzz. Forget it. There he goes, folks. He's got his lint, huh? How about a big hand for him? How proud you must be. You've got lint! Mom. Benjy. Benjy, what's wrong? What is it? You sure you're okay? You could have been killed. - I think that was the idea. - You didn't get a good look at them? No. I'm sorry. Then when I went back, the blood was gone. Someone had cleaned it up. Okay, it's right over here. Ninja Fury Four was out of order, but this kid said it really wasn't. So when I went back to plug it in, the back fell off and-and there she was. She was right there, Mom! I saw her! They would have had time to move the body. It was in there! She was, like, all wrapped up. It was the same woman you saw in the window? - I think so. - Of course it was. Why go to the trouble of inventing an entirely different victim? Tony. / I believe him. And it isn't just Benjy. Somebody tried to kill Miss Bronwynn. Really? But whoever it was wouldn't have risked carrying it down the hallway. Who has the key to this door? The entire staff. About 180 people. - Are you thinking inside job? - Maybe it's that comedian. Wouldn't that be great? - Do you have a piece of paper? - No. Isn't that a notepad in your pocket? - It's lime? - It's calcium oxide quicklime. - What's that supposed to mean? - It's used to cover up smells. Smugglers use it to fool drug-sniffing dogs. I've seen the mob use it when they try to hide a body. You've seen the mob use it? I mean, in that movie GoodFellas I saw it. - Actually, this is good news. - How so? Because it means the body's still in the hotel, right? So that means we have to keep checking every bag going out. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Your time is up. We had a deal. Oh, come on. The deal is off, Tony! Work with us here. If they get rid of the body, we have no case. I'll give you until noon tomorrow. You'll be checking out then anyway. Tick, tick, tick. God, I hate it when people go, ""Tick, tick, tick."" The body is still here in the hotel. I know it is. Somewhere inside this hotel. But where? Adrian, you're ruining the last hours of my vacation. - Hello? I'm solving a murder. - Well, do it three feet to the left. Well, well. Here you are. - Here I am. - So how about a rematch? - Are you a glutton for punishment? - Oh, I'm a glutton for a lot of things. I bet you are. Okay, I'll book the court. And then I'm gonna beat the pants off you. You wish. I'll see you later. See ya. Do you like him? Why? Is there a reason why I shouldn't? Adrian, if you know something about him, you have to tell me. That's the rule. I thought the rule was I should keep it to myself. Well, it's a new rule. Well, he, uh he might be married. - Might be or is? - His wife's name is Julie. Or Julia. It was hard to read 'cause the check was upside down. What check? / When he was buying his sunglasses. There were two names. It's a joint account. You know, you could be wrong. You're not perfect. That's true. You were wrong about Mr. Fenimore killing his wife. Maybe you're losing your superpowers. Maybe I am. - What? - The groundskeeper. He's using lime. I think you should take eight or nine hours and check it out. Don't even think about moving. Who are you calling? Who do you think? Security. Security, extension 404. Give my regards to Bronwynn. - How do you know Bronwynn? - I'm working with her on a case. Oh, yeah. I've seen you with her. I'm Rawley. You want to tell me what's going on? One second. - Why didn't you report it, Rawley? - Report what? The missing bags of lime. How'd you know about that? I thought I could handle it myself. How many did they take? Three. - When did this happen? - Sometime last night. That's all I know. Was that door locked? All the time. Dead bolt. I'm the only one with a key. What do they weigh? About 40 pounds each? Fifty. Heavy bags. Locked door. They probably used the window. There had to be There had to be more than one person. I think we're looking for a gang. Did they move those pallet boards? They don't belong there. They were short. A short gang of lime thieves? It's a nutty world. Sweetheart, where'd you learn that one? - Sweetheart, take it easy, will ya? - Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt? Why don't you have Julie put some ice on it? Or is it Julia? It stinks in here. Oh, that's the the disinfectant. They cleaned the whole room. That's not the laundry. That's the garbage. I know. Okay, so why are you throwing it away? They were irredeemable. - Do you know what that means? - Uh, yeah. They got dirty. Exactly. - Listen, I wanted to say thanks. - For what? For believing me when nobody else did. Though you probablyjust felt sorry for me 'cause my dad's not around. Hey. I don't have to be your father to believe you. Or to be proud of you. If you say you saw a body, then something happened here. And I'm gonna find out what it is. I've never seen a room this clean. She must have worked all night. Oh, it wasn't just one. It was a whole group of them. Four maids. A short gang. The maids. Okay. Just for the record, what we just did - Breaking and entering. - Yeah. It's wrong, okay? Don't-Don't do it. All right. - Where are we? - The maids' locker room. - You think the dead body is in here? - Maybe. It's been everywhere else. Look at this. Olivencia. They were talking about her. She quit yesterday. What's wrong? She never changed back into her street clothes. Benjy, the woman you saw the woman who was attacked could she have been a chambermaid? Maybe. Well, was she wearing a dress something like this? Yeah, I think so. Good. At least we know who we're looking for. What? That one tile. It's upside down. Oh, cool. What are they? They're digital cameras. I've never seen them this small. What's that, a screen? Yeah. You see, you can see the pictures they took. What is it? Financial documents. Okay, that's boring. No, no. Not to some people. Mr. Monk. What are you doing here? We're lost. We were looking for the Ping-Pong table and for the Ping-Pong room. Uh, just It's funny. I've been here a week, and I still, uh I still can't find my way around. But we're gonna find it. It's probably downstai I told you downstairs. You gotta argue about every little thing. We're gonna find it. It's gonna be - Yeah. - We got it. It's Hasta luego. The maids'locker room. Right down here. God, you're good! It took me six months to find this place. Hey, Landis says you've gotta check out by 4:00 p.m. No extension. gives me three hours. That's all Clint had in Dirty Harry. Hey, uh, Rita, you have had nonfictional police experiences, right? Yeah, sure. Hola, ladies. There's the locker. What'd you do with her clothes? It was here. They must have glued the tile back on. Suddenly you don't speak English? Well, maybe you'll understand this. The party's over. La fiesta esta over. - We're onto you. - We know you killed Lupe Olivencia. You think because you're rich and white you think you can accuse anybody of anything? Mrs. Garcia, I'm not accusing anybody of anything. I'm accusing you of murder. I should have known. Fenimore's room was too clean. Who else could have pulled that off in just 15 minutes? They're the housekeepers from hell. Wait, wait, wait. Th-They're stealing cameras? - No. They're stealing information. - Confidential financial information. Who is merging with whom, who's about to go under. It's the perfect setup. We have conferences here all the time brokerage firms, investment companies Who's in a better position to steal information? Nobody gives the housekeeping staff a second thought. They're invisible. So people hide their wallets. They hide their jewelry. No one thinks to hide their briefcases or their laptops. The maids were cleaning up. / Literally. Hey, maybe we can get the I.R.S. To nail them for insider trading. No, I'm guessing they were too smart for that. They probably got their friends and family members to buy the stocks for them. I don't get it. Who did they kill? - The missing maid. - Maid number five. Lupe Olivencia. She probably got greedy. Or more likely, she grew a conscience and then wanted out. Whatever the reason, they had to get rid ofher. So then they went to work. It was the cleanest crime scene in the history of crime. - And we can't prove a thing. - Not without a body. No body, no case. But itjust has to be here somewhere. Benjy, what is it? I found her again. Okay, everybody, clear away. Don't touch a thing. Okay, partner. We got 'em. I'm gonna call homicide and the district attorney's office. And the coroner's office. We're gonna need a full forensics team. How long was that? Was that the record? All right! So it's gotta be in the hotel. Bronwynn, if we don't find the corpse in the next 20 minutes, they get away with murder. Wait. There's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Monk. We're completely booked. I'm so sorry. No, you're not. Tony, they are stealing insider information right from under our noses. We are convinced that they murdered Lupe Olivencia. Where's your proof? Where's the body? - Okay. We can't find the body - Because it doesn't exist. Now, it's checkout time, Mr. Monk. You are now officially trespassing in my hotel. But the case / Why don't you just go home and tell your therapist all about it. Tony, listen, I have to talk to you. Where's your mom? She's just picking up some pictures. This place is the pits. Missing bodies, married men. And half of these didn't even come out. Ooh, I like this one. You can tell it was our first day. We were smiling. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Drive carefully, Mr. Monk. This isn't over. I'm gonna mail this in. I have a couple of comments. - I guess you're on your own. - I'm gonna get 'em. I bet you will. Have one for the road. - Benjy, buckle up. - Okay. Adrian, just let it go. You can't win 'em all. Come on. Come on. How can you say when you I don't think I can wait a whole year. - For what? - Our next vacation. You enjoyed that? I had a great time. Okay, for your information, that was not a vacation, Adrian. A vacation is supposed to be fun and relaxing. That was murder camp. I was thinking, the first week of November, there's this place in Monterey. No. No, forget it. No more vacations. The next time you try to make me take a vacation, I swear I'm quitting. I can't believe I just said that. - You seem upset. - I am upset! - You know what you need? - Shut up. - Vacation! - Shut up!"
"﻿You're awake. Not quite. Do you have your, um, art class today? Life in the fast lane. What? I'm just adoring you. Isn't a husband allowed to stop and adore his wife? How did I get to be so lucky? We both got lucky, Henry. - I was listening to that. - I'm just turning it down. You don't mind. I have to go to the office for a couple of hours. Of course. Oh, and, uh, don't forget we're having dinner with Father Hatcher. Again? Honey, not there. Over here. I thought that could have been the big one. Why don't you turn on the news, see how bad it was.

Benjy? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's okay. He was at school when it happened and he loved it. He thought it was like a roller coaster. Adrian, I have to tell you I'm very impressed. I mean, I thought you'd be a basket case. Everything's broken. Where were you when it happened? What? Are you okay? Adrian, you're not speaking English. You know that, right? Yeah, yeah. Sharona, relax. He's having a dissociative episode. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. Dissociative? Yeah. The trauma of the earthquake probably shorted out the occipital lobe in the left hemisphere of his brain, which controls the ability to speak and to form words. Well, what should I do? Look, he thinks he's speaking normally. He's more confused than you are. Right. Okay, well, now l-I can see him, uh, tomorrow at 4:00 if you like, but I gotta tell ya I wouldn't be surprised if he's fine by then. I mean, these things usually pass on their own. The most important thing just don't leave him alone. Okay. Wait Will you wait? Okay, hold on. Hold on. He He wants to speak to you. You're talking gibberish. Adrian, I can't understand a word you're saying. Right. Good. Okay, so put Sharona on the phone, okay? Including well-known philanthropist Henry Rutherford, who's best known for his Rutherford Scholarships, which enabled hundreds of inner-city children from across the country Oh, my God. Okay. Henry Rutherford. I told you about him. I've been working with him the whole month. He was a deacon at my church. He was trying to make money for the new church. Oh, my God. I know his wife. She's gonna be devastated. I gotta go. They live two blocks away. She just moved here. She doesn't know anybody. I'm gonna see if they need my help, okay? Just stay here. You know what? On second thought, you better come with me. Come on. Doctor Kroger? We'll call you back. Fine. And he had a brother in London. They weren't close, but somebody should call him. Don't worry, Christine. I'll take care of it. Thank you, Father. I don't know what I'd do without you and Sharona. It was terrible. The whole room started to shake, and Henry made sure I was safe in the doorway. Now you mustn't torture yourself. The wall unit started to come tipping over, and Henry was trying to keep it from falling. I saw it come crashing down. I called for help but there was nobody else in the house. Okay, here you go. Oh, l-I couldn't. No, no, Christine. You have to have something. She's right, Christine. You must stay strong. You know, I could stay here tonight. Thank you. That's very sweet.

Oh, she'll be all right. It's What are you doing? Not right about this room. Adrian, you can talk! Of course I can talk. What is wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. There is no third watch. I want everybody on active duty to report to their watch commanders, got it? - All right. - You follow me? Yes. Christine Rutherford sat around waiting for an earthquake? No, no, no, no. She sat around waiting for her rich, old husband to die, and when the earthquake hit You see? Captain, when the earthquake hit, she realized it was her chance a one-in-a-million shot and she took it. Captain, we have reports of some looting in Potrero Hill. All right, get 10 uniforms down there. I want a man on every corner. Go. Go. There was ceiling debris all over the floor but none on the back of a fallen display case. And there were marks on the wall like somebody used a lever to knock that case over. - Really? - Captain! Captain, Cargill. - Yeah? - Those calls are false alarms. I don't care if they're all false alarms. You've got to check 'em out. Every one. Yes, sir. Look, Monk, there was an earthquake. That's what earthquakes do. They knock crap over. Yes, b-but there were other pictures on the same wall and none of them none of them were even crooked. I'm trying to put out a hundred fires here, Monk. I realize that. / Where's the guy from Emergency Services? Look out. Look out. Look, somebody will be with you soon enough. Please, everybody just sit down. Calm down. She could be there She could be there right now cleaning up all the evidence. At least send a couple of detectives to look around. I haven't got a detective. I haven't got a moment to spare. Monk, the shaking you felt this morning was a 6.0 earthquake. But at least send me over to check it out. - Where's Sharona? - She went to pick up her kid. All right. Uh, Lieutenant? I'm officially handing Monk off to you. I want you to give him anything he needs. And quit screwing around and get back to work. Sorry, the street's closed. What's going on? The gas line's ruptured, and all the phone lines are down. These two blocks were the worst ones hit. God. Look, we just live over there. Not today you don't. Call Emergency Services. Here's their number. How long is this gonna be? Oh, maybe a couple of days. - A couple of days? - Maybe three. Just call that number, ma'am. I just work here. Officer, I'm with the Melbourne Gazette. Can I get in and get a couple shots? I'm sorry.

I don't know. I guess we're gonna have to find a hotel. / Good luck. I've been calling all morning. There's nary a room left in the whole city. ""Nary a room""? That's what I said. Well, we can always stay at Aunt Gail's. Why can't we stay at Mr. Monk's? Because I will go crazy slower at Aunt Gail's. Do you think your Aunt Gail has a room for an out-of-town journalist? I'm Darryl Wright. I'm Sharona. Yeah, I'm sorry. My sister has no room. Is this your boyfriend? No. This is, uh, my son, Benjy. You thought I was her boyfriend? He's joking.

Do you believe in love at first sight? Personally, I never did. And then you got a look at my husband's bank account And zing went the strings of my heart. There we were, just waiting for the right opportunity, and God dropped it right in our laps. The bloody miracle. $42.5 million. Say it again. Forty-two Point five million dollars. I love it when you talk dirty. Just one more loose end to tie up, and it's all ours. Sharona. Sharona. She's pretty. Didn't notice. Are you sure she trusts you? God. Why wouldn't she trust me? - Sharona. - Hey, butter bean! Hi. / Gail, I am so sorry. I didn't know who else to call. Hey, no problem. That's what I'm here for. It's gonna be fun.

I had it before you. - No, you didn't. - I told you about caller I.D. What? I had caller I.D. When I lived in Valencia. Remember, you came over and I showed you how it worked? I had caller I.D. When I was living with Lenny in Seattle. - Okay, you never told me that. - I know. I was avoiding your calls. - I had caller I.D. - Mom. Aunt Gail. Can we go inside, please?

He doesn't sleep on couches. Gail, I spent two weeks with Mom. Now we're even. It's going to be okay, Adrian. - Hi, Gail. - Hi. Listen, don't worry about Sharona. She won't get in the way. Even. - Yes, thank you. I'll hold. - You Know, I like those earrings. You ought to. You gave them to me. Oh, I forgot. So, um, are you still seeing that actor? Hal Myers? Yeah, in my nightmares. You know, even in my nightmares he can't act. I liked him. / Maybe I'm getting too picky in my old age. How about you? Are you in love with anybody? Well, actually, I met somebody this morning. - He's a journalist. - Really? Yeah, from Australia. - Complete with accent? - Oh, yeah. The full package. He's to die for. Ooh, bring him by. I'd love to meet him. I'm sure you would. What is he doing? He's counting the bricks in the wall. Oh, good. You know, I've always been curious about that. Adrian, don't tie up Gail's line. I'm on hold. I'm waiting for Disher. Oh, crap! One, two, three Is that new? I got it a couple of weeks ago. My other was too big. Check it out! When did you get that? Two months ago. Like you didn't know! What? Y-You think I'd buy the same handbag on purpose? Now why would I do that? What? You think I wanna I want to be like you? Like I'm obsessed with you? Who moved to San Francisco first? Oh, my God! You begged me to move up here! Hey! Do I have to separate you two? Yeah. It's Lieutenant, yes, I'm here. I'm still here. Yeah, I need her phone records. Every call from that house and her cell phone for the last two weeks. Right. Right. And what about the background check? Really? Really? Hello? Sharona. Uh, no. This is her, uh, younger sister, Gail. Really? You two sound so much alike. Do you look alike? No. I'm the sexy one. Really? Hey, are you the Australian guy she met on the street? Yeah, that would be me, unless she met somebody else. What are you eating? Rice cakes. God, I hate this diet. Being the sexy sister is a hard yacker. That's a full-time job. Listen, is Sharona there? You just missed her. She and her boss had some business at St. Claire's Church. Saint Claire's? Yeah, you know, the one on Fulton Street. That's quite a performance. Look, you don't know her. She and her husband practically saved this church. They're like saints. Your saint didn't pay for her candle. Mrs. Rutherford Mr. Monk. Sharona. Would you light a candle for my husband? I'd love to. Which husband? I understand that Henry was your third. Excuse me. Mrs. Rutherford, in 1997, you and your second husband were indicted for mail fraud in Nevada. Indictment's not a conviction, Mr. Monk. A stirring defense. But Henry didn't know about your other marriages, did he? Of course he did. I saw the photographs in your house, ma'am. Watch your step, ma'am. You were married at the Sacred Cross Chapel in Chicago. Henry was a deacon there, and even if he wanted to, he couldn't have knowingly married a divorcee. Okay. You got me. I kept a secret from my husband. Beg your pardon. Sharona. What are you doin' here? I called the number you gave me. Your sister told me where you were, and I was a couple blocks away, so As you do. Well, it-it-it's great to see you. Yeah. And you too. Oh, I'm sorry. Um, Darryl Wright, this is my boss, Adrian Monk. How do you do? Darryl is a journalist from Australia. He's doing a story about the earthquake. Speaking of the earthquake, are you back in your apartment yet? Uh, no. Not yet. They said maybe Monday. / Monday. Right. So, uh, who was the who was the widow? Christine Rutherford. Now why does that name ring a bell? Her husband was worth about $40 million. And I think she killed him. Excuse me. He's a former detective and, you know, he gets a little paranoid, so Well, it sounds like a much more interesting story than this earthquake I'm doing. - Yeah. It is. - You can tell me all about it over dinner. - We're having dinner? - Your sister invited me. Gail? Yeah. Is there a problem? Oh, no. No. It's That's great! It's fine. Yeah. Four months in the outback, find it, sleeping on the ground. That must have been tough. What would you eat, though? We ate grubs, bugs, snakes. Danger, danger, danger! Anyway, we finally got back. I got my messages. It's my editor. He's telling me he's changed his mind. He doesn't want me to go. You know, Darryl was nominated for a Pulitzer. Really? It was a story I wrote awhile back for the Sydney Morning Herald. Ooh, do you have a copy of it? - Not on me. - What was it about? It was about a bridge collapse. Five people died. - Oh, my God. - Yeah. Five people from all walks of life. It was a wealthy old woman, an orphan, a maid. I wrote about each of them, who they were, how they touched different people in their lives. Oh, I'd love to read it. You gotta send me a copy. You can't forget. - I won't. - This is fun. I wish there was an earthquake every week. Don't say that, sugar beet. The earthquake killed three people. No, it didn't. Not according to Mr. Monk. He thinks one of them was a murder. Yes. I've been meaning to ask you about that. How is the investigation going? Well, so far, just a hunch. Hey, can we play a game after? - Uh, it's a song! - Song. Uh, stop. Bus stop! - Stop what you're - Stop  Bus stop! - ""Stop in the Name of Love""! How did you know that? I want you on my team! I'm gonna sit over here. Excuse me. wh-where does this go? - Above the sink with all the others. - Well, this one All the others are square. Should I just throw it away? No. Just put it down. I'll take care of it later. Why don't you join us? Yeah. We're playing charades. It's fun. Yeah, it'll be fun. - It's a game. - That's right. It's a game. Benjy, it's my turn. You take it. - Okay. - Off you go. A fast game is a good game. - Movie! It's a movie.! - Spider-Man. - He's right. - Well, he's seen he's seen the movie 20 times, and he was just reading the comic, so I figured He's 11 years old. Let him have fun. Okay, I got one! - It's a movie. - Movie. - Uh, six - Six words. The Man Who Came to Dinner. How did you know that? It's a movie about a houseguest who wouldn't leave. Six words. You were looking at me. Okay, Darryl, why don't you go next? All right. I got one. Now, instead of playing charades, we're playing ""Let's Stump Monk"". Let's stump Monk. - A Bible book? - It's a book. Right? The Bridge at San Luis Rey. Is he right? Of course he's right. You know, why don't we watch TV? Uh, you said I'm not allowed to watch TV. I changed my mind. Turn it on. All right. A necessary adjunct to the recording of all How'd you know the name of the book? The little story he told at dinner about the bridge collapsing. It was a novel from the '20s called The Bridge at San Luis Rey. Don't do this. Every time I like somebody, you ruin it. I wasn't sure how you took it? Light and sweet. Thanks. Excuse me. Hello? / I thought you were going to call me. Yeah, I know. I know. It's my editor. Did you get into her place yet? I'm working on it. I am aware of the deadline, and I know it's important. You said you've have it by tonight. Listen, mate, the sooner I'm off this phone, the quicker I can get back to work. Correct. Bye-bye. Here you go. - You are an angel. - Thank you. And there's no way he could have been nominated for a Pulitzer. Maybe he's a good writer. It's not that. The Pulitzer is only for American journalism. He said that story was published in Australia. So what? Maybe he's trying to impress me. Maybe he likes me. God. And you're scaring him away. Gail's trying to seduce him, and I'm stuck in the middle as usual. Tobor, bringing you chills you've never known before. - Gail, where's the bathroom? - Uh, first door on the left. All I'm saying is there's something about that guy. Be careful. No, no. You be careful. I am sick and tired of being careful. Son of a bitch! Excuse me. Uh, this building is offlimits. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm, uh I'm with the phone company. I was told we had this block to ourselves. You have a work order? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure I do. It's, uh You know what? I must have left it in my truck. I didn't see any truck. Look, wait right here. I gotta call this in. No, my friend. I can't let you do that. You got a name? Yep, David Bushner. Age 44. He was a gas company tech. Stabbed, one in the chest. He went missing late last night. Phone company crew just found him. Where is his truck? It's, uh, parked up on Downey where he left it. We don't know if this is the murder scene or if he was dumped here. No. He was killed somewhere else. Are you sure? Yeah. The body's on an incline, head down. Look at the blood stain on his chest. Blood doesn't flow uphill. At least not in my experience. When was the last time he was seen upright? Uh, according to his log, the last gas line he inspected was, uh, doors down from Sharona's. The water's all rusty. / Oh, it gets like that after every earthquake. But I always keep some mineral water on hand just for emergencies. Where's all my water? Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk, are you in there? Don't come in. I'm taking a bath. Are you taking a bath in mineral water? Uh, the tap water was a little rusty. Well, enjoy it because that bath is costing me $95. Okay. Thank you. He can tell what you're thinking just by how you're sitting in your chair. I should write about him. You should. Nobody would believe it. You'd have to put it in the science fiction section. So What about you? What about me? Oh, hi. Can I, um Can I help you? Good afternoon. I'm Lieutenant Disher, San Francisco Police. I need to speak to Adrian Monk. Oh, uh, he's in the bathroom right now washing up. That would be Monk. I need to make sure that he gets these. It's very important. Uh, sure. Are you, um Are you really a cop? Yes, I am. Look at the nice picture. Why did you get rid of the mustache? My captain has a mustache. I shaved mine off so that people could tell us apart. Sharona never told me she had a sister. Younger. How long have you known her for? Four years now. Really? And she never mentioned me at all? Well, she's obviously a little jealous. Exactly. Say, copper, you like Italian food? Yeah. Hot. You know, I dated a cop once. I still have his handcuffs on my bedpost. Then I should inform you you are still in possession of stolen property. I might have to bring you down to the station. Really? I might not mind that. Here. Try this. Oh Too spicy? - No. It's perfect. - Oh, perfect. Uh, so, uh, what's it like having Adrian Monk as a houseguest? Well, a few years ago, a squirrel got into the house and I could hear it running through the attic and the walls. It took me two months to get rid of it. It drove me crazy. - And? - It's like that. So are you, um You gonna wait for him? Monk No, I can't. If he's washing up, he could still be another two or three hours. I should, uh Could you make sure he gets this? Oh, of course. - Thanks for the-the sauce. - The sauce, yes. Well, what do you do when you're not working? I don't know. - Thank you. - There you go. Thank you. I'll just have one more. It never comes up. I'm on call 24-7. That's terrible. I mean, you don't ever feel the need to cut loose, do something crazy? Like what? Like dance with me. Here. In the afternoon. - I'm a good dancer. - I'll bet you are. Come on. Why not? I'm fine. I'm fine. I have an idea. What? Your apartment's two blocks from here? We can't get in yet. It's blocked off. You know what they say? Good things come to those who wait. Well, I can't wait. We can just sneak in. - It's too dangerous. - That's what makes it so exciting. Come on. Are you sure? I am sure. What? I just remembered. I promised Gail I'd be home by 2:30. We got plenty of time. Do you have any Q-tips? Well, Lieutenant Disher dropped by. - He did? - Yeah. You know, he's kinda cute. I've got this thing for cops. Yes, I know. That's why you and I get along so swimmingly. Do you have any white ones? What's the difference? These are blue. I'll wait for Sharona. ""Anywhozle,"" he dropped this off. Some phone records you wanted. And get this. They found a body near Hobart Park. A gas company repairman. Lieutenant Disher said they think he was killed near Sharona's house. What? / He said that it was probably no big deal, but the captain wanted you to know. This is strange. Darryl, the phone lines are working. Really? / Yeah. I can finally check my messages. There was a call from the Rutherford house to Sharona's at 8:41 yesterday morning. That's just before the earthquake hit. They were probably talking about the fund-raiser. Then there was another call to Sharona's again at 8:45 right right after the quake that She called Sharona's before she called 911. Maybe she panicked. Maybe she hit redial. Damn! Where are my keys? They were in my bag. Your bag? It looks just like Sharona's bag. So? He said, ""Who's the widow?"" - Who did? - Darryl. When he saw Christine Rutherford at the church he said, ""Who's the widow?"" How did he know she was a widow? She could have been mourning her father or a child. - Maybe he recognized her from TV. - No. No, no. He said, ""Who's the widow?"" He knows her. Oh, my God. Sharona. - Oh, my God. - What is it? It's Henry Rutherford. Listen. Sharona, this is Henry Rutherford. I just spoke to the caterer and Oh, my God. It's an earthquake.! Christine, what are you No, no! I gotta call Adrian. I think we're going to be going by your apartment after all. Move. We're coming up to her place now. I've been trying to get that idiotic tape out of your machine for two days. Don't park here. Go around the block. Captain Stottlemeyer, please. It's Adrian Monk. Tell him it's very important Are you okay? How about that? Mother was right, an aftershock. Can you believe it? Lieutenant, either fix that pipe or buy everybody an umbrella. Yes, sir. Can you take line two, sir? It's Monk. It better be good. What? Wait. No, wait, Monk. Slow down. Try it again. Hi, this is Sharona and Benjy. - Why don't you write it down? - That's a great idea. Write it down. Well, he's writing it down. It says, uh, Look, tell Monk that I'm gonna send a squad car, okay? Well, no. He's He's already gone. He's gone? What do you mean, ""He's gone""? Captain, I think Sharona's in trouble. Lieutenant? Get the car! I was trying to avoid all this. I was trying to get to the answering machine before you heard that message. Darryl! Honey, what are you doing here? I told you I'd take care of it. You heartless bitch. Open the bloody door. Hold on. Hold on. W-Wait. What the hell is that? Korean? Chinese? Turn here? You want me to turn here? Is that what you're saying? Do you want me to turn here? Is that what you're saying? They come over here and they take our welfare, And they take our food stamps, but they don't bother to learn our damn language. Inside. Oh, my God. Where's the tape? Where's the tape? - It's digital! - Take the whole thing. Now. What are we gonna do with you? We've got no choice. Come on, Darryl. Do it! I've come too far to stop now. - Here? - Yeah, here. Why not? 'Cause blood is gonna go everywhere. Who is gonna see blood in this mess? / Monk will. Monk notices everything. He's a damn freak! Well, just take her to the bathroom Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Keep the change! So you can talk. Bilingual sons of bitches. Where are you going? Oh, God! Son of a bitch! I'm surprised you can talk with a broken jaw. - I don't have a broken jaw. - Not yet! Adrian! Adrian, are you okay? Oh, God. It's all over. - I'm gonna need a broom. - Okay. Oh, my God! It looks great! It's back to normal. I had a cleaning crew take care of it. The insurance company paid for most of it. I almost forgot. Here's the note you wrote. Now do you believe me? Did I really write this? Unbelievable. Uh, Adrian, listen. Now that you're home, there's something we have to talk about. I haven't been paid since the earthquake. - Are you sure? - Yeah. It's been three weeks. Here's your checkbook. That's not funny. Okay, will ya stop it? You owe me money. I know you're faking it. - I'm not faking it! - You just spoke English!"

What radio station? For that interview you have in the morning. You remember. All right. Can you excuse me a minute? Not a problem. Will you, uh, let go of my hand? I am so sorry. Put the women's bathroom signs over the exits. We can get more people in that way. I-I gotta go. Hey, Will. Sorry I'm late. How'd rehearsal go? Well, we managed to get by without you again. Something wrong? Yeah, something's wrong. If it's about the $400 from last night's poker game No, it's the $400,000. The books didn't add up. Can we go, uh, talk about this on the bus?

Oh, God.! What did you do? MONK Season 1 Epi. 12 Mr. Monk and the Red-Headed Stranger ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON USA: 2002/10/11 No press. Nobody gets wind of this, okay? Just bag it until you get to the lab, okay? Okay. Who is it? Mark off that side over there. I told you, my hours were crazy. Uh-huh. You know what? I-l-I just got to the crime scene. I'll-I'll call you later, okay? How-How late are you gonna be up? All right. Okay. All right, bye. - Who was that? - None of your business. - Can I take a wild guess? - You never take wild guesses. Was it the guy you met last week at the party Justin? Maybe. When do I get to meet him? Never, 'cause you ruin everything. I'm protecting you. Adrian, you're not my mother. Look, I checked him out on the Internet. He's an architect who's won awards. He's the real deal. So let me meet him. We'll invite you to our tenth anniversary, okay? Now, will you pay attention? There's a dead guy over here. Can we cut the witness loose? Yes. No, no. Wait, wait. Uh, no. No, we better not. Sir, the building next door has a security camera. Maybe we could have a look at the tape. Yes, good idea. Talk to the owner. Wouldn't we need a court order for that? Right. I'll take care of that later. - Monk. - Where's the captain? He's getting an X ray. He was in an accident. - Is he okay? - He fell off his motorcycle. That's all I know. Until he gets back, I'm in charge. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're here. Monk, listen. This is big. In fact, this could be the big one. We have a suspect inside. It's Willie Nelson. The Red-headed Stranger? The press hasn't got wind of it yet, so just Can l Can l Can I talk to him? You like Willie Nelson? Are you surprised? Well, yeah. It's just so so normal. Willie's inside, and he's not talking to anyone until his lawyers get here. If you want, you can meet his road manager. Say hello to Sonny Cross. We found this on the front door to lure him into the alley. What does the ""J"" stand for? His legal name was Jason Cross. Look at this. Shot one through the collarbone, shot two straight in the back while he was running away. We have a witness, Monk, who heard Willie Nelson and Cross arguing just before the shots were fired. We found the gun over there behind the Dumpster. It's a Webley a Mark I.38-caliber. No prints. An old Webley? Yes. We can rule out a mugging. What's he doing? What are you doing? The bullet hole in the jacket lines up with the entry wound. So? Well, you said they were arguing. But if he was animated, if his hands were up or he was gesturing, then the holes wouldn't match up. No, this man had his hands down at his sides. And he-he wasn't frightened either. He You say there was an eyewitness? Well, not exactly an eyewitness. Her name's Wendy Mass. She's been blind since she was 16. She lives in one of those assisted living places up on Mountain View. Oh, my God. I know her. I've seen her in the park. That's your witness? She said she heard the whole thing. Lieutenant, from here it looks like your hands are empty. Excuse me? / You're not holding a warrant, are you? - No, I'm not. - Then we're finished here. I just wanna make sure that we have all the details. What more do you want? Our client has given you his statement three times already. It's okay, Josh. I'm as anxious to get this thing cleared up as you are. Thank you. Now, Mr. Nelson, you admit that you and Mr. Cross were arguing yesterday? We argue all the time. About what? Only two things to argue about, and money is one of'em. And you were coming here to do a radio interview? We've already been over this. It's okay. He's just doin' his job. Look, Lieutenant, I got out of the car, I heard some shots, went around the corner into the alley, Sonny was layin' dead. - I couldn't believe it. - Was anybody else in the alley? There was this lady with a cane. Uh, she could've been blind. She was screamin' at the top of her voice. She had a great set of lungs, I know that. Well, thank you very much. That's all I need for now. Excuse me, Mr. Willie Wilson Nelson. - I just have one question. - Who the hell are you? - I'm Adrian Monk. - And what department are you with? Mr. Monk isn't on the force. He's here as a consultant at my request. First of all, I just wanna say I'm-I'm your second biggest fan. - Well, who's the first? - Uh, that-that'd be my wife. I lost her about five years ago. I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Monk. No, I just wanted to tell you how much your music has meant to me and to my wife. This isn't a fan club. Just ask your question. - Right. - Come on. How long did you know Jason? - Who the hell's Jason? - Uh, I'm sorry. - I mean Sonny. - I forgot his real name. About 18 and a half years on and off, mostly off. All right. Enough is enough. Come on, Willie. - You know where to reach us. - Yes, I do. - Randy, you got a second? - What? Look. Look again. ""J"" Cross. Whoever wrote this knew Sonny by his legal name, not his nickname. So? I don't think Willie did it. Monk, he was shot twice once in the back 20 feet away. It wasn't the blind lady. Then there must've been somebody else in that alley. Now, Mrs. Mass, you said you were taking the bus. That's right. I was visiting a friend, and I missed my stop. I never like to admit it, but it happens. So I got off, and I started to walk. Then I turned down that alley, thinking that I could cut through to - Well, the alley was a dead - Oh, yeah. There was construction. It's a dead end. Dead end. Exactly. So I started to turn around, and then I heard these two men arguing. - Uh, about what? - I couldn't tell. They were very angry. And then I heard these two shots bang, bang. Well, my heart was pounding, and I couldn't move. Then this one man came up to me and he said, ""Tell anybody about this and I'll kill you."" Adrian. How's it going? Miss Mass, this is Captain Stottlemeyer. Mrs. Mass, how do you do? He'll be in charge of the case from here on in, thank God. Good job, Lieutenant. - Oh, thank you, sir. - You're welcome. - Sharona./ Hey, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. His arm's in a sling. Oh. Sorry. What happened? It's nothing. I fell off my motorcycle. I was on the dirt trails north of Highway 18. Slipped on a bunch of wet leaves. It could've been a lot worse. You're a very lucky man, sir. Yeah, well, I don't feel like a lucky man. It's a feeding frenzy out there. We've gotta be very careful how we handle this one. Yes, sir. So what's the plan? Are you okay? Well, you know how they handled the O.J. Case down in Los Angeles? We do the opposite. Where are we? Uh, same as I told you on the phone, sir. Mrs. Mass is reasonably sure that she can recognize the assailant's voice. ""Reasonably sure""? Excuse me, Mrs. Mass? Do you listen to country and western music? No, I like classical. Okay, good. Bring him in. Captain, I wouldn't tell that story about your accident to too many people. Why not? Well, the hills north of Highway Brush fires. Really? What really happened? I was cleaning my gutters and slipped, fell off the ladder. Oh. We're ready, sir. Now, Mrs. Mass, I want you to take your time, and I want you to listen very carefully, okay? - All right. - You all right? - Yes. - Good. All right, number one, please. Tell anybody about this and I'll kill you. No, no. Number two. Tell anybody about this and I'll kill you. No. And number three. Read the line, please. Tell anybody about this and I'll kill you. That's him. That-That's the voice. That's him. - Now, you're sure? - That's him. I know that's him. This investigation is open and ongoing. We have at least one witness, and there is some physical evidence which is being analyzed as we speak. Captain, is Willie Nelson a suspect? We haven't ruled out anybody as of yet. That's all I can say. Has Mr. Nelson made a statement? Mr. Nelson has been very cooperative. He's agreed to stay in town and remain available to us at our discretion. Now, I wanna stress this again. We have not accused or charged anyone of this crime. Whoo-hoo.! - Whoo! - What the hell was that? That was a streaker, sir. What is this, 1974? Oh, yeah! Well, if there are no further questions We'll be going. Thank you. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. Justin, hold on. Hold on. One sec. Adrian. Adrian, you're gonna have a heart attack. I can't believe he called me. Willie Nelson called me. Okay, will you just relax? He's just Adrian, he's just a regular guy who happens to sing and play guitar. No, he's not! You take that back. Okay. Okay, here he is. Here-Here he comes. Okay, just act natural. Okay. - Justin, hold onJust hold on. - Be cool. Hold on. It might be him. False alarm. Oh, God. I wish I wish you were here. My boss is tryin' to act cool, and he is totally hyperventilating. Okay, now he's gonna block the street. / All right, Justin We're gonna miss him now. / Okay, just let melet me call you back later. - Excuse me! This is not a bus stop! - Adrian, please! Please! - I'm waiting for Willie! - He's not blocking the road. Hello, Mr. Monk. Sorry we're late. Come on in. All right. Thanks for comin'. My lawyer tells me that you're about the only friend I got left in town. Do you smell that? Uh, no, I don't, and you don't either. I don't either. This is a little piece of Texas on wheels. I love it. It's the bomb. ""It's the bomb""? Bomb is good. It's good. Willie, uh, if you wouldn't mind. Where in the world did you get that? I haven't seen that one in a long time. I have 'em all. And if you could just if you could make it out to Trudy. - Sure. - She worshipped you. On our first date, we went to see one of your shows. It was the Shoreline Amphitheater. Yeah, I remember y'all. You were sittin' on this blue blanket. - Really? - No, I'm just kiddin'. Oh, he's Willie's jokin'. Hey, the bus is moving now. Mm-hmm. It's gonna do that. Sit down. - There you go. - Thank you. - One more card, - down and dirty. So it's up to me? Three dollars. Well, I think you're tryin' to buy it. I don't believe you got that deuce. - He's not bluffing. - What? - It's okay. It's a friendly game. - He's not bluffing. He's got the deuce. Fold. I fold. What do you got? What do you want for that? - How'd you know that? - When you looked at your card, you started to hum that song ""Deuce's Wild"" from the ""Yesterday's Wine"" album. - You played stand-up bass on that cut. - Did you play on that? He sat in for three songs on that album. I believe that was the first time you used a stand-up bass in the studio. You know more about me than I do. He knows more about everybody than they do. Well, why do they think I shot Sonny? Um, well, you gotta admit it looks pretty bad. The blind lady said that she heard everything. The blind lady's lyin'. - Why was she lying? - I don't know. I do a lot of things, but I wouldn't hurt anybody. I might write a bad song about 'em. And as far as Sonny was concerned, maybe I should've fired him a long time ago, but there's a bunch more I could've fired too. Is-Is that a Rosewood? - Yeah. You play? - Ah, a little. Oh, he's just being modest. No, he's very good. I've never never played a Rosewood clarinet. That's That is a beautiful thing. Well, come over and kick the tires. - Um, Willie? - Yeah. Adrian can't play somebody else's instrument. He, uh, has a little problem with germs. I got a brand-new mouthpiece right there, untouched by human lips. - Very nice. - You think so? Do you know ""Georgia On My Mind""? Oh.Sure. Tomorrow night we're doing this radio concert. My agent thought it might be a good idea for publicity or whatever. We're gonna do ""Georgia On My Mind."" Would you like to come over and play? You-You mean play with the band? Yeah. You think about it. No, no, I'd better not. If I think about it, I might say no. - Honey, do your homework. - I can't concentrate. I know, but he has to practice. He's gonna be on the radio with Willie Nelson. - Who's Willie Nelson? - He's a country singer. Has he ever been on MTV? - No, but he's been on the news. - What for? Well, according to the I.R.S., when he was a little boy, he didn't do his math homework. I think I got it. Listen to this. Adrian, will you give it a break? Benjy could play this song by now. Come on. - Did you really meet a blind lady? - Yeah. - Does she have a dog? - No, she had a cane. Hey, maybe I can interview her for that report I have to do on people with disabilities. Wait. I thought you were gonna write about It only has to be two pages. Mr. Monk is a whole book. You know what? I'll ask her. Will you stop it? Stop! Adrian! Hello? Uh Adrian! Yes, yes, um, right. We'll be there right away. Adrian. Adrian! That was Stottlemeyer. He wants to see us right away. Should I bring my clarinet? I could practice in the car. I'll just leave it right here. Close the door. What you are about to see cannot leave this room. The tabloids would pay a million dollars for this videotape. It's from the surveillance camera near the crime scene. The alley's a dead end. This is the only way in. The side door to the radio station was wired to an alarm, so we know it wasn't opened. Bottom line, we can tell for sure who was or was not there. What the hell are you doing? Oh, uh, he's practicing. Really? Willie Nelson invited him to sit in with his band. Well, he may be live from Folsom Prison. Check this out. Go ahead. Yeah, there goes Mrs. Mass. Tap, tap, tap. She goes into the alley. Fast-forward. And there goes the soon-to-be-late Sonny Cross. And there goes Willie Nelson. Nobody else goes in or out. Pretty much a slam dunk. Are you gonna arrest him? D.A. 's ready to move. I'm waiting for some tests from the lab. Maybe tomorrow. Call your mom. Tell her to set the V.C.R. We're gonna be on the 6:00 news. Captain, what about the note on the door? My videotape trumps your note. Ask any lawyer. - I don't know. - Monk, look. My heroes have always been cowboys too. It's either ""A,"" the blind woman, who has zero motive, or it's ""B,"" your buddy, the Red-headed Stranger. Who had motive, means and opportunity and was identified by the only witness at the scene. -""A"" or ""B,"" Monk? - I think it's ""C."" - ""C""? What the hell is ""C""? - I don't know yet. So he just wants to ask you a couple of questions. I don't mind. I love children. That's a prime number - Now, is there anything else you need? - Let's see. Mushroom soup. It's in the next aisle. Uh, Mrs. Mass, I have a few questions. How did you know the alley was there? I have a lot of friends in that neighborhood. I've lived in San Francisco for 17 years. - The soup should be right up here. - Oh, I got it. Thank you. I peel back the corner. That way I can tell which can is which when I get home. I got a hundred little tricks. Let's see. Oh, juice. Excuse me. Should be - Yeah. Is this apple? - Yep. - Okay. Then we're done. - Mrs. Mass, are you certain that there was no one else in the alley? Maybe someone hiding behind the Dumpster? Well, I didn't hear anybody, and I didn't sense anybody. And I'm not easy to fool. Mr. Monk, I'm sorry about Willie Nelson. I'm sure he's a very talented singer. But I was there. He did it. - Hey, there, Mrs. Mass. - Hello, Janice. Well, as you can see, I didn't need you this time. This is Mr. Monk And his friend Sharona Fleming. - Hey, how are you? - Hi. How are you? That comes to $25.88. Here's a 20, and there's a 10. I'm telling you, she's an amazing woman. I'm not just saying that because she didn't sue us. She didn't sue you? Well, I had a little accident in the produce section last year. I slipped in a puddle of water. A little accident? She had a concussion. We had to call the ambulance and everything. It was just a little bump. I was fine. What's all this? It's for Saturday night. I'm cooking dinner for Justin. Maybe I should drop by. Adrian, I love my job, but if I have to get a restraining order, I will. Okay? Where'd you get that? I borrowed it from Benjy. Okay. This is where it happened. So, I'm the killer. You're Sonny Cross. Okay, I'm hiding. - There is so much garbage back here. - Oh, please. Okay, here I am. I'm hiding. You walk up the alley. I jump out. I step up to you and - bang! - Ow! Why am I always the victim? Because the victim usually ends up on the ground in-in the dirt, and I'm-I'm me. Okay, so now you've been shot, so now you run away. With pleasure. And here comes the second shot. Ow! You know Give me that gun. This is ridiculous. Okay, the first shot was point-blank. Even the blind woman could've done that one. But the second shot The second shot a moving target Impossible. So it had to be Willie Nelson. I don't think so. Then what do you think? I think we need to learn more about Sonny Cross. Sixty-five dollars? Gold Mine has it for Then go buy it from Gold Mine. Go on, go. Leave. Why are you still in my store? Look at all these plastic bags. - You must be in heaven. - I never heard of these bands. You never heard of The Ramones? Oh, yeah, The Ramones. They are great. I love that song they do about loving that woman all night long. Shut up. Look, if you must manhandle, at least put things back where they came from. I think I did. No. You put things back alphabetically. But there happens to be a chronological sub-order. Now I have to redo the whole section. Thank you very little. So, you wanna know about Sonny Cross, hmm? Well, he managed these guys for a while back in '87 till they fired him. Why? Same reason these guys fired him in '82. He was humping the lead singer's wife. That cat had nine lives. Oh, he, uh, he managed these guys for a while as well. - They fired him? - Didn't have a choice. Hard to handle them from the Florida State Penitentiary. Did, uh, two years, I think. Drinking and driving. Apparently, he killed a guy. And now he's been immortalized as the man Willie Nelson shot. Mmm. - You missed one. - I didn't Oh. You're right. - Are you two related? - Why would you say that? Sir, are you ready for this? What is this, a game show? Can't you just walk in here and say what you have to say? The droplets on Willie Nelson's jacket human blood from the victim. Well, he said that he leaned over the body. Maybe he got the blood on him then. The lab is 40% sure they're splatter marks from the actual shooting. - Forty percent? - What do you think? Well, I think it's not exactly through the hoop, is it? Okay, the blood is 40%. Videotape? - Forty eight percent. - Voice I.D.? - Fifteen percent. - Motive? - Twenty. - Well, that's like 123%. I mean, plus means and opportunity All right, bring him in. I have to be crazy. Be plumb out of my mind to arrest Willie Nelson. We're back. I'm Little Kenny Freedman. You're listening to Three Chord Monte on KNGY. We are very excited to have live in our studio the legendary Willie Nelson. I know you've been reading a lot about Willie in the papers. Everybody seems to have an opinion on ""the incident."" But tonight, we're gonna forget about all that and enjoy the music. Willie, would you like to introduce the band? Yeah, thank you very much. First of all, on the bass here from Helodus, Texas, Mr. Bee Spears. This is your microphone. Just don't get too close. Here, I'll show you. Willie Payne from Alabama, and our special guest is Adrian Monk playing the clarinet and sittin'in with us on a Ray Charles standard that we love to do called ""Georgia On My Mind.""  Georgia   Georgia  Excuse me. We have to stop. - We can't stop. We're live. - No, my friend can't play now. That guy just put his lips on his clarinet.  And just an old sweet song keeps Georgia    On my mind   Georgia   Georgia   A song of you   Comes as sweet and clear   As moonlight through the pines  All right, Adrian. Play it, Adrian.  Georgia   Georgia   No peace I find   And just an old sweet song keeps Georgia   On my mind   And just an old sweet song   Keeps Georgia on my mind   On my mind   On my mind   On my mind  Nice solo. That's some mighty good whistlin' there. - Well, did you have fun? - It was great. If there's anything I can do for you guys. Anything. - You used to be a cop, right? - Well, yeah. Get us a key to the evidence room. Yeah. Willie Nelson? - I'm Willie Nelson. - I'm Willie Nelson. / I'm Willie Nelson. I don't think they're goin' for it, boys. Mr. Nelson, we have a warrant for your arrest for the premeditated murder of Jason ""Sonny"" Cross. Captain, this is a mistake. He is not the guy. Well, you can't be objective. You're a member of the damn band. Mr. Monk. This way, Mr. Nelson. Let's go. As you know, Willie Hugh Nelson was arrested at 10:15 last night. He will be indicted in Judge Hackman's courtroom tomorrow. Captain Stottlemeyer was the arresting officer and will be happy to answer any of your questions. - Captain. - Thank you, Jeff. First of all, I would like to thank the members of my department who have been investigating this case. They've done an outstanding job. Captain, how strong is your case against Willie Nelson? We would not have authorized this arrest unless we were certain that we have all the facts for the district attorney to successfully prosecute this case. - Oh! Get a shot of that. - Hey, hi.! For the love of I want him. Go, go! Get him! San Francisco. You gotta love it. We're on foot, heading south towards Prospect. Description? He's wearing gray sneakers. Is there anything else? He's not Jewish! Come on! Excuse me. Oh, yeah. Good boys. All right, hold it right there! Stop.! Stop.! Stay where you are. All right, we got him. Streaker in custody. I've never been interviewed before. I feel like a celebrity. Are you ready? I am clicking on the tape recorder. Benjy, you don't have to shout. My hearing's fine. Sorry. Have you always been blind? Well, I could see until I was 16 years old. I was in a car accident. I have a question. Mrs. Mass, the murder weapon was found behind you near the Dumpster. Do you have any idea how it got there? No. I don't remember much. I was scared to death. Adrian, this is Benjy's interview. - Then what am I doing here? - I don't know. I never know. How do you know what to wear every day? What a good question. I add special buttons to my clothes so I can tell 'em apart. Like this jacket. I know that it's blue because the bottom button is square. See? - Oh, cool. - Uh-huh. Did your parents teach you that? No. My parents were killed in the same car accident that blinded me. I lost everything in one horrible moment. My sight, my family Um, sorry, dear. - What's next? - Uh Wh-Why do you keep pictures on your walls? Oh, they're for visitors like you. You lived in Florida? Yes. I grew up in Tampa. What does it feel like to be blind? Well, first I was always scared. Then when I turned 20, I decided that I wasn't gonna be scared no more. I accepted it. Now I feel I can do anything I want. Well, I think we've taken up enough of your time, Mrs. Mass. Thank you so much. - Thank you, Miss Mass. - Thank you, Benjy. Good luck on your report. Okay, thanks. - Sharona. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Mr. Monk. - Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank-Thank you very much. - All right. - Thank you. All right. Good day. Um, Justin? Hi. It's me, Sharona. Just give me a call whenever you can. Okay, bye. Benjy? Benjy, I need your notebook and your knapsack. Okay. Hello. I-I just wanna say thank you for the great job you're doing. - What are you doing? - We just solved the case. I need a wipe. Lady Godiva, it's your lucky day. Somebody made your bail. Lucky. What's she doing here? I-I asked her to meet me. Well, do you mind telling me why? You'll see. Just wait. Son of a bitch. He's back. Lieutenant, call the 23rd. Get a black-and-white down here A.S.A.P. - Captain, not so fast. - What are you talking about? I bailed him out last night, and I hired him. You hired the streaker? To do what? Son of a bitch. She can see. - She can see? - She can see. - Son of a bitch. - Sh-Sharona! - Justin? What are you doing here? Friend of yours? We're still on for Saturday, right? Okay, Mrs. Mass, when did you get your vision back? A year ago. / It was your accident at the supermarket. When I woke up, I had regained sight in my left eye. That's how it happens sometimes after a blow to the head. It was a miracle. - But you didn't tell anybody? - No. No, you kept it a secret. If people believed you were blind, you could kill Sonny Cross and nobody would ever suspect you. - Why would you wanna kill Sonny Cross? - Revenge. He was driving the car that killed your parents and left you blind in Tampa 36 years ago. You knew he toured a lot. You waited for him to come through San Francisco, and eventually he did. They announced on the radio that Willie Nelson and his tour manager would be stopping by the station. So you got there early and put a note on the door. Then you waited. Before you killed him, did you tell him who you were? Yes. You killed my parents. This one is for them. And you made sure that the second shot was from 20 feet away, a crime no blind woman could have committed. But then Willie Nelson showed up in that alley. You didn't count on that. - You couldn't just leave the scene, so - Help.! Help, somebody.! - You had to pretend to be a witness - Jason Cross served a year and a half. Vehicular manslaughter? That wasn't justice. What I did last week, that was justice. How did you know? I knew that Cross had been arrested in Tampa. When you mentioned that you'd grown up there, it seemed like a remarkable coincidence. But I didn't put it together until I remembered something you had done last week when you met Captain Stottlemeyer. Me? When you came in with your right arm in a sling, everyone in the room naturally extended their left hand to shake, including Mrs. Mass. This was before anyone mentioned you had hurt your arm. So how could she have known that you offered your left hand? - Thank you, Mr. Monk. - You're thanking him? I am so relieved. It was tearing me up insidethat poor man was taking all the blame. - You're gonna have to go to prison. - I understand. Maybe I can talk to the D.A. About extenuating circumstances. - There's only one thing that I want. - What's that? A window.  In the twilight glow I see her   Blue eyes cryin' in the rain   And when we kissed good-bye and parted   I knew we'd never meet again   Love is like a dying ember   And only memories remain   Through the ages, I'll remember   Blue eyes cryin' in the rain   Someday we'll meet   We'll stroll hand-in-hand again   In a land that knows no parting   Blue eyes cryin'   In the rain"
"﻿What time does she get in? Any minute. We have to hurry. All right. I finally get to meet the famous Aunt Minn. Yep. Have you told her about me? I think your name's come up once or twice. What did you say? I told her the truth. Sorry. Oh, hold on, Sharona, wait. We're on the wrong floor. This is departures. Arrival's upstairs. I think you'd better sit down. Okay. I got good news and bad news. - What do you want to hear first? - Neither. Well, you gotta pick one. I don't want to. If you tell me the good news first, I won't enjoy it, because I'll be worryin' about the bad news, which is coming next. If you tell me the bad news first, I won't get a chance to enjoy the good news, - because I know - Okay, okay. Adrian, Adrian. Just stop. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. We're not here to pick up Aunt Minn. - Yes, we are. - No, no, no. We're not. Aunt Minn's not coming here. I'm going there. My, uh, flight leaves in about an hour, and I'm gonna be gone for seven days. - In a row? - Yeah. In a row. I didn't want to tell you 'cause I knew you were gonna freak out. Now, you could either stay here - By myself? - No, no, no. My sister would look in on you, or you can come with me; I packed your things. No, no, l Okay. I'm gonna need a day or two to think about it. You only got five minutes. This is the final boarding call for Alpha Air Flight 395 to Boston. All passengers, please proceed to Gate 10. Again, this is the final boarding call for Alpha Air's Flight 395 to Boston. All passengers should proceed to Gate 10. What's it gonna be? Ah I'm gonna stay here. By yourself? No, I'm gonna come with you. On the plane? You sure? Could I borrow your lipstick? It was the only thing we couldn't match. MONK Season 1 Epi. 13 Mr. Monk and the Airplane Ladies and gentlemen, please note, Nationwide Airlines Flight 476 to St. Louis has been delayed. I can assure you, Mr. Monk, this particular aircraft has an excellent safety record. Could I see it? Adrian. He doesn't have the safety record with him. How long would it take you to get a copy? Now he wants to see the safety record. Ugh! He's gonna sit right next to me. I know it. And the last time the plane was disinfected was when, would you say? Ladies and gentlemen, please note all unattended luggage Adrian. Undo your pockets and put your stuff in here. You didn't have to put them in Baggies, sir. No, he did. Nail clippers. You can't bring these on board. Sorry. So, she can't fly. Is that what you're saying? We have to stay here. No, we have to confiscate them. You sure you wanna go without your nail clippers?

Are you okay? - You want a sedative? They're very mild. - No. No, thanks. Well, I bought some magazines. You bought all those. What's the problem? It just seems like a lot of extra weight. I am telling you, it's gonna be fine. - It's the safest way to travel. - I know. Statistically, it's very safe. But here's my problem: You see that plane taking off? I know it happens 10,000 times a day, but it's really it's really not possible, is it, when you really I mean, how can they fly? They're made of metal. They weigh 200 tons. - Plus, now you're adding all the magazines - Adrian, Adrian. Look. I know this is very hard for you. It's a very big step. And I just want to let you know I'm really proud of you. Welcome. Mrs. Chabrol. Is your husband with you? Oh, yes, he's just, um just running a little late. Well, he better hurry. Just about ready to go, ma'am. Next passenger, please? Mr. Monk! It's nice to have you with us. - Oh, he's just a little nervous. - There's nothing to be nervous about. You're gonna have to let go of that ticket. Okay. Wait. Okay, take it. Take it. Quick. Quick. - Trouble ahead. - Oh, yeah. This is This isn't so bad. This is first class. Keep walkin'. We're in steerage. Oh. - Oh, my God! - What? Oh, my God, that is Tim Daly! I love him! What is he, some kind of actor? Yeah.! He was on that show, Wings. Never saw it. Was it good? Well, he was. How ya doin'? Oh. Here, here. Adrian, Row 11. This is us. - ""C"" and ""D."" -  I knew it. Why do I attract the crazies? Now, do you want the aisle or the middle? Okay.

So, business or pleasure? Uh, w-we're going to visit her aunt in New Jersey, so - Yeah. - Neither. I'm Warren Beach. - ""Beach,"" like Coney Island. - Oh. Adrian Monk. Hi, Adrian. How are you? What's the matter? - I'm not sick. - No, he is. What is that? Oh, um, that's a diagram. It shows you what to do in case there's an emergency. How much time do we have to study this? Oh, he's not exactly a frequent flyer, you know. Excuse me. Could I have a scotch and water, please? Not till we're airborne. Are you okay? I just don't fly very often. What's that? / Oh. That's your call button in case you need help. Can I help you? I was just testing the button. Seems to be working. So you can stop now. Adrian. Adrian. Sit. Sit down. Sit down. Let me guess. First time on a plane? Oh, no, no. I've been on a plane before. - Where'd you go? - Well, uhDidn't actually go anywhere. Before we took off, I was crying so much, they asked my mother and me to leave the plane. Tell her how old you were. I was, uh, 27. Eleven-D's a real squawker. Do you need any help? Me? Honey, I've been doing this job for 19 years. I've never met a rider I couldn't handle. So, as a first-time flyer, you are sitting next to the right person! Look at that. That is the million-mile pin! I'm in sales. I fly two, three times a week, never had an accident. You see? Except last January, in San Diego. We overshot the runway. We had to ditch into the ocean. You know, those brochures are not always so accurate. In real life, people are fighting over the life preservers. And you know how they say your cushion floats? Not all of them do. I don't want to talk about this anymore. We meet again. Excuse me, that woman back there is coughing and coughing. She's not covering her mouth. - I'm not her mother. - I know, it's the air. It's all recirculating, and it feels like she's coughing right on me. We have a special supply of fresh air up front. I'm not supposed to do this, but I'm gonna have the captain pipe it directly into your blower. - Okay? - Okay. Ah, don't tell anybody else. Thank you. She was patronizing me, wasn't she? You sure complain a lot. Thank you. You know what I think your name is? Mr. ""Complain-ey."" - Kid's got your number. - Yes. It's the fourth row. - Oh, Barbara. Stefan! Thank God. Where were you? Uh, I went to the wrong gate. Can you believe it? Her pin. Her pin. What pin? That That woman's pin. She has a million-mile pin. So? She told the stewardess that she never flies. That's pretty sharp. You ought to be a detective. Oh, he is a detective. That's why he notices little things like that. ""Noticing little things""? Basically, that's all a salesman does. Listen, if you ever need a job, call me. ""Extension cords""? The largest distributor of extension cords in the world. We have 65% of the domestic market. We make three-footers, six-footers, nine-footers that's our big seller. It's 50% longer than the six-footer. That's right. - That's all you sell. - I'm fulfilled. I mean, everybody takes extension cords for granted. But just try to imagine how the world would be without them. I guess all the furniture would be a lot closer to the walls. Exactly. ""If it doesn't reach, call Warren Beach."" Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. - This is your captain speaking. - We're moving. W-W-W-We're rolling. W-W-W-We're going. We're moving. We have to move. That's how it works. Welcome to Nationwide Airways Flight 635 nonstop to Newark, New Jersey. In the unlikely event of loss of cabin pressure, an oxygen mask will drop automatically from the overhead compartment. I'm sorry. You were talking so fast. Th-The overhead what, what, what? Compartment. Simply place the mask over your nose and mouth and breathe normally. Could you just say that little part again? I couldn't see. ""simply place the mask over your nose and mouth and breathe normally."" - Maybe we should test them. - We don't need to test them. - But how do we know that they're working? - What? They all work, okay? - There are four exits in the aircraft. - Excuse me. - Two in the foreca - Excuse me. Uh, shh! ""Two in the forward section,"" go on. And one over each wing. In the event of an evacuation, we are asking passengers seated nearest to the exits I'm so sorry. How can we be sure that we have the best people sitting near the exits? If you don't think that the cabin is safe, perhaps you'd be more comfortable flying downstairs in the cargo bay? She got ya, Adrian. Can't find her uh, my passport. Relax. Maybe it's in the other bag. I'll take a look. Sir? Ma'am. Please sit down.We're underway. Thank God. Excuse me. Check it out. - Please.! Sit down.! Take your seats. - Check it out. When they kissed in the terminal, she had to stand on tiptoe. She's grown at least two inches. - Voila. Sit down, Barbara. - Thank you. Ooh! We're off. Excuse me. I can't feel my fingers. Sharona, I have a bad feeling. I'm telling you, it's perfectly safe. I don't mean the plane. That man. I think he murdered his wife. You do? Can I get you something to drink? Do you like riddles? - Oh, yes. - Good. 'Cause I have one. Did I say yes? I meant no. Pete and Repeat were in a boat. - Pete fell out. Who was left? - Repeat. - Â¸Â®ÃÃÃÂ® (Â¹ÃÂºÂ¹ÃÃÃ³Â´Ã Ã¦ÃÃ Â¾Ã°Â¾Ã®ÃÂ¯ÃÃ±) Pete and Repeat were in a boat. - Pete fell out. Who was left? - Repeat. Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left? Repeat. Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left? Is that a new script? Yeah. I can't decide whether or not to do it. Hit Man's Diary. Hmm. If you do it, are you gonna shave your goatee? - Why? - Well, it's-it's just something that I notice. Um, when you're clean-shaven, whatever you're in is a big hit. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, think about it. You got Diner, Wings, Earth to the Moonthey were huge. That's true. And I got an agent, a lawyer and a manager, and they never noticed that. And when you had a mustache in Year of the Comet, it Bombed. Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left? - Repeat. - Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left? - Repeat. - Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left? - Repeat. - Pete and Repeat were in a boat. Pete fell out. Who was left?

Will you help me? - She is relentless. - Mr. Monk. I have 105 other passengers. The call bell is for emergencies only. Do you understand? Good. Where's your friend? I want to show you something. / Oh, she's, uh She's in the bathroom. No, she's not. It says, ""Unoccupied."" Uh Hope she didn't leave. How far could she go? It's an airplane. Listen, Adrian. You're a man of the world. I think you would appreciate this. See what I got in my hands, here? This is the longest tri-prong, tri-outlet cord - ever made domestically. - Uh-huh. It's 18 feet here. We call it, ""The Anaconda."" It's got a hook. This is a special feature, the hook. Here. Just watch it. You don't even need to listen. There. Look at how good it hooks. Bingo! Would you like to read this? - Me? - Yeah. I'd like to know what you think. You would like to know what I think? Sharona. What are you doing? Adrian, I'm busy. I need help. Um, This is my boss, Adrian Monk. Oh. Hi, Tim Daly. Yeah. Hello. Ah. I'm told you're very talented. I really need you back there. Why don't you go back to your seat? - Count the clouds. - I already did. 23. Excuse me. She's not allowed up here, is she? I'm sorry, ma'am. You have to go back to coach. You tattled on her? I can't believe it! You're a freakin' tattletale. He called me a freakin' tattletale. Fourth row back. Overhead compartment. Oh, excuse me. I just need an extra blanket. I think I saw one up here. Got it. Thanks. I got it. Stefan ""Chab-roll"" C-H-A-B-R-O-L. They have a connecting flight to Paris at 5:15. Paris. Now, if you don't mind, Tim Daly wants me to read the script for him. You really think he killed his wife? He always thinks people are killing each other. That's true. And I'll tell you why. Because they are. Well, listen, Adrian. I'm a pretty good judge of people. If I wasn't, I couldn't sell extension cords. So I think I know what's going on here. You're under a lot of stress. You are trying to avoid thinking that this plane is going to crash into a mountain. Thank you. So you're desperately trying to think of something else to worry about! He's right. You really think so? You gotta relax. Let me buy you a drink. I don't drink. You don't drink. Okay. Well, wait. I got an idea here. This is a good idea. It's brand new, not opened. There you go. Put this over your face. There you go. Now, kick your shoes off. We're gonna teach you to relax, Adrian. Good, good. Okay? Push your seat back. Give him a push. - Go back. - Ah. Ahh! There he goes, back. There you go! - Do you mind? - No. No, I don't mind. How do you feel now? I feel better. Good. Forget your problems. Go to a happy place. Go to SeaWorld. I don't like crowds. It's closed! It's a holiday. You're there alone. Easy. There was no murder, was there? No. Â³Ã There are no killers aboard. No killers. Mrs. Chabrol? There we go. Oh, what-what's this? Your vegetarian meal. Oh, no, no. I wanted turkey. Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't you call ahead for the vegetarian? Uh, I ordered it, sweetheart. Remember? I told you. Oh! Did you hear that? What? She forgot she was a vegetarian? Who forgets they're vegetarian? It's like forgetting you're a Republican. Something's going on here. I'm gonna call Captain Stottlemeyer as soon as we land. Why don't you call him now? That's a phone. Disher. / It's Adrian Monk. Is the captain there? No, Monk. It's Sunday. Where are you? Uh, I'm, uh, I'm in an airplane. Flying, uh I'm flying. - Have you been kidnapped? - No. Going to New Jersey. On an airplane. It's no big deal. Listen. Did anything strange happen at the airport this morning? Strange, as in what? Did-Did a body turn up? A female, 5'7"", mid-forties? Hold on. No. Not a thing. What's goin'on, Monk? Passenger on the plane. Think he might have murdered his wife just before we left. Monk, there's nothing on the sheet. Could you check the guy out? Name is Stefan Chabrol. C-H-A-B-R-O-L. Fine. I'll do what I can. Are you really up there in an airplane? It's better than being up here not in an airplane. I'll call you back. Okay. What is that? What is that? I don't know. The flaps or something. - Did you see that? - No. Did you see He knew we were gonna turn. He knows about planes. Sharona, wake up. Sharona. Wake up. He knows about airplanes. He lifted his glass - Disher. - Randy. I think he works for the airlines. Y-Yeah, hang on. I just found him. You're right. He's a pilot. He flies for Paris Air. How'd you know? I'll tell you later. Is there anything on the wife? Yeah, wife. Barbara, maiden name, Lesser. - She's a trust fund baby. - Details. Well, her family owns Lesser Pharmaceuticals. Her mother and father both deceased. If Stefan wanted to be with another woman, And keep the cash flowing They'd have to pretend the wife was still alive. There's your motive. Chabrol found an accomplice who's Barbara Lesser's double. A dead ringer. They killed her at the airport after she checked in. So, officially, she's boarded the plane, and they're probably never coming back. They're just gonna stay in France and collect the money. W-Well, we need a body, Monk. Where's the body? That's the question. They had to make sure it would never be found. Well, it can't be on the plane. It's still gotta be at the airport somewhere. Monk, I'm on my way. Oh, excuse me. I know this may be none of my business, but you see that man in 11-D do you know him? No. Should I? Well, he's been talking about you the whole trip. He thinks you murdered your wife. - He what? - Don't worry. No one's gonna believe him. He's a real fruitcake. But you might want to want to keep an eye on him, you know? Yes. Yes, I will. I'm tellin' you. You're wasting my time and your time. This airport's the most secure piece of real estate in the city. If there was a body somewhere, we would have found it. Now, I don't know where you're gettin' your information from Now, I tell you where I'm gettin' my information from, Adrian Monk. Maybe you've heard of him. No. Stefan.! - Bernard. - What a small world. - Can you believe this? - No. I was just thinking about your father, God rest his soul. - Are you heading back home? - Yeah, that's right. Yes, me too. I haven't seen you since the big anniversary party. / Ah! Barbara, ravissante, comme toujours. It's a pleasure to meet you. To meet me? Well, you don't remember. You're breaking an old man's heart. I taught you how to waltz that night. Oh, yes. Of course you did. I'm sorry, I'd forgotten. Moi, j'aurais pu jamais oubliee une soiree pareille. I'm sorry, I don't speak French. Since when? We spoke for over an hour. That was only three years ago. Uh, Bernard. Excuse me. I'm so sorry, monsieur. I am sorry. Let me get you a napkin. No. No, I'm fine. Very well. Sharona, wake up. Wake up! Wake up. He spilled his wine. It's staining. I can feel it. Stain remover. Add water and rub it in. Would you do it? I-lf you did it, then I wouldn't have to do it. This is the captain. We're experiencing some minor turbulence. Please remain seated. We should be out of this momentarily. Could you put your tray up, ma'am? Here. Let me help you. May I help you? I, uh I was looking for some, uh, magazines. - Oh, merci. - Alors. Thank you for understanding. The woman is obviously not Barbara. I saw nothing! I knew you'd understand. To our wives and lovers. May they never meet. Hello? Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello.! Hello? This isn't funny. - Hello? My God. - Adrian. Adrian, what are you doing in there? What is that? It's my will. Excuse me. - Excuse me. Neil! - What? We have a situation. You better call Bobby. He's dead. We could divert to Pittsburgh. No, this time of day, they'd probably give us priority right into Newark. What is this? That's heart medicine. Well, the guy had a heart attack. I don't think so. Are you a doctor? No, sir. I'm a homicide detective. Can I see some I.D.? Well, actually, um, - I'm not currently active. - Mm-hmm. But there is a situation on the plane. I've been watching two of your passengers. I think they might have been involved in a homicide back at the airport. And in this. Bobby? This is the man that I was telling you about. Sir, I'm gonna ask you to go back to your seat. No, no. You don't understand. No, no, you don't understand. You're making a scene. Now, please, turn around and go back to your seat. Wine glass. What happened? The old man knew that's not his real wife. I think they killed him. - They what? - Can you prove it? An autopsy would. But that'd take three or four days. They'll be in France by then. It'd take years to extradite them. Unless I have proof. Physical proof. What is it? I don't know. Some kind of powder. Do you have a match? Yes. Get a load of this. The company gave me this for selling 1,000 miles of extension cord. What is it we're doing now, Adrian? Burning off the alcohol residue. Hey, stewardess. That guy has a lighter. What is it? Ethylene. It's a solvent, used in refrigerator coolant. Excuse me. - Were you just using that? - No. Yes, he was. I could see him. No, no, no, no. He was just playing with it. It won't happen again. You're right, it won't. Give it to me, please? Oh, the company gave it to me. You'll get it when we land. - And the glass. - No! No. No, no, no. Not the glass. That's material evidence. Where did you dump her? Pardon me? Your wife. What did you do with the body? He's upset. I spilled some wine on him earlier. Mr. Monk, I am only gonna to say this once. It is a federal offense to disobey a flight attendant. - But - If you get out of your seat again, I will call the air marshals and have them meet you when we land. Sit down! What What are you doing? You won't be needing that again. Ugh! Look at me. I'm shaking.! You'll be fine. What are you doing? I thought you'd quit. / I did! - Maybe it's in one of these suitcases. - Not possible. Everything's X-rayed. How late you think we're gonna go? I don't know. 'Cause here's the thing. My shift ends at noon. After that, it's overtime. Plus, today's Sunday, so that's another 25 an hour. - He's a pilot. - Yeah. So, if he had valid I.D., he could go anywhere he wanted to, right? Just about. Okay.  Oh, okay. - Are you okay? - Shh. I've seen Monk do this a hundred times. - You can't make this movie. - I can't? No, no. I won't let you. This character, Glenn, kills people. Well, yeah. He's a hit man. Okay. Look. On page 57, he chops off a guy's foot. You can't chop off a guy's foot. You're Tim Daly, you're a nice guy, and that's why we love you. I just thought it would be a good change of pace. Okay, look. All I know is that if I go to a movie and I see you chopping off a guy's foot, I'm gonna want my money back. You know what? You're right. I'm gonna pass. I'm gonna call my agent right now and leave a message. Really? Because of me? You're my guardian angel. His shoes. Whose shoes? Chabrol's. Before we left the airport, he was getting his shoes shined. That's why he was late getting on the plane. So? So why would a man who just killed his wife be worried about his shoes? Because he I don't know. I need an extension cord. It doesn't reach. Call Warren Beach. May I suggest the Anaconda? I'll need it back. It's the prototype. What did he step in? Cement. Did you say, cement? Is there a construction site at the airport? Construction. Near the airport. They're renovating the terminal. - It's right through there. - Good. Let's go. Um, here's the thing. I'm overdue for my break. Shut up and show me where it is. Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the seat belt sign. Please make sure that your carry-on luggage is stowed underneath the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. Thank you. We're almost out of time, Randy. What have you got? Monk, it's a construction site, right around the corner from the ladies' room. It's perfect. They've been pouring concrete here all week. If he had security clearance, he could have carried her back here in a suitcase or something. We poured the foundation this morning. It's already hardened. So what would it take to dig it up? Four guys, a couple of drills and a court order. Fine. Do it. How long? Hour and a half. Monk, it's gonna be an hour and a half to dig it up. We don't have an hour and a half. They're gonna be on a plane to Paris at 5:15. Well, then, you have to stall them. What did he say? We're gonna have to stall them. Well, this is a flight I'll never forget although I'll sure try to. Adrian, I've been thinking over your theory about the French couple, and I've come to a conclusion. I'd like my card back. Thank you. Bye! Sweet! What is? Double overtime. Sharona! Oh, Aunt Minn! - Look at you! - We're losin' 'em. How was your flight? - See that guy over there? -  We need to go. He killed his wife and poisoned a guy on the plane. - Sharona. - Adrian thinks he used refrigerator coolants. We have tickets to The Music Man. That's one of my favorites. Excuse me. Final boarding call for Flight 17 to Paris, departing from Gate 29. This is a final boarding call. Please check in at the desk at Gate 29 immediately. - Disher. - Monk here. Monk, we've found something. It might be the body. We'll know for sure in 20 minutes. We're too late. Disher needs 20 minutes. They're already on the plane. Bonjour, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Flight 17 Oh, Paris, Paris, Paris, Paris. Lieutenant? Lieutenant! Do you think you can find a duty roster for a flight leaving Newark? Duty roster, yeah. I'll see what I can do. Duty roster. All flights out of Newark. Go! Hi! Hello. Yeah. I'm worried about a buddy of mine. Uh, Captain Claude Pritchard. Claude Pritchard the pilot, yeah. He's on the tarmac right now. He's been cleared to take off. So, he made it okay. What a relief. Unbelievable. What do you mean? Uh, oh, he was in pretty bad shape when I left him. We were out partying all last night, and into this morning, and we're just party boys. Party boys? Yeah. Yeah, it was pretty ugly there for I tried to take his keys away, but you know how old Claude gets when he's totallyHammered. Ladies and gentlemen, we have been asked to return to the gate. Please stay in your seats. We will be underway in just a few moments. Monk, we found her. Female, mid-40s. Just like you said. I already put a call into the Newark P.D. They should be pickin' up our guy as we speak. Monsieur Monk, is it true this was your first flight? That's right. On ne peut pas tous prevenir. One cannot prepare for everything. - Yeah. All right. - Ooh. Excuse me. - Tim? - All right. I'll talk to you later. Tim, hi. Um I wanted to give you my number. I'm gonna be in town all week. George Clooney just signed on to do the part in that movie. The one I read? They're talking to Scorsese to direct. - Oh. He's good. - Yeah. Hey, hey. Um, can I tell you something? Even if it's a blockbuster, and George Clooney wins an Oscar, I'm not gonna go see it, on principle. Thank you. Uh, Don't forget this. Bye! Isn't he famous? He's some kind of actor. Sharona's helping him with his career. Oh, how exciting.! - Good to see you! - Yeah, so, uh, how's your cat doin'? Oh, I love my kitty, you know? But I think he's probably deaf. It's just not possible."

Adrian, do you know an Arleen Cassidy? Arleen Cassidy? Oh, my God. Trudy used to talk about her all the time. - They went to high school together. - Oh. Hi. I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Sure. Yes, I know where that is. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. Adrian, she really wants to talk to us. She just gave me the address. She said it's very important. - Do you think we should go? - It could be a job. - Do you want to leave now? - Yeah. - Before we finish the game? - Yeah. Then you forfeit. Wait. This is a handicap space. I think we qualify. Wow! This is where Trudy went to school? - How'd she afford it? - On scholarship. Oh, she loved it here. She described it to me in such detail. I almost feel like I went to school here. Trudy! All right. Then let it ride. You know, bet the whole 200. What's the spread on Michigan? Uh, excuse me? Excuse me. Hold on,J.J. Can I help you? Yeah, we're looking for Arleen Cassidy. She's the vice principal. Uh-huh. You reporters? No, we're with the police. My wife went here. Did you know her? Trudy Ellison. No. I only been here a year. She was valedictorian. Great. Congratulations. She was on the yearbook committee Adrian, he didn't know her. Um, where would we find Miss Cassidy? Uh, administration building, second floor. Thanks. Oh! Sorry. Were you here this morning? No. Missed it. Thank God, huh? Heartbreak, isn't it? But what are you gonna do? Hey, you there? I was living in New York when I heard the news about Trudy. - I cried for weeks. - Oh. We all cried. And they never caught the people responsible? We're still looking. Were you and Trudy close? Oh. We were like sisters. But everybody felt that way about Trudy. I helped her through algebra, and she got me through English lit. She was a wonderful writer. Did you ever read any of her poems? - I read them almost every night. - Oh! I'm so sorry I never made it to the wedding. - Was it wonderful? - It was. Wonderful. So, uh, what happened here today? One of my teachers died a few hours ago. I'm still shaking. Um, her name was Beth Landow. She was first-rate. One of the best English teachers I had. They found her over there by the clock tower. The police are calling it an apparent suicide. But you don't believe them. No, it's not that I don't believe them, but they didn't know her. Why don't you think Miss Landow killed herself? Look. Beth worried. Maybe too much. She cared maybe too much. But she was not suicidal. I will never believe that. Ever. You want me to look into it? - L I can pay you. - No. No, uh, I couldn't take a nickel. It's for Trudy. Just tell him to wait. I'll let him know. Okay, boys and girls, let's wrap it up. That's it. Tell the medical examiner we're on our way, and I want that report on my desk in the morning. Captain, Adrian Monk is downstairs. - Why? /- The vice principal asked him to look into it. It turns out that Trudy, his former ex-wife late Yeah, I know who Trudy was, Lieutenant. This is her alma mater. He'd like to come upstairs. Hang on. Nobody move. What am I forgetting? - We got the prints off the railing. - Yes, sir. We've got photographs of everything, every angle. - Did you bag the shoes? - Yes, sir. Done. Medical examiner will get the tissue and the fibers / Don't worry, sir. - 'We're covered here. - You got the code Sir. We've got it. - All right. Let him up. - Bring him up! Don't look down. Hey, Monk. / Captain. Sharona. / Lieutenant. Oh, I imagine this is your worst nightmare a crime scene on a roof. No. It's not my worst nightmare. It's my fourth worst. Uh No, wait. Fifth. No, fourth. Fourth Fourth or fifth. I didn't bring the list with me. What's Homicide doing here? It's supposed to be a suicide. It's not a suicide until we say it's a suicide. This happens to be one. No signs of a struggle? No. She left her jacket neatly folded over there. - What What's that? - Those are her shoes. She folded her jacket there? Why did she leave her shoes over here? She jumped. She was taking antidepressants, and we found a note. It was in one of her pockets. It's printed. Yep. Usually they're written longhand. I've seen 'em printed. I've seen 'em written. I've seen 'em written in blood, I've seen 'em written in crayon. I've seen it all. / Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, easy, easy. ""To whomever I may have hurt, the world and it's problems arejust too much. I am so sorry. Beth. "" I don't think Beth Landow wrote this note. / Why not? Well, it should be ""its"" ""I-T-S,"" no apostrophe. And then here it would be ""whoever,""not ""whomever. "" This wasn't written by a, quote, ""first-rate English teacher. "" Well, she was distraught. She wasn't thinking straight. It's a suicide note, for Christ's sake! Did anybody see her jump? No. About 50 kids heard it though. Everyone was inside taking the S.A.T. S at the time. But they they were in the main building, and they How did they hear anything? She hit a car. The alarm went off. She hit a car? Yeah. Come look. - How old was she? /- Thirty-six. Which one was her car? The white Corolla right over there. Uh-huh. And whose car was this? - Derek Philby. - Another teacher's. Is there a problem? Why would anyone park here with all these broken bottles? - He could have parked anywhere. - I've parked on broken bottles before. - And the doors are unlocked. - Yeah. It's a safe neighborhood. You're right. It is a safe neighborhood. So why was the alarm turned on? It doesn't make sense. No, it never does. She just cut her hair last week. Why would she do that if she was planning to My sister suffers from depression, and it works that way sometimes. Just overwhelms you. I didn't really know her. Did she have any family? A brother in St. Louis, I think. Excuse me. Excuse me. My name is Adrian Monk, and this is Sharona Fleming, my assistant. - Col Colleague. - My assistant-slash-colleague. - Colleague-slash-assistant. - Um, I know this is a very difficult time. Uh, just wanted to ask you a few questions. - Are you a policeman, Mr. Monk? - Used to be. Um, I'm a private consultant now. I'm, uh, just helping the department with their report. Were you all here when Miss Landow died? That's right. The students were taking their S.A.T.s. We were proctoring the tests. So So you were all together? No. We were in different classrooms. - Adrian. - Excuse me. What are you doing? Oh, I'm just making them even. But you're mixing the regular with the decaf. - But they're even. - But they're mixed together. - But they're they're even. - But they're mixed together. - But they're even. - But they're mixed together. But they're even. So the test was in progress when the car alarm sounded? Yes. We started the test at 8:20 on the dot. - On the dot? / On the dot. - On the dot? Uh, it starts at the same time all across the country. It's a standardized test. You've never taken the S.A.T. S? No. No, they they gave me a different test. Can you think of any reason why Beth would have killed herself? Yeah, we were just talking about that. Didn't she say anything in her note? No. It was pretty vague. - Uh, you're Mr. Philby? - That's right. Derek Philby. - And you teach - Chemistry and biology. And it was your car that she landed on, right? Yeah. Even if they can fix it, I can't imagine driving it. It just wouldn't It wouldn't feel right. No, of course not. Of course not. Could I ask you something? Apparently, there's no stopping you. Why did you park by the tower? Isn't there faculty parking near the classrooms? I was gonna take a jog after the S.A.T. S, so I wanted to park by the field. Which reminds me, I need to call a taxi to get home. I have the number in here somewhere. - You left your car alarm on? /- Hmm? You left your car alarm on, - but your doors were unlocked. - I forgot. - I guess I'm not perfect. - I guess you're not. - He's the guy. - Who's the guy? ""Mr. Science. "" Derek Philby. He asked about a suicide note. I never mentioned a note. Well, maybe he just assumed. Isn't there usually a suicide note? As a matter of fact, there isn't. Also, he cheats on his wife. - How do we know this? - Wedding ring. He was wearing his wedding ring. Yes, I know. But he takes it off a lot. When he opened his wallet, I noticed a small indentation in the leather where he keeps it. You noticed that? A little indentation? It's a gift and a curse. He's the guy. But, Adrian, he was proctoring the S.A.T. S at the time, - and there were 50 students in the room. - That's true. So how could he have killed her? He can't be in two places at once. I know. It's impossible. But he's the guy. - There's my girl. - She looked happy. Oh, she was very happy. She hadn't met me yet. You wanted to see her appointment book. This is a copy. - The police took the original. - Thanks. Can you tell me about Derek Philby? Yeah, he's he's the most popular teacher in the school. He has a wonderful family. We're gonna miss him terribly. - He's leaving? - He got another job. He's going to be headmaster at Lincoln Academy in Marin County. It's a big promotion. Miss Cassidy, could Beth Landow have been involved with Derek Philby? Beth and Derek? I don't think so. Why? / He was using a pen from the Modesto Inn. I think I'd like to spend a little more time with Mr. Philby, get to know him better. Adrian, you can't skulk around the school. I'm not gonna skulk. I don't skulk. Stottlemeyer said the investigation is officially over. She's right. / We still haven't found a substitute to take Beth's class. Don't even think about it. They're teenagers. Hello. I understand that, uh, it's been a very difficult time for everybody. I'm going to be filling in for two or three days. And my name is Mr Mr Monk. Mr. Monk. Okay, I understand that you've been, uh, reading The Red Badge of Courage, by Stephen Crane. It's one of my favorite books. We'll start with chapter one. What's up with that ""K""? Oh, my God. Adrian. Adrian, are you okay? What happened? Chalk dust. I have to go to the nurse. Can't breathe. Give me that chalk. Can you manage to sit? - Okay, who threw this? - Kyle! - What's your name? - I didn't do it. Look, I know when a man's lying, okay? - I was married for three and a half years. - I didn't do it. I know that smirk. My husband had that same stupid smirk on his face when he got back from Bally's, where, it turns out, he spent the weekend with Betsy Bennett, his so-called ex-girlfriend. Bally's? Lady, what are you talking about? Is that chalk on your hand? Maybe I should call your parents. You don't have to. My dad's a gym teacher here, and he's gonna be pissed. - I'm really scared. - You should be. - Ow, lady! You're gonna get fired! - Yeah? I don't work here, chump. Hey, great great work, everybody. For tomorrow, we'll read chapters one and Uh, one Oh, read whatever the hell you want. Brings back memories, huh? Yeah. Mostly bad ones. - Did you check out Beth Landow's appointment book? /- Yeah. Nothing unusual. She had a doctor's appointment three days ago. I'm-I'm looking into it. Oh, thank you. From this angle, that looks a little bit like food. - It's vegetarian lasagna. - No, thank you. I bet you always sat at the popular kids'table. I bet that was you over there. - Where were you? - I'm over there. I should go over and talk to him. - What would you say? - ""Things get worse. "" - Mixed vegetables or mac-cheese? - Can I have both? Can I have neither? If I don't get at least a 1550, my dad is gonna kill me. Excuse me. Uh, - did you take the S.A.T. S on Saturday? - Yeah. Uh, by any chance,were you in, uh, Mr. Philby's room? / Yeah. So when Miss Landow died, you heard the car alarm go off? Everybody did. And there were people screaming. I guess everyone ran to the window then, huh? Yeah, pretty much. What did Mr. Philby do? Did you happen to notice? Yeah. We were talking about that later. He never moved. He never even looked up. - What's up, Mr. P.? /- Randy. Good luck today. You got another shutout in ya? - You know it. /- That-a-boy. Mr. Monk. Derek. I heard you were filling in today. How'd it go? It was great. It was great. Actually, I heard you got off to a bit of a rough start. Want friendly advice? Control the classroom. Don't let 'em see you sweat. Believe me, he's much better at his other job. - Which is what? - Catching murderers. Mr. Philby? / Yes. - Got a minute? - Actually, no. My wife is picking me up. I have an ethical question for you. Yesterday I was talking to that policeman, Mr. Monk, and I lied to him. That's wrong, isn't it lying to a policeman? Been bothering me all day. What did you tell him? He wanted to know if I saw anything Saturday morning, anything unusual, and I told him didn't. The fact is, Mr. P., I did. I got to give you credit. It was pretty clever how you pulled that off. Honey! / At first I didn't know what the hell I was looking at. Pretty smart. Apparently not smart enough. I'll cut right to the thing. I owe some friends of mine some money. How much? Ten thousand dollars, and I need it by tomorrow. You see that? The Class of'77. We had one of these murals in our high school too. Everybody painted a little piece of it. Trudy painted these flowers. How can you tell? I can tell. Hey, hey, hey. Not so fast, sister. I'm Kyle Patterson's father. You were hassling my kid during second period? - Excuse me? - Uh, I was there. Your son was way out of line. He threw an eraser at me. - He says it was an accident. - Well, maybe it was. - Although it wasn't. - Who are you? I'm, uh I'm, uh, Monk. Um, Adrian Monk. Adrian. Well, Adrian, this is between me and the lady. Or should I say the other lady? No, I think I think this is between you and me. Whatever you say, Adrian. - Come on. Come on. - Hey, Coach. Hey, guys. Huh? Never give up. You know that. I'm gunnin' for you, pal. When you least expect me, that's when you can expect me. Uh, wait, wait. Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, when I least expect what? Expect me when you least expect me. But that doesn't make sense, though. Uh When the time comes, it'll make perfect sense. Do you know what the hell he was talking about? Somebody burnt the toast. - What do you think? - I think it's weird. Guy worked at the same school. We got two dead people. That's weird. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Weird. Captain, what do ya got? Oh, it looks like a pinhole rupture in the gas line. Happens all the time. He came in, tried to relight the pilot 'cause he wanted to make a fire and, uh, he did. Monk, what do you think? Monk, hey. What do you think? Uh, I-I don't think he was lighting a fire. - You don't? - No. It was pretty warm last night. That's true. Benjy didn't even use his comforter. Plus, the air conditioner is on. He's right. It's on. And the flue wasn't open. This was murder. This was This premeditated Excuse me. - You'll thank me later. - All right. I think you're right about Beth Landow. This is a crime scene. Let's lock it down. And I want to put a man in the school. You already have a man in the school. And this is General Grant. And these are the Southern generals surrendering at the courthouse in Appomattox, Virginia,on April 9, 1865. Very good, Kathy. Very good. Okay. Excellent. So, who's next? - I am. - Oh, good. Kyle. This is Sherman's march. This is them burning down Atlanta. - And what's that? - That's a cannon. - I mean, next to the cannon. - A tank. - A tank, Kyle? - It's a Sherman tank. It's General Sherman, Sherman's march, Sherman tank. Ha Huh I don't think the Union Army had tanks, Kyle. - Well, my Dad helped me with it! - I could be wrong. She made the bed. Why would she make the bed if she was planning on leaping? I don't know. Maybe she was just putting her house in order. - She wore glasses. - So? Those sunglasses have a heavy prescription. There were no eyeglasses at the crime scene. - Contact lenses? - I don't know. Let's find out, shall we? - This has gotta be it. - What? This is Trudy's tree. She used to talk about it all the time. She said she used to get here early and sit down under it and write poems. Poems about me. I thought you didn't meet her until later. Oh, she didn't know they were about me until we met. That's what she used to say. Monk! Come here. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he was right. I wasn't expecting him, and here he is. Get in the car. Here we go. You're just gonna run away? Absolutely. Join me, won't you? You can run, but you can't hide! Oh, yeah. I can hide. Don't think I can't hide. - He thinks I can't hide. - He doesn't know who he's messing with. Nobody hides like you. Adrian, what are you doing? The carrots and the potatoes were touching. - Would you like separate plates? - Of course I would. - Benjy, go get Mr. Monk separate plates. - Okay. Mom says you're having a tough time at school. / Huh? - Something about a bully? - It's a misunderstanding. - Mom says he wants to kick your ass. - No. I mean, yes. RememberJeffrey Appella? Kept beating me up in the fifth grade? You said if I ran away from him, I'd be running away my whole life. I said that? I hit him in the side one time, and he never bothered me again. You can't be afraid of everything, Mr. Monk. / Really? Adrian? Remember Beth Landow's doctor's appointment? Well, it was with a Dr. Sedlik. So I called my friend Maureen, whose roommate's sister knows a nurse who works for him. And? She pulled her file for me. - Is that ethical? - Do you care? No, I thought I should ask because the kid's here. Your basic tennis ball. Cost me a dollar, fifty-nine of my own money, Amy. We're about to put this in some liquid nitrogen. Mr. Monk. Was your hand up? No. I have some questions, but not about your tennis ball. And we just demonstrated what? - The atomic rearrangement of - Amorphous solids. / Very good. Q E.D. ""Thus it is proved. "" All right, now, put the goggles back on the lab shelf. Remember next Thursday is midterms, all right? Bye, Mr. P. Good-bye, Marcia. Mr. Monk, you had a question. If you wouldn't mind. That's what teachers do satisfy curiosity. - Did you know Beth Landow was pregnant when she died? /- No. No, I didn't, but that would explain why she jumped, wouldn't it? The baby's father, whoever he was, must have run out on her, huh? You. You were the father. Unfortunately, you can't prove that, Mr. Monk. Her body's already been cremated. What did she do, threaten to tell your wife? You would have lost everything your new job, family Again, impossible to prove. I think you're failing this course, Mr. Monk. I think I'm doing all right. I have a motive now. Well, you're gonna have to do a little better than that, Mr. Monk, because you're in a science classroom now, and when you're in my classroom, if you have a theory, you'd better have some proof to back it up. I was proctoring the S.A. T. Test when that poor girl died. - I never left the room. - Okay? If that mouse vanished, you could think that the snake did it. I mean, he's got motive He's hungry; he likes to eat mice But he's in a separate cage. There's no way that the snake could have done it. It is one of the immutable laws of physics, Mr. Monk nothing can be in two places at the same time. Any thoughts? I think the snake did it. No sign of a struggle. Her jacket folded neatly, her shoes were over there. A note was in her pocket, and he was across the campus. Maybe he had an accomplice. No. He's too smug. He's arrogant. You should have seen him earlier today. He was He was taunting me. How did he do it? Adrian, you're gonna make yourself crazy. Ah! What's wrong? I'm afraid Okay, well, don't look down! No, I'm afraid he's gonna get away with it. You'll get him. You always do. I think this guy is smarter than me. Nobody's smarter than you. Come on. You'll think a lot better when you're not so high up. - Adrian - What is it? Eyeglasses. They're Beth Landow's. Stottlemeyer called. He said they still haven't been able to locate them. Adrian, if she jumped from the roof, how'd they get here? - See, that's a good question. - Thank you, boss. Hey, Professor. It's showtime. Oh, my God. Keep walking. If he catches up with us, fall to the ground, curl up in a ball and protect your face. No. No, no, no, no. I can't. I can't keep running. Benjy was right. I can't run away from everything. You're gonna be picking up your teeth with your broken fingers. Did you hear that about the teeth and fingers? You want me to call the police? - No. No, I've got to do this. - Come on. Come on. What? You hear that, Mr. Monk? It's 10:00 a. m. At 10:05, you're gonna be waking up in an emergency room. - No! /- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean, wait? Come on! We're fightin' here! Wait. Just cut it out for a minute, will ya? I'm thinking here. I'm thinking too. I'm thinking about punching your lights out. - Will you shut up? - Well / Shut up.! - Did you solve the case? - Thank you. - Thank you. /- For what? L I couldn't have done it without you. I'm gonna give your boy an ""A."" Really? Well, all right then. So, who won here? Mr. Monk. Derek, just wanted to stop in and say good-bye. They found a full-time replacement for the class. She's coming in tomorrow. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Monk. A good teacher merely explains. A great one inspires. And I think you could have been a great teacher. Well, I'll still be here. Just won't be teaching. Oh, yes. Your hypothetical murder investigation. How is that going? Pretty well, actually. Thanks for asking. - We just got a big break. Her Her eyeglasses. /- Eyeglasses Beth Landow always wore glasses. It seems she was blind without them. But, uh, they weren't near her body or on the roof. Where are they, you suppose? I don't know. Well, we'll find them. Tomorrow morning, there'll be about 200 police cadets here searching every square inch of the campus. We'll find them. And when we do, we'll we'll know where Beth Landow was killed. Good luck. Yeah. Good luck. Working late, Mr. Philby? What's going on? Mr. Philby, you're under arrest for murder in the first degree,special circumstances. Come on. That's insane. I told you. I was Proctoring the S.A.T. S at the time. We know. It took me forever to figure out how you pulled it off. But then it hit me. You killed Beth Landow before the test started. You met her on the clock tower roof that morning at about 8:00, Then you killed her, and you carried her body down the stairs to the clock room. This was inspired. She fell, all right, but not from the roof. She fell from the clock. You laid her body out on the minute hand. It was 8:15, so the hand was perfectly horizontal. The S.A. T. S were to begin at 8:20. You had five minutes to get back to the classroom. Plenty of time. And you let gravity do the rest. It was just like one of your science experiments. You took a pretty big risk, Philby, hiding the body in plain sight. It wasn't such a bad bet. That side of the tower faced the athletic field, which on a Saturday morning was completely deserted. Tick tock, until 8:25, when the body slid off the clock and landed on your car. You made sure that the alarm was activated so that everyone would know exactly when she fell. It was a perfect alibi. There was only one problem the groundskeeper just happened to see you. But you took care of him later. I told you, Mr. Monk, a theory is just that unless you have some proof. It's true. I don't have any proof. But you do. It's in your hand. Oh! You see, I I found these on the roof. I think they're Beth Landow's. I think you're looking for them. You didn't find them on the roof. You found them in the clock room under the gearbox, because I put them there two hours ago. Only Beth Landow's killer would have known to look for them there. Q E.D.Quod erat demonstrandum ""Thus it is proved"". Get him out of here. Guess we have to find another science teacher. Well, make sure you check their references. I will. What was she like? Who? Trudy. Smart. Quiet. Didn't date much. Said she was waiting for the right man. Said she'd know him when she met him. She met him. Where's Mr. Monk? I'd love to thank him. He's with her."
"Baja, Mexico Whoa, there he is.! Whoo-hoo-hoo.! Chip.! - Whoo.! - Chippy.! Hey, we see you man. How you doing? I'm doing great. This rocks! He says it rocks. Tell him to jump. Jump! The pilot's a total Nazi. He made me ditch my beer! Oh, don't worry, dude. We've got a couple cold ones down here for you. Okay, man. Don't drink 'em all. I wish you guys were up here. Hey, we didn't win the contest, man. You did! Let me see it. Hey, Chip! Are you gonna jump or are you wussing out? I want to see a man jump out of an airplane. - Yeah, jump, man! - Here I go! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! - There he goes.! - All right, Chip.! Whoo.! Chip! It's Superman.! Open the chute, man! Why isn't he opening the chute? Oh, there's something wrong. Pull the cord! - Pull the cord, Chip! - The cord.! Oh, my God! Dios mio.! Capitan Alameda.! - Yes, Doctor? - You say this boy fell? That is right. From an airplane. His chute malfunctioned. Capitan, are you telling me everything? Yes, of course. What else is there to tell? Well, it is true this boy fell. There is massive trauma,internal injuries, but that is not what killed him. This is impossible. It's a mistake. - There is no mistake, Lieutenant. - ""Cause of death "" He drowned? How could he drown? He jumped from an airplane. He landed in the desert. Well, look for yourselves. His lungs are filled with water. This boy drowned. In midair?

You're lucky I get paid by the hour, I'm telling you. - Hey, Monk. - Captain! - Sharona. - Sharona. /- Lieutenant. - What you doing? - Mailing a letter. - Where's the letter? - In the mailbox. We're waiting for the mailman. Here he is. Monk, the mayor needs your help again. He's got a friend whose kid was killed down in Mexico. Kid named Chip Rosatti. - What happened? - Skydiving accident. - His chute didn't open? - No, he drowned. - Did he land in the ocean? - No. Look. Apparently, the kid jumped out of an airplane, and he drowned in midair. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Hardly any, really. Which is why the mayor wants you to go down there and look into it. It's right up your very unique alley. Hey, we can use a vacation. Now, look, I know how you hate to fly, so you're gonna have to drive. And it's a long way to San Macros. You're gonna have to leave immediately. Mexico. I can't I can't go to Mexico. Why not? It's not here. You can't say no to the mayor. - Gail can watch Benjy. It's a done deal. /- Good. Monk, where you going? I'm just gonna make sure he doesn't drop anything. Oh, no, no. You gotta go home and pack. - Lieutenant? - Sir. Follow that mailman, and make sure he doesn't drop anything. Yes, sir. We made it. Welcome to Mexico. - What are those? - Earplugs. - You You've had them in the whole trip? - Since Los Angeles. - You haven't heard a word I've said. - No. L I've been talking the whole time. - Did you say anything important? - No. - Adrian, take off your sunglasses. - Why? - You look like a drug dealer. - No, I don't. I'm telling you, you do. You fit the profile perfectly. You have 18 suitcases and you're wearing a suit. I mean, if you were a cop, wouldn't you think you looked suspicious? Buenos dias.! How long will you be in Mexico? - Two to three days. - I'm not a drug dealer. - Pardon me? - I'm not a drug dealer. Uh-huh. I want you to park over there and meet me inside. Are you opening a restaurant here, Mr. Monk? No, I'm not opening a restaurant. He's kind of particular. We have bottled water in Mexico, senor Monk. - Many fine brands. - Well, all he drinks is Sierra Springs. Ah, there he is the genius from America, here to show us simple peasants how to solve a homicide. - I have seen this brand here as well. - Well, you know, better safe than sorry. Send him home, Captain. We don't need a babysitter. I wish I could. But I promised the governor I would be a gracious host. - I only hope he doesn't get in my way. - Uh, one second, sir. Lieutenant, will you marry me? - Sir, I - I'm joking, Lieutenant. Those are pillow cases and backup pillow cases. - And these are? - Moist towelettes. Why so many? / In case I happen to, you know, meet people. Senor, I think you have a very poor image of our country. Oh, no, no, no. It's not just you. He thinks everybody is dirty. - You must be a very lonely man, senor. - I am. Thank you. This man is my guest, Sergeant. Let's, uh, close up their bags and put 'em in the car. - Si, Capitan! - Senor Monk. - Hi. - Senorita Fleming. Bienvenidos.! I am Captain Alameda. This is Lieutenant Plato. - Senorita Fleming, welcome to Mexico. - Oh, well, thank you for inviting us. We didn't invite you. In fact, you are wasting your time. We are going to be making an arrest on this case very soon. - You have a suspect? - Not yet. - But we have a theory. - What's that? - Drugs. - Drugs? It's always about the drugs. Well, his parents swore he was clean. Uh, the most he ever had were a couple of beers. Hmm. / Captain, how do you explain the cause of death? He drowned in midair? I don't know. I admit, it sounds baffling. But at the end of the day, you will see, it was drugs. We have the case folder. We translated it for you. / Oh. Gracias. I'm afraid the nicer hotels in town were all booked up with American teenagers. - It's, uh, spring break. - Oh, this will be fine. Oh, I didn't know whether to book one room or two? Two! Two rooms. Two. Uh, dos. Two. Two rooms. - I think they understand, Sharona. - Oh, okay. - Uh, two rooms. - It doesn't really make any sense, does it? Nineteen years old, comes down for spring break, wins a free skydiving lesson, goes up in the plane and drowns. Drugs. Somehow, drugs. It is always the drugs. - Have you spoken to the pilot? - Yes, many times. He is as baffled as we are. He swears the boy was alive and well when he jumped off the plane. - Would you like to meet him? - Eventually, yeah. First I'd like to talk to the witnesses the boy's two friends. I'll arrange for it. Give us a call when you've had a chance to freshen up. / Until later. - Gracias. - Por nada. - What do you think? - It's weird. Everything's weird. It's like another country. This way, please. Your bags will be right up. - Is this your first time in San Macros? - Yes, it is. Adrian! Adrian, look. You can see the plaza. Senor Monk is in here. Senorita, you are in the next room. There is a connecting door. Well, it locks, right? There's a lock on the door? How do you say ""lock""? La cerradura. Si, there is a lock. You have air-conditioning and a minibar and the three-way light low, medium, high. This is the only room in the hotel with a three-way light. Good thing we called ahead. Here is a list of things you cannot flush down the toilet. Adrian, they have chocolate mints on the pillows. Uh, that is not a mint. Excuse me. Uh, don't eat the mints. - Is there a problem? - Uh, si. Your bags. They have been stolen from your car. - You must have left it unlocked. - Oh, my God.! Our bags? All of them? I'm afraid so. These were 18 of them! That was only five minutes. It would take a small army and a U-Haul truck to do that. Perhaps your friends in the police can help. I'm very sorry, senor. Enjoy your stay. I'll call Captain Alameda. They took all my food and water. What am I gonna eat and drink? Adrian, they have food and water in Mexico. Answer the question! What am I gonna eat and drink? Every time I close my eyes, I can see him falling. Was he alive when he left the plane? Yeah, I think so. I saw him kicking, waving his arms. - How well did you know Chip? - I didn't know him at all. I didn't even know his last name till I had to identify the body. We just hooked up the other night at this club in Rivesta. And you all just decided to go parachuting? No, no. Chip won a free lesson or something from this flight school for one freejump. He just asked us to come and watch. It sounded like a blast. I was talking to him on his cell phone the entire time. He sounded scared, but excited. You know, the coroner said Chip Rosatti drowned. - Drowned? - Does that make any sense to you? - Something from the bar? - I'll have an iced tea, thank you. - Me too, please. - That sounds good. - Okay. And for you, senor? - Do you have any Sierra Springs? - No. Uh, we have Perrier. - No, thank you. Do you know anyone in town that sells Sierra Springs? I'm afraid not, senor. - We have San Pellegrino. - No, thank you. - We have Aquafina. - I don't think so. - We have Polaris. - No. - Arrowhead. - No, thank you. - Deer Park. - No. We have Evian. it's delicious, senor. It's our best seller. It is? No, thank you. I'm sort of used to Sierra Springs. We have Aqua Fresca. It's owned by the same company that bottles Sierra Springs. They use the same water, senor. - No. - But it's the same water, senor. - It's just a different label. - Adrian, it's the same water. No, I I'll be fine. How long can you go without drinking? I don't know. What's the record? That man. That - That man. - What about him? He's wearing my clothes. I think he stole my suitcases. Excuse me. What are you doing? Hello? Excuse me? Sir? Sir? Hello? Excuse me.! Excuse me? Oh, sir? Excuse me. Hey, senor.! I'd like to talk to you! Sir? Sir? Con permiso? Stop.! Senor, wait.! Stop! Stop! Alto.! Adrian.! Adrian, are you okay? Oh, my God! He could have killed you! I think that was the idea. My goodness, senor Monk. You are lucky to be alive. Did you get the license number of the truck? / No. He was probably drunk. He lost control of the vehicle. He wasn't drunk! He tried to kill him. Why would anyone in San Macros want to hurt senor Monk? - Do you have any enemies here? - No, not here. So, I am right a drunk driver. - Or maybe it was the drugs. - We'll find him. Oh, senor Monk, Dr. Madero, our local coroner. / Bienvenidos.! This is a great honor, senor Monk. You are legendary, even in this tiny corner of the world. I know. It is a frightful smell. Here mentholated cream. Put a little bit under your nose. You'll be fine. - Is that better? - Si. Gracias. You want some? Doctor, senor Monk is helping with the Chip Rosatti case. Ah, excelente. - He wanted to see your report. - Of course. Anything you need. You know, I just love it when Americans visit. I've never been to the United States. It's been my life's dream. - Here it is. - Uh, thank you. ""Catastrophic injuries, both internal and external. "" Consistent with a fall from a great height. Plus his blood was hypertonic and there was a pint of water in each lung. In other words, he drowned - Was he drugged? - Oh, no, no. No drugs, no alcohol, no signs of force. - Time of death? - There was zero lividity. No rigor mortis. He died just before impact. This case is even stranger than the one last year. - Oh, what happened last year? - Another unusual death. An American student was mauled by a wild lion. - A wild lion? - What, did he escape from the circus? That was the puzzle. There was no circus. A wild lion in Mexico? It was definitely a lion. I did the autopsy myself. It was drug-related, somehow. I am sure of it. / I am sure you're right. I wish you had been here for that case, senor Monk. All right, let's forget about the lion. The lion is ancient history. It's old news. / Yes. Let's concentrate on the case at hand. He jumped from an airplane and drowned. - Are you all right? - Uh, I'm just a little thirsty. - Do you have any bottled water? - Oh, yes. I have Perrier. No, thank you. I'm fine. Here. - No, thank you. - It's fine. It's in a can. It doesn't say where it was bottled. I'm Captain Valez. You wanted to see me? Uh, yeah. I'm Sharona Fleming and this is Adrian Monk. We're investigating the death of Chip Rosatti. Well, I wish you luck. The police have shut me down until they figure out what happened. Well, we understand you were the last person to see Chip alive. The police think I was involved, which is crazy. Why would I do this to my own business? Why don't you tell us what happened? The kid, Rosatti, showed up with a letter from the home office that said, ""Good for one complimentary jump. "" It turned out to be a forgery, but at the time it looked, how do you say, ""kosher"". So I took him up, I strapped him in, and he jumped. That's all I know. Captain, the rip cord on the boy's parachute was severed. - So they tell me. - Who had access to the parachute? Everyone, anyone. It was sitting right here on this shelf all weekend. Anyone could have cut it. From now on, I check them all. I feel terrible. - Is this the plane? - Si. Did anything unusual happen during the flight? No, it was routine. I've logged over a thousand flights just like it. So Chip was alive when you took off? Everybody saw him. Talk to my crew. He was alive when he jumped. I don't know what happened after he left the plane. Why don't you talk to his three little friends? Three? I thought there were two. Two came to watch, but there was a third kid who dropped him off. - A third kid? - An American. - Did you get a name? - I think his name was T.J. - I saw Chip give him something. - What was it? I don't know. This kid, T.J., he was wearing a Rolex watch and driving a very nice car. You might want to check the Grande Lago Resort. That's where all the rich kids stay. - Oh, excuse me. We're looking for a T.J. - Good luck. I've never been prouder to be an American. - They're having fun. - So this is fun? I've heard about fun. I've never been this close to it. Hey, you're hot. You wanna, you know, go upstairs? I'd rather chew glass. You hear that? Did you hear what she just said to me? Excuse me. - Where'd you get that water? - I brought it with me from San Diego. - We'll give you $20 for it. - What? Look, it's the only brand that he likes and he hasn't had anything to eat or drink all day. - Well, here you go. - Oh, thank you. /- Yeah! - That's the most obnoxious thing I've ever seen. /- Yeah? Is it more obnoxious than this? - Oh, my God. - Hey, hey. Are you still looking for T.J.? 'Cause he's right over there. Oh, thank you. Thanks. Oh, my God. So you'd rather chew glass, huh? Hey, look. I'm sorry I said that. It was just an expression. Oh, yeah? Well, I know a few expressions too. We know that you drove Chip to the airport on the day he died. I barely knew the kid, all right? I met him that morning. He asked me for a ride. Why didn't you go to the police? Yeah, right. Like I'm gonna get involved with the federales. The pilot said that Chip gave you something just before they took off. Maybe he did. What What was it? I told you. I am not gonna get involved. Did you hear what he said? We're with the police. Somebody is dead. I'll tell you what. I'll drink you for it. Me and my buddy against the two of you. One pitcher each. If you finish first, I'll tell you what I know. - Fine. You're on. - No. What? No. This is insane. No, forget it. We'll just call Captain Alameda. - It's a piece of cake. - Sharona, I don't drink. Don't worry about it. I do. Ready! Set! Go! Come on! What are you doing? It's a race! One second. You'll thank me later. Give it to me. Give it to me! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Four years of Catholic high school! Fork it over. - Okay. Here. - A key? - What's it for? - I don't know. He just asked me to hold onto it for him. Adrian, why don't you go back to the hotel. Vacuum or something. I'll stay here for a while. - Want to do another one? - Let's do it. /- All right. - Hey, Detective! - Where have you been? Are you okay? - Did you have fun? - I had fun. I forgot how much fun fun was. I like it here. - Where did you get that necklace? - I don't remember. Don't ask me anything else. It hurts to think. But-But that-that's my bed. - Your bed is in the next room. - Oh, shut up! I've been asking around about the key. The concierge says it might fit a locker at the bus station. - You want to go check it out with me? - You mean now? I'm afraid they're gonna clean out the locker. We'll lose whatever's in there. I think what I'd rather do is die. Okay. So I'll just go out alone then. Without you. By myself. Senorita Fleming. Are you all right? Do you have any aspirin? - Yes. Uh, how many do you need? - A thousand - I like your necklace. - Senorita. Sharona. Something has happened. - What? - It is your friend, senor Monk. Was he at the bus station last night? Yeah, yeah, I guess so. Why? Oh, my God. What happened? I'm terribly sorry. Senor Monk, he is dead. What? Well, Judge Dexter won't give us the warrant. Yeah. I knew she was trouble when they appointed her. Stottlemeyer. Yes, Captain? Yeah, I know him very well. What's he done now? Uh, thank you. L- I have to hang up now. Captain? That was Captain Alameda, San Macros Police Department. Adrian Monk is dead. He never used the same umbrella twice. Every time it rained, he threw it out. It drove me crazy. I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. Senorita, you have to come down and identify the body. I will go with you. If it's any consolation, your friend showed great courage. After he was run over, he crawled inch by inch through the mud and garbage trying to get help. - He crawled through what? - Mud and garbage. He's not dead. - Pardon me? - It's not him! - Senorita, your friend is gone. - It's not him. Maybe it's the guy that stole our suitcases? / How can you be sure? Adrian Monk would die before he'd crawl through mud and garbage. - But he was dying. - You don't understand. Adrian! Senor Monk.! That officer outside told me I was dead. I'm not dead, am I? You're not dead. I didn't think so. I am so thirsty. I found this in the locker. It's Chip Rosatti's. I'm so thirsty. In a way, given what he had to deal with, he was the bravest man I've ever known. I measured everything I did against him. He was my yardstick. I never told him that. I'm sure he knew, sir. I'm sure he did. The son of a bitch knew everything. I want a full-dress funeral. I want the governor there. I want the entire department there with black armbands and white gloves. Sir, Monk wasn't on active duty. We can't go full dress. Adrian Monk is to be buried with honors or I quit. I'm gonna tell you something, Randy, and I'm not ashamed to admit this I loved that man. This is Stottlemeyer. Yes. I understand. I hate that man. I hate that man! Thank you for coming, senor Monk. As you can see, there is nothing unusual here. Some skin cream, a T-shirt, some magazines, and, oh, yes, a candy bar. - No drugs? - No, senor. Which makes me think for once we have a case that may not involve drugs. - I have a theory. - What is it? The boy, Chip Rosatti,drowned at the resort in the swimming pool. It was an accident. The resort owner panicked. He couldn't afford all the bad publicity or a lawsuit. So, to cover up, he arranged for the boy's body to be put on an airplane and made it look like a parachuting accident. But his friends talked to him just before he jumped. They were obviously paid off. But the pilot swore he was alive. Then he was paid off as well. What do you think, Mr. Monk? I'm I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Capitan, I have some excellent news. Don't tell me you have the news. Tell me the news. - He's here. - Excellent! Oh. The hotel owner is here. He will be in the next room. You will have the front row seat. He will be confessing very shortly. Can we get you anything, Hernandez? - It is a bit hot in here, Capitan. - Of course.! Sergeant, get some water for our guest. Hernandez, we know all about the accident in the swimming pool. - What accident? - Don't play games. We know Chip Rosatti drowned there and you tried to cover it up. You're crazy. Is that why you brought me here? Sierra Springs? - Sergeant, is there any more Sierra Springs? /- Sorry, no mas. That was the last one. We have Perrier. - I like your beads. - Thanks. - What was that? - Don't change the subject! Do you have witnesses? If he drowned, there must have been a witness. Maybe you paid them off like you paid off the pilot. - Adrian! Adrian! Look at this! - What is it? Hydroxyzine. That means he was allergic to chlorine. - He never would have gone swimming. - I don't care. I'm just so damn thirsty. If Chip didn't drown in the pool, something must have happened on the plane. - Maybe. - I think we should go back to the airport. - Okay. - I'm gonna call Benjy. Hi, honey, it's me. How you doing? You did? That's I am so proud of you. You wanna tell him about it? Okay, okay. One sec, okay? I love you. I love you too. Bye. - Adrian, he wants to talk to you. - But the painting I'll fix the painting. Come on. He wants to talk to you. Hi, Benjy. It's me, Monk. What are you drinking? Oh, I thought you were drinking something. Hold please. Sharona, the bed. - It's not made.! - So? The maid hasn't been in here. Don't move! Benjy, we'll call you back. Don't move. - Somebody's been in this room. - How do you know? The three-way lamp it was on ""low"" when we left, but now it's on ""high"". And that painting was tilted the other way. Senor Monk? Senor Monk? Senor Monk? - There you are. - Are you all right? / Yeah? You are a brave man, senor Monk. You are not sweating at all. I'm dehydrated. I'm out of sweat. I want to sweat. I'm trying to sweat. Clearly, you were right, senor. Somebody is trying to kill you. You must be frightening someone. But we don't even have a suspect. This isn't about the Chip Rosatti case. It's about something else. - What? - I don't know. Maybe it's just a local zafado who hates people from San Francisco. Excuse me? He's right. You, Chip Rosatti, the boy last year who was mauled by the wild lion you are all from San Francisco. The boy who was mauled is from San Francisco? Yes, from Marin County. From a wealthy family. And Chip Rosatti's family had money. - What? - I got it! I know who did it, I know how and I know why! / You do? Get the car! Start packing! We're going home! / What? It's all over! We're going home! / What? When did the coroner, Dr. Madero, first arrive in San Macros? Wait. Don't tell me. A year and a half ago. That's right! But what does Madero have to do with all this? I didn't catch it before because I'm so damn thirsty. Smell this! Menthol. Madero uses mentholated cream when he works at the morgue. Go find Dr. Madero and bring him here! Rapido.! Plato! / Come on! Come on. Pack! Pack! It's nothing personal. I just I just gotta go home. I still don't understand, senor Monk. Captain, the wild lion last year and the boy who drowned in midair, - what do they have in common? - I don't know! They're both impossible. One impossible murder, maybe. Two impossible murders? It's just not possible. - Is the car downstairs? - I just called. - Come on. - Wait! Wait, wait! My hairbrush! - I'll buy you a new one! - How are you so sure? Two years ago back in the States, I testified against a doctor named Louis Nivara. I remember that case. It was an insurance scam. It ruined him. He lost his practice. His poor wife committed suicide, and he always blamed me. So you think this Dr. Nivara And your coroner, Dr. Madero one and the same. - But why didn't you recognize him? - I never met the man. It was a grand jury. Closed hearing. He jumped bail before the trial and disappeared. Excuse me. Could we go first? I haven't had a thing to eat or drink in 36 hours. - Hi. We're checking out! - What room, senor? The room with the bomb behind the painting. Oh, yes. Room 403. Speak of the devil. - Que pasa, Capitan? - Dr. Nivara. I believe that's your real name. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm talking about homicide, Doctor. I was just explaining to the captain why you killed Chip Rosatti. This whole thing has been about me from the beginning, hasn't it? - About you? - You wanted to kill me. You blame me for ruining your life by testifying against you. But you couldn't return to the States. You're a wanted man. So you had to find a way to get me to come to you. - Senor, would you care to check the bill? - No, it's fine. You needed the right bait. A kid from San Francisco whose family had money and connections. If the murder was difficult enough and mysterious enough, you knew the mayor would bring me in. It's true. He's the go-to guy. You went to the Grande Lago Resort and you found Chip Rosatti. - He was a thirsty victim. - Adrian. I mean, a perfect victim. His family was rich and well connected. You sent him a letter with a coupon for one free skydiving lesson. But first you made sure that his parachute would never open. Shall we keep this on your card, senor Monk? / Yeah, yeah. Whatever. - Shall I staple them together? - I don't care! Do what you want! - Where is the car? - It is coming. Continue, senor Monk. When Chip Rosatti's body was brought in, the good doctor poured water into his lungs and announced that the boy had mysteriously drowned. He knew the mayor often asked me to look into cases like this. Capitan, you cannot believe a word he's saying! Actually, Doctor, it explains quite a bit. There were some fingerprints on the parachute handles we couldn't match up. I'll be interested in comparing them with yours. You're leaving too? I'm afraid your impression of own town must be terrible. - Will you give us another chance? - Oh, of course. I love your country. Maybe you come back alone. You can earn some more necklaces. Why does everybody keep mentioning my necklaces? They're fiesta beads. Oh. What are fiesta beads? You don't remember how you got them? - No. - Hey, guys give them to girls at parties. Oh, what for? Oh, my God! Why didn't you tell me? You wore them so proudly. Oh, God! Adrian! - The car's here! Let's go! - Senor Monk! You said you ruined my life. That is wrong. You stole it! I made one foolish mistake. Nobody even noticed.! Who the hell are you to point your finger at me? - Who is he? /- He is a police officer, and a damn fine one! Keep your eye on him, Lieutenant. He is the primary suspect in two homicides. Actually three. Three homicides. Don't forget the boy the killed last year. - The wild lion? - Exactly. He fabricated that too. Only it didn't work, 'cause no one called me. So he waited a year and tried again. All this because you smelled menthol cream on the curtains? Actually, I've been thinking about Madero for a while. He claimed he had never been to the United States. Then he said there was a pint of water in the boy's lungs. He didn't say half a liter. He said, ""A pint. "" Only a person who practiced in the United States would have said that. Senor Monk, I want to say, it has been an honor to work side by side with such an accomplished detective. / Mail it to us! - Just put 'em anywhere. - Thanks a lot. - I see you bought some water. - Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm thirsty. No, no. Don't-Don't-Don't drink that. - That's my emergency stash. - You have like a thousand bottles here. Drink this. That's fresher. Hey! Oh, great. No, great. Now I'm gonna have to order some more. Hey, it's from San Macros. They indicted Dr. Madero. There's a trial date. It's hard to believe. I never even met the guy in person and he wanted to kill me, huh? I said, It's hard to believe. I barely knew him and he wanted me dead. I mean, it's hard to believe, don't you think? Sharona, he wanted me dead. Hello?"
"All right. Here he comes. Mr. Hammond! Mr. Hammond! Mr. Hammond, the SEC Is saying you purposely misled your investors. I can't comment on anything the SEC says or does. As you know, I'm meeting with the board of directors. I'll be able to tell you more about it in the morning. Thank you. Mr. Hammond, is there a possibility that charges will be filed? Mr. Hammond?

Come on, Jared! Right over the plate! Come on, Benjy! You can do it! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't watch. Adrian, tell me what's happening. - The three is crooked. - What three? On the scoreboard. Why doesn't he fix it? Adrian, I need you to watch the game. How's he doing? - The one is upside down. - You can't tell the one is upside down. I can tell. The whole scoreboard It's like some surreal, abstract art thing. Come on, Benjy! Grab a piece of it! Come on, Jared! Right down the middle. He's no hitter. - He's not eligible. - Who? Stottlemeyer's son, Jared. I think he's 13. - He doesn't look 12, does he? - Knock it out of the park, Benjy! - Come on! - The numbers are crooked! Somebody fix the scoreboard! No wonder attendance is down. - Strike three! You're out! - Yeah! Yes! Yeah! - Adrian, why don't you go talk to him? - Me? Yeah. Give him a pep talk. He respects you. - He does? Why? - 'Cause he doesn't work for you. Good game. Good game. Good game. Good one. Next time. - Is there a problem? - Didn't your son repeat the third grade? - Yeah. So what if he did? - How old is he? - He's 12. - Jared, what year were you born? Don't answer that, son. All right. We're gonna huddle in the outfield, and then we're goin' out for pizza! - Yeah! - Yeah! All right. He's 13. But I have a special dispensation from the league. He's eligible. How many parking tickets did you have to fix for that? He is eligible, Sharona. End of discussion. Excuse me. This is Stottlemeyer. Hey! Hey, you looked good out there. What game were you watching? I sucked. Yeah. You did, kind of. Listen, Benjy, do me a favor, and, uh, just your mom thinks I'm givin' you a pep talk. Why? / I don't know. I don't know. Because I'm a guy. You're we're two guys. I don't know. I don't know. Look, just kind of nod your head and pretend I'm giving you some good advice. - Okay. - Great. Okay, so, um - Oh, um hands together. - Like this? - Yeah. Uh-huh. - Yeah. That's good. Nod your head. Smile. / Adrian. Adrian. We've gotta go. We've got a job. - Lawrence Hammond was killed last night. - The Lawrence Hammond? - And his wife. - Okay. Um, listen, Benjy. Just keep practicin' that swing like we talked about, and we'll have another lesson tomorrow. / Okay - Be careful. - Okay, Mr. Monk. Thanks for everything. / Okay, pal. Honey, go home with Mrs. Cargill, and I'll pick you up later, okay? / Okay - I love you. You did so good today, huh? - Yeah. Right. He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be fine. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Back up. His sister just I.D.'d the body. It's him. This is gonna be a circus. Give me your tie. Give me your tie. How'd the game go? Randy, this is a double homicide. - Sorry. - I can't talk about the game. We beat 'em 3-1. Jared pitched the whole game. - He gave up two hits. - Really? /- Yeah. Eight strikeouts. Bring them up to speed, all right? Walk 'em through it. I gotta go do my dog and pony show. - Monk. Sharona. - Lieutenant. - Is it really Lawrence Hammond? - Yes, it is. - What was he doing here? - We're just kicking that around now. We think he got lost or maybe he was meeting someone. It doesn't make any sense. Isn't that a what do you call it? Global positioning system. It was on, but it wasn't working. There was no disk in the computer. - Maybe somebody took it. - Maybe. The shooter was here waiting. - Hammond drives up - Yeah. Right. We found the casings. The shooter comes in here pop, pop, pop, pop - four rounds into the wife. - Oh, my God. - He shot the wife first? - Then Hammond. Hammond was shot once, but it wasn't fatal. - He tried to get away. - Oh, my God. He gets out, runs. The shooter gets back into his car, runs him down. / Oh, my God. - Hammond still wasn't dead. - Oh, my God. - In the morning, he crawled away. - Oh, my God! He crawled for two and a half miles. Truck driver found him. - I'd like to talk to him. - I'll get him. Captain, he shot the wife first. Why would he do that? I would've done the husband first, wouldn't you? I don't know, Monk. It's never come up. He didn't even stick around to make sure Hammond was dead. Maybe he got interrupted. He lured them here somehow to kill her. Who? The wife? She's a nobody. Lawrence Hammond's worth a billion dollars. He had at least 100 enemies. No. No, no, no, no. Lawrence Hammond is an afterthought. - She was the primary. - This is Norm Mosely He was the truck driver who found Lawrence Hammond. Was Mr. Hammond dead when you found him? He was barely hangin' on. He died before the paramedics showed up. - Did he say anything? - Yes, sir. He said, ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" - Come again? - ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" - Is that it? - Yes, sir. - You sure? - He said it, like, five times. Then he died. ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas""? - What the hell does that mean? - Well, it's true. They can't. It depends. How many girls are we talkin' about? Hang on. Were there any girls nearby eating pizza? No, sir. I figured he was delirious, but he kept saying it. ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" Nah. No, no. Forget it. No. Never mind. Never mind. Not too shabby, huh? Walk this way, please. - Trudy and I almost bought this house. - Really? Adrian, you made a joke. You were joking. You feeling okay? Hello. I'm Robin Jenkins. I'm their well, I was their housekeeper. Hello, Mrs. Jenkins. I'm so sorry to bother you. Um, I'm Sharona Fleming, and this is my boss, Adrian Monk. You're with the police? - Not really. - Yes, I'm with the police. - Used to be on the force. I was discharged. - We help the police. We're private consultants. - It's a long story. - How long did you work for the Hammonds? Three years. I started a few weeks before they were married. Oh, I am so sorry. I know this is a really bad time I don't know what I'm going to do. Can I have one of those? I'm sorry. I only have four left. Um, we were hoping we could look around a little. Oh, uh, certainly. There's nothing left to see. The police were here all day yesterday. They took Mr. Hammond's computer and boxes of papers. His office and his bedroom are a mess. His bedroom? They had separate bedrooms? Yes. For the last year, Mr. Hammond slept in the east wing. Follow me. Actually, I'd like to see her bedroom. You know, separate bedrooms might've saved my marriage. - Was Mrs. Hammond a sports fan? - Just baseball. She never missed a game. You know, it's not true what the papers say. - What's that? - About Mr. Hammond. They make him out to be greedy and selfish, like a monster. But he wasn't like that at all. He was so kind. He never forgot your name or your kid's name or your birthday. - What about her? - Mrs. H? She liked to keep busy. She had hobbies horseback riding, painting. She painted that. ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" - Pardon me? - Those were Mr. Hammond's last words. Does it mean anything to you? - ""Girls "" - ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" - What girls? - We don't know. Maybe they've got stomachache from the pizza. / No. All eyes on Scott Gregorio tonight as he attempts to create history. No baseball fan could ever forget this moment. It was three years ago. This is Darryl Grant hitting his historic 73rd home run. The question now is how long will that record stand? Scott Gregorio's within three home runs - with four games left to play. - Scotty! If last night is any indication, he's gonna be in trouble. Gregorio went 0 for 3 in Philly. He looked pretty shaky at the plate. He's choking. I was at the stadium Tuesday night. He was on fire. Some guys just can't handle the pressure, my friend. Not like you and me. Randy, where is that list of people who might have had a grudge against Lawrence Hammond? Still workin' on it, sir. It's like a phone book. Everybody who had stock in the company had a reason to hate the guy. Captain, do you have a minute? I think we're onto something. - Erin Hammond was having an affair. - Oh, again with the wife. There were four shampoo bottles in her bedroom from the Newport Inn. Which is just two miles away from her house. The concierge said that she's been there two or three times a month with some guy, - but they never got a good look at him. - Congratulations. Mrs. Hammond was having an affair. Yeah, all right. Yeah. I can't ignore that. Um, go down to the Newport Inn. I want you to interview the staff and bring a sketch artist. / Yes, sir. - Who's this? - Scott Gregorio. He's a baseball player trying to break the single-season home run record. Yeah. Monk, can we keep our eye on the prize here? / Is he an artist? Yeah. He likes to do some painting in his spare time. Adrian, you're wrong. It is not the same artist. I know it's not the same artist, but look at the window and the drapes and the church in the background. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're right. It is the same church. So at some point, they were both in the same room. W- Wait. So you're saying Lawrence Hammond's wife - His murdered wife. - And Scott Gregorio - Future Hall of Famer. - Are connected? Bet on it. Adrian.. Adrian, you were right. This is the room. Look at the drapes and the church outside. - They both must have taken this class. - Oh, yes. Oh, no! Okay. Sharona, I can't do this. Why? 'Cause he's naked? You've never seen a naked man before? / No. Well, you've seen yourself naked, right? - Just once. - All right. Let me do the talking. - Mr. Henley? - Yes. I'm Frank Henley. Excuse me if I don't get up. My regular model called in sick. Oh, that's okay. We spoke earlier. I'm Sharona Fleming, and Adrian this is Adrian Monk. Hi. / Is this a bad time? Oh, no, no. Not at all. Please. Make yourself comfortable. I am. Okay. That's it. Sharona, let's go. Come on. - I can't. I just can't. - What about the case? Forget about the case. We can't win 'em all. So you're gonna let a murderer go because you can't talk to a naked man? - Yes. - Oh, come on. Mr. Henley, this is only gonna take a minute. Um, Erin Hammond was a student of yours last year, right? That's right. For one semester. God rest her soul. Do you draw, Ms Fleming? No, but my son, Benjy, really has the gift. Didn't get it from me, though. - Mr. Monk, please don't touch anything. - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. I understand Scott Gregorio, the baseball player, was also a student of yours. - Did they know each other? - Look, I don't wanna get anyone in trouble. Maybe they left together once or twice. They were both consenting adults. Who am I to judge? That's a good point. Thank you. Interview's over. Thank you. - Well, I guess that's it. - That's it. Thank you very much. Thank you. Anytime. Here. Wait. Wait. Let me see you out. No. I can't No. No. That's it. We can see ourselves out. Just stay there. What is your problem? The human body is a beautiful thing. No. It's not. Did you hear what he said? Erin Hammond and Scott Gregorio left together. So what does that mean? I don't know yet, but I think it meant something to somebody. We haven't seen any home runs for the last three games. What are you tellin' yourself? I've been in a slump before, Danny. I've been workin' with the coaches. All it takes is one good swing of the bat, and I'm right back in this. - He's Benjy's hero. - I'm just gonna take it one game at a time. I thought I was Benjy's hero. I've noticed last few games, you had a little trouble with breaking pitches. What are you doing about that? Well, I took a little longer on B.P. today, and I think I've worked it out. - He loved her. - How do you know? Three more home runs. Four games to go. Do you still think you can catch Darryl Grant? I'm just trying to help my team win ball games. That's all I'm focusing on right now. I appreciate you taking the time to talk to us on your day off, Scott. Best of luck tomorrow. - I'm gonna get him. - Scott.! Scott.! Hi. How are ya? Thanks for comin' out. - Here you go. Here you go. - Scott? Scott? No. No, no, no. It's a note from my friend. I think you should read it. We think Erin was the real target of the attack, not her husband. - Why would you say that? - Think about it. Think about how you were affected by her death. Your hitting streak. Maybe somebody's trying to distract you. I can't believe you said that. I know this sounds paranoid, but I was thinking the exact same thing. Maybe it was the same guy who attacked you a couple of weeks ago. You heard about that, huh? Yeah. I was outside the stadium. It was after a game. Some creep came at me with a baseball bat. I fought him off. He disappeared. - Did you get a good look at him? - Nah. It happened too fast. It's when the team hired Hekyll and Jekyll here to babysit me. What about the police? What are they doing? Well, sometimes it takes them a day or two to catch up with us. Meanwhile, I'm workin' on it round the clock. I'm gonna get that other one out in the bleachers. / Thank you. If there's anything I can do to help anything at all. Really? - Oh, good swing! - Really? Yeah, you're a natural. Just remember: Keep your weight on your back foot. Don't be afraid of the ball. - Yes! - Good hit, Benjy! That is a double in any ballpark in this country. Thank you, Adrian. I thought I'd thank you now, 'cause in a half an hour, you're probably gonna piss me off again. You're welcome. - Keep your eye on the ball. - I miss her so much. They say when people lose a leg, they can still feel it. That was better. - That's what it feels like. - Keep your eye on the ball. I know. - Better. That was better. - How do you just keep going? How do you keep working? When Trudy fell in love with me, I was a detective. I was on the street breaking cases. So I keep working. I keep trying to be the man she loved. That's all you can do. Be the man she loved. Hey, Benjy. Don't forget help. - What's help? - H-E-L-P. Hands together. Elbows up. Level swing. Patience. H- E-L-P. / Yeah. It helps to remember it. It's - What do you call it? - Mnemonic device. Sharona, call the captain! G- C-E-1-5-P. ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" It was a mnemonic device. I understand. That's good work, Monk. I remembered how the housekeeper said Lawrence Hammond never forgot a birthday. A lot of successful people use little tricks to memorize information. - I said I understand. - Obviously, Hammond made up the phrase to help him remember the license plate of the car that ran him down. - ""G"" stands for ""girl. "" - Adrian. Adrian. He gets it, okay? We all get it. - ""Girls can't eat 15 pizzas. "" - Captain, the car's hot. It was stolen from the Presidio Sunday night. - Is this blood on the bumper? - Yes, sir. We have a positive match. It's Lawrence Hammond's. You ready for this? Ready for what? Just say it, Randy. What? We found this underneath the rear seat cushion. It's for one of those global positioning systems. It's homemade. The guy programmed it himself. This is what he used to lure Hammond and his wife to that industrial park. / Right. Start putting together a list of computer geeks that can do that sort of thing. Yes, sir. There's more. And would you like to share it with us, Randy? The shooter abandoned the car in a parking lot. There was a security camera. We got a picture of him. That's it? They can't clean that up? It is cleaned up. I mean, he was 50 feet away. - Should I release it to the press? - What's the point? I've seen better pictures of Bigfoot. Captain, I've seen this guy before. Who is he? / I can't remember, but I know that face. I've seen him before.. somewhere. I know that face. I just cannot remember where I've seen it. Adrian.. Adrian, let's put the face aside for a minute. Let's put the case aside for a while, and we're gonna talk about your life. I mean, after all, Adrian, that is what you're paying me for, okay? So, I understand you've been spending a lot of time with Benjy. - Now, how does that feel? - Oh, he's a great kid. Yes, I know that. I'm asking how does that feel? It hurts. It hurts to be with him. Why? You and Trudy ever talk about having kids? Trudy used to bring it up. I said there was no rush. We had all the time in the world. Could've, should've, would've. Okay. Well, I hate to end the session on that note, but the hour is up. No, it's not. It's only been 57 minutes. How'd you do that? You're wearing a watch? / No. - You could see my watch, right? - No. - It's a gift. /- And a curse. - And a curse. Okay. Okay. So, uh, we have a few more minutes left. What would you like to talk about? That face! I have seen him before. I know it. I have seen that guy before. That guy I have seen him before; I know it. I have seen that guy before. So, Adrian, do you think you've seen that guy before? I know I have. Mr. Monk, Mr. Turrow will see you now. For the best price and best quality, come into one of our many Bay Area locations today. Baseball's Darryl Grant can break the single-season record for home runs, but one thing he can't break is any storm window made by Parson's. Swiss-tempered, double-laminated safety glass to protect your home, you and your family. With Parson's storm windows, the only break you'll be seeing is in the price. Darryl, I'm watchin' it right now. I've seen it 20 times. Will you relax? No. The lighting's perfect. You look great. Darryl, I'm gonna have to call you back, all right? Who loves you? Right. Well, who else loves you? Me! Why do you tease me like that? Excuse me. Excuse me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? There was a bit of a smudge, like an ink stain. I think I got most of it. No, no, no. It's an autograph. / Oh? Yeah. It's a 1988 All-Star game ball signed by Michael Jordan. Well, maybe he could sign it again. Sure. I'll just call Michael, ask him to stop by. Thank God. I'm so relieved. He's being sarcastic. Give it to me. So, what can I do for you, Mr. Monk? You represent Darryl Grant. I have that honor. That was just him on the phone. Well, as you know, Scott Gregorio is very close to breaking Mr. Grant's home run record. Not if he keeps having games like he had last night. What was he? Like, 0 for 3? Well, we think somebody's trying to get to Scott Gregorio either directly or indirectly. Get to him? What? Are you talking about that lunatic with the baseball bat two weeks ago? We're talking about a murder Friday night of someone very close to Scott Gregorio. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold it. You're not saying You can't be saying you think Darryl Grant is involved? You can't deny he had a motive. It's his record Gregorio is trying to break. Where was your client Friday night? Darryl Grant is a sportscaster now. He was in Chicago covering a doubleheader. There was, like, two million people watching. You want their names? He could've hired somebody. No, no, no. No. Not Darryl Grant. Look. This was taken last year. This is Jerry Grierson breaking Darryl Grant's single-season R.B.I. Record. Now, Darryl Grant was more proud of that record than the home runs. But look at this. Darryl is the first guy on the field to congratulate him. Darryl Grant's a mensch. He's a stand-up guy who realizes that records are made to be broken. So I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Monk. Do I owe you any money for cleaning up? - No, no. I don't want any money. - He's joking again. I was joking back. - Thank you. - Right. Keep in touch. Come on, Jared! Big inning, son! Big inning! Come on! - Crack that outfield, boy. - Come on.! - Ball! - Good eye! Good eye! I can't I remember I know I have seen that guy before. Go Cyclones! Come on, Jared! Come on, boy! - Strike three! You're out! - What? No, no, no, no, no. Walter. Walter, he checked his swing. - Leland, he broke his wrists. - He did not. I was standing right there. He didn't go around. Jared, did you go around? Wait a minute. You can't ask him. Yes, I can. Why not? Why? Don't you trust him? Leland, sit down. I mean it. You're out of line. / Oh, no, no. - You're out of line! - Back in the dugout, Leland! Get your finger out of my face, Walter. What? You want the health department to come visit your restaurant? I don't have to take this not for $20 a game. I quit! Walter Walter, I'm sorry. He didn't go around. - He has some nerve. - Excuse me. Someone said you don't have a kid in this game. Okay. I'll leave. No. You don't have to leave. It means you can be the umpire. - Oh, uh, no, I don't think so. - Well, here's the thing. If we can't find an ump, we gotta call this game. Benjy. Okay. We have a new umpire. We'll pick it up where we left off. Monk? Let's go! Gonna play or what? All right, kids! Be alert! You want the ball! Play ball! Time Time-out! Time-out. Play ball! Time-out. Time Time Time-out. Time-out. Come on! Let's start! Play ball! Adrian. Adrian! It's okay. It's clean enough. Okay, guys. We're gonna be here a while, so if anybody's got any homework they need to do, they might as well get it out now. Come on! Come on! Play ball! Strike! Strike one. Ball Ball one. That was a ball. That was ball one. Ball one. No. No. It was a strike. Strike. - Ball. Ball. - Come on! Time! Time-out! Play ball! This is where you're gonna have to carry. / Strike! Ball! Ball. Ball. Strike. Strike! Ball. Ball. Do over. Come on, Benjy! You can do it! Eye on the ball! Eye on the ball! H- E-L-P. Hands together. Elbows up. - Good job, Benjy! - Safe! He's safe! He's natural! He's na.. I mean Good job, Benjy! - That was a nice hit. - Thanks, Mr. Stottlemeyer. Don't lose that. When you make it to the majors, that's gonna be worth a fortune. Are you okay? You know who killed the Hammonds, don't you? Adrian, you are a great detective. A terrible umpire, but a great detective. Captain, I've got that list of computer programmers who worked on global positioning systems in the Bay Area. Yeah? / And I checked them against applications for gun permits. - And? - Nothing. Captain.. Captain, I know where I saw him. / Saw who? Him. He's on TV. I've seen him a dozen times. - So have you. He is in a commercial. - A TV commercial? For storm windows. We made a copy of it. Your TV has a video player, right? What? / Your little TV the one you're always watching. - I don't have a TV. - It's all right, Randy. Let's have a look. Can I make a prediction here? You're each going to say ""Oh, my God"" twice. - Okay, okay. Here it is. - Don't blink. Baseball's Darryl Grant can break the single-season record for home runs, but one thing he can't break is any storm window made by - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my - Oh, my God. My God. Okay. Back door, eyes open, armed and dangerous. - I knew I'd seen that guy before. - Adrian, please. - Walker Browning? - Toby! Toby, quiet! I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, San Francisco Police Department. This is Lieutenant Disher, Adrian Monk, Sharona Fleming. - What's goin' on? - May we come in, Mr. Browning? - What if I say no? - Don't say no. Toby, no. Stay. Quiet. - Excuse me. Is that dog dangerous? - Not to me. Mr. Browning, you worked for Springbook Electronics in Palo Alto? Not anymore. I got laid off in October. And you worked for their global satellite division, though? Uh, that's right. Can I ask what this is all about? Whoa. Hey. Is that 73? Uh, yes, it is. Please don't don't touch it. / I won't. Must have been quite a day for you, huh, catching that ball? Yeah. / That's a piece of history right there. Yeah. I wasn't even planning on going to the ballpark that day. Friend of mine had an extra ticket. It's funny, huh? Just Your whole life can change. - Just like that. - Just like that. I understand you've been in touch with an auction house in New York. - You sellin' the ball? - That's right. Yeah. Toby and I are having a little bit of a cash flow problem, so I figure the 500 grand could come in handy. Five hund No. That ball's worth, like, three million dollars. - Ah, nah. - What would happen, I wonder, if Scott Gregorio broke Darryl Grant's record. - I don't know. - I'll tell you what would happen. That three million dollar baseball would suddenly be worth roughly nothing. Yeah, but it doesn't matter, 'cause, uh Well, the slump Gregorio's in, he's not gonna be breakin' any records. You made sure of that, didn't you, Walker? when you murdered the woman he loved. Catching that ball must have been the best day of your life. A few weeks ago, you decided to sell it, but you discovered there were no buyers Because the record was about to be broken. So you panicked. You had to protect your investment. You went after Gregorio outside the stadium. You were trying to break a leg or an arm or anything to keep him out of the lineup. But that didn't work. After that, he was surrounded by bodyguards 24/7. You knew you'd never have another chance. But he was vulnerable in another way. He was in love with Lawrence Hammond's wife, and you knew it. Okay, has that dog been fed recently? Hammond the millionaire? This is insane. You knew Hammond's schedule. The board of directors meeting was well publicized. The night before, you broke into his garage and replaced his global positioning disk with one you programmed yourself. Hammond followed the directions, and all you had to do was wait. And all because you wanted to sell a baseball. No, no. No. You can't prove any of this. Here's a little tip for you, Walker. Next time you wipe down a stolen car, make sure that you get the adjustment bar under the driver's side seat, because we lifted a thumbprint, and I'm betting it's yours. - Toby! Achtung.! - I'm done, right? - I think I'm done. Am I done? - Stop. Stop. Monk, stop! - I'm just gonna leave. - Get it! - Here we go. - Toby. Good dog. Good boy. Good boy. Give me the ball. Ball! - Toby, give the ball to the captain. - Give me the ball. Good boy, Toby. Toby Toby, release! - Okay. Just give me the ball. - Monk? Toby, sit. Uh, I've never been good with animals. Go! Go! Fetch! Get the ball! Get the ball! / Toby? Toby, heel. Toby, freeze. Heel! Heel! Heel! Get the dog! Scott, you were on pace to break the all-time home run record. You fell three short. Are you disappointed? Of course I am. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't. Do you have any comment about the arrest of Walker Browning? According to the district attorney's office, you were the reason he killed Mr. And Mrs. Hammond. Please. That's my private life. I'd like to keep it that way. But I would like to say I met a man recently. He's become a good friend. He reminded me there are a lot more important things in life than baseball. What matters most are the people you love. Being true to them or their memory that's the real ball game. My friend isn't giving up on that, and neither am I. I'll see you all in spring training. I wish you were at the game yesterday. Benjy hit two singles and a double. - I'm so proud of him. - You should be. Next time, he's gonna bat cleanup. Sounds like something you would do. Cleanup. Get it? Yeah, I get it. Is that Browning's dog? I think that's the baseball. Oh, my God. Toby! Toby! Drop the ball. Drop it. Oh God. - It's all chewed up. - Ohh. - It's a pretty expensive chew toy. - It sure is. Well, it's kind of fitting, though, don't you think? What? / Nobody ends up with the money. A dog chews it all up. This dog just chewed up three million dollars, and I can't even afford a tank of gas. So you're holding, what, about $20,000 right there. You could put three, four tanks of premium in your car with that. You know what? Consider that a Christmas bonus. Like you would ever give me a Christmas bonus. I want you to go out and buy yourself something pretty. Yeah. Right. Don't save it. You don't have to save the money."
"Excuse me, sir. There's no smoking. - We are outside. - It's our policy. I don't make the rules. Then change your policy. It doesn't make any sense. - We're outside, for God's sake. - Sergei, what are you trying to prove? I'm not trying to prove anything. I'm just trying to enjoy a cigarette. Sir, if you don't put that out, I'm going to call the police. Fine. I'm putting it out. There. Are you happy? Are you happy? Is everybody happy? This is how it started in Nazi Germany, you know? Call 911.! - Oh, my God.! He's got a gun.! - What are you doing?

Man, we really lucked out. - That's Adrian Monk. - Who? He's the best crime scene investigator in the department. We studied all his cases at the academy. Huh. Really? Never heard of him. Oh, I can't believe he's here. It's like meeting Mick Jagger. - Oh, that's Sharona, his nurse. - He has a nurse? When his wife was killed, he didn't leave the house for, like, three and a half years until he met her. Now he can't do anything without her. She's pretty hot, huh? Oh, you think so? Hey, maybe they're together. No. Monk's not with anyone. He's still hung up on his late wife. That's the one case he can't solve. Look at him. Adrian Monk.! Oh, he's the man! - Hey, there. What's your name, son? - Myers. Officer Myers, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the area. - Me? What did I do? - Nothing. It's your socks. They don't match. My socks? Wha I lost one, sir, so I They're pretty close, sir Look, I couldn't care less about your socks. It's Monk. You're distracting him. He can't concentrate. - What's taking so long? - Maybe next time. / Oh. Okeydokey. Bad man all gone. He's directing traffic on Ridgewood Avenue. - Did he understand? - No, he didn't understand. I've known you a long time, Adrian, and I don't understand. - Just focus on the work now. - Okay. All right. 12:30. Place is packed. Everybody's having a good time. The perpetrator comes down the fire escape and leaps down. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He leaps down? Yes, leaps down. Now, the maitre d' is trying to call 911 on his cell phone. Comes to confront the perp. The perp does a spin move - Hits the phone out of the maitre d's hand. - Really? At this point, pulls a gun, fires one round right through the guy's heart, kill shot. From here? What is that? Thirty feet? Thirty-four. I know. That's a hell of a shot. Look at this. / We pulled that slug out of the planter box. - What did he use, a cannon? - It's a. 454 from a Ruger Casull. - They use it on safaris to stop elephants. - Elephants? And who was the victim? Uh, his name is Sergei Cluvarias. They're running it now. Table's set for two. Who was his date? Some broad. She ran off. We'll have a sketch soon. Uh-huh. - Where is the sugar? - Sugar? Sugar cubes. This bowl's empty. All the other bowls are full. - Right. What's that mean? - I don't know. What about the cashier? No. Showed zero interest. This wasn't about money. Or it was, and he got scared away. - What's that? - Wood shavings. - Wood shavings? - Sawdust? - Randy - What happened next? Well, the getaway. Which is why you're here. I thought this might be right up your alley. - No pun intended. - What pun is that? Because of the alley. Shecky, can I continue? All right. For once, the witnesses are all on the same page. They all saw the perp jump to this table and then leaped up to this bar and did a somersault, and then over the valet, runs down the street and makes a left turn down the alley. - Is there a circus in town? - Circus? Circus That makes a lot of sense. - Sir? - Yeah. We just got a positive on the victim. He's the master of ceremony at the Dratch and Denby Traveling Circus. - Master of ceremony? - Yeah, the ringmaster. - At the circus? - Circus. / Circus. We got a winner.! Dratch and Denby Circus. Founded in 1947. They do 400 shows a year in 65 different towns. Cool. Payroll: 240 people. Yeah, that's using the term ""people"" very loosely. / Ooh! - You okay? - I'm not really in my comfort zone here. Oh, that's hot.! - You have a comfort zone? - Yes, I have a comfort zone. - I've never seen a comfort zone. - It's not very big. It's, uh It's kind of small. I- I don't have a comfort zone. - Where do we start? - Well, we follow the gun. There's a Ruger Casull handgun registered to an employee here. Oh, yeah. His name's Nikolai Petroff. He's, uh, one of the animal trainers. You go on ahead. We're gonna poke around on our own. All right. Meet you back here in a bit. Stay out of trouble. Randy Excuse me! Uh, can you toss me one of those? Go ahead. It's okay. Just throw it. Yep. Just go ahead and throw it. I got it. And, throw it. - Throw it. - Throw the ball. He says to throw it. - Throw it. Now! - Oh! - Let's go. - Sorry. - So what's the plan? - We find the stables. - Why the stables? - Missing sugar cubes. Very good. Hi. Hi, I'm I'm Adrian Monk. And, uh, this is Sharona Fleming. - It's a beautiful horse. - She's a Percheron, one of the strongest horses in the world. What are you doing? What are you Don't Don't touch the horse. Why not? / People sit on that. Sweaty circus people. No offense. You want a wipe? - Will it make you happy? - No. Take a wipe. - What is your name? - Ariana Dakkar. Miss Dakkar, we're investigating the death of Sergei Cluvarias. Why talk to me? You were with him, last night, weren't you, at the cafe when he was killed? - Who told you that? - No one told me. You shouldn't have taken all the sugar cubes from the table. I shouldn't have run away. I know. But I was scared. I was sure she was going to kill me too. / ""She""? You think the killer was a woman? I don't think anything. I know exactly who it was. I know she was crazy, but I never thought she would try something in public. - Who? - Natasia Lovara. She calls herself the Queen of the Sky. - An acrobat? - Sergei's ex-wife. Jealous bitch. She couldn't stand the thought of him having a life. If she's miserable, everybody else has to be miserable. She tried to kill him before, six months ago. But there wasn't enough evidence to indict her. If you knew who did it, why didn't you go to the police? She was afraid. You're not a citizen yet, but you're about to take your naturalization test. She was afraid to draw attention to herself. - How did you know that? - That pamphlet in your bag. You're studying the U.S. Constitution, something no citizen would ever do. Good luck, by the way. - Thank you, Mr. Monk. - Thank you. We'll be in touch. - Nikolai Petroff? - Who's asking? This shiny little piece of metal's asking. - Are you Nikolai Petroff? - Are you trying to scare me? Huh? This pussycat weighs a couple hundred pounds. It could rip me apart in a heartbeat. I ain't scared of her. You think I'm scared of you? Excuse me. You may not be scared of the lieutenant, but you've got plenty of reason to be scared of me. 'Cause I got a little cage like that downtown. It's not much bigger than that, actually. It's not a whole lot friendlier. And if you obstruct my investigation, sir, for one moment further, you're gonna spend some time in it. - What's your name? - Yeah, okay. I'm Nikolai Petroff. Can we make this fast? I have a show in 30 minutes. You're not gonna cancel the show after what happened? Most people around here are celebrating. Really? I take it Sergei wasn't very well liked. / Not by me. Well, it's no secret. You're gonna find out anyway. Until last week, I was with Ariana. - The woman he was with last night. - To hell with both of them. - What is it you do around here? - I'm a wrangler. Anton the Great goes into the cage. I watch his back. You watch his back? So you've got a gun in case there's a problem? / That's right. - And that gun's a. 454 Ruger Casull? - That's right. Could we see it, please? - What happened? - You don't know? I swear to God, I checked it last night. Sir, sir. Just step back, please. - Where is it? - I was hoping you could tell me. Phone it in. Get S.I.D. Down here right away. You, sir, are going to have to find somebody else to feed your kitty cat. You're coming with me. There you are. - Are you okay? - Fine. I turned around, and you weren't there. I like it when I turn around, and you're there. I'm-I'm sorry. I just I don't know. It's okay. Let's go. I think we should talk to Natasia, the ex-wife. I've got a good feeling about her. I can't help but notice you're not moving. Are you blind? What kind of detective are you? Can't you see that I'm upset? You said you were fine. - Impossible. - What? What's going on? - You promise you won't laugh? - I never laugh. - I'm scared of elephants. - Elephants? When I was seven, I went to the zoo. I saw a baby girl fall into the elephant pit. - And she was hurt? - No, she was fine. They got her out. But it scared me to death. And now, ever since then, whenever I see an elephant, I- I-I freak out, and I start shaking. - Can't help it. I hate 'em. - Oh, brother. - What's that supposed to mean? - Oh, come on, Sharona. You're not a kid anymore. You just suck it up. We're on a job here. I need you now. - What did you just say? - I said, I need you. No, no, no, no, no. Before that. Did you just tell me to suck it up? - No. - You know, I can't believe you, Adrian! You have thousands of phobias and quirks that I have to deal with every single day, and I am always there for you! Aren't I? Answer the question! Yes or no? - Yeah. - Right! I am. And now I have just one tiny, little problem, and you have the nerve to tell me to suck it up? Don't you have any compassion? You're the most selfish, inconsiderate man I have ever met. - Great. Now I'm upset. - Oh! - Miss Lovara? - Come in. I'm Adrian Monk. This is my assistant, Sharona. She'll say hello later. I'm We're I'm investigating the murder of your ex-husband. Of course. Whatever I can do. Wipe. Suck it up. Okay. Anyway, sorry to hear about Mr. Cluvarias. If you are sorry, you didn't know him. I understand it was not an amicable separation. Sergei was a terrible husband. And a terrible ex-husband. But he's an excellent late husband. No. It was not, as you say, amicable. It would be foolish of me to pretend otherwise. Everyone here knows how I felt. I should warn you, ma'am. Anything you say can be used as evidence against you. - Are you taking notes? - No. - Is this you? - Da. And, uh And you're also a sharpshooter? - Mm-hmm. - Where were you last night, Miss Lovara? I was here, alone. I was reading. Tolstoy. Uh-huh. This book? The spine hasn't been cracked. No bookmark. No pages folded over. How do you know where you stop? I remember where I stopped. Could you excuse us? - Get away from me. - Come on. Call the captain. Tell him to meet us here. She's the guy. Motive. No alibi. And she already tried to kill him once. Mr. Monk. If you would like me to come with you, all you have to do is ask. If you wouldn't mind. Not at all. If you wouldn't mind getting the door. A leopard and panther wrangler? Yep. He works with the leopards and the panthers, and he's got a. 454 Ruger Casull handgun, which he says he can't find. He had the hots for the horse trainer the vic was seeing. And get this He's a trapeze artist wannabe. He's been practicing. They say he's pretty good. And that's how we spell ""primary suspect. "" Hmm. He's left-handed. Well, yeah. He works in the circus. What's that supposed to mean? They're freaks. They're all ambidextrous. / Says who? Circus people are ambidextrous. I read that somewhere. I like the ex-wife. You should have seen her. She's cold as ice. Cold as ice with a broken foot. She's got a bad temper. A bad temper with a broken foot. You keep coming back to the foot. Monk, the killer did a somersault and then ran away in front of witnesses. That's precisely why I think it's her. Why else would the killer jump around like that in front of witnesses? There's only one reason to prove prove that she could. Suck it up. - Are you guys all right? - Yeah, we're fine. - Fine. - Okay. As I was saying, she has a broken foot. It's in a cast. We don't know if it's really broken. We haven't exactly been sleeping here, Monk. - Lieutenant? - Her story checks out. She broke her left foot two weeks ago in Kansas City. She, uh, always ended the show with something she called the triple tailspin. You know, it's a specialty move. Anyway, she, uh, missed the bar or something and fell 25 feet in front of 750 pretty freaked-out people. She missed the net? She never used a net. - She go to the hospital? - No. She's a Romany Gypsy. They don't believe in doctors. She set the bone herself. So she never saw a doctor. Which means a doctor never saw her. - Captain! - All right, Monk. Lieutenant, see if our Queen of the Sky will consent to an X-ray. - Fine. - Thank you. You're welcome. You want to finish it? You know, when Karen and I were having trouble last year, we went to a marriage counselor guy named Mosely. Decent guy. He didn't help us much, but I'm sure Karen has the number if you'd like We're not married. And if we ever get married, shoot me. You know who you should never marry? The Elephant Man. I'd marry the Elephant Man before I'd marry you! ""S.I.U."" Know what that means? ""S.I.U"" Yes, I know what it means. - Here it is. - Ah! - So, is it really broken? - No, it's not broken. Hah! It's shattered completely. The radiograph indicates multiple fractures of the tarsal and metatarsal bones - consistent with a crush-type injury. - Ooh. There are also fractures along the tibia and fibula at the medial and lateral malleoli. Ow. What happened to her? She fell 25 feet from a trapeze. - That would do it. - Doctor, let me ask you something. Somebody with an injury like this could they do a somersault and run away? That's impossible. The pain would kill her. She couldn't even hobble away. What if she took pills? Painkillers? Well, we took a blood test before the X-ray. Came up negative. - No drugs, no painkillers. She's clean. - Thank you. What are you doing? You don't smoke. Do now. This is a hospital, for God's sake. You can't smoke in here. So? Suck it up. Okay. I'll suck it up. You two stay here. I'll bring the car around. No, I'm going with you. Mr. Monk. Do you mind? I can't open it myself. Can't you? You saw the X-rays. Do you have any other questions? Just one. How did you do it? I like you, Mr. Monk. You appear to be a careful and cautious man. But inside, in your mind, you're like me. You are up there working without a net, risking everything. It is the only way to live. Am I right? Steady. Steady. No, no. All right. Natasia, over here. - Heinz. - Uh, thank you. Thank you for coming. What did you want to see me about? Did your girlfriend forget the routine? No. I just wanted you to know I got your back. Don't worry. I would never tell anyone. Tell them about what, Heinz? You know, about how you did it. How I did what? Well, uh, my trailer is over there. A couple nights ago, I couldn't sleep. I looked out of the window, and, uh, I saw you. Come on. Don't make me say it. Look, I've always thought you were a smart woman, Natasia. Very smart, very pretty. What do you want? Money? Money? What would I do with money? No, I I just want to spend time with you. I I like you. Heinz, but I like you too. Oh Mm-hmm. I think we've got a lot to talk about. - Maybe I can buy you a drink? - I would like that. - Tomorrow, after the matinee. - I'll come to your tent. No, no, no, no. Better I meet you here. - There's something I want to show you. - Good. Good. Hello? / It's me, Adrian. Adrian Monk, y-your boss. - I know. What do you want? - I'm at the circus. I thought that you were gonna meet me here. I told you I was taking the day off. - Are allowed to do that? - No, so fire me. Please. It'll be my birthday present. - Got your flowers. - Oh, good. Good. - The card was blank. - I know. I I didn't know what to say, so I just I just left it blank. - How did you know they were from me? - All the same height. And all the flowers have the exact same number of petals on 'em. Yeah, look, uh Sharona, I-I just wanted to say I'm I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. That's not good enough. - I'm very, very, very, very sorry - You just don't get it. Yes, I do. No, I I don't. It's not that easy. You can't just apologize. You have to really think about how you treat me, Adrian. You really hurt me and you have to try to understand Wait. There she is. I gotta go. Be careful. Please don't don't do that. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Don't worry about them. They know how to fall. That's the first thing we learn. You brought your camera, Mr. Monk. Oh, sure. I love it here. It's so upbeat. You hate it here. You think I can walk. - You're trying to catch me. - You're right. I was. You saw the X-rays, Mr. Monk. How can I walk on this? I'm curious. What is your theory? Some people have a very high threshold for pain. They can take it. Nice try. But any doctor will tell you it's impossible. Besides, I was married to Sergei for 15 years. It's enough pain for a lifetime. You fell two weeks ago, is that right? - Mmm. Your point? - Your cast. Looks Looks like new. No scuff marks. It's not even discolored. Again, nice try. My old one was itching. Ah. / So I put a new one on four days ago. The show is about to begin, you are missing it. You're wrong, Natasia. I'm not missing a thing. The lights are coming on in the big top.! Hurry up, folks.! Take your seats.! - So, how-how's the case coming? - Good. Not good. Bad. I have a suspect. She doesn't even deny she did it. - But I can't prove a thing. - Hmm. - Well, how-how's that make you feel? - Angry. Okay, so what do you do when you feel angry? I get mad. Adrian, you've had tough cases before. You usually don't get this rattled. What's going on with you and Sharona? She's still not talking to me. She says I don't get it. - Well, I think maybe she's right. - What don't I get? I don't understand. - I can't tell you that. - You mean, you know, but you won't tell me? Adrian, you're gonna have to figure this one out for yourself. I'm sorry. Uh I want to make sure I understand this. I have a problem. You know the answer. - That's right. - I'm paying you. - That's right. - But you won't tell me. That's right. Adrian, the answer is inside you. No, Doctor. The answer is inside you. If you told me, I would hear it, and then the answer would be inside me! - What do you got? - Bingo. What exactly does ""bingo"" mean, Randy? We got the murder weapon - Well, that's been fired recently. - Any prints? Nope. It's been oiled down. How'd it get in there? It's the backup cannon. Cannonball guy says anybody could have dropped it in. - They haven't used it in a week. - Backup cannon? Good Lord. Get that down to Ballistics. Put it on the fast track. Excuse me. Are you guys about done? Sir, could you please step back? This is official police business. Maybe I should come to your office and root through your stuff. How'd you like that? Huh? I hate that cannonball. Benjy, bring your bike around back.! How many times do I have to tell you? God - Adrian. - Hello. It's me, Adrian. I know. I'm looking right at you. Listen, Sharona. Uh, I've been thinking about it. You know, ""it""? And, uh, I just want to say ""About your fear of elephants I was way out of line. ""I shouldn't have belittled you just because you were being irrational. "" Is that it? Uh-oh. My fear is irrational? As opposed to to what your fears? Well, the stuff I'm afraid of is, you know, based on fact. - It is? - Like germs. Like, uh, crooked paintings? And-And sidewalk cracks? And-And food touching? - And the wind? - Hey, the wind can kill. - Hurricane Edna? - Milk? At least they're things people actually encounter. You have to make an appointment to see an elephant. You have to sign up for a safari or something. You don't get it, and you never will. - I'm gonna go play some video games. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't forget about your bike. If you don't do it, your mom's gonna have to do it. - Just give her a break. - Okay. - What did you say? - Noth Nothing. No. No, no, no. Don't be scared. It was good. You said, ""Let's give her a break. "" That was empathy. That means you're thinking about how I felt. I think you're getting it now. I am. So, we're back to where we were. No. But it's a start. Burundi! Foot. Steady, steady. No, no. No, no. Ungawa.! Ungawa.! Back. Dede, bend down. That's a good girl. Good girl. Good. - Why are you dragging me back here? - Well, you'll see. Have a little faith, okay? Oh, no, no. Adrian, are you crazy? What are you doing? / Come on. All right. Look, I spoke to the trainer earlier. I told him about your problem. And we just thought that if you met the elephant, if you got to know her, maybe you could get over your fear. Thank you, but I can't. I can't and I won't. I'm not doing this. - Mr. Monk. /- Yeah. - Hi, hi. Is this your friend? Yes. This is Sharona Fleming. This is Edgar Heinz. - Hi. /- Hi. - Right. And this is Dede. There's There's nothing to be afraid of, Miss Fleming. Nothing. Look. See? I'm petting her. Me. I'm petting her. / Elephants are very passive. They're like children. Dede wouldn't hurt a fly. Really. Now you pet her. / I can't believe you did this. I can't believe Come on. You don't You don't want to end up like me. If If I can do it, anybody can do it. Come on. Come on. There you go. Just Just like I did. Go ahead. G-Go ahead. - Come on. - Oh, she likes you. She likes you. / Uh, we're just about to rehearse a couple of tricks. - Would you like to watch? - Sure. Sure. I really don't want to do this. I don't want to / Yeah. Good. Good. Dede, back. Back. - Ungawa.! - I don't want to do this. Burundi! Ungawa.! And now, for the grand finale! Oh, God. / Come on, now. Don't worry. He knows what he's doing. Dede / Burundi.! Ungawa.! Dede, ungawa. Oh, my God! Ooh. Here you go. Do you want to sleep? I can't. Every time I close my eyes, I see it again. I - Oh, it was so horrible. - It's okay. I'm right here. I'll take care of you. Ah, one hot cocoa coming up. Here. I'm gonna put on some music for you. - Thank you, Adrian. - Oh. You kidding? It's the least I could do. You've been there for me every day. And I spoke to that woman from animal control. She said it was just a freak accident. The odds against it were a thousand to one. I really don't want to talk about it. Good idea. Sorry. Is, uh Is this a dollop? What? / A dollop. It says, ""Add one dollop of whipped cream. "" I don't know. I think a dollop's, like, a teaspoon. Yeah, it doesn't say ""teaspoon. "" It says ""dollop. "" It doesn't matter. It doesn't have to be exact. I- I-It's like a pinch. How many pinches to a dollop? - I don't know. - Well, maybe it's more like a schmear. I think it's three pinches to a schmear. Or, uh Ah, forget it. Forget it! Let's make something else. What? You're throwing it out? Nobody can make this cocoa. The recipe's impossible. Fine. I'll do it. Yeah, maybe you should do it. You mind if I sit down? What do you want in your cocoa? Do you have any of those little marshmallows? - How many? Ten? - Eight. I'll have eight. - Eight's good. Make it eight. - Here. One / There's eight. You don't have to count. Four, five, six - What? - A thousand to one? What's a thousand to one? The odds of an elephant doing that. - What? - It wasn't an accident. Energy! Phillipe, you're dragging your feet! Point your toes! - Let's do it again! - Excuse me. - Natasia Lovara? - Da. I need to ask you one or two questions. If this is about my ex-husband, you're wasting your time. This isn't only about Sergei, ma'am. You're also the suspect in the murder of Edgar Heinz, the elephant trainer. Don't be ridiculous. - That was an accident. Tragic. - No. It was homicide, premeditated, and we have the murder weapon right here. Lieutenant! You waited for Mr. Heinz to put his head under Dede's foot. / What? And then you gave the command for the elephant to stomp. She is well trained, weighs over four tons. A perfect killing machine. Adrian, Adrian. I got to go. Just tell me what happened. Tell me what But I was nowhere near the pen when it happened. That's true. You weren't there. You gave the command from across the midway over a walkie-talkie. Oh. / Lieutenant, could you check behind the elephant's ear? Got it. / Careful with that, Randy. We need the prints. Why kill Edgar Heinz? Well, you had no choice. He knew that you had murdered your ex-husband that Monday night. Mr. Monk, you are demented. Nevertheless, you did it. Excuse me. I'm I'm summing up the case here. The killer ran away. My foot is broken. You saw the X-ray. All week I've been asking the wrong question. I've been asking if your foot was broken. I should have been asking when your foot was broken. It's true You fell during a show two weeks ago. But it wasn't an accident. You said it yourself the first thing you learn is how to fall. I'm guessing it was one of the best performances of your life, Natasia. And your fear of hospitals came in quite handy. There was no X-ray. Everyone just accepted the fact that your foot was broken. - What is your problem? - Hey, clown.! Take a walk. The night of the murder, you slipped out of your cast and followed your ex-husband and his girlfriend. You waited until they were in a crowded restaurant. You needed witnesses to see you running. That was the key to your plan. I wasn't there, but I heard you were dazzling. You really are the Queen of the Sky. An interesting theory, Mr. Monk. Perhaps you'd like to X-ray my foot again. No need for that. I'm quite sure it really is broken. - Good. - Now. You knew you'd be a suspect, and you knew that we'd want an X-ray. It's not an easy thing to do breaking your own foot. After the murder, you came back here. It was late. Everyone was sleeping. Dede, ungawa.! Everyone except Dede's trainer. His trailer was right there. He probably woke up and looked outside. Can't somebody do something about this clown? Look, I'm a police officer. Knock it off. Go ahead. Like Tolstoy, you know how to tell a clever story. But you need proof. The elephant isn't talking. Anyone could have put that radio thing in her ear. Randy, take that down to the laboratory straightaway. I don't think they'll find any prints. She's too smart. I'm sure she wiped it down. Then again, that walkie looks brand new. Which means she had to put batteries in it. You did remember to wipe your prints off the batteries, didn't you, Natasia? - Wocka wocka! - All right. That's it, freak! - You're under arrest. - For what? For impersonating an officer! Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Get her! Get her! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Don't move! Go, go! batteries! Are you all right? You must have been so frightened. See, I'm empathizing with you. I'm putting myself in your shoes. Will you shut up? Okay, now that's you getting annoyed at me because I won't shut up. So I'm That's me being compassionate and sensitive. - I I feel your pain. - Oh, God. - I'm feeling your pain. - I've created a monster. I hear that. I'm hearing what you're saying. See, Mom? I told you she was friendly. - How do you feel? - Good. I think I'm over it. Maybe there's hope for you. - Ugh! - What's wrong? I think I stepped in something. - Where? - It's right here. - I don't see anything. - I definitely stepped in something. - I have to go home. - We just got here. - I want to go home. - Just suck it up. I don't think it's my turn to suck it up. I think it's your turn to suck it up. Hey, why don't you both suck it up? Excuse me. Do you kiss your mom with that mouth? - No. - You should. Come here. - I love you, Mom. - I love you too."
"Excuse me, sir. I have an appointment with Mr. Miles Holling. No, I have an appointment. But you don't seem to understand. - All right. Go ahead. - Thank you so much. I don't care who you are. No one gets in without a pass. You don't understand! I was promised I could / Call your office. Clear. Gin. - What are you doin' this weekend? - Same as you. Workin' here. What? / Didn't you hear? We all have to work. They just posted it. Oh, why? / You know why. It's the old man's birthday. Oh, and don't you forget your I.D. Or they will not let you in. So some geezer has a birthday, and my whole weekend's shot. Miles Holling is not just another geezer. We are talking about the oldest man in the world here. It's big news! Didn't you see all those reporters out there? Well, it's not big news to me. I made plans. My whole family's coming over. Well, maybe you'll get lucky and he won't wake up. Oh! Wouldn't that be great. Who are you? You're not George. Where's George? Fella? You better get outta here. What the hell are you doing? Help! Turn me loose!

Look. Have you considered taking a different road home? You have a nice day too. Captain? / Lieutenant, why am I fielding calls about zoning regulations? Aren't you supposed to be protecting the quarterback? - Your wife's here. - Okay. Okay. Uh, look, I need a few minutes. Could you stall her? / What should I do? - Uh, talk to her. - About what? - I mean, what does she like to talk about? - How I ruined her life. Okay. Cigars. He'll just be a minute. He's on a call. Hmm. So, uh, you're workin' on a new script? I make documentary films, Lieutenant. I don't use scripts. - The world is my script. - Neat. Big special crystal. And the magic dream catcher. There we go. I want to show you something. They just issued these. It's a Beretta. Nine-millimeter Centurion. It holds 15 in the mag, one in the chamber. Mm. You know how I feel about guns. I know you have strong feelings. I just can't remember what they are. I'm against them, Lieutenant. My husband doesn't carry a weapon. I don't know why you need to. Sh - What's he doing in there? - He'll just be one more minute. And the waterfall. This is the holster. It's calfskin. It's nice. - Water. - I'm going in. Yes, ma'am. Let me just get the door for you. Okay. Here we go. That's it. Hi. - Hi. - Come on in. Hi. What a nice surprise. Oh! The waterfall. How do you like it? It's great. I love it. - Thank you, again. - Is it calming you down? / Yes. - Is that coffee? - Yes. Yes, it is. It's a coffeefall. - H-How was, uh, art therapy? - Art therapy is on Wednesday. Yes, I knew that. U- Uh How is, uh / Leland? - Do you remember Miles Holling? - Yes. - No. - The oldest man in the world? I made a film about him? It won Honorable Mention at the Monterey Festival? Of course, you wouldn't remember. You didn't go! Anyway. He died last night. Oh, honey. I'm sorry. Is that why you're here? In a way. You see, I think he was murdered. Okay. / Now, I know it sounds crazy, but I went to the nursing home this morning to wish him a happy birthday, and - they had just found him. - Uh-huh? The coroner was there. There was something wrong. - Uh-huh? - You see, they said he died in bed, but Leland, he never used the bed. He slept in a chair. He told me he was afraid that if he ever laid down, he would never get up again. - Well, Karen - Also, they found a book on his chest. Like he'd been reading. But he couldn't read, because he was nearly blind. So. I told the head nurse to lock down that room. - You what? - So that you can investigate. Karen, you can't do that. Wh-What are you, a homicide detective? I mean How old was this guy? People that old, they die! It's It's like their job. Be reasonable. Who would kill the oldest man in the world? - I mean, why would they bother? - It's a hunch. - You get hunches all the time. - Yeah, well, that's my job, I'm a professional. - So you're not going to investigate? - Look, honey. I Once again, I'm asking too much. Is that it? I- I don't tell you how to make your little movies. They're documentaries, Leland. Is this what you meant when you told Dr. Mosely you were going to be more supportive? You promised. You swore you were going to try! All right, look. I'll call Monk. He's the best detective I know. And if Monk thinks there's been foul play, I'll look into it. - Promise? - Yes. I promise. Yes, honey. We're at the nursing home. Monk.! - I really appreciate this. - It's no problem. Glad to do it. Yes. Monk's here. Look. If you don't believe me, here. Here's Sharona. Hey, Karen. How are ya doin'? - The room hasn't been touched? - No, sir. And you were the last nurse to see him? / Yes, sir. I was. Was the walker right here? / Yes. Yeah? - How tall would you say he was? - Um, about 5 foot 1. - Oh, no. - Okay, now. He's looking around the bed. Looking at the pillowcase Did you lower those shades? No, Mr. Holling never liked them down. - Give me the phone - What? Okay, wait, wait. Hold on. Here's your husband. Honey? Okay, look. The next voice you hear is going to be Adrian Monk's, okay? And whatever he says, we're going to accept it, right? No questions asked. Okay. Adrian Monk. - Have you studied the room? - Yes, I have. Have you formed an opinion about the cause of Miles Holling's death? - Yes, I have. - And what is your opinion, Adrian Monk? He was murdered. - He was murdered, Karen. - I knew it! The walker is in the middle of the room. H- How could Mr. Holling have made it to the bed? Plus, there's no way a man of his height could have reached over the dresser to pull down those shades. Sweetheart, I'm gonna strangle Monk, and then I'll call you right back. Welcome to Malden. - How can I help you? - Mr. Mayor. - The reason I - Excuse me. I'm s I'm sorry. Uh, could we switch chairs? It's the tassels. Uh, my chair has tassels. A lot of tassels here. Will you stop staying ""tassels""? Dennis Gammill, my deputy mayor, has just been filling me in. Are you, uh, seriously asking us to exhume Miles Holling? - We'd like them to do an autopsy. - Mr. Mayor. Um, I- I wouldn't be here, if uh Well, if some of us didn't feel that there was a strong case for probable cause. / Excuse me. What? / I'm so sorry. Could you switch with Sharona? Why? / Then she'd be next to me. - And then - That's fine, Monk. - He's sorry. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Why do you do this? Just sit down! Now, Mr. Mayor, the letter that I wrote Which, by the way, Mr. Mayor, is not a court order. It's an unofficial request. That's true. It's an unofficial request. We've been talking to the coroner's office for three days now, - And they won't issue us a subpoena. - They said it was up to you. In other words, you can say ""No. "" And I strongly suggest that you do. Steve, if-if they're wrong about this, when the next election rolls around, you're gonna be a punch line around here. Mr. Mayor. I'd consider it a personal favor. My wife, as you know, knew Mr. Holling, and she grew very fond of him - during the course of the documentary - Excuse me. I am I'm so sorry. This one's so slippery. You know / Why don't you Just stand up just for a minute. Stand up. It's a tough call. Captain, I'm gonna grant your request. - Thank you. - Just one favor. Don't be wrong. Captain? / Yeah? We're 'bout finished. - If you want to accompany the body - Be there in a minute. I remember that case. It was a hit-and-run, right? Yeah. Seventeen years old. - He'd been accepted to Princeton. - I dug that hole. I'll never forget it. The ground was frozen solid. It was like the Earth didn't want him. - Did they ever catch the son of a bitch? - No, I never did. It was your case? / Still is. Still is. Captain. You all right? Miles Holling was murdered. He was suffocated. It's on the ""A"" list. I made you a copy of the medical examiner's report. Karen kicked you out. - How did you know that? - You didn't eat dinner at home. - A receipt here from Happy Burger. - Yeah. We're having some problems. I'm gonna crash down the street at the Red Roof Inn again. Why don't you stay here? Look, you were there for me. When I went through my rough patch, remember? / Yeah. Yeah, I remember your rough patch. It lasted three and a half years. I wouldn't mind the company. Are you sure? It's the least I can do. - I insist. - All right. Thanks. - Uh, come help me with my bags. - Bags? You have more than one? Yeah, I got a suit bag, and a few things in the car. Shouldn't be more than a few weeks. It'll be fun. We'll be roommates. I always have a glass of milk before bed. But that's not Shut up. Hell of a thing, the oldest man in the world. Randy had a theory. He thinks maybe the second oldest man in the world did it, to claim the title. - He actually looked into it. - How did the killer get in? There's only one entrance. You need a valid I.D. To get in. Maybe somebody on staff? Psycho nurse? Did the old man have any money? Oh, yeah. There was a small insurance policy, under ten grand. What are you doing, Monk? I have a coaster. I always put another one underneath. It's, uh It's like a backup. - Thank you. - Who was the beneficiary? The old man's son, Hiram Holling. - We're gonna talk to him tomorrow. - So, what do you think? Well, why ask me? My hippie wife's a better cop than me. - Don't say that. - Look. I don't mind living in your shadow, Monk. You're a freak of nature. / Thank you. But when Karen sees things that I miss, I might as well just hang it up. Guess where I was today. I was at the Leveroni gravesite. - Do you remember that? - Oh, it was a hit and run, five years ago. Seventeen years old, valedictorian. Killed three blocks from his house. I always figured somebody would confess. Well, me too. I mean, how-how-how can somebody live with themselves, you know? I mean, you gotta tell somebody. - The urge to confess. - Yeah, it's the cop's best friend. - What are you doing? - I like it like this. It's crooked. / No. Monk. The whole house is laid out at right angles. Everything. Except this table. Do you want to tell me why? Uh-uh. Here. I found an alarm clock, Captain. You can stop calling me Captain. You might have noticed I'm out of uniform. Okay, uh Leland. Do you, Leland need anything else? No. I'm fine. Thank you. Good night. Why don't Why don't you just say 8:00? - 8:00 is too late. - But it's a nice, round number. ""Eight-oh-oh. "" Monk, how important is this to you? I mean, on a scale from one to ten? I'd say it's about an eight. Eight-oh-oh. How about 7:00? Seven-oh-oh. - 7:00 is too early. - You could use the snooze alarm. Six times. / Okay! This isn't working. I'm gonna go to the hotel. No! No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Look, just You can't go. You were there for me. I owe ya. All right? I'm gonna make this work. Okay. No problem. Okay? I'm an adult. All right? Odd number? / All right. - Good night. - No big deal. Good night. Okay. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm setting the alarm to 8:00. Eight-oh-oh. Are you happy? / Yeah. Now, I'm setting the clock Ahead seven minutes, so really, I'll be getting up at 7:53. Now we're both happy. Yeah, but / You come in here again, Monk, and I'll shoot ya. Good night. Did Leland send you? No. I swear. I didn't even tell Adrian I was coming. - You okay? - It's called Bikram Yoga. - You should try it. - Looks pretty painful. It's supposed to be. ""No pain, no gain. "" I have a different motto. ""No pain? What's the catch?"" Um, you know, I I hope you don't mind that I came over here. But Your husband is staying over at Adrian's house. And they're driving each other crazy. Well, tell Adrian Monk welcome to my world. You know, neither one of them got any sleep last night. Adrian's back at my place, taking a nap. Sharona, I don't know what you want me to say here. I mean, Leland is impossible nobody could live with him. You know, the department has counseling services. Well, we tried therapy. It lasted for, uh, three weeks. You see, Leland does not respect the process. He doesn't respect me. That's the bottom line. Karen, that is not true. He is so proud of you. He talks about you all the time! Do you know that he still has not seen my movie, the one that I made about Miles Holling, and it won ""Best Documentary Honorable Mention""? - Well, he's busy! - It's 65 minutes long. How busy could he be? Here. Would-Would you like to see it? Sure. And I promise you, he's gonna see it too. Last night midnight I get up and use the bathroom. Five minutes later, I hear him. He's in there cleaning. An hour and a half. / Geez. Kind of makes a guy self-conscious. Well, you could stay with me, sir. I have TiVo. / No. No, I couldn't leave now. I'd hurt his feelings. He thinks he owes me because I held his hand when Trudy died. That's my new, full-time job. Not hurting people's feelings. My father was 114. Now, that is old, but it is still too young Do you understand? / Yes, sir. If you find that bastard, do me one favor. I want five minutes alone with him in the room. When was the last time you saw your father? Two months. U- Unless you mean, on the TV. Oh, they used him a lot on the TV. He wrote a book! They even put it in a time capsule. - Did your father have any enemies? - No, not unless you you're talkin' about the phone calls. - Phone calls? - Yeah, they started about a few weeks ago. Somebody started callin' my daddy in the middle of the night. - At all hours.! - What did they say? ""You're a dead man. Oh, I'm gonna kill you. "" - Pull the phone records. - Oh, I do hope you find that bastard.! Now that's old, but it's still too young. You know what I mean? He was still my daddy. And I was still his baby. Captain. I'm home. Hi. - I was just cleaning up. - I'll-I'll do that. - I got it. - Please. Please. Le - I-I-I'll do it. / I got it. - No. Please. Please. / Okay. Thanks. - How was your day? - My day was good. I picked the boys up from school, - bought 'em some pizza - Oh, and how are they? - They're doin' great. Thank you. - Good. Randy and I tracked down Hiram Holling. The old man's 83-year-old baby boy. Yeah? Anything there? Apparently, Miles Holling was receiving phone calls last week. Late at night. Somebody was trying to scare him. - What's that? - Oh, new shower head. This way, we both have our own. Oh, and, uh Sharona gave me this. - Karen's movie. - Sharona says you have to watch it. / I tried. Three times. When I watch it, all I can think of is it cost 45 grand. It was either this or a cabin cruiser. Thirty-two foot, fiberglass. Thank you. Well, we talked about it, and we decided to make the movie. Yeah. The table! - What is with you and that table? - It has to be like this. - These are the phone records? - Yeah. Yeah, we traced those. They were made from a phone booth at the Amtrak station. - It's a bust. - What about these? They just sent those over Employment records from the nursing home. We got time cards and sign-in sheets. That's strange. - What is? - Well, this-this security guard. George Rowe. Look at the signatures. This is Monday, the day of the murder. / Right. These two are from last week. Yeah, that's a pretty good match. Not the handwriting. Look at Monday. - He misspelled his name. - Son of a bitch. How did I miss that? What is wrong with me? I should just quit. I wonder if Home Depot's hiring. - It's just a slump. It happens. - Not to you. I didn't leave my house for three and a half years.! The slump of the century. You know when it started? That hit and run. The Leveroni kid. That was the case. That's when I went off the tracks. After that, I was never really able to focus again. You know it? Of course you know it. You know every damn thing. Mr. Rowe, open up. It's the police. It's kinda messy in there. Coulda been a fight. - Is that ""probable cause""? - Probably. - Probably probable cause? - It's good enough for me. George Rowe? Hello? Police! Mister Rowe.! Monk, don't touch anything. This isn't our house. Jesus, did I just say ""our house""? Oh! / What, what, what? - What, what, what, what? - Snake, snake, snake, on the loose. - Snake. Over there. Snake. Snake. - All right. Okay. Okay. Easy. It's all right. / Snake on the loose. Out of the box. Out of the box. - He's on the prowl. - It's all right. Come on, buddy. There you go. There you go. He's heading uptown. He's heading uptown! - All right. Come on, guy. - Getting away. You're losing him. - Here you go, here you go. Whoa! - You're losing him! Shut it, shut it, shut it. Just shut it. Shut it. Shut, shut, shut! There. Don't soil your pants. - If you do, you're on your own. - Look at this. - What? - ""Feeding schedule: Curly, Larry, Moe. "" Clever. There's Curly. Larry, and What? What? What? / Oh. - What is wrong with you? - Where's Moe? - Who's Moe? - Moe the snake is loose. He's missing. How do you know it's Moe? It might be Curly. / Fine, it's Curly.! - Where the hell is Curly? - Maybe Curly's dead.! No, no. No, no, no. No. The feeding schedule goes up to last Friday. He's-He's-He's loose. He's somewhere in the house. Come-Come up Come on up here. It's plenty strong. I'm not getting on the table with you, Monk. - I thought you were afraid of heights. - Snakes trump heights. It goes germs, needles, milk, death, snakes, mushrooms, heights, crowds, elevators Okay, I don't need the entire list. Why don't you wait outside? Come on. - Carry me? - What? Carry me. Please! No. No. / Please. Please. - Monk, I'm not gonna carry you. - Okay. I'll stay here, I'm fine. Can I have your gun? / No. Not unless you plan on using it on yourself. / Maybe I will. Ho! I found him. / Kill it! Sh Shoot it! Kill! Shoot! Kill it! - It's not the snake. - Kill it.! Just shoot it.! Kill it.! I found George Rowe. Adrian? You're just sitting here. You're on the job. Crime scene's inside. Yeah. So's Curly. Who's Curly? / The snake! Curly or Moe We're not sure. Hey. There's your roommate. / Yeah. - How's that workin' out? - I'm not sleeping. I'm I'm all stressed out. I'm thinkin' about going to a hotel. - Why don't you? - I don't want to hurt his feelings. Hey, Monk! We got him. He was under the couch. Come on. I need you in there. I can't figure out if the perp and the victim knew each other or not. Show me the snake. / What? - The bag's empty. - No, it's not. Show me the snake. All right. The bag's empty. Come on. I need you in there. You don't need me inside. The killer was a stranger. He'd never-never been in this house before. - You can tell that from here? - He broke three panels in that door. Yeah, right. Then he reached in and he opened the lock. What does that prove? He broke three panels. He wasn't sure where the lock was. We're lookin' for a stranger. Pass it on. - Yes, sir. - What time will you be home? Huh? / What time do you think you'll be home? I don't know. / Because I was thinking of making a pot roast. But I need an approximate time. - I don't know, Monk. I'll call you. - Okay. Don't forget. - I won't forget. - That's what you said yesterday. Shut up. Good morning Sir, are you okay? He was cleaning again. Until 3:00 a. m. / Aw, Jesus. I love my wife. I have never loved her, or missed her more. What have you got? - Uh Maybe this is a bad time. - Oh, no. No, no. I need to work. It's all I have. What have you got? / All right. Here's the question. Who would murder the oldest man in the world? - I know what the question is, Randy. - Okay. Look at this. Book of World Records. Enrico Palamo. He was Italian. He collected yarn. He made the world's biggest ball of yarn. He was murdered three years ago, still unsolved. Well, maybe the world's biggest kitty cat did that. I think we might have a serial killer on our hands. - Oh, God. - Somebody is killing world record holders. One at a time. / You think we oughta warn the fat twins on the motorcycles? Or, wait-wait-wait Maybe we ought to put a 24-hour guard on the guy with the beard of bees. I can never tell when you're being sarcastic. I'm being sarcastic, Randy. Get the book outta here. Yes, sir. What are you doing? Monk! I just vacuumed that. I know. I'm trying to help out. I'm trying to do my share. I know! No problem! - Finishing up. - It's finished! The rug is clean. I know. Then what's the problem? The lines in the carpet. See? You went on a diagonal. I like to make a grid! It's no big deal. - You win. I give up. - Excuse me? You know what I'm gonna do? First thing in the morning, I'm gonna call the Vatican and I'm gonna nominate your late wife Trudy for sainthood! Because you are impossible! The lines! They're all diagonal! - I have to live here! - Forget about the rug! This is not about the rug! Do you know what you are? Do you know what you are? You're the world's best marriage counselor. You could save every marriage in California! All people have to do is live with you for two days! Two days! And they'd never complain about their spouse again. What are you What are you doing? I am going home! I am gonna beg Karen to take me back. I'm gonna beg her to take me back. I'm gonna tell her I am a different man, and I will not be lying. She won't take you back. You haven't seen her movie yet. When I am dead, my dearest, sing no sad songs for me. Plant thou no roses at my head, And if thou wilt, remember, And if thou wilt, forget. How are you feeling today, Miles? Not bad for an old bastard. Next week, I'll be 110 years old. I'm the oldest man in the world. That means I win. I don't know what I win but I win. This time capsule is a message in a bottle A big, metallic, vacuum-packed bottle for our children's children's children. Oh, I see our guest of honor is arriving. One hundred years from now, future generations will read copies of the Malden Gazette. Oh. Aw, wait. I've written a letter to future generations, and I've asked my family and staff to do the same. Why don't we drop them in now? And finally, I have asked Malden's most famous resident Where's the remote? Give it to me. Miles Holling, to write his life story. I'm going to include a copy of it. And I make you this promise: If you live another five years, and I'm still in office, we're gonna dig this baby up and add another chapter to your book. - What do you think? See you in five years? - It's a date! What are you doing? What are you doing? You're rewinding? We were almost done! What do you think? See you in five years? / It's a date. Monk, I'm gonna say something I've wanted to say for a long time. What is it? I just solved the case. Hi, hello again. The mayor will be right with you. Actually, Dennis, we came to talk to you. Oh? / On December 10, 1998, the day that they buried the time capsule, you were driving a rental car, weren't you? Mm-hmm. / I think that's strange. You driving a rental car in your own town. Oh, well, it was a special occasion. I wanted to arrive in something nice what's this about? It's about Darren Leveroni. Do you remember him? Oh. Oh, yeah. Of course I do. Your car, the one you didn't drive that day, was it a sky-blue Oldsmobile Cutlass sedan? Oh. Well, that was a long time ago. Uh, I think so. A witness saw a blue Oldsmobile leaving the scene of the hit-and-run. Now, I remember. I requested a list of registered owners from the D.M.V. That list came through your office, but your name wasn't on it. - Can you explain that, sir? - I don't know. - Oversight? Clerical error? - Where is that car today, Mr. Gammill? - It was stolen. I reported it. - Pretty convenient. A short time later you joined Alcoholics Anonymous, didn't you? I can't believe this! I can't believe it either. I can't believe I missed it. Do you have a warrant? / No. I didn't think so. You can't prove any of this, can you? I'm not sayin' another word. Here. It's my lawyer. Talk to him. - Sorry I'm late. What did I miss? - Nothing. Nothing. They were just leaving. - This isn't over. - Bye-bye. What? Hi! Excuse me. You remember us. - What the hell do you want? - Did you forget something? - Yes. I did. What happened to your wrist? - What? Looks like a snakebite. There was a snake loose when the security guard was killed. Good old Curly. / Or Moe. - It could have been Moe. - Oh, th-this is insane. F- First you accuse me of a five-year-old hit-and-run. Now, I gather, you're saying I killed some security guard. Well, make up your mind, boys, which is it? Both, actually. Mr. Mayor, uh, we We would like your permission to dig up the time capsule. - Dig up the what? - The-The time capsule that you buried five years ago. - We need to take a look inside. - Oh, Jesus. Why? What, first the old man, now the time capsule? What? Y- You plan on diggin' up the whole county? Steve, they don't have the authority. That's true. But I do. They were right about Miles Holling being murdered. I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. - Thank you. You can't keep me here. You're the primary suspect in two homicides. We can detain you briefly. What do you think you're going to prove? First, we're gonna prove that you killed George Rowe to get his security pass. - His security pass? - You needed it to get into the nursing home, - in order to kill Miles Holling. - Steve. No, no, no. Care to tell me why? Because of something you said, Mr. Mayor, five years ago. It was in Karen Stottlemeyer's movie, which which I thoroughly enjoyed, by the way. Yeah. Me too. I watched the whole thing. When you buried the capsule, you made a promise to Miles Holling. Remember? You said that if he lived another five years, that you'd dig it up again, so that he could add a final chapter to his autobiography. That's right. I did. If Miles turned 115, they would have dug it up. And in your paranoia, you couldn't risk that happening, could you? So you tried to scare the old man to death. Late night phone calls, death threats. When that didn't work, you realized you had no choice. You had to kill him. There's something in there. Something you thought no one would see for 100 years. I've written a letter to future generations, and I've asked my family and staff to do the same. Why don't we drop them in now? The mayor invited his family and staff members to add a personal note. Let's take a look at what Mr. Gammill wrote. Captain? Would you mind reading it? ""On December 2, 1998, I killed Darren Leveroni with my car. ""May God forgive me, because I will never forgive myself. Signed, Dennis Gammill. "" - The urge to confess. - It's a cop's best friend. Steve, please. How long have you known me? I don't know you at all. It was an accident! I swear! I was drinking! I don't remember hitting anybody. I woke up and the-the fender was dented and there was some blood and some hair. And I thought I hit an animal. I prayed to God I hit an animal. Lieutenant, take him away. Yes, sir. - You have the right to remain silent. - Captain. Captain! This was in there too. Did you write that? / Well. You weren't supposed to read it. At least, not for 100 years. Is it about me? What do you think? Did you really like my movie? Yeah. Two thumbs up. Though I'm not an objective critic. Because I'm insanely in love with the filmmaker. Monk. Looks like you're on your own again. - Glad to hear it. - Thank you for looking after him. And-And thank you. - You're welcome. - It was my pleasure. - No, it wasn't. - No, it wasn't. I took the liberty of packin' up your things, puttin' them in your car. Let's not do this again real soon, okay? / You got it. It's great. It's great. - Are you tired? - Mm-hmm. Come here."

There were 300 people in that theater. They all saw it, Gail. I can't tell you what they saw. I can only tell you what I did. I can tell you what they saw. They saw you pick up a five-inch kitchen knife and plunge it into Hal Duncan's chest. Then they saw him fall, dead. I didn't do it. Come on, Randy. You know me. You two are pals? / Yeah. Well, no. Not exactly. We met last year. - Gail, I can't help you here. - All right, Gail. Why don't we go She's scared to death. I gotta go in there. Sharona, you can't. Okay. There are two knives onstage. One of them is real. I use it to cut a tomato in the second act. The other one is retractable, - so it looks like he's being stabbed. - Right. There are two knives onstage. Knife number one is on the counter. Knife number two is sticking in the guy's chest. Look, here's the problem, Gail Both knives were real. There's no way. I'm telling you. It was a prop knife. I can tell the difference. - Look, Gail, I like you. - We both like you. So please, stop insulting us. Why would I kill him in front of everybody? People do it every day. You were having a relationship with the victim. You'd been seeing him for nearly a year. - It was just seven months. - He broke it off. You were upset. You sent him some e-mails. They were pretty emotional. Th-That's what I heard. Who you been talking to, Randy? The crew? You wanted to teach your boyfriend a lesson. You were pissed off. You did it in public. You didn't care, so you took a knife from home, you switched it with the knife on the stage, and then you stuck him in the chest. - Everybody saw you. - He's not my boyfriend. No! Not anymore. - Now Gail, I - I feel so helpless. Can't you do anything? Oh, God. Okay, I got toothpaste, toothbrush, magazines. I'm allowed to bring her a towel, right? / I don't know. How long can they hold her? Second-degree murder? The D.A.'s gonna try to deny her bail until she confesses. Why would she confess? What? You think she did it? Sharona, I don't know what to tell you. I was there. So were you. You know, I don't accept that. She said she was innocent. Things aren't always what they seem. Isn't that what you taught me? Sharona, she stabbed the guy in front of 300 people. - Look, I'm not a magician. - Yes, you are. You turn things around all the time. You do it for strangers every day. So how come you can't do it for my sister? - Oh, my God. - What? Oh, no. / ""Oh, no,"" what? Sharona, who is out there? My mom! I totally forgot she was coming. She flew up from Florida to see the play. This is gonna kill her! Oh, no. Look Look, I might have told her some things that weren't exactly true. - Like what? - Like, Benjy's on the honor roll. - Oh, okay. No problem. - Okay, thanks. Oh! Oh, oh, oh. And And I also told her that my rent is only $900 a month. And-And-And-And I broke up with Steve, the florist I was dating. He didn't break up with me. Oh, oh.! Oh, oh.

So, how was it last night? Tell me everything. How was Gail? Were there any reviews? Hey, Ma, you know what? There's-There's something I've got to tell you. - What? A bad review? - Uh, you might want to sit down, Cheryl. Oh, no, I'm fine. I've been sittin' all day. Ma, you know what? I think it's best that we sit down. / Oh. Something happened last night at the show. Okay / There was a stabbing. Oh. You mean, in the audience? No. Uh, no. Onstage, uh, during the show. The actor who was playing Burt was killed. Gail stabbed him. - Oh, I know. I read the script. - No, no. Cheryl, he died. Oh, I-I don't understand. Neither do we. Uh The police think that she might have done it on purpose. She's been arrested for murder in the second degree. There's a bail hearing tomorrow. Gail? No. I don't believe it. It's a mistake, right? - The police don't think so. - Well, they're wrong. Well, you're gonna help her, right? I mean, that's what you do. You're a couple of detectives, right? Of course we're going to help her. After all, we're we're a couple of detectives. - Right? - Right. Right. What? What? What? Forget it. Forget it. Excuse me. We're looking for Gail Fleming's dressing room. - And you are? - We're her mother. Backstage, then down the stairs. We'll be right back. We're just gonna pick up her stuff. Hey, hey, hey. Don't eat those. They're props. - And you are? - I'm O'Dell. I'm the prop master. - Well, they taste terrible. - But they look delicious. And that's the point. It's just an apple. It hurts, Mama. It hurts worse than anything else I've ever felt. Can I help you? Um, yeah. I'm I'm Sharona, Gail's sister. And I'm her mother. Who are you, dear? - Jenna Ryan. - Oh, hello, dear. L- I thought this was her dressing room. It is. It was. I'm her understudy. Can I help you? Yeah, we're just here to pick up her stuff. Oh, sure. Oh, I put them right here. Here you go. You couldn't fold them? Look, I know you're Gail's family, but it's very hard for me to be sympathetic. - I just came from Hal Duncan's wake. - Gail didn't do it. I'm sorry. You're right. She's innocent until proven guilty. I guess I'm a little nervous. I have a show on Friday. It's my opening night. I want you to know I wanted this part, but I never wanted to get it like this. Yeah. Look, my boss Uh, my associate and I are working with the police. We'd like to ask you a couple questions. I'm kind of busy. Um, how about tomorrow? Come by the apartment. - 3198 Green Village Road. - Fine. We'll be there. Great. Um Uh, Jenna? - Yes? - Break a leg. Excuse me. What are you doing? Uh, I was just Nothing. Hey, don't fiddle with the props. I've got to know where these are, in the dark, by touch, at a moment's notice. I've been juggling props for 44 years. Ask me about the first prop I ever bought. - What was the - The sword Richard Burton used in Camelot. - I had to go to Scotland to get it. - Really? Wow. I'm, uh, I'm Adrian Monk, and this is Sh She's usually right here. This is a terrible week, I'll bet. Hey, that wasn't my fault. The cops had me under the lights all night long. I told them I put the prop knife on the set. We use two knives on this show. A real one and one like this. Hey, whoa Don't wet yourself. The blade retracts into the handle. Gail must have switched the gag knife for the real one before the show. - May I? - See? It doesn't feel like a real knife at all, does it? No / She had to know she was holding a real knife. What happened onstage Sunday night, that was no accident. That was a woman scorned. ""Hell hath no fury,"" right? And you're sure you put a fake knife on the stage? I swear, I put it there myself, half an hour before curtain. - And there was nobody else here? - Nope. Except Jenna. Jenna Ryan, Gail's understudy. She was checking in. They check in before the show, see if anybody's sick. We're all set. It's killing me that we can't see her. She's not allowed any visitors until after the bail hearing. I can't believe this is happening. There's nothing we can do today. - Let's get a manicure. - A manicure / Come on. It'll be fun. If we just go home, we're gonna go crazy. There's a salon around the corner Alberta's. All the ladies in the show go there. What do you say? Nothing, nothing, noth Hold on. Hold on. No. Nothing. Saturday, nothing. Ouch. I don't have an opening for another two weeks. I'm sorry. - Not even for a manicure? - Don't you have any cancellations? Well, Luna can put you on the waiting list, but, uh, why don't you try Scissor Wiz? - They'll take anyone. - Excuse me. Uh, Jenna Ryan Is she a customer? Yes. / Gail's understudy. Right. She has an appointment for tomorrow. So? She wants to look good for her debut. But-But look. According to this, she made this appointment two weeks ago. How did she know she'd be onstage? I don't know. Coincidence? - Maybe. - So what are you saying? I'm saying you might be right. Your sister may have been framed. And I think the understudy could have had something to do with it. Who did your perm? I- I absolutely love it. Captain Stottlemeyer, you have been investigating the violent murder of Hal Duncan? - That's correct. - Look at her. She's lost weight. - How can you tell from here? - I can tell. - And who is that suspect? - Miss Gail Fleming. Um Uh, may I say something? Your Honor, in my opinion, Miss Fleming is not a flight risk. You see, I know her family, I work with her sister Your Honor, there is an avalanche of evidence against Miss Fleming. I hardly know where to begin. She had motive, she was obsessed with the victim, the attack was witnessed by 300 people. Excuse me, Your Honor. I would also like to mention that I have a consultant working on the case. He's a former homicide detective. He's somebody I respect a great deal, and, um, he has serious doubts about what happened. What is his name? Adrian Monk, Your Honor. He's, uh, in the courtroom, uh, and he's ready and willing to testify. Oh, yes. I know Mr. Monk. - Hello, Adrian. - Your Honor. I, uh, presided over his last competency hearing. He couldn't testify until I adjusted my robe. - I remember. Right. - You see, it had to be even. - Perfectly even. - Uh, look, Your Honor I know he's a little unorthodox, but he's a great cop. I'm refusing this petition. Bail is denied. - Thank you, Your Honor. - The court is in recess. Gail, baby Oh, no. I'm her mother. Can't I just talk to her? Give ya a minute. - Mom, I didn't do anything wrong. - I know you didn't, honey. Gail, do you remember when you were in the second grade and Pogo got sick? - Do you remember what I said? - You said you'd make it better. I gave you a promise. I said he'd get better, and what happened? - He got better. - That's right. - Until the bus hit him three weeks later. - No, no. Forget about the bus. The point is, he wasn't sick. Now, listen to me, pumpkin. I'm making you another promise, and I'm gonna take care of this. We gotta go. It's going to be okay. I'm depending on you. I'll do whatever it takes. I'm depending on you too. - Can I help you? - Uh, yeah, we're here, uh, for Jenna Ryan. She's expecting us. Miss Ryan just left 10 minutes ago. - Are you sure? - I put her in the cab myself. Okay, she didn't forget. I saw her write it down. She's avoiding us. Did you happen to hear where she went? It's possible. Well-Well, where did she go? It's very important. Isn't it funny? I- I can't quite remember. I get it. I get it. I get it. Memories are funny things. Uh, maybe this will help. Three dollars? Hey, buddy, I get three bucks for holding a door open. He wants more. Give him more. He didn't do anything. I think three dollars is more than appropriate. Give him more. - Oh, so we're up to four dollars now. - For 20 seconds of your time. - I think that's not too shabby. - You're the cheapest man I know. Here. Where'd she go? - What are you doing? Forty dollars? - My sister's on death row. I think she's worth 40 dollars. Where'd she go? - The Beltram Hotel on Ridgedale. - Okay. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Could I have my four dollars back? What? / We gave you 44 dollars. Yeah? / The bribe was only 40, so, you know - Are you for real? - Will you come on? O- Okay. Okay, but we have a four-dollar credit on any future bribes. I won't forget. I'm writing it down. There she is. Oh, excuse me. Have we registered? / Uh, for what? Speedy Dates. We do it here once a month Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I read an article about this. It's for singles. Instead of spending all night with one jerk, you get to meet 15 jerks at once. Yeah, that's not exactly how we would describe it. You spend four minutes with each person. Then when the love bell rings, you move on to the next person. - It's like square dancing. - He'll do it. Sign in. / What? Sign in. It's perfect. This way, Jenna has to talk to you. ""Speedy Dates""? No. No, no, no. That's like Dante's seventh circle of hell. Adrian, ""whatever it takes. "" Isn't that what you said? I like your eyes. Well, thank you. They came with the face. - And you're a cop? - Uh, used to be. Do you still have your handcuffs? Yes. They're in my bureau. Maybe you'd like to show them to me sometime. Why? They're-They're just handcuffs. And Trudy and I were married for - seven years. - I am so sorry. It was a car bomb. Three pounds of plastic explosives under the driver's seat. I I felt responsible. I think it was meant for me. And how about you? Have you ever been married? It's so hard for women my age to meet men. I'm 38. Oh, no, you're not. Excuse me? I was standing behind you when you were registering out front. I- I noticed that your credit card said ""member since 1979."" You have to be 18 to get that card. Which means that, uh, you're at least 42. All right. I'm 43. Are you happy now? You don't look it. - I hate dating, don't you? - I don't know. I never date. Then what are you doing here? I'm I'm just here to meet her. Oh, I see. Sorry I wasted your time. It's okay. Hello, Adrian. I'm Jenna. Jenna, hello. Is this your first time? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. How about you? Third. Insane, isn't it? But I don't know how else to meet anybody. The only guys I meet at work are actors. Oh, you're an actress? - Guilty. - Are you famous? No. Not yet. Are you into the theater? I really don't get out much. I'm in a play at the El Portal, if you're interested. - It's called Blood on the Moon. - Oh, I heard about that. Didn't a guy get killed during the show? It's not exactly the kind of publicity we wanted. Actually, I'm the understudy for the girl who, you know, did it. - Really? - My daddy always said, ""When opportunity knocks, just kick down the damn door. - Don't ask any questions. "" - Is-Is your father an actor too? He wanted to be. Raised by a frustrated actor. That explains everything, right? But he's great. He's really great. My father would do anything for me. Were you there when-when Mr. Duncan was stabbed? No. I, um I had checked in earlier. I was at a party across town. How did you know his name? - It's on the news. - Uh-huh. So you didn't actually see the attack? No, I was at a party across town. I told you. You ask a lot of questions. You never told me what you do for a living. Oh, that was quick. Can I see you again? I don't think so. - So how'd it go, stud? - She did it. I don't know how she did it, but she did it. Let's go back to the theater and look around. / Okay. - So how did the dating go? - Oh, it was terrible. - Thank God I'm not single. - You are single. Oh, yeah. Okay. I think I remember exactly what I saw. It's the second scene. You're Gail, I'm the guy. The two knives are on the counter. This is very important. This is the real knife. This is the prop knife. So when you stab me, please use the prop knife. - I'll try to remember. - Okay. Okay, now, so. - You You enter from the right. - You mean the left. That's stage left. - But it's on the right. - But it's stage left. That's what they call it. My sister's an actress. But-But for the purposes of this recreation, let's just call it what they call it on planet Earth. - Like you would know. - All right. Just enter from over there. All right? Over there, and then come walk to the table when I say ""Go. "" And Go. Hey, Cuz. Did you miss me? I hope you don't mind. I let myself in. - You're pretty good. - Oh. I have my moments. So now you say, ""Burt, you're supposed to be in jail. "" Come on. Say it. - Burt, you're supposed to be in jail. - Yeah, it's funny about that phrase, ""supposed to be. "" I'm supposed to be in jail. You're supposed to be waiting for me. A man can't count on ""supposed to be"" the way he used to. Your husband's downtown, drowning himself in scotch and soda. I saw him leave here about an hour ago. What are you doing? Well done. Very nice. - Sorry. We thought we were alone. - I was in the shadows, where the director belongs. I'm Karl Sebastian. I'm Sharona Fleming, and this is Adrian Monk. - You're Gail's sister, aren't you? - Yeah. Will you tell her we're all praying for her? I've known Gail many years, and I still can't believe what's happened. It's like a bad dream. / Sure is. How do you know the play, Mr. Monk? It's brand-new. It's never been published. I saw it last week, and, uh, must have memorized it by accident. Sorry. You memorized it after seeing it one time? I'm so sorry. I know this is all last-minute. I don't know what your schedule is, but, uh, we've just hired an actor from New York to play the part of Burt. But he can't be here till Monday. Would you consider filling in? It's only two shows. / Me? No. No. - Uh, no. Sorry. Can't. - He'll do it. He'll be great. I just need to talk to my agent for one minute. Are you insane? I can't act! Look, my sister's in trouble. You said the understudy did it. She's in the show. That's where you should be. It's two shows. Come on. - He'll do it. - Oh, excellent. I'm thrilled. Welcome aboard. We'll, uh, see you tomorrow, 10:00 a. m. Rehearsal. - You're in the show Friday night. - In the show. I'm in the show. It's fantastic. Okay, from the top of scene two. Adrian, you've just escaped from prison. You're hiding behind the door. You step out, and, uh Anytime, Mr. Monk. Hey, Cuz. Did you miss me? I hope you don't mind. I let myself in. Okay, okay. Um, Adrian, you started to have it yesterday. Remember, you've escaped from prison. / Right. I s Yeah. Full of rage. You swagger. I don't think so. Hi.! I'm sorry.! I'm sorry I'm late. I couldn't get a cab. - You - Jenna Ryan, this is Adrian Monk. - He's filling in for a couple of shows. - You're an actor? Yes, he's an actor, and he's doing a splendidjob. But we haven't got all day, so, um, we'll go from your line, ""There's money in my purse. "" Jenna, you're at the table. Adrian, you're swaggering. Here. I have some money in my purse. Take it. / You think I want your pocket change? You think that's why I came back? Okay, now, you push the table over. You're an animal. Just-Just push it over. Maybe my character wouldn't want to make too big a mess right-right here. She sent you to prison. You're You're full of rage.! I have a thought. What if my character expresses his rage by putting away the groceries roughly? Uh, okay. Uh, okay. Uh, let's-let's move on to your next line, ""Who ordered the tossed salad?"" Who ordered the tossed salad? I'm sorry. Is that how you laugh? - I'm not not a big laugher. - Well, try a real laugh. Have a go. Who ordered the tossed salad? Oh, no. Okay, wait. Let me try that again. Who ordered the tossed salad? Sebastian? - Who ordered the tossed salad? - He's impossible. Just cut him loose. We'll find somebody else. It was your idea to hire Hal, and he was terrible, God rest his soul. Who ordered the tossed Um Okay, we'll, uh, we'll work on the laugh. Take 10, everybody. Oh, not quite. Hold on. Kathleen, what did the director mean when he said that Jenna made them hire Hal Duncan? It was no secret Jenna wanted them to hire Hal. I'll tell you what I heard: She slept with the producer, then threatened to tell his wife unless they did. - Why? Were they dating? - No. Nobody could figure it out. Jenna didn't even like the guy. He wasn't a great actor, or even a good actor. He was a character. Always wore sunglasses, even inside. Oh, and he was allergic to everything: Eggs, peanuts and shellfish. He wouldn't eat anything unless he made it himself. Ah. This might work, huh? What do you think? Can't I just wear my own clothes? I'd I'd rather wear my own clothes. Uh, what-what do you have at home? Uh, well, he just has more of this. Basically this. So, when do I get to meet the elusive Ronnie? - Who? - The stockbroker. I told you about him. He's at a convention in Belgium. What stockbroker? I don't like Benjy meeting any of the guys I date until I'm sure, you know? But you said he took Benjy to the basketball game. No, I didn't. / Yes, you did. Well, then, you misunderstood, or you just got mixed up. Look, Ma, can we just change the subject, huh? You don't have to snap, honey. This is a hard time for all of us. You know, I always thought if anyone in this family ever would end up in jail, it would be you. You know what? That's great. That's great. Right in front of Benjy? - I don't mind. - No, you know what I'm talking about. - Remember when you S-T-O-L-E the car? - Ma, he's 11 years old. He can spell. - S-T-O - Okay, you know what? You know what? Go to your room and do your homework. Whatever. Oy! I'm sorry, Sharona. I- I'm just so scared. I'm scared too. - How you doing? - Oh, I'm making lots of new friends. I need you to get me out before I make any more. Listen, your Mom and Sharona wanted to come, but you're only allowed one visitor a day. They wanted me to ask you if you needed anything. Yeah, an explanation for what happened. Adrian, I didn't stab anybody. I grabbed the prop knife. I'm sure of it. The knife they found my prints weren't on it, were they? No. No, no. There were no There were no usable prints. The, uh The police figure that you, uh, that you wiped them off in all the confusion. Nobody believes me. My lawyer thinks I'm crazy. Well, maybe I am. / No. - No, you're not crazy. - Do you want to try a different phone? No. No, no. I'm good. I'm good. Listen, Gail, what do you know about your understudy, Jenna Ryan? I can't believe you said that. I've been thinking about her. Why is that? / Because Jenna would do anything for that part. Four years ago, she tried this Tonya Harding thing on another actress. I think it was in Chicago. They were both up for the same part. The actress was attacked with a golf club. Broke her kneecap. / Really? Yeah. Jenna got the part. You know, everyone suspected her, but they couldn't prove anything. But, you know, she couldn't have done it. She wasn't even near the theater, and she was at some party across town, so Maybe. There. There. Oh, God, the time. I've got to go. I've got a show. - Are you really in the cast? - A star is born. God, I would have thought you'd get stage fright. Nah, I was fine in the rehearsals. Everyone's fine in rehearsals. There's no audience there. That's true. That's true. My mom's in the front row. But there's not too many other people out there, right? No, there's lots of people out there. / Oh! It's sold out. Well, don't worry about it. You were fine in rehearsals. - Don't worry about it. - This is it! Places everyone. Energy. Energy! I heard you've been asking around about me. / What? Who are you? You're not an actor. That much I know. Okay, Jenna. Your entrance is on the other side. - We know a few things too. - What's that supposed to mean? Figure it out. Henry, you just sit there. You read those baseball scores. Don't let me bother you, huh? Where's that girl? She was supposed to be back here an hour ago with the groceries. - Okay. - Dinner's gonna be late tonight. Okay. Okay, I I-I-I can't do this. - Tell them I'm out of town. - It won't work. They've all seen you. What was I thinking? I'm not an actor. Are you all right? What are you doing? What-What are you doing? Taking your pulse. I'm a nurse, remember? Oh, my God. Sharona, I've I've got it. I know how she did it. / You do? If that's how you take someone's pulse, I know how she did it. Adrian, let's go. You're on! You. Come here! - How did she do it? - Allergies. Hal Duncan had lots of allergies. The wardrobe lady said he was afraid to eat anything he didn't make himself. That's why Jenna wanted him in that part. He was the perfect patsy! The prop master told me that Jenna was hanging out onstage before the show. But she wasn't switching knives, she was tampering with the apples. The apples? She must have been putting something on them or in them something that Hal Duncan was allergic to. That's right. My mom said they tasted funny. Like I said, I'm here for what's mine! Hal Duncan wasn't stabbed. He was having an allergic reaction. But he was stabbed. There was a real knife in his chest. I know. I-I know, I know. It was a brilliant plan. - You're still here? - What? / You're on! - No. No, no, no. - Adrian, Adrian, if you don't go onstage, she's gonna know something's up. Sharona, go downstairs, check her dressing room! What am I looking for? Evidence! Something Hal Duncan was allergic to. Shellfish, eggs, peanuts Hey, Cuz. Did you miss me? I hope you don't mind. I let myself in. Burt, you're supposed to be in jail. Funny, that phrase, ""supposed to be. "" You're supposed to be in jail. I'm supposed to be in jail. You're supposed to be waiting for me. A man can't count on ""used to be"" the way he's supposed to. Yes, yes. We can prove it. Look, are you almost here? - Great. I'll see you soon. - You'd better go. My husband's upstairs. If he hears you Your husband's downtown, drowning himself in scotch and soda. I saw him leave here about an hour ago. I have money in my purse. Here, take it. - You think I want your pocket change? - Adrian! You think that's why I came back? Adrian. Adrian! Look.! Adrian.! Adrian. Who ordered the tossed salad? Oh, my God. I'm here for what's mine. Burt, if you don't leave, I'll You'll what? Huh? You'll do nothin'! - Adrian, be careful! She knows! - Like I said, - I came for what's mine! - Watch out! Oh, my God! Is she all right? Is there a doctor in the house? Everybody stay in your seats, ladies and gentlemen. - I'm a police officer. Everything is under control. - Are you okay? / I'm all right. Everybody just sit down. Could we have the house lights on, please? She's okay. I'll call an ambulance. Excuse me. Did you Did you just ask if there was a doctor in the house? Yes. Yes. Right. That's funny. Because last week, you were the doctor in the house. - What are you talking about? - I was here. I saw you. Is there a doctor in the house? Anyone? / I'm a doctor. But you're not a doctor, are you? I remembered how you took Hal's pulse after he collapsed. You used your thumb, something no real doctor would ever do. Hal Duncan was having an allergic reaction to peanut oil. He wasn't stabbed until you stabbed him. When you leaned over, you pocketed the fake knife, and then you killed him. He's dead. He's been stabbed! That's crazy. Why would I You would do anything to help Jenna get into the play. It's a big hit, heading to New York, and a career-making role for your daughter. - My daughter? - That's right, Mr. Ryan. That is your name, isn't it? You've been obsessed with her career. Jenna told me all about it. We We dated, briefly. You don't understand. Jenna's all I have. But if they wanted Gail out of the way, why didn't they just go after her? They couldn't do that, Captain. Jenna was suspected of attacking another actress four years ago. They couldn't pull that trick again. They had to find another way to get rid of Gail. - So they framed her. - Or they tried to. Thank you, Adrian. Now, can you prove any of this? The medical examiner can. This was in her dressing room. I'm sure you can still find traces of it in his body. - Peanut oil. - Daddy! Daddy, what did you do? I had nothing to do with this, I swear! I swear! Shut up, bitch! Show's over. That's my daughter, the detective.! Bravo! Listen to this. ""The director said, ""'We're all excited about Gail Fleming rejoining the show. / Yea! ""'We're also hoping to bring our newest cast member, Adrian Monk, to New York with us. In all my years in the theater, I have never seen fear and panic portrayed so convincingly. ""' That is a money review. First time out. Congratulations. / Thanks. Are you gonna be doing any more acting, Mr. Monk? Anything's possible, Benjy, except for that. Oh, I'm gonna miss my plane. We better call a taxi. Oh, no, I'll take you. You know, I've been cooped up all week. Before I leave, I want a picture with me and my girls. Oh, I'll I'll take it for you. Oh, no, don't give it to him. He'll spend half an hour cleaning the lens. Don't. Oh, well, we can all be in it, because, uh, there's a built-in timer. But we have to be careful. There's just one picture left. Ready? Go! Smile! Here, Cheryl, you switch with me, okay? / Adrian, no. - No. There's no time. - Mom should be in the middle. Okay, okay. Wait. Smile. - Gail, you switch - Oh, come on. We don't have time for this! Quick, quick! Yeah, now it's better. Cause you have tall, short, tall, short."

Yeah, and I don't know where he is. - Dwayne, do I look like an idiot to you? - Yeah, you sorta do. Oh, that's a mistake. You don't want to make him angry. Uh, I made him angry once. You don't want to do that. / Dwayne Hey! Cop. Kiss my ass! Don't move. - Can I be honest with you, sir? - All units, clear the air. We're in pursuit of a hit-and-run. He's eastbound on Union.

Says ""Fun for all ages. "" I know he enjoys having fun. He mentioned that once. Adrian, I can see that you're anxious about this, but the important thing to remember is that Benjy loves you, so whatever you get for him, Benjy will love. He didn't love the pajamas I bought him last year. I saw it on his face. The The disappointment. L- I hate that look. L-I never want to see that look again. Adrian, why don't you just ask Sharona what he would like? She said to pick out the gift myself, so it would really come from me. Okay. I'm sorry, but, uh - our time is up. - Okay, well I'll see ya Thursday. No! No, uh, don't you remember? - I'll be in Costa Rica. - Costa Rica? Yeah. For three weeks. It's my vacation. I've never been to Costa Rica. Uh, no, Adrian. You're not coming. It's a vacation. But if-if you like, I can refer you to another doctor. / Uh - O-Or not! Or not. - Why didn't you tell me? I did. I told you every week for the past month, but I guess you just, um, blocked it out. Is that possible? / Apparently. I guess I did. I blocked it out. No problem. We'll talk about it on Thursday. Carrie, come on. You can't believe a word my brother says. I was there. My father was not in his right mind when he wrote that second will. If he wrote it at all. Well, you know what? If the judge wants to rule against us, I'll guess we'll just have to appeal. Hmm. Bay Bridge Books? I don't remember ordering this. Yeah, well, you know what? It's been two years. I'll probably die before I see a dime. Listen, Carrie, I gotta go. I gotta unpack. I've been here six weeks, and my stuff is still in boxes. Bye. Sigmund Freud never took a vacation. Well, Sigmund Freud never met you. I need somebody to talk to. He'll be back soon. Don't worry about it. I mean, everybody needs some time off. Except, apparently me. Why don't you try a different doctor for a few weeks? No. No, no, no. It takes me eight months to break in a new therapist. Most of them don't make it. Two took an early retirement. Did you get a present for Benjy yet? / No. Well, you don't have that much time. His birthday's tomorrow. - I don't know if I can make it. - You better make it. You promised him. He really wants you at his party. Why? / Because he's very young. His father better send him something. That's all I can say. Lieutenant. / Sharona, Monk. - Is that a new tie? - Yeah. It's a gift from my girlfriend. She has very good taste. In ties, not in men. Ooh, do I detect a hint of jealousy? If you do, it's the only detecting you've ever done. Adrian Monk, old buddy, old pal, old chum. ""Old buddy""? What have you done with the real Captain Stottlemeyer? What do we have? / Mail bomb. An ounce and a half of plastique with a magnesium charge. There were two triggers: A chemical detonator wired to the wrapping, and a motion detector so when you opened it and moved it, boom! - Not hard to make. - Crude and unpredictable, actually. - Who's the victim? - Amanda Babbage, 35 years old. - She lived here alone. - Nice house. - It was a lot nicer two hours ago. - The feds are here? Yes, up the wazoo. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. They're in charge, and they're not shy about saying so. Monk. If you can make me look good here, I would really appreciate it. I'd love to show these bastards up. Wouldn't hurt our careers either. Excuse me! Excuse me, excuse me! Can you please keep it down? We're trying to think. Go in the other room. Who the hell is that? Marion the Librarian? It's Adrian Monk. He's consulting with us. But he's not consulting with us. Agent Grooms, you said you'd keep us local bumpkins in the loop. Give my man a couple of minutes, okay? - What is it? - A knot. I've never seen one tied quite like that, have you? No, I can't say that I have. - ""Street""? - Yeah. That's part of the address. Well, but this is McCallister Avenue, not Street. - Part of the return address. - Return address is here. The bomb was addressed incorrectly. ""Please forward. "" It's a change of address label. Did she just move in? That's right. She bought the house two months ago. Thanks. Glad we could help. - We would have found it. - Maybe. There's our boy. Amanda's kid brother, Ricky. Estate's been in probate since the old man died. Amanda and her two brothers have been fighting over the estate ever since. Too much money, and too many lawyers. Do you want me to talk to him? No, thank you, Captain. I think we can handle it. Okay. I'll just watch and take notes. I'm so keen to learn. That's my sister's house. What's your badge number, huh? That's my sister in there! I'm family, eh? Do you understand? All right. I got it. I got it. Richard Babbage? Are you in charge? Thank God, because this storm trooper wouldn't let me through. I'm Agent Grooms. I'm with the A.T.F. Ricky, I know this is a bad time for you. I need to ask you a few questions. When was the last time you saw your sister? I don't know. There was a barbecue here about two weeks ago. We had a fight. I said some things. I can't believe this has hap - Excuse me. Is this your surfboard? - Yes. - Did you put it up here? - Yes. I didn't want it to tear up the back seat, so I tied it up there. - Who is he? - Nobody. Captain? I need to ask Ricky a few questions. Why don't you stay here with ""Marion,"" and uh guard the car. Okeydokey. Who's ""Marion""? / You are. - ""Marion the Librarian. "" - So it's like a put-down. Yup. It's a derogatory remark, Monk. What do you see? Oh, he's not the guy. He definitely knew his sister lived here. He was at a barbecue here two weeks ago. But the package was mailed to the old address. / Right. And he said he tied the surfboard to the roof himself. Look at these knots. They're a mess. Crude, tangled. But the knot we saw inside, on the bomb, was a work of art. - So the feds - Are barking up the wrong tree. You said there was another brother? / Yeah. Brian. - But he's a dead end. - Or practically dead. - What do you mean? - The guy's in a coma. We saw it happen. Four months ago, he got T-boned by a pickup truck. Cracked his skull. It was really unnecessary. The guy just baited me and Randy and-and stepped on the gas. - It was my first car chase. - That didn't count. The guy didn't go half a block. You didn't get the car in gear. - It counted. - It wasn't a chase, Randy. We ran to the car. Anyway, uh Four months ago. So he wouldn't have known that his sister had moved. - It counted. - I'd like to meet him. They say that people in a coma can hear everything. - Why were you chasing him? - Because he was running. If he ever wakes up, we'll be sure to ask him. - What are you doing? - Uh, I'm just makin' sure. Oh. Pen. Wait. I think I feel it. Oh, my God. It's leaking. What are you doing? Get your hands out of there. Uh I-I, uh I dropped I dropped something I got it. I'm Mr. Babbage's private nurse. Are you people family? Even for family, there's no excuse. San Francisco Homicide, ma'am. We're here on official business. Was that about the sister? I heard it on the radio. Nurse Nurse Stempel, is there any way Mr. Babbage could have left this room? Not unless he was carried out. This is a stage nine coma. His cognitive response is near zero. Has he had a lot of visitors? / Just one. His brother Ricky came by to serve him with a subpoena. Can you believe it? - Like The Addams Family. - And, uh Are those the patient's shoes? - You-You didn't untie them. - They were yanked off in the E.R. Is there anything else? I need to change the sheets. No, ma'am. We'll be leaving. So, you'll all be leaving? / Yes. - Yes. Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you. Private nurse, private room. This guy knows how to take a nap. - He's the guy. - Who's the guy? Him? Monk, he's a vegetable. He's not even a vegetable. He hopes one day to be a vegetable. Captain, listen. His sister moved two months ago. He is the only man in the world with a motive who wouldn't have known that. Also, look. Look at the knot. It's elegant. In my life, I've only seen one other knot like that. - Yeah, the bomb. - He's the guy. Yeah, but Monk, he's been asleep since May. I know. / The bomb was mailed three days ago. - There's a postmark. - I don't know how he did it. But he did it. I've heard about sibling rivalry, Ricky. But this is ridiculous. I mean, you spend more time in court than me. My father changed his will every three weeks. We're just tryin' to figure out who gets what. It's family. It's complicated. - That's a nice cigar. - Cohiba Robustos. You want one? I got a friend down in Key West. - He sends me a box every month. - No, thank you. You've never worked a day in your life, have you, Ricky? I tried working once. I hated it. Look, I-I can't help if I'm lucky. I think your luck's run out, Rick. Goin' down. I didn't do anything. Just couldn't settle for your third of the pie, could you? - You had to have it all. - Hey, I was ready to settle. You ask my lawyer. My brother Brian was the one who wasn't happy. Oh, that's classy. Blaming your brother who's in a coma. Hey, Ricky. I got a sister. We fight all the time. There's times when I feel like I'd like to kill her. Have you ever felt like that? I don't know. I've never met your sister. Captain, why don't you go grab some coffee? I want to talk to Ricky alone. I just got kicked out of my own interrogation room. You want some coffee, sir? No, Randy. What I want is for that ATF creep to eat crow. Well, we know who did it and we know why. We just don't know how. Monk, again, he's in a coma. He's the guy. In 20 seconds, Agent Grooms is gonna come walking through that door, and he's gonna ask me what I think. Give me something else, for the love of God. Okay, wait. I have an idea. Maybe he had an accomplice. Yes. Somebody else mailed the damn thing. Why not? I already had that idea. Tell him. There was no accomplice. Why would Brian Babbage hire one? He didn't know he was gonna be in a coma. It's not exactly something you can plan. All right. Anyway. Why would an accomplice bother to go through with it? There was no reason to. The guy who hired him was in a coma. All right, so, Brian built the bomb. And then, Brian mailed the bomb. By himself. / That's right. - While he was in a coma. - You gotta admit. It's a pretty good alibi. - It's rock-solid. - Monk, I have known Here's what they all have in common: They're conscious! - Nonetheless. - Is your shrink coming back soon? Captain. Sorry about in there, I, uh, work better one on one / All right. - So, how's it look? - He's bending, but not breaking. I'll get him. About to write up my case report, uh, I'm gonna list him as my primary. I'll need you to sign off on that. Right? Be easier to get an indictment if we're all on the same page. I'm thinking maybe it's the other brother. Well, there's only one other brother, and he's in a coma. That's the one. I think, uh, I think we should look into him. He's a vegetable, Captain. I know. / Don't you think that eliminates him as a suspect? I mean, I'm just curious. How do you think he did it? We're still workin' on that / Yeah. Well, good luck with that, Captain. Uh, keep me informed. Benjy, Benjy, Benjy. Where's Adrian? Mm, I don't know. Whoa, whoa. Watch it. Hey, you guys. Not in the kitchen. You want to take that out of the room? Are they gone? - No! What are you doing? - Playing a game. What game? / It's called It's called, ""Are they gone?"" Are they gone? /- No. Then the game's not over. - It's a jigsaw puzzle. - Is he right? How many pieces? /700? Didn't I tell you? - But Benjy, Mr. Monk isn't a toy. - Sure he is. Okay, next. I know what this one is! Because it's from me. It's a rock-polishing kit. To clean rocks! Happy Birthday. - What do you say? - Thank you. I had one when I was 12. It was so much you know fun. Hey! Let's use it now. I saw some great rocks out back. Let's go get 'em! Maybe later, Mr. Monk. - There's that look. - Oh, it's okay. - Trevor, what are you doin' here? - My calendar says August 14. Mom, who is it? / Your father. His name is Trevor. Trevor Howe. He just shows up after six years, out of the blue. At the kid's birthday party. Can you believe it? Benjy loves him, of course. L- I really appreciate you letting me talk like this. My regular doctor's out of town. I'm glad you could squeeze me in. Anyway, about this Trevor guy, Sharona's so happy to see him, I can't figure it out. He treated her so badly. He was never faithful. He drank, he gambled. I guess I never appreciated how lonely Sharona's been. She wants to forgive him. She wants to believe in him. Am I jealous? Is that it, do you think? Or maybe-maybe I'm afraid he's gonna take her away. What do you think? Or maybe I'm I'm just feeling bad about Benjy's birthday. Ah, he hated my gift. I could tell. A rock-polisher. What was I thinking? Why couldn't I just buy him a regular toy? I'm so tired being different. I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted, I I don't have to tell you about being exhausted. You don't know how lucky you are. Sleeping. Sleeping through it all. Not a care in the world. Take my advice. Savor these moments. Wow, this is a nice house. Brian did pretty well. So, how are things with Trevor? Great! He's really turned his life around. - Think so? - What, you don't trust him? - Mm. You don't trust anybody. - That's true. Although, I'm hardly ever wrong. I'm telling you. He's a different man, He's not drinking. He's got a job. I mean, people change. Not you, but other people. Good. I'm glad. - Can't you be happy for me? - I am. I'm glad. This is me, being glad. I was just telling Brian how happy Benjy seems. Brian who? Brian. Babbage. The coma guy? / Yeah. He woke up? / Nah No. - But you were talking to him. - He's a good listener. Oh, hi. I'm Sharona Fleming, and this is Adrian Monk. We're helping the police investigate He didn't wake up, did he? - No. - Oh! Thank God! Come on in. - Do you mind if we look around? - Go right ahead. I'm just the maid. What is all this weird stuff? He was looking for a lawyer. That's no surprise. He was suing his whole family. No, no, no. These are criminal lawyers. Look at the name he circled: ""Scott Butterworth. "" - I know that name. - Suspended twice. He was a hack. Brian Babbage could afford any attorney in town. Why would Why would anyone want to hire a bad lawyer? Is that blood? No. It's just ketchup. Ugh. Ugh! There's something you don't see every day. Excuse me. We noticed the ketchup bottles. - In the closet? - Why would he do that? We were afraid to ask. Mr. Babbage hates questions. - What are you doing? - I always open the mail, to pay the bills. - Oh, my God! - Don't open that! Hey! Okay. They pieced together enough of the package to get a postmark. It was mailed from Pacific Heights, two days ago. Different post office, same type of explosive. Well, don't use that bathroom! It's a mess! - You don't have to shout! - Why are you whispering? Residual auditory trauma from the blast. It'll clear up in a few hours. Monk. Monk, can you hear me? Do you have any idea who might have done it? Brian Babbage! No! The bomb was mailed to Brian Babbage. Somebody just tried to kill him. He sent the bomb to himself so nobody would suspect him! - Did you see the ketchup bottles? - Yeah, I did. Pretty weird, huh? Captain. A.T.F., 3:00. Monk, gimme somethin' else. Anything. Any theory besides the coma guy. If you were to tell me that Howdy Doody was behind this, - it would make more sense. - Howdy Doody? Why would Howdy Doody be sending people mail bombs? Wasn't he a puppet? He was just using that as an example. Or maybe he was just using that as an example! Captain! D.A. won't hold Ricky Babbage. I was hoping this might change your mind. Oh, you can't be serious. You still think Rip Van Winkle's behind this? We believe Brian Babbage is involved, yes. We just don't know how. And by ""we,"" you mean, you and your consultant. Yeah, I'm pretty sure Howdy Doody was a puppet. How was your career, Captain? Did you enjoy it? So, do you remember me at all? I remember going camping. That's right. Yeah. You were four years old. We went to, uh, Wisconsin Dells. And you fell off the rock. Do you remember that? You almost scared us half to death? Huh? I bet you still got the scar. Do you? Where is it? There it is. Wow! Well, I'll tell ya. Wear it with pride, kid. It was a hell of a fall. Carried you two miles. Mom says she carried me. Yeah, well, we took turns. Hey, did you get the camera I sent you? / Yeah. Um, Mom says you never send any checks. Yeah, well Well, Benjy, the important thing is, I'm here now, right? Hey, did your Mom tell you, I got a job? Managing a restaur Do you like hamburgers? / Yeah. Oh, good. I'll get you all the free hamburgers you want. Oh, which reminds me of somethin'. Someone has got some back allowance coming A hundred dollars? - Thanks. - Hey, Benj, listen. I screwed up, but it's not gonna happen again. Okay? / Okay, Dad. All right. I forgot. Which one Which one am I? Red. Yeah. / I'm the red one. Oh.! Oh. Oh.! - You got me. - It's okay. You have three lives. Oh, is that right? Well, keep playin', all right? Okay, I'm gonna talk to your mom. You hear that? I get three lives. You're gonna need 'em. You already used up two. You want a beer? / Uh What, you temptin' me? - A.A. My 60-day chip. - Two months? It's a start. Sharona, if I had three lives, I'd spend one of them apologizing to you. - And Benjy. - And Benjy. And Benjy. Listen. Y-You know, Monday I start the new restaurant gig. And I was thinkin', how nice it would be if I came home every day and found you and Benjy there. - and found you and Benjy there. - In New Jersey? Well, it's the Garden State. Don't-Don't say no. Don't say no. J- Just think about it. Well, I, uh What about my job? I just can't leave Adrian. He's an adult. Only somebody who didn't know him would call him that. Trust me. I'm telling you. She says she's thinking about it, but I can tell she's gonna go. Why should she be different? Everybody leaves me. Trudy. Dr. Kroger. And now, Sharona. It's like the national pastime. Comments? Any questions? Is this your watch? You're two minutes fast. Just relax. I'll fix it. What's that? Is that glue? What were you gluing? Ah.! Ugh.! Uh, excuse me! Hello? Uh, sorry? Okay! Okay, Brian. Come on, Brian. Come on. Come on. Come back! Come ba Oh, God. Aah! Come on. You can Brian? Come on! Come on, you and me. You and me. You and me, all the way. Come on, almost! Almost! Almost! That's got it! That's got it. Yeah. Ahh. He's He's good. I mean, he's great. I mean He's He's fine. Fine now. Adrian, I'm gonna visit you all the time. - When are you going? - Friday. Friday? This Friday? Just like that. - You're just leaving me in the lurch. - You're not in the lurch. I'm in the lurch! This is the lurch! I can feel it! / My sister's gonna look in on you. Hey, this is the best way. If I would have given you three weeks' notice, you and I both know that you would have gone crazy. You know it! Oh, God, Adrian! I'm sorry. Look, this isn't about me. It's about Benjy. He needs his father. If this doesn't work out, I'll come back. What if it does work out? What if you're happy? / Isn't that good? I mean I mean, didn't you ever think that someday I might leave? No. No, I wa I was afraid to. I'm sorry. / Mr. Monk.! Sharona! Sorry I'm late. I stopped off to visit a lady friend. Then I stopped off to visit her sister. Look, my lawyer said that you guys were very helpful. And it's greatly appreciated. What happened at the hospital? Heard you pulled the plug on my brother. / I'm sorry. That was an accident. Don't apologize. I just got off the phone with his doctor. It turns out, you did the bastard a favor. It, uh jump-started his neutrons or something? Anyway, he's breathin' on his own for the first time in months. - All thanks to you. - Well, good. Glad to have helped. Be it ever so humble, make yourselves at home. Geez, look at all this mail. - Uh, don't open any packages. - Yeah, thanks. I'm not an idiot. Bills Mail.. Don't bother. Won't stick. Peels off every four weeks. My God. Sharona. I've got it! / What? The mail bombs. I know how he did it! What are you doing? / Relax. They're my cigars? From my guy in Key West? Nobody knows I get these. - Does your brother know? - Yeah. Brian knows I get these. It's a bomb! Don't open it! Oh, my God. Do not move. It's okay. It's okay. Just don't move. It is now motion-sensitive. Don't move. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Stop saying ""okay"" and do something! Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm talking to the bomb squad. - And they're on their way. - There are no wire cutters in this cabinet. They're right there in the tin bucket! Will you hurry up? I don't know how long I could stand like this. / Shh! Okay, he wants to know how many wires you see. - Four wires. Still want to quit? - Four wires. You'll never have this much fun in New Jersey. He says, cut the wire leading from the detonator to the battery. There are two. A blue and a red. - What is that? - Light turned green. Light turned green. He says you have 10 seconds. Cut one of the wires! Which one? Either one. It doesn't matter! - Okay, blue. No, no, red. - Oh, God! - No, red. No, blue. - Oh, God! - Cut one! Cut the blue one! - Five seconds! - Why blue? - God! Well, cut the red one! - You said blue! - Three seconds. - Adrian, cut one! - I'll cut 'em both! You okay? / Yeah, it was just your basic mail bomb. No big deal. So I heard you're leaving. New Jersey. Are you gonna miss me? / Nope. Well, maybe a little. Do me a favor and call me sometime to remind me why I left. / I'll do that. - Can everyone see? - Yeah, we can see it's just a mailbox. What the hell are we doing here? Well, first off I'd like to thank United States postal worker Tamil Swarma for helping us out here today. We're glad to help our brothers and sister in the law enforcement community. We just wear a different shade of blue, that's all. Yeah! Yeah. Brian Babbage wanted to kill his brother and sister. He found a way to mail a bomb in May but not have it be delivered until August. It was quite brilliant, really. Yes, it was. Although by doing so, he violated two federal laws, and a score of postal regulations. Go on. When I recently saw some wallpaper peeling off a wall it reminded me of the ketchup bottles in Brian Babbage's closet. They were glued to the ceiling. The glue was the key. There was no glue in the bomb. It wasn't part of the bomb. It was part of the delivery mechanism. Exactly! / Ex It was an experiment. A stress test. The ketchup bottles weighed about the same as the mail bombs. He was trying to find out how long they would stick before they fell off. - I don't get it. - Tamil. Four months ago, Brian Babbage went around the city late at night. Cracked open the panel on a couple of these mailboxes These locks are pretty simple to pick I've talked to my supervisors, but they don't listen. - Tamil. Tamil. - Don't make waves, you know? Everybody just wants to hit their 20 and get out. I can take it from here. Brian put the bombs in the mailboxes, but he didn't put them on the bottom with the rest of the mail. He glued them to the top. You see, it's a blind spot. Nobody ever looks up there. Why would they? Four months later, the glue dries up, the bomb falls down, and the next day, the mailman picks it up with the rest of the mail. It was like a time-released mail bomb. The U.S. Post Office unwittingly became the messenger of evil. Who'd have thunk it? / Well put, Tamil. By the time they were delivered, Brian had a perfect alibi. He put himself in a coma? That's his alibi? That's the stupidest plan I ever heard of. He came this close to killing himself. I was stumped too. But then I realized, that wasn't his plan at all. - No one would plan to be in a coma. - His idea was to get himself arrested so he would be in jail when the bombs were delivered. That's why he tried to lead us on a car chase. He figured he'd be in jail for seven or eight months. He even picked out a terrible lawyer, to make sure that he wouldn't get off. - But he screwed up and he hit a truck. - And a car. Then another car. Brian Babbage stumbled literally, by accident into the best alibi in the history of crime. - Look, where's your proof? - Brian Babbage woke up this morning. I've arranged for all of us to pay him a little visit. This is going to be great. / Not you. Mister Babbage? / Maria. Ohh! You're awake! It's a miracle. I came as soon as I heard. Sorry about your sister and your brother. Thank you, Maria. The doctor just told me about them. I can't I can't believe it. I won't stay long. I just wanted to welcome you back. And I brought your mail. - What's-What's that? - I'm sorry, I started to open It's a bomb. It's a bomb! Get down! Get down. I can't help but wonder what made you think that was a bomb, Mr. Babbage. Brian Babbage? Good morning. You're under arrest for the murder of your sister, Amanda. Sharona? Benjy! The taxi's here. Ah. Come on, guys. We're gonna miss the plane. Sharona, whatever it is, leave it. The movers will get it tomorrow. - Wha Where's Benjy? - He's at my sister's. What? We gotta get goin'. - We're not goin'. - What are you talkin' about? Found the plane tickets last night. Detroit? / Sharona - No. Sharona, listen. - Christ, I shoulda known. I just thought we could stop I just thought we could stop on the way home and see my Uncle Jack, that's all. You don't want to see Uncle Jack. You want your Uncle Jack to see me and Benjy. He cut you off after we split up, and now you're trying to get back into his pocket. Look. The taxi's outside. The meter's runnin'. Let's just We'll talk on the way, okay? Sharona. Honey? The money is for bo It's for all of us. I mean, he's richer than God. Why not take advantage of that? That's all you're good at, Trevor. Taking advantage. Why don't you call Benjy and tell him that the only reason why you got back into his life is so that your rich uncle doesn't cut you off. Didn't think so. - What about Benjy? He needs a father. - Yeah, that's true. He does. So why don't you come back when you're ready to be one? Hey Uh, there it is. The house on the left there? K- K-Keep going! J- Just go. Where to? / It doesn't matter. Just go. Go. Go. Hey! Thought you might be here. How ya doin'? I'm good. I'm great. I'm living a dream. Where's Trevor? Went home. I'm sorry. I missed you. I missed you too. God, I really did. Maybe I should see a shrink, too. Stick around. Dr. Kroger will be here any minute."
"Dex. Excuse me. They're waiting for a final decision about the cover. Ah, all right. Well, what do you think, darlin'? Um, that one. / Mm. And which one would you pick if it was you on the cover? That one. / That one. Yeah. We'll take that one. And make sure there are more girls here tonight. Last week was like a stag party. - This is paradise on earth, remember? - It's taken care of. Elliott, you're early. The party doesn't kick in till midnight. Dexter, I'm not here for the party. Amber, this is, uh, Elliott D'Souza, Chief Financial Officer for Dharman Publishing. You know, which means, technically, this pencil pusher is my boss. Dex, we have to talk privately. Go wait by the pool. Dex, I made a decision. I wanted you to hear it from me. The magazine is hemorrhaging dollars. It just isn't paying for itself. It's not your fault. The whole industry is shrinking. It's the Internet. It's videos Sapphire magazine is more than a magazine. - It's a way of life. - Well, that may be true. But the corporation just can't carry you and this fantasy world anymore, so I've decided to pull the plug. - So that's it, huh? - I'm afraid so. Hey. It was fun while it lasted. Actually, I'm surprised you waited this long. Listen, Elliott. Can you do me a favor, one last favor? Don't make any announcement for a day or so. This is our anniversary party. Let me enjoy the weekend. Of course. / And that means you can't tell anybody. Those bastards on the board never could keep a secret. Yes, I understand. It can wait until Monday. Are you sure that you don't wanna stay? No. No, thank you. Oh. I know, I know. You're goin' home. Asleep by midnight, up at 7:00, work out for 35 minutes. My Elliott, you are so predictable. You should stick around, have some fun. I'm gonna pass, Dexter. Gonna be a hell of a party. You know me. I'm goin' out with a bang. Elliott, it's Dex. - This a bad time? - No. I'm in the gym. How was the party? It must have been great. I don't remember a thing. Uh, listen. I was wondering if you'd reconsider your decision. No. I'm afraid not, Dex. Aw, come on. What about keeping the mansion open? Just the mansion. - We could rent it out. - Dex. Dex, don't even ask. The place is drowning in red ink. We're gonna have to sell it. - Is that your final decision? - I'm afraid so, Dexter. Okay. It's your funeral. Dexter, let's not be so dramatic, shall we?

I don't know. Every time I go there, it's closed. I wonder why. Last time I went, I thought I saw him in the back room, but I guess it couldn't have been him. See? You're You're still long. You see that? That's three-sixteenths. Adrian, these are very sharp scissors. Don't piss me off. I'll get that. Adrian Monk's office. Uh-huh. It's a job. Yeah. 10:00 tomorrow is fine. Make it 11:30. It's trash day. Thanks. Mr. Monk? And you You must be Sharona. Oh, thank you for coming. I'm Diane Luden. I am I was Elliott D'Souza's assistant. I'm sorry. Wasn't I supposed to shake hands? You're the first private detective I ever met. Oh, no. Don't worry. It's not you. It's him. Please, come in. Uh, Ms. Luden, the elevator we just took, that's obviously a private elevator. That's right. It comes straight up to the penthouse. Um, I found him Sunday morning. He was in there, in his private gym. Yeah, yeah. We heard about it on the news. They said he had a heart attack. That's what they thought at first. But they did an autopsy, and it wasn't a heart attack. He was lifting an 80-pound barbell and and they think it must have slipped and crushed his windpipe. - You okay? - Uh, the sign in front of that hotel they misspelled ""Kiwanis. "" You mean that sign five blocks away? What, you want me to do down there and have them fix it? No. No, you don't have to do that. Maybe we could call them. There. Sign's fixed. Ms. Luden, um, why exactly did you call? Mr. Monk, I think Elliott was murdered. Why would you say that? For the past two years, he and Dexter Larsen have been threatening each other. Dexter Larsen? / Dexter Lar With-With With the naked Elliott published Sapphire magazine. He was thinking of shutting it down. Dexter was pretty angry. That certainly could be a motive. Could we look at this private gym? He was right there. It was horrible. The barbell was still on his neck. Is this exactly the way the room was when you found him? Yes, sir. I wouldn't let the paramedics touch a thing. Good, good. And he was alone, and the door was locked? - That's right. - From the inside. That's right. Hmm. Clock is slow. Forty minutes. There's something strange about this room. / What? I don't know. I can't put my finger on it. It's something. - Is this his briefcase? - Yes. He always had it with him. And this floppy was in there. This was his final recommendation. What'd it say? / I don't know. When I tried to open it, it was blank, like somebody erased it. Why would they do that? Oh. That was from last year. They ran a profile on Elliott in the magazine. Page 53. Page 53. Five-three. Five-three. 5-3 5-3 Are you a religious man, Mr. Monk? He is now. Wipe. Wipe. Wipe. Wipe. Wipe. - That assistant, she called you. - Mm-hmm. Diane Luden. I gave her your name. I figured you'd collect a nice payday after you convinced her she was crazy. Actually, I think she might be onto something. We'd like to look at the official file. Look, there is no D'Souza case. It was an accident. The barbell slipped, crushed his trachea. He was alone in his apartment on the 35th floor. / I know. There was only one way up. It was a private elevator. Nobody else used it. I know. / The apartment was locked from the inside. I know. / Are you gonna be cooperating on this or not? If you two wanna go tilting at windmills, be my guests. But this time, Monk, you're on your own. Forget it. Let's go. What's our first stop? Sapphire Mansion. We have an appointment. Sapphire Mansion? You have an appointment? / Yes. Elliott D'Souza controlled that magazine. He was about to pull the plug on Dexter Larsen. I think Larsen might be involved. Sapphire Mansion. I've never been. Have you ever been? Once. Ten years ago. - Did your wife find out? - Yeah. I told her. In therapy. We were playing the honesty game. Red Roof Inn? / Yep. This was before they built the new lobby. You know, Captain, I think Monk might be onto something here. Maybe we should tag along. - Lieutenant, I think you might be right. - Oh, God. Hey, I'm married. I'm not dead. Oh. Oh. Wait, wait.! Wait for me.! Karen? Honey, hi. I can't make it for lunch today. Yeah. Something's popped up. Yeah. It's a homicide. Pretty nasty business. I No, I won't let it bother me. - I promise. Bye-bye. - Bethany Daniels. She was May's Sapphire Girl of the Month. Not this May. Last May. - Hi. I'm Bethany. - Yeah, honey. We know. So, how's your singing career coming? Oh, fine. Thank you for asking. Dexter will be down in a second. He'd like it if you just make yourselves comfortable. And if you feel like unwinding, there's an indoor pool at the end of the hall. We didn't We didn't bring our suits. He's new here. / I thought so. Well, I'll see you around. - See ya. / Bye. - Bye-bye. You can look now. She's gone. - What's this about? - That is how Dex got started. This is his first magazine. He almost went bankrupt, and then one day he put Miss Transistor on the cover. - And voila. - Voila? Yeah. He renamed it Sapphire magazine, dropped all the electronic stuff. - The rest is history. - Silicone and air-brushed women? Well, it's a kind of history. Oh, gentlemen, I am so sorry to keep you waiting. I hope you're not here to confiscate my Cubans. Cubano de Oro. Mmm. Ah! It's the finest cigar in the world. Would anybody care for one? No, thank you. We're from Homicide. I'm Captain Stottlemeyer. I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. I'm Dexter Larsen. Lieutenant Disher. / Hey, Dex. - Sharona Fleming. Adrian Monk. - Hi. ""Sharona. "" That's a beautiful name. It's from the Bible, isn't it? - Have you read the Bible? - Not lately. - Can I get you gentlemen anything? - Actually, we're We're here to talk about the death of of Elliott D'Souza. Yes. Yes, it's heartbreaking. I still can't believe it. Please.! Please.! Don't touch that. It's an original Carvasia. It's worth a hundred thousand dollars. Mr. Larsen, where Where were you on Sunday morning? Where was I? Let me show you. This is it, guys. This is the room where I get Oh, my God. We're really here. We're in his bedroom. Pinch me. / No. I didn't I didn't mean literally pinch me. It's a figure / Randy, shut up. We're done talking about pinching. You were asking about Sunday. I was right here, in bed, all morning. - Where you alone? - No, Mr. Monk. I had company. Ah, let's see. Um, Gwen. No, that was Friday. Ah, Brianna was No. That was also Friday. Sh Oh, oh. I remember. Could you ask Amber to come upstairs, please. Mr. Larsen, we understand that Elliott D'Souza was planning to shut down your magazine. Well, that's not true. The last time we spoke, he said he was still undecided. So, you can relax. Your magazine's safe. I'm always relaxed. Whoa there, cowboy. Don't hurt yourself. Lieutenant Disher, Get off the bed. Look at that. There's a mirror above the bed. Why would he need a mirror on the ceiling? Don't think about that now. Not now. Gentlemen, this is Amber Post, our Sapphire Girl of the Month and perhaps our Sapphire Girl of the Year. Uh, Amber, sweetheart, these gentlemen are from the police, and they're wondering where I was on Sunday morning. Oh. Well, would you like me to go into detail? - Yeah, I think that would be best. - No! No, no. No, no. Don't No details. Just the big, vague, general picture. Well, Dexter and I were here in bed all morning. And I remember we woke up and watched the sunrise together. And actually we didn't even leave the room until about noon. Which is when I got the call about Elliott. Oh. Sweetheart, that reminds me. I found this under your pillow. My earring. - I was looking for that. - Excuse me. You said You said you saw the sunrise, but these windows only face west and south, so Oh, I think what Amber meant to say was that we saw the dawn breaking together. We didn't actually see the sun literally rise, no. Oh. What I don't understand is, the earrings You know, Mr. Monk, I would love to answer all of your questions, but, right now, I am late for a tee time. / But I have a private golf course out back. Some friends are coming by. Mr. Monk, do you play golf? - No, I don't play. - I play golf. Lieutenant Disher does not play golf. Lieutenant Disher is still on duty. You play golf, don't you? - Me? I - Yes. You're good. Don't be modest. She's good. She's a She's a duffer. You duff. - Sure. I play. - Perfect. Great. / Great. Well, Sharona. Look at you. Sharona Fleming, this is Shawn Clemmons. Won the Calico Beach Classic last week in Santa Barbara. Hi. / And this is Danny Bonaduce. Yeah. This is a dream come true for you. Am I right? Uh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I like this girl. Oh, I, uh, see you brought your caddie. I hope you don't mind if I tag along. It's a beautiful day for a walk. Oh, yeah. Okay, so I lied. You can play this game. Very nice. Okay. Very sweet. Sharona, you're up next. Okay. / She makes a nice exit though. - Give me a three. - I think we start with one. No, no, no. It's too much club. I need a three-wood. Give me a three. Let's start with the one and then the two and then the three. It's better. Just go in order. You don't know what you're talking about. Give me the three. I c-can't. I can't. Okay. Give me the one. Now you're talkin'. - Give me the two. - Comin' up. This is the first club now. Okay? Was that so hard? / Yeah. You called him Sunday morning. - Pardon me? - You called Mr. D'Souza. We checked the records. Yes. I had a question about business. From your cell phone? / That's right. You were in bed all morning. Well, I have my cell phone with me at all times. - It's easier. - Dex. You're up. Mr. Monk, if you don't mind. I- I was also wondering about that earring. / What earring? The earring you found in your bed. You mean the one that Amber lost. It wasn't Amber's earring. The earring you found was for pierced ears. Her ears aren't pierced. Why would she lie about that? An honest mistake, Mr. Monk. It happens. Excuse me. That's game. I'm glad you were here to see that. I don't lose. Call me if you think of any snappy comebacks. I'll be inside. Hey, uh, you know, don't mind Dex. I've known him for years. He's got a bit of a temper, but he's a good guy. Good friend. Like last Saturday night, at the party, he wouldn't even let me drive home. - Were you drunk? - No. That's the thing. I only had a couple of beers, but Dex insisted I stay over. How could I argue? He even took my car keys. Son of a bitch. I told you to put a new battery in this thing. - I did. I put a new one in last week. - Did you check it? - Of course I checked it. - Well, it's dead now. Give me a hand here, will ya? Oh, hey, can I help you? Mr. Bonaduce left something in his car. It's the silver convertible over there. / Right. It's unlocked. Detective, caddie, car thief. You wear many hats, Mr. Monk. You, uh You looking for something? Did you drive this car, Mr. Larsen? - Maybe Sunday morning? - Why would you think that? Somebody was smoking a cigar in here. A lot of people smoke cigars, Mr. Monk. Right, but the texture and size of this cigar ash are consistent with those from your precious Cubano de Oros. - Hmm. - How did you do it? You mean how did I, uh, rise from humble beginnings to achieve all of this? No. No, I mean how did you murder Elliott D'Souza? What are you talking about? There was no murder. Elliott was alone. The door was locked. / Right. How did you do it? You've taken a great interest in me, and the truth is I've taken an interest in you too and your friend, Sharona. May I show you something? My research staff is first-rate. She must have been 19, maybe 20. You know what? Th-That's That's my favorite age. Hungry, with no inhibitions. These were taken in Atlantic City. She was using a different name, but my lawyers assure me that the release that she signed is solid. - I can publish them anytime I want. - What kind of man are you? I told you on the golf course, Mr. Monk. I do not lose. Now, Sharona, she has a son. How old is he now? / He's 12. Twelve. That's an impressionable age. I think we understand each other, don't we? Any more questions about what happened to Elliott? - No. - You can let yourself out. I told you. Dexter and I were in bed all night and all morning. He never left the room. Okay. We know it wasn't your earring. Why did you lie about that? I thought it was mine. I made a mistake. Amber, why are you protecting him? I wouldn't do that. I don't lie. You don't lie, huh? Well, in your pictorial, you never mentioned having a kid. And you said you live on a farm. Well, this may come as a shock to you, Lieutenant, but those profiles, they're completely made-up. You okay? - Oh, she is lying. - What? She is covering for that son of a bitch. Dexter Larsen is dirty. There is no doubt about it. Well, I don't know. - You don't know? - What do you mean you don't know? I'm thinking it probably was an accident. D'Souza was alone. - Look, the door was locked. - What about the earring? - And the threats. - And the phone call that morning. I don't think he did it. I was wrong. - I was wrong. - What the hell is going on here? Nothing. The case is over. And, uh, I'm gonna return Ms. Luden's money. Let's go home. Hey. Hey, what's goin' on? What do you mean? I know you. You were lying back there. Listen to me. It was an accidental death. I was wrong. - People change their minds. - That's true. People do, but you don't. What happened in that garage? Was Dexter there? Did he threaten you? Adrian, you might as well tell me. You know I'm never gonna let this go until you do. He He had some pictures. - What kind of pictures? - Compromising pictures. What, he's blackmailing you? With what? You never did anything. What, he's got pictures of you with your shirt not tucked in? That's ridiculous. - Not of me. - Well, who then? What, me? Oh, my God. From Atlantic City. I Adrian. Benjy was one, and I I was just so desperate. He's gonna publish them if we don't walk away. Did you see them? What? / Did you see those photos? No. Yes. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Talk about an embarrassment of riches. Once again, we had 12 stunningly beautiful girls to choose from, but only one can be Sapphire Girl of the Year. Ladies and gentlemen, the Sapphire Girl of the Year Amber Post! Now, Amber, here is your sapphire necklace / All right.! And the keys to your new Ferrari. Thank you. Do we have a plan? Yeah. The plan is, we find Dexter Larsen and kill him. Do we have a Plan ""B""? I told you you didn't have to come. This is between me and Dexter. All right. Just Just don't kill him. That would be so wrong. - What-What's he doing? - He's dancin'. - I don't think so. - Excuse me. Do you know where Dexter is? - Is Is he pointing? - He's dancin'. I think he's pointing. / Oy. Are you Sir? Are you pointing? Uh, no? Hello. Yes? Okay, you know what? I'm gonna be right back. Okay. Be careful. He's dangerous. Yeah? So am I. Hey. No horseplay. - And no diving. No diving. - Oh. Oh, my God. Have you seen Dexter? No? Amber? Are you okay? Hi. / Hello. You wanna take me home? I can't. I don't have a driver's license. I- I mean I have one, technically, but I hardly ever use it. I have trouble with the left turns. And the right turns. Turning. And yielding. Turning and yielding. Oh, she's beautiful. How old is she? She's four. / Beautiful. You know, it's, like I just want her to be proud of me. You know? / She will be. - I gotta go. - Hey, hey. Amber. Amber. You know, I have a kid too. And Believe me, I've done some things in my life that I pray to God my son doesn't find out about, you know? But we all make mistakes. The question is, what are you gonna do about it? Right? - You sound good. - You are very kind. I practice everyday, but never get any better. - You havin' fun? - No. But you can't go by me. Well, I'm Noelle. Now you tell me your name. That's how it works. I'm Adrian Monk. You can call me Adrian Monk. Are you a friend of Dexter's? I am a ghost of Sapphire Girls past. What year? /1985. If you have any back issues in your garage? You can look me up. No. I I don't have a garage. It seems like a lifetime ago. Not Not that I'm complaining. Dexter has been very good to me. He bought me an apartment, sent me to Europe on a promotional tour. So, uh, is your wife here? I'm not married. You're wearing a ring. She passed away. I can't take it off yet. I'm sorry. When did she die? Six years ago. Sharona Fleming. What a pleasant surprise. Come in. Don't be shy. That was a joke. We both know, uh, you're not shy at all. Dexter, I just want the pictures and the negatives. / Yeah, well, I want to invent the world's first fully integrated semiconductor, but we don't always get what we want. You like it? This is my first workbench. I had them move it here from Cincinnati. And that's how I started out. I was experimenting, tinkering. I was a nerd, publishing my little electronics magazine. I was the kind of guy that a woman like you never talked to. You still are. If you're here to beg, you're not off to a very promising start. And if you're here to threaten me, you can save your breath, because that release you signed is airtight. I have a kid. / Then keep your friend, Mr. Monk, out of my face. Okay, you listen to me, you twisted, porn-peddling freak. If you print those pictures, you're gonna hurt my son. You hurt my son, I'm comin' after you. And I am gonna dedicate my life to ruining yours. Yeah, well, take a number. ""Hold me, Adrian, my darling husband, ""true love's touch so rare a gift. ""How much more precious is your caress, ""who loves so deeply ""yet fears the warmth of hand on hand. ""Still, your love is given free ""only to me, only to me. "" That was That was the last poem she ever wrote. I just wanna go home. / Me too. Did you find him? / Get him. - What do you mean? - Just nail him. - But what about the pictures? - Forget the pictures. Just do whatever you have to do to nail that son of a bitch. - My babies. - Benjy. We have to talk. I didn't do anything. / I know. I know you didn't. I did. You know how sometimes you make a mistake and you mess up, but you know I still love you anyway? Yeah. / Yeah, well, sometimes mommies make mistakes too. And when you were a baby, I made a very big one. - What kind of mistake? - I can't tell you. - What, did you kill a guy? - No, I didn't kill anybody. What But somebody took pictures of me makin' this mistake. What kind of pictures? Oh. Benjy, the reason why I'm telling you this is because we're workin' on a case, and somebody is threatening to print these pictures if we don't let him go. - Is he a bad guy? - A very bad guy. Now, I had to tell you this because, if they ever got published, you're gonna hear about it in school. How do you feel about this? I don't know. / Honey. I was really trying to make a better life for us. Mom, you can't let somebody get away just because I might have a bad day at school. Have I told you how much I love you? Not since lunch. You know, I'm missing my show. One hour. He was alone. The door was locked. - From the inside. - From the inside. The phone rings. He's over here lifting weights. There's something wrong here. Something is wrong about this room. I just can't see it. / You will. Listen. Listen. Do you hear that? - Hello. - Noelle. Do you remember me? Oh, yeah. From the party. Uh, Mr. Monk. - This is my assistant, Sharona. - Hi. - Do you mind if we come in? - Uh, sure. Well, you'll have to excuse the mess. I'm still unpacking from my trip. Noelle, did you know that you were directly below Elliott D'Souza's apartment? No. No, I knew he lived in the building. At the party, you mentioned that Dexter Larsen found this apartment for you. Yeah, that's right. - When was that? - Uh, about a month ago. - And then he sent you out of town? - Yeah, that's right. To London and Paris on a promotional tour. So, what's all this about anyway? - Did you make these? - What? These indentations in the carpet. Uh, maybe. I might have. Or maybe they came from that chair. No. No, they're not from the chair. No. No. No. I'm not allowed to let anybody else in here. / Just relax. No. Dex is gonna be so mad at me. - It's okay. / But it's my job! - What the hell is goin' on? Dexter Larsen, that's a warrant, duly sworn, authorizing us to search your house. Dex, I tried to call you. They've been here an hour. - They've been looking everywhere. - Looking for what? Looking for proof that you killed Elliott D'Souza. Mr. Monk. Are you serious? You My Carvasia. I told you not to touch that. Sorry. I'll get it. / No.! No.! Don't touch it. I'll do it. It's very valuable. Is there a problem? What's wrong? Pick it up. Can't weigh more than 15 pounds. All right. What did you do? Did you glue it down? Excuse me. If I may? No, not glued. Your turn. We found it, Dexter. - Found what? - The magnet that you built. Randy, you can come out now, unless you're enjoying yourself down there. - Come on, come on. - What's this supposed to be? What, you don't recognize that? We found it in your workshop. It had fingerprints all over it. Go ahead. I never realized how strong an electromagnet like that could be. I'm told that one can lift a car. With your background in electronics, building a device like this was child's play. You needed a car battery. You borrowed one from your own Mercedes the night before the murder. You couldn't risk driving one of your own cars, so you took Mr. Bonaduce's keys and borrowed his. And since you had found Noelle Winters's apartment for her, you had copies of all her keys. You knew the apartment was empty because you had sent Ms. Winters to Europe. Now you were where you wanted to be directly below Elliott D'Souza's penthouse, right under his private gym. You knew Elliott worked out every morning. You could hear the weights clanging through the ceiling. You phoned him to make sure he was in position. And then you killed him Without ever setting foot in the room. That's why the computer disk was erased and the clock was a little off. I knew there was something wrong with that room. Everything was turned around. The pens and the stapler, they were all facing the same way. All right. So? I made a magnet. So, what? I make a lot of things. It's my hobby. It doesn't prove anything. I told you. I was here all night and all morning. No, you weren't. It's all right. Go ahead. He offered to make me Sapphire Girl of the Year if I lied and said that we were together that morning. She's willing to testify in court. Your necklace. Your Ferrari. I don't want 'em. I don't need 'em. Looks like you picked the wrong two women to mess with. Dexter Larsen, you are under arrest for the premeditated murder of Elliott D'Souza. You need to come with me, sir. Sharona. / What? I found this in his office. They're your photos and all the negatives. You won't have to worry about them anymore. Did you look at 'em?"
"So the salesman says, ""Try the cleats. "" I said, ""What do I need cleats for? I work in a tollbooth for God's sake.

I thought you didn't like Kenny. I don't know. I changed my mind. Oh, my God. I've got to get more copies. Mr. Monk, I tell you before. Do not ring the bell. - Stop that! - It's 10:00, Mrs. Ling. - The ticket says, ""Tuesday, 10 a. m."" - It's an approximation, Mr. Monk. It means ""about 10:00."" Not at 10:00, you crazy man. What's wrong with you? Okay, give me your ticket. Oh, Mr. Monk, I told you before, no copies. - Where's the original ticket? - It's safe at home in my file. What do you need a file for? This is dry cleaning ticket! Stop that. Why you let him xerox? - I'm not with him every minute. - Oh, okay. Here you go. Four shirts, okay? That's $24. - Why do I pay more? - Because you're so much trouble, okay. I got to clean everything twice. Then I got to stand here and talk to you for like half an hour. Okay, good. Thank you. Bye-bye, now. Thank you, Mrs. Ling. Thank you. / Wait. - What is it now? - Well, this is all wrinkled. Well, it's cellophane. It's gonna get wrinkled. - That's cellophane, crazy man! - Come on. - What What's this? - Oh, that? Th-That's nothing. - Okay, bye-bye, now. Bye-bye. - Go. Let's go. This isn't my button. Your button fall off. But I found a new one. - Identical, no difference. - Looks the same to me. The button matches, but the stitching is all different. See? O-On the other ones, the thread is crisscrossed. - But here, look. It's parallel! - That's how I sew them. - Parallel! That's my style. - But it doesn't match. - I have to live in this town! - All right fine. We'll be right there. Hey, another job. I've got a good mind to take my business elsewhere. Oh, please, do, okay. Quit me, okay. Bye-bye! No, no. Relax, Mrs. Ling. I was I was just kidding. Just kidding. You're the best dry cleaner in the city. - I'm not going anywhere. - Adrian, stop that Handcuffed? Handcuffed to one wrist and tied to 70 feet of rope. - Oh, God! - And then he was dragged west seven-tenths of a mile. I just saw the body or what's left of it. - Oh, God. - The M.E. Said he's never seen anything like it. - There's no end to it. - What do you mean? I mean, this is number nine. Nine bizarre murders in the past two weeks. Every time my beeper goes off, - my heart skips a beat. - Are they connected? No. No connection at all. I mean, four have been men, five women, all different ages. Latino, white, black. - And the M.O.'s? - All different. There's been a couple of shootings, different weapons, a hit-and-run, a drowning, an electrocution. I mean, it's-it's-it's like - a full moon every night. - And you're sure that the cases have absolutely nothing in common? Well, they have one thing in common, Monk. We can't solve them. I swear, there's something in the water. Saw the picture of you and your new boyfriend. He's not my boyfriend. / Hmm. I was thinking of voting for him, but, uh, now I worry about his judgment. I mean, if he's going out with you, there's no telling what else he might do. - Start a nuclear war or something. - I'll tell him that you said that. - No, don't. Just I was joking. - Then I'll tell him you were joking. No, d-don't say that. Just don't say anything. - I brought you some coffee. - Thank you. I appreciate it. - Actually, it's for Sharona. - Oh, thanks. Tell Kenny I say ""Hi. "" / I will. He stayed on his feet as long as he could. Then he fell, dragged away. I could hear him screaming and begging. It could have been me. It should have been me. - What do you mean? - I was wide open. - Frankie had three cars in line. - Wait. You were wide open? But the killer went to Mr. Pulaski's booth and waited in line? / Yeah. - Why would he do that unless - He was after that particular guy. So, you didn't see the driver, and you didn't get a make of the car? Sorry. It might have been a Chrysler. I'm not sure. - Captain, what's this? - The killer paid his toll with that. That's supposed to be at the lab. Lieutenant? Hey! Hey, guys. What is this, a high school dance? Give the girl some room. Let her breathe. Come here. I want to talk to you. I understand that you are seeing Kenny Shale. - Oh, it's nothing serious. - Yes, it is. I wanna tell you something, Sharona. Your life is about to change. Everybody you know is gonna want a piece of you. You're not going to know who to trust. Monk can't help you with this, all right? - Mm-hmm. - He's He's brilliant, but he's Monk. - He's lost in Monkland. - Mm-hmm. Now, I've been where you are. I've been in the spotlight. And Well, here. I want you to take that. - What is it? - That's my cell phone number, okay? You call me 24-7 if you need anything. Yeah. I just don't want to see you get hurt. Oh. Thanks a lot. Thanks. / Yeah. Oh, I was thinking, um, maybe we could get together, do a double date kind of thing. Me and Karen, you and Kenny? I've always liked Kenny. Kenny, he's He's a good guy. - He's good people. - You called him a weasel. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did, three weeks ago. No, I never said ""weasel. "" I said he was a a w Oh, yeah, I said ""weasel. "" I called him a weasel. But then, you see, I That's not a bad thing. I had a weasel. A weasel is a noble animal, all right. It's It's a term of endearment. Jerry! Hey, how you doing, you weasel? Good to see you. See, I call everybody a weasel. Captain. Captain, look at this. His coin tray was almost empty. He was just starting his shift? - That's right. He was. - So the killer had to have been waiting - for Pulaski to come on duty. - That's right. I remember. The guy was parked over there by the call box for about 20 minutes. / Hmm. So he was waiting? What do you think, Sharona? Me? / Yeah. She's dating Kenny Shale, who's running for mayor. Yeah, I know. L I've been reading about him. I don't think she really likes him. I think she just likes all the attention. Everyone in the department has been fawning over her, - laughing at her jokes, getting her coffee. - Maybe you should be happy for her. - Can I tell you something? - Yeah, that's why we're here. The last few days, I find myself thinking that if Kenny Shale is elected and Sharona is still with him, maybe she could She could help to get you reinstated to the department. - I'm as bad as any of them. - Oh, Adrian, no, no, no. You see, there's nothing wrong with being ambitious. It just means that you're human. Human. It's been a long time since anybody's called me that. - What's wrong with your shirt? - Nothing. - W-W-Why are you holding it like that? - I put on the wrong shirt. What? There's a stain? Because, see, I don't I don't see anything. It's the button. Mrs. Ling sewed it back on. - The stitching is all different. - The-The The stitching? It's not crisscrossed.! It's parallel. D- Don't Don't pretend you don't see it. Arlene? Arlene Carney? Yes? - How are you, Arlene? - Who is that? The lady Well, the dead lady, sh-she bought a ticket Did she appear to be waiting for somebody? / No, sir. - Did she look frightened? - No, sir. It fell off and the dry cleaner sewed it on wrong. - Sir? - Weren't you staring at my button? - No, sir. - Whatever. - We haven't met. I'm Chuck Evered. - The theater manager. Adrian Monk. Sharona? Sharon Sharona? If you're looking for Jackie O., she's over there. You know, Kenny took me to city hall last night, and we had dinner - in the private dining room. - Wow, really? Maybe I'll bring you next time. Kenny might need a bodyguard. Hello? Hi, Kenny. Whoa, guys! Guys, keep it down. Her Royal Highness is talking to Mr. Kenny Shale. Go ahead. - No, no, no. It's nothing - Go ahead, kid. - You're doing fine. - So, she goes inside, and about - a minute later, a man steps up. - Can you describe him? - I couldn't really see his face. - He was holding a handkerchief over his mouth like he had a cold. He bought a ticket for the same movie. And And I asked him if he wanted the combo special, which is a large popcorn and a medium drink. A $9 value at only 7.50. H-He said no. And then he went inside and killed her, which I had no idea he was planning to do. - And he paid you with this? - Yes, sir. Great, thanks a lot. You need to go downtown and talk to a sketch artist. Jerry? Officer Johnson will give you a ride. Captain? / What? - You've got a serial killer on your hands. - Monk, the woman was strangled. She didn't know any of the other victims. I am not crying wolf until I am 100% sure. This is definitely the same man that killed Frank Pulaski at the toll booth. - A lot of people pay with $10 bills. - It's brand-new. There are a lot of brand-new tens out there right now. The serial numbers are sequential. - What? You remember that? - Well, I got a pretty good look at it. The bill at the toll booth ended with 6092B. This is 6093B. A serial killer. Captain. Washington just sent this down. It's a prelim psych profile. Let me guess. The killer is between does not work in an office, probably spent time in the military and definitely hates his mother. Yeah. How'd you know? Because that's what they always say. That's scrap paper. What about the $ 10 bills? Anything on them? They're from a bank in San Mateo. Wells Fargo, untraceable. Of course they are. All right, everybody, listen up! Listen up! We're not gonna find him flailing around in the dark. Let's communicate, keep each other briefed. We're going Dumpster diving. We're gonna What are you doing? What is that? I'm leaving a space for the next victim. Take that down. Take it down. There is no next victim. We're stopping the son of a bitch at 10. Well, thank you. Thank you. Sharona! Are you cold? - Here you go. - Oh, thank you, Kevin. - Sharona! Look at this. Look. - Sharona Fleming? Look. - Oh, yes, I'm Sharona Fleming. - These are from, uh, Kenny Shale. Oh, my God. They're beautiful. Thank you. - Let me get you a vase for these. - Okay. Sharona! Hello? Hey Sharon Sharona, look. Miss Fleming? Lieutenant? Captain? Captain, can I show you something? Look, Lieutenant. Look at this one, - this one and that one. - Yeah, the calendars. Exactly. These three have the same calendar on their wall. Yeah, we noticed that yesterday, Monk. Come here. I want to show you something. They send me one of those every year. Probably print a million of them. Actually, they print 25,000. I talked to the insurance company last night. It's a single office, mom and pop operation, still owned by Mr. Henry Smalls. It can't be a coincidence. Captain, three of them, maybe more, with the exact same calendar. We at least have to check this guy out. We already did. Lieutenant? Henry Smalls, 47 years old. He's been away for the last two weeks at an insurance convention in Baltimore. - He's due back tonight. - He's been out of town, Monk. Okay, okay. But maybe he's the common denominator. Maybe you might be right. But I cannot put this on the top of my pile. I have 700 leads. At least half of them are stronger than this is. I will get to that, eventually, I promise. - But he's coming home tonight. - I said eventually. - Did I miss anything? - No, nothing much. We're just trying to catch a serial killer before he strikes again. Hardly worth mentioning really. Listen, there's a possible lead. You and I are going to stake out the guy's house later. You mean tonight? / Yeah. I can't. This is Kenny's only night off. Adrian, I told you three days ago that I needed tonight off. Sharona, this guy's coming home tonight. I have to talk to him. Okay, so who's stopping you? You don't need me. I don't need you? Haven't you been paying attention - for the last three years? - Hire a Kelly girl. A what? / A temp. You pay them by the hour. They'll do anything. - I can't bring a temp on a stakeout! - Oh! All I know is that - I'm seeing Kenny tonight. - And I'm going on that stakeout. Yeah, that's the house. Number 782. - He'll be home any minute. - I finally got you in the backseat, and after only three dates. Um, Kenny, uh, you've got to behave yourself. This is official police business, you know what I mean? I am so sorry. I'm just so excited. This is my first stakeout. Oh, right. Well, I brought you some doughnuts. Oh. Real stakeout food. Okay. And I brought the vino. Now, this wine is 30 years old. So, let's not let it live another minute, okay? Doughnuts and red wine. This might be the best date I ever had. Here, baby, take this. Hey, Adrian, thanks again for inviting me. - Don't make a mess back there. - It's my car. That's true. Don't make a mess back there. Hello? Yes, sir. Thursday's perfect. Yes, sir, I'll see you there. Well, yes, sir, she's right here. I'll tell her. Yes, sir. Thank you. The governor says hi. - That was the governor? - Mm-hmm. - He said hi to me? - Yes, he did. - Adrian, did you hear that? - Did he happen to mention me? - I met him during the campaign. - No. No, he didn't. Mmm! Saved his life, got him elected, that's all. Kenny, has Sharona told you about some of the cases I've been working on? You know, I, uh I could do so much more if I was, uh, officially reinstated. - Mmm. Isn't that good? - No, it But not Kenny, not now. I told you, remember? Not now. - Adrian, what are you doing? - The odometer's 9999. I'm trying to get it to zero. / Why? So - then it'll be at zero. - But w-will that work? Do the numbers change if you just go backwards and forwards? It's changing. Look. There it goes. - It's not moving. - Yeah, it's moving. It's moving. Oh, no. Oh, God! Oh, no! Look out behind you.! Look out! Look out! Henry Smalls! Henry Smalls! - Adrian! What are you doing? - I don't know! It's number 11, damn it. All right, nobody's going home. I want to know how many of our victims knew Mr. Henry Smalls. We're gonna revisit every crime scene, every house. We huddle back here at 0900. Go. Go! You okay? / Yeah. What happened to your hands? You hurt both of your hands? No, just the left one. Why do you have bandages on both? Right. Symmetry. Where is our future mayor? He went home. He was pretty shaken up. - I'll bet he is. - Grace under pressure. That's what I look for in a chief executive. - Can you I.D. This guy? - I'm not sure. He was wearing a ski mask. - Well, you were right about Henry Smalls. - Except, I honestly thought he might be a suspect, not the next victim. Yeah, but it is something. It's something real. We've got our foot in the door. Thank you. Oh, Monk, what the hell is going on here? Okay. A Hispanic plumber, a retired white cop, an African-American school teacher - what do they have in common? - Absolutely nothing. Exactly. They have nothing in common. Different ages, occupations, some were rich, some poor. Captain, this is a very diverse group. They are - too diverse. - Too diverse? I'm talking statistics. You'd have to work hard, really hard, to find a group this different. Plus, look at this. The blue pins indicate where they lived, right? / Yep. The murders took place all throughout the Bay Area, but the victims all lived in Marin County. - What are the odds of that? - Go on. Go, go, go, go, go. A diverse group, all registered to vote. You know where you find a group like that? Yes, yes. On a jury.! Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Hang on. Hang on. He's right. They all served on the same jury six years ago. - A jury. - On a jury! Eleven victims. What did they have in common? They all served together on the same jury six years ago in Marin County. It was a personal injury lawsuit. A handyman named Ian Agnew fell off of a roof and he landed on a metal pipe, which was sticking up out of the ground. Now, he sued the homeowners, a Stewart and Lisa Babcock, for negligence. Apparently, part of the pipe is still in the guy's head. - He has a pipe in his head? - Yep. He's got a three-quarter inch galvanized metal pipe in his head. They couldn't remove all of it. - He has a pipe in his head? - He was awarded $700,000. The homeowners' insurance paid for the whole thing. It was a routine trial. Except, six years later, the jury's being killed off one at a time. Excuse me, Captain. What happened to the 12th juror? That's a good question, Kenny. You know, I could use a guy like you on the force. The 12th and only surviving juror is a fellow named Cassidy. Wallace J. Cassidy. - We're looking for him right now. - Did anything unusual - happen during the trial? - Well, not according to this. They deliberated for a day and a half. They went and visited the scene of the accident. Then they were sequestered at a motel for a night, and they delivered their verdict. - It's all very straightforward. - Captain! You ready for this? Randy, you could be halfway through your first sentence now. We just picked up Juror Number 12 at a casino in Wallenpaupack. He gambles a lot. He's always in debt. He did it. - What? He confessed? - No, he lawyered up. - He's not saying a thing. - But you think he's the guy? He tried to bolt when we picked him up. The guy put up a hell of a fight. And Are you ready for this? Yes, Randy, we're ready! You don't have to ask. - You never have to ask. - We just came from his house. There was a body part in the freezer. A human finger. Really? Oh, the D.A.'s gonna love that. They love body parts in the freezer. But none of the victims were missing a finger. Yeah, well, uh, he killed somebody else. I mean, that's why they call them ""psychotic. "" Why would he wait six years, and then kill everybody else on the jury? I don't know and I don't care. Congratulations, Captain. I'll be sure to mention you in my statement. Whoa, whoa. Hey, hang on. Kenny, uh, I think I should go with you. They're gonna have a lot of questions - and, uh, I know this case inside and out. - Oh, all right. I'll, uh I'll say a few words - and then I'll introduce you, okay? - Good deal. - Oh, uh, Kenny? - Yeah, babe? Wait. Crooked. / Thank you, honey. Captain! Thank you, honey. Shall we? / Yeah. Wait! Cap Captain? Why don't we slow down here? I mean, what if I can I.D. This guy? I'd like to give it a try. You want to be sure about this, right? Number 5, could you slide a little to your right. A little more. Thank you. Number 1, you have some lint on your jumpsuit. Number 2, could you help number one? Adrian. Do you see the guy from last night? Number 3, could you trade places with Number 2? Number 3, stay where you are. Monk, do you see the guy or not? Listen to me. This is very important for you. It's very important for everybody. So, for the record, before you say anything, please count to the number four. Number 4, could you step forward? Could you straighten that number? - He's not the guy. - He's not the guy? - His fingernails are too long. - His fingernails? The guy I fought last night didn't have any fingernails. - I think he chewed them. - Monk, this guy is the only - surviving member from that jury. - Oh, we found a finger in his icebox. He's not the guy. I want to know more about that trial. I think I should talk to the handyman who fell off the roof. Captain, the press is all over this thing. We can't keep a lid on it. All right, Monk, look. You go You go and you talk to the handyman, okay? But you make it quick because I have got to go public tonight. Go. - Thank you for seeing us. - Oh, I don't mind. I don't get many visitors. So, what can I do for you? Mr. Agnew, we were wondering about your accident. Please, sit down. Uh, Ian, I used to be a nurse. Is there anything I can do? No, thank you. It comes and goes. It's the pipe. I have a piece of pipe in my head. Oh. / I don't get many visitors. Please, sit sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, - sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. - Sir? Uh, about your accident? Oh, the accident. I really don't remember much about it. I, uh We were building a cabana near the pool for the Babcocks, and, uh, I was working on the roof. And there was a a tile loose. And the next thing I knew, I woke up and I was a human smokestack. I'll get it! Hello? Hello? It's a wrong number. I get 'em all the time. How's that coffee? Bad dog.! Anyway, I, uh I haven't worked since. / Huh. - How did you get the job? - Mrs. Babcock hired me, although by the time I had started, she wasn't there anymore. They split up. She ran off. I never got the whole story. I dealt mostly with, uh, her husband, Stew. I'll get it! You know, I just changed my phone number and it doesn't seem to help. I don't get many visitors. - Did you go to the trial? - I testified. - Did you spend any time with the jury? - No, ma'am. I wish I had. Uh I wanted to thank them. They were very generous. I don't get many visitors. ¢Ü Tell me your answer true ¢Ü¢Ü Bad dog! You know what I think I miss the most? Not having this pipe in my head. I have to take this. Hello? Hello? I can't believe you're not the craziest man in the room. - How did you get this number? - We'll let ourselves out. - You tell me who this is right now.! - Go. Go. Go, go, go. I don't believe that for a minute. Ah, that was before my time. I didn't even meet Stewart until after the trial. Would you like some lemonade? Um / No, thank you. Stew, these people want to talk about the handyman. - What handyman? - The one who sued you. - Why? That's ancient history. - Is that where he fell? - Uh, yes, it was. - Mr. Babcock, were you at home - when the accident occurred? - No, I was on vacation with my wife. - My first wife. The Dragon Lady. - Did you attend the trial? Well, there was no reason to. It was my insurance company's headache. What is this all about? I mean, that was settled, - like, six years ago. - It's, uh - It's probably nothing. - Will you stop it? Please? Well, there's another another case involving - a few of the jurors. - The jurors? Uh, yeah. Did any of them try to contact you? The jurors? No. Why would they? - Thank you. - Do you have a trash can? - Just toss it anywhere. - It's wet. - It's a leaf. - Why don't you just - throw it on the ground? - I'll throw it out. - You'll thank me later. - Uh, around the corner in the kitchen. Thank you. I had so much fun the other night. Did you? Yeah. We have to do it again. I know. Oh, you're so bad. Uh, hold on. Hold on. Uh, Kenny wants to know how we're doing. Tell him I don't know yet. The jury's still out, so to speak. Uh, Kenny, you know what? He-He's a little distracted right now. Why don't I call you back later? Okay. Y-You did? Oh, my God. Thank you. You're an angel. An angel. All right, I'll speak to you later. Bye. Adrian, do you know what Kenny just did? He took care of all of my parking tickets. He's like Superman. That's strange. / What? Lisa Babcock said she didn't meet her husband till after the trial. But look. This picture was taken more than six years ago. - How do you know? - I recognize that restaurant. It's O'Malleys on Richmond. They haven't allowed smoking in there since 1995. And And he was chewing his nails. - Who, Babcock? - Just now. - In the pool. - So what does it mean? - It means they're a couple of liars. - Or maybe worse. Maybe a lot worse. Kenny, come here. Kenny, come here! What the hell are you doing? I didn't authorize this. I did. Captain, the people of San Francisco are frightened. They deserve to know that we have a suspect in custody. This is not a campaign stop, Kenny. Monk could not I.D. The guy. Monk could not I.D. The guy's fingernails, Captain. That's just not good enough. Now, I want to reassure the citizens that we have made a significant breakthrough in this case. - But we haven't made - Captain.! We just found this photograph in Wallace Cassidy's house. - Oh. Who's this? - I don't know, but, uh, - she's definitely a woman. - She looks like she's frozen. Yeah, Captain, this picture, plus the finger in the freezer, plus he tried to run, plus he is the only surviving - member on that jury. - What else do you need? Okay. - Okay, go ahead. - Good afternoon. In a few minutes, Deputy Mayor Kenny Shale will be making his brief statement regarding the recent series of homicides in Monk, you're too late. They're about to name Wallace Cassidy - as the primary suspect. - Oh! No. No, they're making a mistake. Lieutenant, there is something else going on here. Stewart and Lisa Babcock are involved in all of this. I know it. The homeowners where the guy fell off the roof. How? - We're still working on it. - Well, can you prove it? - Not yet. - What Wh-What's this? The coroner found it. It's a sleeve or part of it. Henry Smalls, Juror Number 12 he was clutching it when he died. He must have ripped it off the killer. Monk, forget it. It's a dead end. It's already gone through the lab. It's untraceable. time for a ""Q"" and ""A"" later, but remember, officially, this is still an open case, so we're not going to be able to get Captain! Captain! What have you got? What's up? L I think I know what's been going on here. It wasn't Juror Number 12. It was Stewart and Lisa Babcock. What? The couple that's being sued? Are you sure? - Do you mean, am I certain? - Yes. Yes. That's what - I mean by, ""Are you sure?"" - Not yet. L I need an hour. Just one hour and then we'll know. - Is there a problem? - Captain? Are we about ready? Hang on just a second. Kenny, Monk needs an hour. - I'm gonna give it to him. - What about the press? The press can wait. That's what they get paid for. I can't. If we don't start now, we're not going to make the 6:00 news, all right? I'm going to go ahead with or without you, Captain. It's called ""leadership. "" No. No, Kenny, it's called grandstanding. - Let's go. - Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Oh, hey, sweetie, I'm glad you stayed. Watch this. A star is born. No, no, wait. Kenny, Kenny. Listen to me. You're making a big mistake. This is the kind of mistake that - that people won't forget. - Well, Sharona, sweetheart, you don't - understand how this game is played. - But you said you trusted me. Well, I trusted you to pick out my tie, babe. Not with the big stuff. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much for coming. I'd like you to know we've made a significant breakthrough in this case. Mr. And Mrs. Babcock? San Francisco P.D. I'm Captain Stottlemeyer. Were you folks going somewhere? - We're just getting away for the weekend. - Yes, we have a house at the beach. - Well, I'm glad we caught you. - ""I trust you with my ties. "" Where the hell does he get off? Where the hell I don't know. Are those passports in your handbag, Mrs. Babcock? You're not leaving for the weekend, are you? You're leaving for good because you heard they - just arrested Wallace Cassidy. - Who? Fixes a few parking tickets and you think he can talk to me that way? - Nobody talks to me that way. Nobody! - Wallace Cassidy. He was on the jury when you were being sued six years ago. What are you talking about? Why would we care about - somebody on a jury? That - Maybe because you knew he was going to confess. Not for murder, for blackmail. Juror Number 12 was blackmailing you. He knew that you had murdered your first wife. After Ian Agnew fell off your roof six years ago and sued you for negligence, the jury was brought here to visit the scene of the accident. One of them, Wallace Cassidy, wandered off. Most likely, he was looking for something to steal. Mr. Cassidy had a gambling problem. - He was always in debt. - I can't believe I went out with him. He's not even my type. I felt sorry for that stupid weasel. Sharona? / What! We're working here. Mr. Cassidy never did find anything to steal. He found something a lot more valuable. It was the first Mrs. Babcock. He didn't leave without taking a picture and one ofher fingers. We have that picture, and we have the finger. It won't be hard to prove who it belongs to. He sent you an anonymous note demanding money. You knew it was from one of the jurors, but you didn't know which one. At the time you didn't really care. Cassidy was small-time, and he wasn't asking for much. So you paid him and you thought that was the end of it. But it didn't end there. Cassidy kept coming back for more. So you decided to kill the blackmailer. But since you didn't know which of the 12 jurors it was, they all had to go, one at a time. Bastard! - Not you. - Sharona, murderers, okay? Relax, honey. They can't prove a thing. If they could, they would have arrested us - as soon as they got here. - That's true. I couldn't prove a thing until I found this. Your shirtsleeve was torn off when you attacked - Juror Number 11. - Can you prove that's my shirt? No, sir, I can't. But I know someone who can. As soon as I saw this, I had the strange feeling that the killer and I might have something in common. - We both use the same dry cleaner. - Mr. Monk, why you bring me here? I got to close my shop. I'm losing money. - You're just my worst customer. - The longest car ride of my life. I'm sorry, Mrs. Ling, but this is very important. - Do you recognize this? - Yeah. Yeah, I know this shirt. I clean this shirt. Silk. Beautiful shirt. Hanger, no starch. What you do to this shirt? Mrs. Ling, there must be a thousand shirts like this in the world. How do you know you cleaned this particular one? You know how. The button, it fall off. - I sewed it back on. - The thread is parallel, not crisscrossed. No one else sews a button on like this. I told you, Mr. Monk. That's my style! Always complaining about the button. Hey, Mr. Babcock! When I fixed this shirt for you, you don't complain, right, - 'cause you're a good customer. - Mrs. Ling, are you certain that this shirt - belongs to Mr. Babcock? - Yeah, I'm sure. He's a good customer. You come back anytime, Mr. Babcock. - Ma'am, he just killed 11 people. - Twelve. Let's not forget about the first Mrs. Babcock, who I'll bet is buried under that new porch. Well, he's still a good customer. Not crazy like that Mr. Monk over there. Mr. And Mrs. Babcock, could you step back inside, please? We'd like to ask you a few more questions. - Right this way. - This way, please. - Thank you, Mrs. Ling. - Yeah, yeah, all right. Hey, saw your boyfriend on TV last night. Kenny Shale. He's a good man. I like him. - Yeah? Well, I like Mr. Monk better. - Oh! Mr. Monk's a crazy man. Well, I like him better. / No. I do. / Stop saying that. Go away, Mr. Monk! No! No more Mr. Monk! - No, no, no. Go! You! Go away! - Oh, forget it. We'll find another cleaners. You know Hey! Hey, hey! What are you doing? - The meter ran out. - I thought you fed the meter? I was carrying this. Hey, hey. Do you know Kenny Shale? - He's a good friend of mine. - You mean the former deputy mayor? Former? / Yeah. Your good friend resigned this morning. It was on the news. Have a nice day. - Well, I guess the party's over. - I don't miss him. I miss the attention, but not him. Here. - What's this? - I'm not paying for it. - It's your car! - You didn't put money in the meter. Okay, let's compromise. You pay the ticket, and I don't. - What kind of compromise is that? - Well, that's the economical kind."
"Hey. Check this out. - Left-handed! - Yeah, nice shot. Hey, skip Mrs. Nelson's house. She's on vacation. - Why don't we get a vacation? - Yeah. Where do you want to go, huh? Acapulco? I don't care. I mean, just anywhere without these papers, you know? That'd be nice. Hey, what are you doing? That's Mr. Monk's house. You can't throw it. No, no. Not that one. The paper's wrinkled. He likes it smooth. No, no, no. Not there. You gotta go and put it on the front door. Hey, it's gone! What do you mean it's gone? Well, it's not there. Just give me another one. Let's go Hey, did you put it in the center of the mat? It needs to be centered Hey! What are you doing? Nestor? Nestor, what are you doing? Oh, my God! What's happening? Nestor, are you okay? Nestor?

All right, boys and girls, moms and dads, this crime scene is getting cold. - Donohue? - Yes, sir? I want you to get two uniforms and start knocking on doors. Any car that's not parked in the driveway, run the plates. So, is that coffee ready yet? Uh, what are they doing here? What? It's a crime scene. There was a murder right out front. / But - They had to set up somewhere. - C Hello! Excuse me! Don't touch that. Who are you talking to? Everyone. How's he doing? Oh, great. No problem. Hey, Monk. I need to ask you a couple questions. - Did you know the victim? - Yes, it was Nestor Alverez. He and his cousin have been delivering my newspaper for two years. Now, according to the cousin, Nestor caught the killer stealing your newspaper. That's what the fight was about. - My newspaper? - Yeah. Yep. Nestor puts down a paper, the killer stole it. Puts down another paper, the killer steals that one. Does that make any sense to you? / Uh-uh. What did he look like? The cousin can't identify the guy. Did you hear anything? - What time was that? - 5:30. Oh, no. I wouldn't have heard a thing. Sleeping? No I was vacuuming. Hello? Uh, excuse me. - Did something happen? - There's been a homicide. A homicide? You mean a murder? Holy Toledo. Here? Right out front, early this morning. Somebody killed the paperboy. - Holy Toledo. - And you are? I'm Kevin Dorfman. ""D"" for dolly. ""O"" as in orange. - ""R"" as in Robert. - Dorfman. Yeah, I got it. - Where do you live, Kevin? - I live upstairs. Did you hear or see anything early this morning, say around 5:30? No, sir, I did not. I was, you know, with someone. Your girlfriend? I guess so. Holy Toledo, I have a girlfriend. Well, we're gonna need to question her too. - How long have you lived upstairs? - Seven months. Before that, let's see, I lived at 12 Grant Street. Before that, until she moved to Baltimore because she had to take a new job. Great. Thank you. Before that, I lived at Before that, I lived at 8 Todd Road and 45 Radcliffe Street, consecutively. My first place, though, on 26 Armory Lane, that was a studio. But what I did was you might want to write this down on a separate page for yourself I put the bed up on a loft to create some space. Adrian, Adrian. Give it to me. / Ugh. Can I go home now? - You are home. - Oh, yeah. Just relax. It's fine. Oh, excuse me. Where's the bathroom? I, uh I don't have one. You don't have a bathroom? Don't get me started. I am still so angry at that architect. Excuse me? Excuse me? What are you doing? - Wiping my feet. - On a mat? Wha Kevin, is it true? - Somebody was killed? - The paperboy. - Oh, God. - Right out front. - When? - This morning, around 5:30 while we were, you know / Mm. Mm. Sharona. Hi. How are you? - Oh, good. Yeah. - Yeah? Lieutenant, hi. Vicki. / Hi. - Vicki - Salinas. Oh, you work at the Stop-N-Go on Ridgedale, right? That's how we met. That's how we met. Vicki's been serving me my doughnut and super-sized latte every morning for the past five months. Well, when we first met, I wasn't super-sizing. No. But then last July, I had to pull a couple of all-nighters because I was working on that new inventory diagnostic software. - I told you about that job. You remember? - Yes, you did. Mm-hmm. But wait It wasn't July, it was August. How long have you two been going out? - Since yesterday. - Really? Wow. That's That's fast. - Yeah. - Yeah I've been asking her out all summer long. ""No. "" ""No. "" ""Drop dead. "" ""No. "" But then suddenly last night, ""Yes"". And I've been saying ""Yes"" ever since. Hey, Sharona. You're still Monk's nurse, right? Try to get him out of here. Good luck. Hey. - How are you doing? - I was just thinking about the murder. Well, let's go outside. You think better outside. Why would anybody want to kill a paperboy? What were they after? Maybe he was too cheap to buy his own. Why would he steal two? That's the thing. He could have just taken the first one, but he stuck around. He wanted both. I think there's something in the newspaper he didn't want me to see. - What? - I don't know. Maybe an article about another crime he committed. Do me a favor. Go down the street - buy me a newspaper. - Okay. Okay, - but you're coming with me. - I can't. If something spills, I want to be here. Adrian, trust me. If something spills, you don't want to be here. - That's a good point. - Let's go. There's something in here. Something they did not want me to see. Look at the employee of the month. Kevin's new girlfriend. What does she see in him? Oh, I guess you never know. I mean, look who I married. Yes. People used to say Trudy was way out of my league. - Do you think they were right? - Oh, of course they were. Oh, here. They have Sierra Springs. It's my favorite. Oh, could you grab me a cream soda? I love their cream sodas. It's the only place you can get it. Ah. Some kid must have tightened it on for a joke. Give it to me. Here. I loosened it. No, you didn't. How are you folks doing? Do you really want to know? No. - How about a lottery ticket? - Oh, no. You just had a big winner. I never buy a ticket unless the jackpot's more than $10 million, so Yeah, $10 million. I don't know how they can even call that a ""jackpot. "" - Anything? - Nothing yet. Well, here, let me have a section. - What are we looking for? - I don't know. Just anything unusual. ""Hit-And-Run Driver Kills Grandmother. "" Where did that happen? Laurel Heights. - Around 3:00 p. m.? - 3:15. Why? Call the Captain. I think I just solved the case. What? - You think the killer's in there? - I'd bet your paycheck on it. I don't understand. Why was he stealing your paper? Because he didn't want me to see these two articles. He knew I was the only one who could possibly see the connection between them. You're feeling pretty good about yourself, huh? I'm allowed, once a decade. - Did you call the captain? - He'll be here in 10 minutes. Let's wait outside. It's stuck. You gotta push it. I'm pushing. Uh, let's just wait in the car. Okay, there you go. Now we've got it. / All right. You think you're stronger than me. What?/ You think you're stronger than me. - I didn't say anything. - But it's what you're thinking. You think you could take me. - Why would I want to ""take you""? - I don't know. - What if one day I went nuts? - What if you went nuts? Oh, boy. I really have to use my imagination for that one. I'm just saying, what if? What if What if I attacked you? Do you think you could take me? I don't know. Maybe I could. But so what? I work out. I take care of myself. Why, because I couldn't open the car door or or the water bottle? That doesn't mean anything. Fine. You're stronger than me. Okay, you win. Let's just drop it. God! - I can bench 200. - I'm happy for you. What can you bench? - I don't know. - But you can't bench 200. What you want to do? You want to fight? Is that what you want to do? Come on, let's settle it right here, right now, you and me. - Ah! - What are you doing? Hey! You guys all right? - You need a referee? - Oh, no, no, no. We're fine. I just hurt his feelings - 'cause I'm stronger than him. - She's not stronger than me. - The car door was jammed. - If it was jammed, - how did I open it? - Leverage. - It's called leverage. - Excuse me! Did somebody call a police officer? Captain, I I I think I know why the paperboy was killed. Take a look at this. On the front page. - Okay. - Now look at this. Wow. - What do you think? - Is he in there right now? - According to his secretary. - Let's go check it out. Okay. Here we go. Sorry. I wasn't laughing at you. I was. I might be able to bang out the fender, but you're gonna need a whole new grill. / Yeah. Whatever it takes. How long do you think? A week. I'll give you $200 extra if you can have it done by tomorrow. - Are you Malcolm Cowley? - That's right. I'm Captain Stottlemeyer, San Francisco P.D. This is Lieutenant Disher, Sharona Fleming. And I am Adrian Monk. The Adrian Monk. Is there a problem? I was reading about you in the newspaper. Sharona, wipe? I need a wipe here. That's you, isn't it? ""It Just Wasn't His Day. "" It says here that you had two accidents in the course of 10 minutes. First you hit a little tree; then you drove another half mile and hit a lamppost. That's right. Is that a crime? Yeah, it is if you were intentionally damaging your car so you wouldn't have to explain a smashed-in grill. See, Mr. Monk found this other article. ""Hit-And-Run Driver Kills A Grandmother. "" Same neighborhood, same approximate time. We thought there might be a connection. / Hmm. Captain. Blood. Turn around. Put your hands on the car. You, sir, are under arrest for vehicular manslaughter, leaving the scene of a crime and for the murder of Nestor Alverez. Come with me. He's not the guy. What? Monk, we got him dead to rights. He is guilty of the hit-and-run, but he didn't kill the paperboy. He didn't know who I was. There is something else in this newspaper, something I'm missing. Oh, my God! Oh, the humanity! Yeah, you're stronger than me. Captain, I have a thought about the paperboy. - This means ""hurry up. "" - It was a burglary. The paperboy interrupted a B-and-E in progress. It fits. There were five break-ins on that block last year alone. Nope. I looked into that already. All of those break-ins were hot prowls - forced entry with a crowbar. - Right. - Our guy was empty-handed. - What about a car thief? Well, that doesn't explain the taking of the newspapers, does it? Right. - So we're back to Monk's theory. - I'm afraid so. And this means ""We're leaving. ""/ Right. Monk? Oh, thank God. Here. I thought we could each take a section. - Wow. How'd you clean up so fast? - I cleaned up last night. Did you sleep at all? He can sleep while he cleans. I've seen it. Okay, there's something here, something I'm missing. Something worth killing for. All right. Well, let's just go through it line by line. ""Partly cloudy, chance of showers. "" Could that mean anything? Here's something. There was a drug bust in Hunter's Point. Oh, yeah. I'm aware of that one. That's nothing. Strictly routine. Okay, comics. Maybe there's something hidden in here. Oh, Marmaduke. I love Marmaduke. He's this He's a dog but he's enormous. Y- You can't believe how big this dog is. W- We know who Marmaduke is. Yeah, look. He ate the whole turkey right off the table. ""I guess we can forget about leftovers. "" Hello? Oh, come in, Kevin. We're right in here. Oh, hi. Excuse me. Sorry to bother you. Adrian, do you have any olive oil? I'm making mushroom moussaka. It's Vicki's favorite. Uh, uh, yeah, I think so. How's it going up there? Pretty good We haven't left the apartment since Friday. I know. I can, uh I know. - The fact is, I think I'm in love. - Good. Good. Love is good. Is there anything else? Oh, well, let's see. Uh, I have the eggplant. - I have the chopped onions. - Excellent. I have the salt. - And I have the cinnamon. - Okay! - If you need anything - I have the oregano. I have the parsley. I don't have butter, but I can use margarine. What a relief. What a relief. Well, this was fun. - I will bring this back to you later. - No, no. You keep it. It's yours. Good luck! - How's Kevin doing? - He's in love. Listen to this. This is, uh, news from around the world. Paris, France. There is an unsolved murder. A woman was found strangled and both of her hands were cut off. - Oh, my God. - No, it happens all the time. No fingerprints makes it harder to I.D. The body. Now, here's the thing. They found the hands. They were a couple of meters away from the body in the grass. The killer cut off both hands but then left them near the body? Yeah. Yeah, she and her husband both worked as curators at the prison museum in the Bastille. Prison museum. Captain Duprat, There is a detective calling from America. He has solved the murder of Madam Beaudreau! He solved it? By reading a newspaper. From 9,000 kilometers away! Captain Duprat. Prefecture de Police. Bonjour. Je m'appelle Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. L- le Department de Police de San Francisco. Uh, parlez-vous English? I speak enough. What can I do for you, Captain? Hi. Uh, I have a friend here. His name is Adrian Monk. Bonjour. He has a theory about an unsolved case of yours. Here. I'll put him on. He speaks English well. Hello. Bonjour. Bonjour. Yes, I think I know who killed Madam Beaudreau. Oui, Monsieur Monk. What is your theory? I think her husband did it. Well, we suspected him from the beginning. But why did he cut off her hands? He must have used a pair of handcuffs from the museum to restrain her. I do not follow you. They were antique handcuffs very distinctive so they could easily have been traced back to him. Mon Dieu. He must have lost the key. He was desperate. He had to get them off the body. Well, that makes sense. Lafitte, why didn't I think of that? Monsieur Monk, you are a genius. Perhaps, sir, some day you will fly to Paris, and I can thank you in person. Yes. Yes, that sounds like fun. I'll check my calendar. Okay. Au revoir. Wow. You just solved two cases by looking through one newspaper. I know, but we're not done yet. There's still something here somebody doesn't want me to see. Ooh. The personals. Can you move your hand? I already looked through that section. Nothing in it. ""Man with a badge in hot pursuit of romance. I'm 32, fit, sexy, ambitious, with a dynamite sense ofhumor. "" Oh, my God. That's you! Dynamite sense of humor? Since when? Could I have that please? / No. ""Looking for a petite blonde, no nonsense attitude, kids okay. "" That's me. Don't flatter yourself. - How's your boyfriend? - Why, you jealous? - He's so boring. - Where is he now? He's fast asleep. - I wore him out. - Yeah, I'm sure you did. Okay, let's be very careful here. Loose ends. Are there any loose ends? I don't think so. Oh, wait. I just thought of one. I think all the loose ends are covered, darling. When did it happen? The M.E. Is saying two and a half, three hours. He worked as the night manager at the Stop-N-Go on Ridgedale. Oh, my God. We were just there. That's where we bought the newspaper. The one with your letter in it to me. It wasn't to you. His shift ended at 4:00 a. m. He came here to make the night deposit, and he got jumped by the killer. Stabbed twice, once in the neck, once in the stomach, with that bottle. - No prints on the bottle? - Nothing yet. - Surveillance camera? - Negative. It's over by the A.T.M. It's facing the wrong way. It didn't see a thing. Now, what I can't get over is that we haven't had a homicide in this neighborhood for over four years. All of a sudden, we got two. First, your newspaper boy, killed for a newspaper and now, this robbery. This was no robbery. What? The killer took the money. The killer wants us to think robbery, but why wouldn't he do it in a more secluded spot? He could have killed him anywhere between here and the store. Maybe the killer just waited for him here by the bank? No. No, the killer had to have followed the victim from the store. Cream soda bottle. You can't find that brand anywhere else. Well, how do you know the victim wasn't drinking the soda? He worked at the Stop-N-Go. - That's true. - It's a woman. There's lipstick on the bottle. How did I miss that? She's stronger and smarter than you are. The TV isn't working. I unplugged it. Why? I don't want any distractions. I want to concentrate on you. Here, eat. Oh. Uh, oh! Ah. Keep your energy up. You're gonna kill me. How did I get so lucky? Oh, I'm the lucky one. Don't you know that? Vicki, I think I love you. Prove it. This is the same headline as yesterday. It's the same paper, honey. You're reading the same newspaper? It's part of a case we're working on. It's hard to explain. Is it harder than opening a car door? Benjy! I didn't say anything, I swear. I heard Mom talking to Aunt Gail. Mom says you feel threatened by her because she's stronger than you. - Benjy! - What? It's the truth. Adrian, I'm sorry. L I didn't mean to Hey, hey. Why don't you guys arm wrestle? - Yeah, then you'll know for sure. - We're not gonna arm wrestle. - Well, why not? - Because he doesn't want to. Sure he does. He's not afraid of you. Are you, Mr. Monk? Okay. Let's do it. Oh, boy. This is like Triple H versus The Undertaker. Bring it on over to me. Righty or lefty? Righty. Lefty, lefty. Wait. Righty. Uh right lefty. - Let's just do it righty, okay? - Okay. Hey. Are you sure you don't want to wear a glove or something? Don't be ridiculous. I don't need a glove. Why would I need a glove? Wait. Let's just get this over with. Ready? Ready? Ready? Get set. Go! - Do you have to make that noise? - It's not me, it's you. - I don't think so. - Come on, Mr. Monk! Benjy, I'm your mom. Uh, come on, mom! - Hey, everybody! - Hi. Who's winning? - I am. - I am. Mr. Monk, I don't think you've ever met Vicki before. Honey, he obviously can't shake hands right now. Oh, it's okay. He's not big on handshakes anyway. I just had to tell somebody. - We're getting married! - Really? So fast? - When's the big day? - Tomorrow. Vicki didn't want to wait. Yeah, I have a friend who works at the hospital, so we don't have to wait for blood tests. - Come on, honey. We're late. - Okay. Holy Toledo. We've got to go. Tell me who wins. Okay. Wipe! Wipe! I need a wipe here. And the winner is Mr. Monk! - The guys rule and girls drool. - That's right. Girls drool. Uh, say, don't feel bad. You did good. You did good, really. You know, you You had me scared there for a minute. At least it's over. Now we know. You're stronger than me. Hey, hey. You beat me fair and square. - Uh, she she winked? - It was definitely a wink. I think she let me win. Why does that bother you, Adrian? - You have to be the man? - No, I don't have to be the man. But I would like to be mannish. I've been feeling so weak lately. Maybe I'm just tired. - I haven't been sleeping again. - Why, is something wrong? My upstairs neighbor has a girlfriend. They're very friendly very friendly all night long, if you know what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean. Now, I'm just wondering though, what's keeping you awake? Is it the noise or is it what they're doing? What are you saying? Well, maybe what they're doing makes you think about Trudy, makes you miss Trudy. It's something we've never talked about, Adrian your physical relationship with your late wife. I consider that a personal question. Yes, it is. That's what I do. L I assume you and Trudy were intimate. We held hands a lot. All the time. Once we woke up holding hands. We'd been holding hands the whole night. That's sweet. I like that. That's nice. But, Adrian, is there anything else besides the holding hands? Ah, I think we're out of time. No. Plenty of time. Are those pillows new?/ No. They look -  new. - Adrian, I'm your doctor. I think this is important. Now, we've got 20 minutes left.

Sorry I'm late. I had to drop Benjy off. Sharona, it was right in front of us the whole time, right on the front page. The lottery? That's what this whole thing has been about a $43 million jackpot. Excuse me. Excuse me. Where is the justice of the peace? - Right this way. - Justice of the peace? - You recognize these numbers? - No. Will you slow down? I'm in heels. Well, I knew I'd heard these numbers before. I called Lieutenant Disher, and I asked him to check his notes just to make sure. Remember when Kevin Dorfman came downstairs after the murder? He started reeling off his old addresses. Before that, I lived at Before that, 8 Todd Road and 45 Radcliffe Street, consecutively. Sharona, Kevin won the lottery on Thursday night. these are his old house numbers. He played the same numbers every week. - A lot of people do. - Okay, wait, wait, wait. Kevin won $43 million? Why didn't he say anything? Because he didn't know. He still doesn't. But Vicki knows. Kevin bought his lottery tickets at the Stop-N-Go every week. - Can I help you? - Vicki, I would like my lottery ticket. After awhile, Vicki and the other clerk, probably her accomplice, got to know - his lucky numbers by heart. - I was also wondering - if you and I could - No way. / Okey. When the numbers were drawn, they realized Kevin had won. They knew he lived alone, that he didn't have many friends, and it occurred to them that maybe, just maybe, he didn't know he had won. Vicki, come here! Look at this! They came up with a plan. - Probably Vicki's idea. - Why Vicki? - Because, the other guy's dead. -  $43 million. Oh, my God. - Wait, wait, wait. - Bring your winning tickets to an Ultra-Lottery price checker or an Ultra-Lottery retailer near you. Once again, the winning numbers are: Later, on some pretext, Vicki woke Kevin up. Kevin. Hi. For a woman like her, the rest was easy. I found these at the store. I thought maybe they were yours? I didn't want you to be without your glasses. Well, these are these are mine. I'm wearing mine. Oh, God. I'm so stupid. All Vicki had to do was keep Kevin distracted for a day or two. She didn't let him answer his phone. She probably unplugged the T. V. She didn't want him to see or even think about the winning lottery numbers. Wait, I still don't get it. Why did they kill your paperboy? They didn't know it was my paper. They thought it was Kevin's, and they couldn't afford to let him see this. It had nothing to do with me. Why didn't she just steal the ticket? The time stamp on the ticket would match the time code from the store security camera. He could prove it was his. - They're getting married. - Exactly. That was her plan from the beginning to get him to marry her before he knew he was worth a fortune. If anyone present knows of any reason why this couple should not be wed in holy matrimony, let them - This wedding's a sham! - That woman's a killer! She's marrying him for his money. Sorry. I'm so sorry about that. - Oh, th-these things happen. - Best of luck to you. Yeah. I I love your dress. All right. Thanks. She said we're too late. They left 15 minutes ago. She overheard them talk about their honeymoon. That's it. - Well, where are they going? - She doesn't know. What's the big deal? Kevin can just get his marriage annulled when he gets back which is an option I should have explored. / No No, no. You don't understand. Remember what happened to her partner? Vicki Salinas is a cold-blooded killer. I think she's planning to inherit that money, maybe tonight. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She said she saw them check out those brochures just before they left. It looks like it's been restocked recently. Ten. Ten. Ten. Nine. ""Dexter Cliff Inn. "" That's Pigeon Point. - Let's go. - Okey. Hurry up, but not too fast. But hurry up. But not too fast. Mrs. Dorfman. Mrs. Vicki Dorfman. How does that sound? Like a dream come true. / Huh. Here. Drink up. I think it's making me tired. Yeah, well, five Seconals will do that. Huh. Why are we stopped? Oh, you'll find out, in seven minutes. - Drink up. - Huh. I really do love you. / Yeah. Well, everybody makes mistakes. / Yeah. What's that? Oh, it's my inheritance. My husband was killed in a train accident. He was drinking. He fell asleep at the wheel on the tracks. - He was killed instantly. - Oh, that's terrible. Yeah. Could that be their car? I don't know. Kevin! - Oh, my God, it's him. - Kevin! - Kevin.! Kevin.! - It's locked. Kevin, can you hear me? Are you okay? Kevin, can you hear us? Kevin!/ No! I'll get the switch! Kevin! Kevin, wake up! Come on, wake up. That's it. Come on.! Wake up.! Kevin, wake up. What's the problem? - It's stuck! - God! Come on. Oh, no. Your birthday's the ninth, right? What are you doing? I'm playing the lottery. You'll never win. You have a better chance of being hit by lightning. Adrian, Sharona, I'm heading out. Wanted to stop in, say ciao. Where are you going? Well, my place in Maui isn't ready yet, so I'll be staying at my house in Aspen for a little while. Great. Have you heard from Vicki? / Who? Excuse me. Bonaduce! Yeah, what's happening, Danny Boy? Hang on. I've got to take this. But listen. I wanted to give you a little something for your trouble. Oh, no, Kevin. No, I, uh I can't take any money from you. Well, I can. Thanks. Take care of each other. And remember, you gotta be in it to win it. Right. Right. Nice. $400? After I saved his life? You? I pulled the train switch. - After I loosened it. - You didn't loosen it. It gave a little just before you grabbed it. Why do you say that? - Why do you torture me? - Because I can."

This is where you grew up? Are you surprised? Nah, I just always pictured something different. Like what? I don't know. Like a laboratory. Was that your swing set? My father put it up when I was eight. It's probably the happiest day of my life. - Looked like fun. - I wouldn't know. You never used it? I mean, look at it. It's a death trap. But it was fun watching him put it up. He must have been disappointed. Well, he was used to it by then. Two months later, he went out to pick up some Chinese food, never came back. Sorry. Is that him? - Okay. Let's go. - What? I waved at him. He waved at me. - That's enough for one decade. - Adrian, you can't leave. He's your brother. Come on. - Hello, Adrian. - Ambrose. Uh This is my assistant, Sharona. - Oh, hi. - Hello. We spoke on the phone. Oh, so, you can dial a telephone. I was worried.

That's sardonic. Please, come in. Oh, God. You didn't have to clean up just for us. - Hey. Did you write this? - Yes. I have this answering machine. This is a very good manual. All the steps are very clear. - I'm sure you noticed the typo. - Uh, no. It's on page 42. It should read - You wrote the German part too? - Ambrose can speak seven languages. Seven and a half. I'm teaching myself Mandarin. That'll come in handy. - Um, here. I picked up your mail for you. - Thank you. You know, I really, uh, like that catalog. Can I have one? They sent you two of them. I'm sorry? No. - Well, they're identical. - I save all my mail.

Actually, that's as close as we ever got. - Is that your mom? - Mm-hmm. - She's beautiful. - She was. We lost her in 1994. So, Adrian, are you still living on Pine Street? Oh, yeah. He has a great apartment. You should come by sometime. - I can't. - Ambrose, don't say you can't. I can't. / Of course you can. You choose not to. That's easy for you to say. You've always been the fearless one. - Here it comes. - You should have seen him. Going into stores and buying things - all by himself when he was 15. - Wow. Driving a car when he was 24. Going out on dates Going out on dates with women at 26 years of age. - He's a regular Evel Knievel. - So, anyway, Ambrose. What am I What am I doing here? Believe it or not, I need your help. Something happened two nights ago. It's my next-door neighbor. His name is Pat Van Ranken. - What happened? - I'm 85% to 90% sure he killed his wife. That's his house. You can see it out the window. His wife, Rita, is a friend of mine. She comes over and makes me dinner sometimes. - Is this your old bedroom? - Mm-hmm. - Wow. How does it feel to be in here? - Horrible. Thank you for asking. - You like The Who? - The what? The rock band The Who. You have the album. Oh, yeah. All the kids enjoyed the rock-and-roll singing groups. - And the 49ers? - Now they were a great band. - They're a football team. - I know. You were just trying to fit in, weren't you? / No. Yes. / This might be the saddest room I've ever seen. Anyway, Adrian, two nights ago I heard them fighting. - They were really screaming. - Right. - Then I heard gunshots. - Are you sure? Four shots. It sounded like a Lane and Westing nine-millimeter. Lane and Westing doesn't make a nine-millimeter. They did until 1992. I know that gun. I wrote the manual for it. Three hours later, he drove away in his pickup truck. He was gone all night. / Uh-huh. The next day I called the house. Rita wasn't there. - Pat said she was in Argentina, - Okay. Visiting her sister, which was news to me. When I mentioned that I saw him leave, he denied it. - He said it was impossible. - Right. His truck's been broken all summer. He He called me a lunatic. Well. Did you call the police? Oh, no. They They no longer respond to my complaints because I call them more often than I should. I'd like to complain to them about it, but they no longer respond to my complaints. When was the last time you saw the wife? Three days ago. She borrowed a bag of flour. She was baking pies for the town. It's their big centennial celebration. - What do you think, Adrian? - Yeah, you might be onto something. - Really? - Oh, yeah. I'll look into it. Let's go. - We'll look into it. - Gonna look into it. What What are you doing? What What What's that for? For making my family seem normal. Okay. Okay, okay. - Are you really gonna look into it? - No, no. He's delusional. He is the worst eyewitness in the world. But he heard gunshots. / Sharona, the whole town's been celebrating all week. It was probably some kid setting off firecrackers. Well, at least you two were talking again. I'm glad you enjoyed it, because that's it. I am never setting foot in that house again. Okay, I have my own problems. Really? I never noticed. Now you're being sardonic. What? What is it? Van Ranken's pickup. He told my brother it hadn't been moved all summer, but look at the grass in front of the truck. It's brown. The truck's been moved. Coming. Coming. - Mr. Van Ranken? - That's right. Yes, hi. I'm Sharona Fleming, and this is Adrian Monk. - Monk? From next door? - No, no. No, no. He's He's my brother.

Stuff and and things. What can I do for ya? Well, my brother loaned your wife a bag of flour, and he sent us over to to pick it up. - Yeah, sure. Come on in. - Thanks. Is your wife here? No. No, you missed her. She's in Argentina. Her sister's sick. / Oh. We were thinking about doing some hiking later. Um What is that Melvone State Park like? Is that nice? It's beautiful. How'd you know I was up there? Uh, there's a parking permit on your pickup truck. Is that right? / I guess you couldn't have had too much fun though. According to the permit you got there just before closing 9:43 p. m.? That's true. It was a longer drive than I thought. - Hmm. - Well, let's find that flour. Excuse the mess. I was just cleaning up. I don't know where she put it. - Is that a shoe? - Yeah, it's my wife's. Guess she decided she didn't like them. It's funny there's only one. They Usually come in pairs. What are you doing? I was just just looking for that other shoe. It must be around here somewhere. They really should be together. They're a they're a you know, a pair. I'm sure it'll turn up. Well, when it does, could you give me a call? Uh, it'd mean a lot to me. Yeah. I'll do that. There's the flour. Thank your brother for me, won't you? Well, I guess that's it. - I don't want to keep you. - Oh, I'm sure you don't. Whatever happened happened in the kitchen. He's been bleaching the floor. And he went to the state park maybe to bury something. Yes. He was parked by the southern entrance. - How do you know that? - It's obvious. Why don't you tell her, Adrian? - Uh - The yellow acorns on his truck, which can only mean he was parked under a spotted oak tree. / Wow. - Which are found? - Uh - Near water. - Wow. So that's near the river by the southern entrance. / Wow. - Please stop saying ""Wow. "" - This detective stuff is easy. Looks like you got a new partner. Yeah, for any crime committed within 30 feet of this property. So, what do we do now? Well, at this point, it's just your word against his. - Hello. - Where's he goin'? Let's find out. Come on. He's heading downtown. - Ambrose, come with us. - Me? No, no, no. You're just gonna hide in this house for the rest of your life? That's my plan, yes. Come on. Take my hand. Just to the end of the driveway. You can do it. Come on. Come on. - Come on. - I I can't. Ambrose, you know what? Adrian's scared too all the time. But he doesn't let that stop him. Okay, now you tell me, what does he have that you don't have? He has you. He never apologized. Did you notice that? Adrian, he's trying his best. The man's in pain. Yeah, well, who isn't?

Uh, and the second prize is this delicious homemade cherry pie. - Who came in second? - Right here. Here you go, sir. Bon appetit. - What's he doing? - He's looking for something. That's why he tripped. He didn't want to win the race. He was trying to come in second. He wanted the pie. - Why? - Well, obviously, he You see, Sharona, what happened was I have no idea. I guess he didn't like the pie. - He was looking for something. - Something inside the pie? - Wait a minute. Cherry pie. - Yes, cherry pie. - Cherry pie. Cherry pie. - Cherry. It's cherry! You can see it's cherry! There was something about a cherry pie in the paper three days ago. - What is this? - Every newspaper since 1972. - Oh. - I am as God made me. It's only three days ago. - Wouldn't it be near the top? - I have my own system. - What system is that? - You wouldn't understand. Ah! Ah! Here it is. Here it is. Right here. Here. - The carjacking? - Oh, my God. We were there, remember? - Yeah, I know. - Doesn't that label say ""cherry pie""? Yes, it does. It says ""cherry pie. "" How did you remember that? It's a gift and a curse. - Oh, my God. Adrian, this is - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think she was killed for a pie. - So, this is where you guys grew up, huh? - That's right. - What's with the filing cabinets? - Mail. - Mail? - Thirty years' worth of mail. Okay. That makes sense. - Not to me, but - So, Captain, - Yeah? - What do you what do you think? - About your pie theory? - Right. The wife baked three pies cherry pies for charity. They've been giving them away all weekend. / Mm-hmm. Yeah. There's something in them, or something inside one of them. - Something worth killing for. - Captain. I I have your coffee, Captain. Thank you. Why is it numbered? - Mother numbered all the mugs. - So we'd always put them back in the right order. Of course she did. - What did she do if a mug got broken? - What? - What happened if a mug got broken? - Number nine. It slipped. I couldn't help it. - Ambrose, not now. - It was not my fault. - I'm sorry. - It was not my fault. - Did you look at the crime scene photos? - Yes, I did. And? / And you're right. There was no pie. But I I like to have more than lack of pie when I go to the grand jury. - Does he own a gun? - Yes, he does. - Nine-millimeter? - Yes, it is. But he is a retired army sergeant, and most veterans have guns. Plus he lied about his pickup truck. - And the one shoe in the garbage. - His wife is missing. You want to talk about facts? Here's a fact for you. On Thursday night, Van Ranken's wife flew to Buenos Aires. I checked with the airline. She purchased the ticket personally, and she boarded the plane. Well, it might have been a girlfriend with a fake I.D. Yes, he he was definitely fooling around. I I saw him in the backyard, making phone calls on his cell phone. - There you go. - Is that it? Is that it? You're leaving? / Yes, I have to go. Look, I'll sniff around. That's all I can do without real evidence. / Captain Look Ambrose, it was a pleasure meeting you. / Yes. It certainly answered a few questions, but it raised about a hundred more. Here. That goes between five and seven. I'll see myself out. - Listen to me. - Monk. - Wait a second. - I'm late for dinner. - Call me tomorrow. - Wait. - Bye, Captain. - Bye-bye.! Oh, my God.! Oh, my God.! You guys, look at this. Look at this. Here's the schedule for all the charity events with a list of prizes. There are three homemade pies being given away. At the raffle, the potato sack race - And number three? - They're giving it away tomorrow. - You play bingo? - No. - Is it fun? - It's a lot of fun. You're gonna hate it.

If you don't rub the troll, it is bad karma. - Adrian, just rub the man's troll. - I don't want to rub the troll. He's never gonna shut up if you don't rub his troll. O-73. O-73. What are you doing? Not so hard. What the hell are you doing? And our next number is G-56. - G-five-six. - You don't have anything. I'm doing great. I'm only two away on this one. Where's your markers? I don't need them. And our next number is O-68. O-68. I-21. - One more. - Okay. I-21. O-72. O seven - two. - Bingo! - Bingo! - We have another winner. I'll save you a piece. Sharona, are you sure you called the captain? Yeah. I know what Van Ranken's been looking for. I know what's in that pie. Captain.! Captain.! Captain, here.! He's trying He's He's trying to get rid of the evidence! It's in the pie! Officer, I'd like to file a complaint. These two have been harassing me all weekend. Sir, could you put the pie on the truck? - What? - You heard me. Put the pie down and step away. Step away from the pie. Look, I live next door to his brother. They're both nuts. I know they are, sir. Please, put the pie on the truck. Please. - Monk. - Okay, here's what I think happened. Last Thursday, Rita was baking three pies for the town centennial. - She probably put them on the counter to cool. - Get your hands off Her husband came home. They had a fight. Maybe Pat was threatening to leave. Who knows? But there was a struggle. My brother said he heard four shots from a nine-millimeter pistol. If that's true, the shells were ejected from the gun as he fired. They must have gone flying all over the kitchen. At some point, he was interrupted. It was someone from the town coming by to collect the pies. Hi. The pies, right? Okay, just wait one second. I'll get 'em. Wait here. Bye. Later, when he started cleaning up the kitchen, he got the shock of his life. One shell casing was missing. The gun is registered, so if anyone had found that casing, it would have been easily traced. It wasn't in pie number one or pie number two. It has to be in here. Mr. Van Ranken, we'd like permission to search your pie. What? Please don't make me say that again. - What if I say no? - Then we hold you here as a material witness until we get a search warrant. - For a pie? - For a pie. Sharona, would you do the honors? Actually, this is one of my fantasies. Except it's not a pie, and you're not in it. Will you shut up? Well? - It's It's not in here. I - What? Right Right Right there, right? Sharona? - Adrian, it's not in here. - But But, Sharona Mr. Van Ranken, the department would, uh, like to a We'd like to buy you a new pie. I don't understand. Usually when he does the whole summation thing it's all over, right? We get to go home. What is with you and these cherry pies? Uh, Captain, look, I-I'm telling you Monk, what is this? Some kind of sibling rivalry thing between you and your brother? No. No, no, no. No. No, no. Look. Don't call us. We'll call you. Lieutenant, get in the car. - So the pie was empty? - That's right. Is that it? Just gonna give up? There's nothing else I can do. Well, thanks for believing me. Or at least pretending to. - You going to stay? - No. I can't. Uh I made I made Dad's favorite uh, pasta primavera. - Ambrose, I I I have to go. - Wait. Sharona's waiting. He's not coming back. You're probably right, but just in case. Maybe I'll see you, uh, next week. I don't think so. Take care of yourself. I love you. Don't say that. Don't you say that. I'm no expert, but I know that people who love each other who care about each other don't go seven years without calling. Especially when I needed you most after Trudy. - You think I didn't c-call because I didn't care? - Then why? What happened to you? Do you know why Trudy was in that parking garage on the day she died? What are you saying? It was because of me. - You? - She was doing me a favor. I needed cough medicine. I called her. - I asked her to go - Oh, my God. - To the drugstore for me. - Don't do this. She wouldn't have been in that garage if it wasn't for me. / Oh, Ambrose. It was me, Adrian! It was me. It was my fault! No, no. No, no, no. - Adrian, it was my fault! - No, it was not your fault. - Adrian, I'm - No, you couldn't - I'm sorry, Adrian. - It was not your fault. - I'm sorry. - Oh, God, no. Don't. No, no, no. Don't. It was not - Adrian, it was my fault. - It was not - It was not your fault. - Adiran - No, no, no. Shh. - I'm sorry. - Shh. - I'm sorry. It was not your fault. Okay, so, I'm here. She's over here. ""Where do you think you're going?"" Okay, you're Rita, and you're making three pies. You're taking them out of the oven. She grabs the knife, right? ""Rita, don't be stupid. I'm warning you. "" No. No, not there. That's where she kept the flour, remember? ""Don't make me do it. Don't make me do something "" - "" I'm going to regret. "" - Bam, bam, bam, bam! Bam, bam, bam, bam. Ambrose. Hi. I'm Pat Van Ranken from next door. You loaned my wife a bag of flour, remember?

It's been a terrible week for Brad Terry, star of TV's hit series Crime Lab S.F. Two days ago, Brad was arrested for assaulting a bartender. This morning, his ex-wife former actress Susan Malloy was slain while Brad was standing right over there, talking to reporters. Adrian. How do I look? Sharona, this is a murder scene, not a high school prom. Yes, but it was Brad Terry's ex-wife. Brad Terry could be in there. Wait, wait. Do I have anything in my teeth? Forget it. Come on. Come on. This morning, paparazzi gathered to get the scoop on Brad and Susan. Excuse me. Hey, hey! Excuse me. Are you gonna go see Brad? Yeah. Come here. You could do this for me. - Sorry. - No, no. I need This is a petition to get the old theme song back. They changed the theme song. Oh, my God! I hate that new theme song. Me too. God, the show was perfect. It was perfection, right? It was. It was It was perfect. Why can't they just leave shows alone? I don't know. / But tell Brad this is from Marci. That is me. ""M"" for Marci. ""Marci. "" Okay. Yeah. He-He knows me, so - Okay. I'll tell him that. Okay. - Come on. Don't bend it. Don't forget the upstairs. I want pictures of everything. Dylan, grab a couple of uniforms. Go door-to-door. And do not send anything upstream until I get a chance to read it. I'm glad you're on the case, Captain. I feel pretty silly doing what I do, watching you do it for real. Yeah, I've seen your show. It's pretty good. - Really? - Yeah. That's a big compliment coming from you. Thanks. There he is. There he is. The greatest detective in San Francisco. Okay, you understand he's not a real detective? It's what they call a show. I'm gonna talk to him. Mr. Terry? Hi. I'm really sorry about your loss. I'm-I'm Sharona Fleming. I'm with Adrian Monk. The consultant, right? Yeah. Is there anything I can do for you? No. I don't think it's really hit me yet that Well, this this is for you. Somebody outside gave it to me. It's a petition about that new theme song. Oh, yeah. I know. Everybody hates it. Am I the only one who likes this? I like it too. I can't get it out of my mind. It-It's a good song. From Marci, right? Marci Maven. She follows me everywhere. She's not right. So, they were They were divorced? - Who was? - Brad Terry and the victim. Yeah, right. For three years. They were still friendly. You know, show people. He's been hidin' out here for the last couple of days. - Hiding from - Paparazzi. He slugged a bartender on Friday night. It was big news. Why is this thing still running? Sorry. She was working out. Yeah. She's workin' out here. Killer opens the back door, sneaks up behind her, stabs her three times neck, back and chest. Murder weapon's nothing special either. It's just a camping knife. Here, look at this. Point of entry. - How is he? - He's okay. I like him. Like a regular guy. Like me or you. Or me. Do you think he could have had a motive? Who? Brad Terry? Nah, I don't think so. No kids. No alimony. Besides, he can't be the guy. He was out front when it went down. Ten witnesses with cameras. Killer broke the glass, opened the door, reached in. Went out the same way. There's-There's glass in the track directly under the door. Yeah. So? I think the door was open when the glass was broken. Or the killer kicked the glass around when he ran out. This driveway curves around the back of the house. Hey, Brad. Brad Terry, this is Adrian Monk. This is the guy that, uh, we're workin'with. I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - I understand you're an actor Oh. Oh, no, no. Don't be insulted by him. He's never heard of anybody. No. He doesn't have to watch my show. He lives it. Right? Well, not really. Well, maybe. Yes. Yeah, I-I guess so. I just have a couple of questions. Is that your car parked at the bottom of the driveway? Yeah. I was just wondering wh-why you parked out front if you didn't want anyone to know where you were. That's a good question. Susan drove it last. I guess she just forgot to pull it up. Makes sense to me. Yeah. What do you think? What can I get you two? Nothing for me. Just some water. Are you Dustin Sheers? Yeah. We're working with the police on the Brad Terry case. - What do I owe you? - Don't worry about it. I understand Mr. Terry was in here last week. - There was a fight. - My brush with fame. Well, actually, it was more than a brush really. What was the fight about? Nothin; I said I'd never seen his show, and he flipped out. He jumps over the bar. He starts goin'postal on me. Excuse me. I'll have some of that scotch. - It's 20 bucks. - No, not the whole bottle. Just a glass. Yeah. Twenty bucks. It's the best in the house. What are you doing? You don't drink. I get it. You're gonna waste Great. Oh, my God. - You want this? - Sure. Was Mr. Terry intoxicated? Had to be. - How else do you explain that? - I'll have a glass of water, please. You're not gonna sue him, are you? I considered it, but I figure, after what happened with his ex-wife, that guy's suffered enough. I'll have another scotch. Don't mind if I do. Besides, he felt pretty bad about it. Before the cops showed up, he wrote me a check for two grand. He wrote him a check. That's the check? That's it. I don't know whether to cash it or frame it. What's wrong? - The handwriting. - Looks okay to me. It's not just okay. It's perfect. He stayed right on the line. I don't think he was drunk when he wrote this. Why would a star like Brad Terry pretend to be drunk? Please. I'll have some more water, please. Can you make it a double? There's the editing rooms over there. That's the costume department. Are they allowed to keep all the clothes? Well, they're not supposed to, but sometimes they do. Could you slow it down a little, please? I don't think I can go any slower. I'm surprised Brad Terry is working today, after what happened. Oh, yeah. They just keep workin', no matter what. You know, they have to do 26 episodes a year. Brad wouldn't shut us down. He's great. - Oh, He He is great. - Yeah, he's great. - I can't seem to find my seat belt. - You don't need a seat belt. I don't need a seat belt. Oh. Over there's the dubbing stage. That's where we do all the sound work for the show. Hey. - Is he anybody? - No. He's just a writer. ""100th. "" We're shooting our hundredth episode this week. Yeah, it-it's a really big deal. Why is that? Because they can syndicate the show. That's where they make the big money. Okay. Well, here we are. - We made it. - Yeah. It's the big door on the left. - Thank you so much. Thank you. - You're welcome. Bye. A camera, Sharona? He's a murder suspect. Brad Terry didn't kill anybody. How do you know? Because he plays a nice guy on TV. Tony Danza never killed anybody. Mister Rogers never killed anybody. I'm not saying every actor is a murderer. I'm saying this actor might be a murderer. Do I have to agree with you on every case? - Is that, like, a rule? - No. Well, you're wrong. He didn't do it. The door was locked from the inside. The hooker must have come in through the fire escape. Minute traces of blood over here. Rusty? - Over here. - What do you got, J.? It looks like a fiber. What planet are they supposed to be on? J, don't touch it. Lee, get the spectroscope. What the hell is that? A spectroscope. It's how they solve the crimes. - We should get one. - Why don't we get two? Then we can solve 'em twice as fast. It's fiber all right. It's some sort of strange, synthetic polymer. Lee, speak English, please. It's not domestic. It was made in Bolivia. The Santorini cartel. Santorini? That-That's in Greece. What can I help you with, Mr. Monk? Well, this is your 100th episode. Is that right? Congratulations. I understand that's a big day for you. Thank you. Yeah, a big one. I've been workin' a long time for it my whole life actually. And how does that work? I know that you weren't paying Susan alimony. But, uh, when the show started, you were still married, right? - Yes, I was. - Under California law, she would have been entitled to half of any syndication money. You think you've found a motive, don't you, Mr. Monk? Would you like me to take a lie detector test? Would that make you happy? Yes, it would. Anytime, anywhere. Oh, excuse me. - You mind? - Oh, no, no. Come on. Okay. Press that button. Thank you. I was at a bar, Eric. Yeah, I had a drink or two. And some peanuts. The local news has been running this all-day long. - What are you doing! - Susan? I had the lab run a voiceprint analysis. That was definitely Susan. We think the killer was a deranged fan. It makes sense to me. Have you talked to the one we met, Marci Maven? No, not yet. We're still tryin' to track her down. I asked around. Do you realize that if this show goes into syndication, Brad Terry stands to make over $20 million? There's your motive right there. He did not want to share it with his ex-wife. Gentlemen! Max Green, the truth machine. What do you got? Well, according to this, he's clean. He's Mr. Clean. Zero deception. You see? What more do you need? Come on. I think you enjoy being alone. So, did we pass? Yes, we did. With flying colors. I was up all night studying. Mr. Monk, are you satisfied? The machine is not infallible. Well, neither are you. I've been watching you, Mr. Monk. That's what actors do. We soak people in. I think I got you. It's something like I don't know what this thing is, but Tidiness. Everything has to be in complete Don't you? Oh, I'm sorry. The lamp thing. I don't know what That's-That's nothing nothing like me. Nothing at all really. - Hey. - Come on. There's a big 100th-episode cast party tonight. - You're coming. - I'll be there. Okay, good. Sharona, you have to come, because these parties get a little wild. - I might need a nurse, you know? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Do you mind? Don't wait up, Mr. Monk. No, no. You go ahead. I guess it's just you and me. Yep. Brad Terry. What's your name again? Randy. Randy. Randy, you ever done any acting? No. 'Cause you got a great energy. I think you might really pop. - Pop? - Come to the party. I want you to meet the casting director. Okay? Okay. Cast and crew, please put your hands together for our stars! Let's hear it for 100 shows! To be honest with you, I didn't think we'd make it past 10. Listen, I want to thank everybody for-for your support this week. Susan's murder was a Sorry. It was a terrible tragedy, and-and I wanna thank everybody for stickin' by me this week. I really appreciate it. You guys were there for me, and I will never forget it. We really are a family. Except, unlike most families, we actually like each other. Listen, congratulations, everybody. Let's get drunk. On TV, you always see one cop in one car hot-roddin' after some suspect. It doesn't happen like that. Believe it or not, we're out there trying to serve and protect. It's a great party, huh? Move, move, move! You're in the picture. - Move. Move. - Sorry. Sorry. You wanna dance? Oh, well, I'm not much of a dancer. Hey. Hey. There she is. Sharona, hi. - Hi. - How are ya? - You wanna dance? - Oh, she's not much of a dancer. Oh, that's okay. I can teach her.

I have to talk to Brad. - This way. Come on. He's seducing them all, one by one. It's easy for him. He's an actor. He lies for a living. Yeah, but you could say that he tells the truth for a living. There was a cast party last night. - Everybody went. - Except you. How did that make you feel? Like I was back in sixth grade. There was this kid Robbie Walover. He was a great athlete. He was funny. Everybody liked him. That year, he invited everyone to his birthday party except me. Here I am, still in the sixth grade. Robbie Walover. Did-Did he live over on Hillside Avenue? - Yes. - I knew him. My mother was friendly with his mother. Were you at the party? Yeah. Was it great? Adrian, you don't wanna know. No, no. Okay, yes. Okay, fine. It was Yes, it was, um It was pretty great. Yeah, it was great. We went to Candlestick Park. I met Willie Mays. - Where have you been? - We had to parallel park. What, for 20 minutes? Parallel means parallel, right? That's all I'm saying. Whatever. Come on. I want you to hear something. What is it? You said it was big. Monk, you're a great detective, but nobody bats a thousand. Marci Maven, this is Adrian Monk. He's working on the case with us. Yeah, I remember you. Now, Marci, I want you to tell him exactly what you've been telling us. I did it. I killed Brad's ex, Susan Malloy. I did the world a favor. She was a terrible actress. Who was? Susan Malloy. The bitch I killed. She only made one movie. What kind of actress only makes one movie? Frat Party Massacre. Did you see it? - Uh, no. - I did. Like, 20 times. And how did you do it, Marci? It was easy. Snuck in the glass window in the back. I hid. She came in. She was, uh, doin' an exercise tape. She didn't even see me. I pulled out the knife, and she started screaming. I started stabbing, and I stabbed her. How many times? Three or four. Why did you do it, Marci? I did it for Brad. Hello? I love him. You know, I That bitch broke his heart. She won't be hurting him anymore. Right? I don't know. Sharona and I saw her a half an hour after the murder. There was no blood on her shirt. She explained that. She said she went back to her car and changed. What happened to the bloody clothes? Where are they? / Monk, we have a confession. A confession trumps a missing blouse. Plus, a videotape puts Brad Terry in the front yard during the attack. And also we have a confession. And he passed a polygraph test. And did I mention we have a confession? Okay. Okay. Okay, you win. I'm convinced. He's innocent. - Yes! - We have a verdict. All right. As far as I'm concerned, this case is closed. Call the D.A. I wanna file this first thing in the morning. - Yes, sir. - Monk. Thank you. Thank you. Now I can take that job. I'm gonna be a police consultant on the show. No way. / A thousand dollars for half a day's work. I couldn't have taken the gig until you - agreed the guy was innocent. - I appreciate that. And, uh, I can take the part they offered me.

You reminded me of this kid I knew in sixth grade. Ah, it's complicated. We all have our demons, right? So the case is officially closed. Marci confessed. That's right. See, I always knew she was unstable. She, uh Come in. She's been harassing me for years. - Hi. - Hey, Laurie. How are you? - I got your water. - Thanks. Sierra Springs. I drink that too. Yeah? Here.

Where you goin' to, Frankie? Huh? You goin' to church? Cocaine. It's pure. - Cut! - Cut! He used a different finger. It won't cut together. Oh, you're right. Uh, Brad. Brad, listen. Make sure you use your right pinkie, okay? Yeah. Sorry. No problem. Excuse me. I noticed something else. The second time, the lights on the van were off. He's right. I missed that one. Carl. Your lights. And, uh, this-this This gentleman in the brown shirt by the pizza place, he, uh The first time, both his socks were pulled all the way up. But the second time, one was down. And, uh, you, sir Sir? Your umbrella handle was turned, uh, this way. And, uh, you Sir, you You were holding your coffee cup with your pinkie extended. Not-Not Not that much. Not that much. And her sweater Her sweater was buttoned up, you know, all the way. And, uh, she looked at her watch like this the first time. And he-he scratched his elbow, and her straw was bent a little more. Thank you, Mr. Monk. Her zipper on her bag was all the way up. You're a very observant man, Mr. Monk. I don't think there's anything you can do about the bird, but, on the first take It's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect. Could we take a break? - Let's take a break. - Break! Everybody back in 10! Sorry. He's kind of a perfectionist. Hey. Hey. - Hi. - Hey, Laurie. Did you, uh Captain, do you think I think they need to shove the criminal harder. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. That was lame. - Have you read Laurie's script? - No. Is it any good? It is the worst script I have ever read. That figures. - Sharona. - What? Brad. He lied to that girl about her script. I was there. So what? He was being polite. No. No, no, no, no. He was He was wearing one of those pulse monitors. His heartbeat didn't change, not a fraction. He's a sociopath. That's how he beat the polygraph test. He did it. He's the guy. - He can't be the guy. - He's the guy. He's the guy. How do you feel, Marci? How do I feel? Well, th-that's funny, because I've talked to five psychiatrists and-and three psychologists and one therapist. And, uh, they all wanted to know the same thing. ""How you feelin', Marci? How you feelin', Marci?"" I heard that you got into some trouble last night. I smashed the TV in the rec room. What was I supposed to do? Crime Lab S.F. was on with that that new theme song which I hate. Why do they need a new theme song? Marci. I know you didn't kill Susan Malloy. Oh, no. Sure I did. No. You couldn't kill anyone. Why did you confess? There's only one reason why you would confess. Because you know Brad Terry is guilty. You love him. You're protecting him. But how do you know he's guilty? That's the question. How do you know he killed his ex-wife? Marci. Marci. What really happened here? They went outside together for a minute. She comes back in alone. You be Susan. Great. So I'm the victim again? I think you enjoy stabbing and shooting me. No, I don't enjoy it, but it's my job. Okay, so she comes back in to start her workout. And you put in your favorite exercise video. I'm sorry. It was turned all the way up. Okay Okay. Okay. Wait a minute. It was turned all the way up the day she was killed too. What does that mean? I don't know. Let me see that yoga tape. - It's not here. - It's right there. I saw Disher take it out. It's not here. What, somebody steal it? I mean, who would steal a workout tape? What? I know what happened here. You're not gonna like it. Just hear me out. Just keep an open mind. He did it, didn't he? There's a reason the coroner couldn't find a bullet in her body. There was no bullet to find. At least no ordinary bullet. You killed the hooker with a bullet made from your own frozen blood. Isn't that right, Senator? Here's what happened. All you needed was an ounce of your blood. You poured it into a.38-caliber mold and froze it. The rest was easy. You left the fund-raiser at 7:00. You shot the hooker. Then you waited for the blood bullet to dissolve. Well, you can't prove any of this. Oh, I think we can. I think it's fine. I think the gunshot could be louder. I can do louder. This is my favorite part where everybody stands around and you sum up the case. Yeah. Me too. Thanks. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Mr. Monk. Why don't you, uh, take a break. Brad Terry, you're under arrest for the murder of your ex-wife. You can't be serious. I was out on the front lawn the whole time. Everybody saw me. You made sure everybody saw you by pretending to be drunk and staging that fight a few days earlier. After an incident like that, you knew the press would follow you anywhere. That was the whole idea. You needed witnesses. I was at a bar, Eric. Yeah, I had a drink or two. And some peanuts. Listen, stay off the property, please. Leave Susan out of it. Okay. Freeze it right there. That proves it. I was outside when she screamed. Oh, yeah, she screamed, but that scream was 15 years old. You recognize this? This is the first movie your wife ever made. It took us forever to track it down. The movie's been out of print for years. What are you doing! What are you doing! Susan? Marci Maven recognized the scream 'cause she's seen the movie a hundred times. As Special Agent Rusty Clark would say, ""Here's what happened. "" Last week, you came in here alone after hours. What are you doing! No! No! It was easy to transfer Susan's scream from the slasher film onto the exercise video. What are you doing! The morning of the murder, you smashed some glass on the rear door to make it look like somebody broke in. You hid a knife near the front door where you could grab it quickly. Then you replaced her exercise video with the one you doctored, and the stage was set. As you planned, the press was out front, and you made sure they saw Susan alive as you left the house. You recorded the audio low intentionally Because you needed her to turn the volume all the way up. Listen, guys, to the right, arms down. What are you doing! Susan? / The press thought you were going in to help her, but you were going in to kill her. You only had a few seconds, but it was all you needed. Somebody call the police! She's been stabbed! Good work, Mr. Monk. And he did it without a spectroscope. Could you stand up, please, Mr. Terry. You're under arrest. It's one easy motion. Cuffs come out, right arm down. Slap 'em on. You're goin' down, clown. Just like you're dancin'. - How was that? - That was perfect. Now, don't be afraid to rough 'im up. That's a bad guy. Hey! Marci. - What are you doin' here? - I just came by to thank you. God, that was so crazy of me to confess to murder. What time is it? - Midnight. - Midnight. I'd invite you in, but, uh I make you uncomfortable, don't I? That's okay. No. Listen, I'm sorry about Brad and Oh, I don't even like Brad anymore. I'm never seeing his show again. No way. Which is easy to say anyway, 'cause, you know, they canceled it. Well, okay. Good for you. I'm happy for you. They told me how you solved the case and everything, Adrian. I just think you're wonderful. No. Not-Not really. Yeah. Really. I started a whole Web site about you. And a newsletter. Don't do that. Oh, you are the greatest detective in the world. You are the greatest detective in the universe. You should have your own show! No. No, I'm You should. You have to promise me something. Will you promise me something? If you ever do get your own show, you have to promise me that you will never change the theme song. Okay? I promise. That's the only thing. You promise? - Sure. I promise. - You promise? Good night."
"Oh, they're doing George Clooney. If I were 10 years younger, I'd be all over that man. Oh, uh, Sex and the City. I don't think so. No. You're too young to be watching that one. I think. You know, I don't even know how old you are. If nobody claims you by next week, I'm adopting you. Would you like that? Hmm? Shut up! Shut up! - Throw that over her. - I'm trying! Hey.!

Well, we think it's a calling card. There was a radical group in the early '70s. The Lightning Brigade? They were involved in some R.O.T.C. Bombings I know who the Lightning Brigade was, Lieutenant. I remember the '70s. At least some of it. You okay? They have a cat. I'm allergic to cats. Okay, we've got two short hours before this phone call. Are we ready? Yeah, we're all set, Captain. We've got two recorders ready to roll, and the phone company's online for an immediate track and trace. How long do we need? Well, if it's a land line, we've got 'em. - If it's a cell phone - Which it will be. We'll need 45 seconds. Excuse me. Captain Stottlemeyer? Hello. I'm Julie Parlo. Uh, where is the F.B.I.? This is a kidnapping. I happen to be a lawyer, so I know in a kidnapping situation the F.B.I. has jurisprudence. That's only true if your grandmother's been taken across the state lines. Or if she's been held for more than 24 hours. And I think you meant to say ""jurisdiction,"" right? What kind of lawyer are you? - Oh, uh, I never said I was a lawyer. - Yes, you did. I- I'm a law student at Garland College, and I know that I have certain rights. And if you don't do everything you can to get my grandmother back, I could sue you all for malpractice. No, you can't. I- I can't? No. Miss Parlo, you live here with your grandmother, right? Yeah. I moved in after both my parents died. That was four years ago. - So it's just the two of you? - Oh, yes, sir. Well, and the cat. Yeah, I know about the cat. Is your grandmother wealthy? No. That's why this doesn't make any sense. Why Nana? She She's 76 years old, she's not rich, she doesn't have an enemy in the world, and she's out there somewhere right now scared to death. Captain, you've gotta do something. What about, um, that detective I was reading about? Uh, the-the monk? Monk. His name is Monk. Yeah, I read an article about him. Um, they quoted you. You said he was brilliant. Yeah, um, Adrian Monk is a former homicide detective who we use on a consulting basis from time to time once we've hit a wall. But we haven't hit a wall, Miss Parlo. Everything is under control. Sorry. Careful. Slowly. Concentrate. Be the dotted line. Oh! Come in. It's open. Adrian Monk? You're not Sharona. No, sir. Um, my name's Julie Parlo. I need your help. Uh It's my grandmother. She's been kidnapped. Thank you. Uh Okay, there. Okay. We'll just keep it right there if you need it again. Um, Mr. Monk, you're a private consultant now, right? Okay, 'cause, um, I want to hire you. There's just one thing. Uh, I can't pay you. Well, that's that's a problem. My assistant, Sharona, won't let me take any more cases for free. Doesn't she work for you? Well, it's complicated. Here's the thing. I don't have any money, but I can pay you in trade. Um, if you help me, I can help you. What are we What are we talking about here? I can get you reinstated. Reinstated? I know you want your badge back more than anything, and I already talked to Professor Emory about your situation. Professor Em Eugene Emory? At Garland College? That's right. I'm in his class. Oh, my God! I just read his book. Oh, yeah. We have a test on that next week. It It's wonderful. What's it about? Oh, well, it's an argument for tort reform. Professor Emory feels that we could eliminate all superfluous litigation if we cap punitive damages and hold the plaintiff liable for any court expenses. Well, I'm sure you could get out of the test because your grandmother Right. Whew! But you you did talk to Professor Emory, to Eugene Emory about me? Yeah. He said he could definitely get you reinstated. He guaranteed it. How? I'll tell you when my grandmother's home safe and sound. Do we have a deal? Well, I I could always call Professor Emory myself. But I won't. She can get you reinstated? She talked to Eugene Emory, the Pulitzer Prize winner. There's some sort of loophole in the law. It-It It's too good to be true. Exactly. You okay? She has a cat. Well, why don't you tell her to bring it upstairs? No. No. It doesn't matter. If a cat's been in a house in the last year, I can't stop sneezing. Really? Remind me to buy a cat. Ooh. Well, at least you won't be alone on Saturday nights. Is anybody hungry? I made these pastries while we're waiting - just to keep my mind off things. - Oh, thanks. No. Mmm. Really good. Delicious. You could sell these. Actually, it's always been my dream to open up my own bakery. So why are you in law school? Oh, well, that's what my parents always wanted. So, uh, I used their life insurance money to pay for the tuition. But if you're not happy Well, you don't want to disappoint your parents, even if they're not here. Well, especially if they're not here. I understand. Not a word. She's alone in the house. Now, nobody is in the room but her. Julie, we need 45 seconds, okay? You can do it. / Okay. Hello. This is the Lightning Brigade. All the power to the people. - Uh, okay. - We have your grandmother. - Is she all right? - She's fine. And if you want her to stay that way, do exactly what we say. Don't try to keep us on the phone, Julie. We're not stupid. Um, well, okay, but can I can I talk to her? I said she's fine. Don't you trust me? Yeah, but she has a heart condition. Um, she needs her medication. Then you'd better listen carefully. Here's what I need you to do. What? Do you want me to hang up? Is that Is that what you want? Who's there? You blew it, honey. Forty-one seconds. We missed him. She had something on her cheek. - Do you think they'll call again? - I don't think so. Sharona, watch him. Um, that wasn't the police. I'm just really nervous, okay? I swear. Don't be nervous. Here's what we need you to do. There are hundreds of homeless people in the Mission District. They suffer needlessly while just blocks away the rich stuff their fat faces in fancy restaurants. Okay, we're we're not rich. Shut up and listen! Tonight we're redistributing the wealth. I want you to buy every homeless person in the Mission District a turkey dinner. A turk turkey dinner? Just do it, and Grandma will be home before you know it. Okay, well, what time She didn't get it. They want turkey dinners for all the homeless people in the Mission District. What the hell is going on? This is crazy. What kind of ransom demand is this? I know. The kidnappers are risking life in prison for what $500 worth of food? I mean, the shelter on Third is serving turkey tonight anyway. Well, we can't stand around here like this. We don't exactly blend in. Do you have a suggestion? This is crazy. It doesn't matter. I'm getting my badge back. I'll believe that when I see it. Julie Parlo didn't exactly seem like Supreme Court material. - Gravy? - No, thanks. Everyone else is having gravy. I don't like it. Why don't you have a little gravy? He doesn't want any gravy. I think the gentleman can speak for himself. Sir? I don't want any gravy. Okay. Sure. Enjoy your meal. Oh, my God! - What are you supposed to be? - I'm undercover. I'm homeless. - What's that on your face? - Dirt. Give the lady some gravy. Here it is. I don't want it. Didn't you just ask for gravy? I didn't say anything. Oh. Well, here it is. I told you. I don't want it. Okay, how about this then? You have some gravy And? That's it. We got her. We got her back. They dropped her off two blocks away. Call E.M.S.! It's me. How's Grandma Parlo doing? Oh, she's a tough old bird. But she can't I.D. The kidnappers? Blindfolded the whole time. But she thinks she's heard their voices before. She just can't remember where. Well, at least they didn't hurt her. No. She was treated pretty well, considering. They even kept saying ""Be careful"" when they carried her out of the house. Yeah, they fed her pizza. All the pizza she could eat. I can't even get pizza at my house. Get this. They played opera. The old lady says she could hear it through the door. The kidnappers are into opera. What kind of revolution is this? We're about to find out. We picked up Ron Abrash this morning. He was the leader of the Lightning Brigade 30 years ago. He's in the box now. You want to sit in? - You're asking me to sit in? - Yeah. I heard you might be getting your badge back. It'd be good practice for you. Thanks. I'm going in. Okay. Cool. It'll be the three of us. We can do good cop, bad cop, worse cop. Randy, it's a two-man job. Just wait here. Oh, okay. I'll just wait here and Weep openly. Do some paperwork. While you weep openly. Head inside. Don't you people read the papers? The Brigade is ancient history. We broke up like 25 years ago. Besides, all we cared about was the war. Remember the war? Yeah, I remember the war. I had a brother over there. So you're denying any involvement in the kidnapping of Mrs. Parlo? Of course I deny it. Demanding free turkey dinners? That's insane. Besides, I'm a vegan. All right, Ronnie. Where were you yesterday at 7:30 in the morning? I was in my classroom. I teach graduate level English and screenwriting at Berkeley. Call them. Check it out. The most radical thing I do these days is give the finger to jerks driving SUVs. All right. Maybe it wasn't you. Maybe it was some of your old playmates trying to relive their glory days. Maybe they missed the buzz. You look familiar, Ronnie. Didn't I see you last week at the opera? The opera? What have you been smoking, man? I've been smoking the truth, man! What are you guys doing good cop, crazy cop? Ronnie, could you roll up your left sleeve? All right. So I still have the tattoo. It doesn't mean anything. It's like having an old girlfriend's name on your arm. It doesn't mean you still love her. That lightning bolt has three jags. That's right. Resist, revolt, reform. That was our motto. Captain, can I talk to you for a second? Captain, I don't think it was him or anybody in his group. You heard him. Each of those three jags means something. Any real member of the Brigade would have known that. But look look what was painted on Mrs. Parlo's wall. Two jags. How'd you know he had a tattoo on his arm? Oh, uh, I didn't. His other sleeve was rolled up. - It wasn't even. - Exactly. I don't think this was about politics at all. There is something else going on here. Well, you knock yourself out, Monk. As far as we're concerned, this is on the back burner. It wasn't exactly the crime of the century. ""Turkey for the people. Right on. "" Hey. / Hi. I'll bring the car around, and you'll be home in half an hour. Julie. Julie, what is it? I never should've left you alone. I should've been there. Oh, honey. This is not your fault. I should have stabbed him in his particulars when I had the chance. What would I do if anything ever happened to you? You would have had a brilliant, rich, full life. You would have met a man, had children, and you'd name one after me. And then open up that bakery you're always going on about. That's all I was thinking about when I was locked up in that horrible room. So you've gotta be home by 5:00, okay? Oh, hi, Julie. - Oh, hey. Nana, this is Sharona Fleming. - Okay. I've gotta go. She works for Adrian Monk, the detective I was telling you about. Yes. Oh, hi, Mrs. Parlo. How are you feeling? Oh, a lot better. Tell me. Is it true? They said that they'd arrested a hippie that belonged to that group, the Lightning Rods. Uh, yeah, the the Lightning Brigade. I should have stabbed him in his particulars. Well, actually my boss doesn't think they were involved at all. He thinks somebody was framing them. Yeah. Uh, Jul Julie, can I just talk to you for a second? Oh, yeah. Nana, I'll be right there. Um, I just want to make sure that you remember what you promised Adrian. You know, that if he helped you Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. About getting him reinstated. Yeah. Yeah, just, um, come by the law school library tonight. I'll be there with my whole study group. / Great. Great. Well, I just want to let you know that he's really counting on this. It It really means a lot to him, you know? Look. I understand. A deal's a deal. I mean, it's like we have a verbal Uh, what's the word? Verbal Ugh! I'm drawing a blank. - Excuse me. Miss Parlo? - Contract. That's it. / Miss Parlo? Excuse me, Miss Parlo. Why do you think the Lightning Brigade targeted your grandmother? Oh, we have no idea. Is she a political activist? An activist? No, no, no. My grandmother doesn't even vote. Besides, Adrian Monk, the most respected detective in San Francisco, Doesn't even think the Brigade is involved at all. The police don't seem to care about the case at all. They're calling it a harmless prank. Any comment? Well, Adrian Monk cares, and he is not going to quit until he finds the people or peoples responsible for committing this horrible crime. Thank you, Miss Parlo. Hey, guys. Uh, Adrian Monk. Um, Sharona Fleming. This is my study group. - Edie Rusher. - Hi. - Tom Burton and Sasha Gordon. - Hi. Oh, are you studying in Spanish? Um, yeah. I'm taking my next bar exam in Peru. It's all true and false down there. Doesn't that mean you'll only be able to practice in Peru? Uh, geez. Do any of you have any professional experience yet or Oh, well, uh, we've done a lot of pro bono work. Last year we assisted in two death penalty cases: Sal Dickerson and Bill Jansen. Dickerson and Jansen? Weren't they I miss them every day. That's how you learn. By making mistakes. Now we know if you're filing a stay of execution, you have to take into account daylight savings time. The law's hard, Mr. Monk. Look at all these books. Hmm? And there are more upstairs. Uh, about my reinstatement. You guys definitely talked in person to to Professor Emory Eugene Emory? Absolutely. These are his notes right here. Professor Emory said it can't fail. It can't fail. Okay, so here is the plan. We sue the police department under Title 1, Section 102B. ""The A.D.A. Prohibits discrimination against a qualified individual in regard to hiring, advancement or discharge of employees. "" The A.D.A.? Americans with Disabilities Act. - It's been the law since 1990. - Disabilities? Well, lucky for you, all your phobias and obsessive behavior have been well-documented, so you could have your badge back as early as next week. All you have to do is take a test. No biggie. Just 20 or 30 questions about department protocol. A mere formality. It's up to you. Should I file this or not? Am I disabled? Well, it's the only way. Right? Okay. Do it. Excuse me. Are you Adrian Monk? A man just gave me this note for you. Don't trust them. Meet me upstairs-3rd floor. Come alone. Oh! I thought you were The note said to come alone. Well, this is as alone as you're gonna get. Where is he? I don't know. Oh, God. This place is creeping me out. - Let's go back downstairs, hmm? - Hold on. Will you forget about the book? They have librarians for that. It'll just take a second. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Adrian? Adrian? Adrian! Oh, my God! A little help.! Oh, my God! Adrian! Don't let go. Don't let go. That's good advice. I better write that down, or I'm gonna forget it. Don't worry. They'll be down in a minute. Okay, here's another question. A man is blocking the main entrance of a store. - What is the charge? - Obstructing a public access. That's right. The test used to determine whether a handgun has recently The paraffin diphenylamine test. Are all the questions gonna be this easy? I think so. This is the official practice book. Then I am in, baby. Already had my old uniform cleaned and pressed. Adrian, don't you think that's a little premature? / It's not premature. It is perfectly mature. Sharona, ahh, I'm back. Look who's awake. Are you ready for your test? Piece of cake. Mrs. Parlo, how are you feeling? Oh, don't worry about me. I heard what happened to you in the library. It just means we're getting close. Somebody is getting nervous, Mrs. Parlo. So now I want to try to find out exactly where they took you. Sharona, do you have that map? All right, but I I told the chief of police I I couldn't help him. I had an afghan over my head. Maybe we'll be able to figure it out anyway. Okay. / We're here. What are you doing? Just smoothing it out. What else do you remember about the trip? Well, like I said, I didn't see a thing. Did you hear anything? No. I'm sorry. Did you smell anything? You know, now that you mention it, I did. - I smelled fresh bread. - Bread. Oh, my God. There's a There's a big bakery on Claxton Boulevard. You can smell it when you drive past. And then we stopped for four or maybe five minutes. - Why so long? - Were they getting gas? - No. - Could've been a drawbridge. Oh, my God.! Third Street drawbridge across channel. Then just a few minutes later, we got to their house, and it was exactly 8:00. How do you know that? My watch was beeping. See, I I set it so I don't forget to take my ticker pills. And And it was raining. Are you sure? It wasn't raining all week. Listen, missy. I think I know what rain feels like, and that's what I felt when they carried me from the van into the house. And, you know, that wasn't all. - Cough drops. - Cough drops? I distinctly smelled cough drops. Eucalyptus trees. They smell like cough drops. There's the big bakery. Turn here. You gotta turn Turn here. Will you relax? I'm turning. Okay, there's the drawbridge. Stop the car! The bridge is up! Do you wanna drive? No. You're doing fine. This has to be the block. I can smell the eucalyptus from here. But which house? - Well, we'll know in a few seconds. - What do you mean? Mrs. Parlo said it was raining at exactly 8:00. But what she felt wasn't rain. Automatic sprinkler system. That's our house. Oh, which one is it? Oh, great. That one. They fed her pizza, remember? You're gonna be a pretty good cop. - Now what? - Now Now we take a picture of whoever comes out of the house. Mrs. Parlo said she recognized their voices. Maybe she knows who they are. - How are we gonna get their picture? - I don't know. Why don't you think of something? I did the sprinkler thing. It's your turn. - Oh, so now we're taking turns? - Yes, now we're taking turns. - Since when? - It's our new policy. Didn't you get my memo? Stay here. - I'll send you a memo. - What did you say? Nothing. I heard the word ""memo. "" Just stay here and study for your test. Get the camera ready. - Harold, what's going on? - Nothing. These cars have a mind of their own. German engineering, my ass. I don't see anything. Let's go. - Well, strike me pretty! - You do recognize them. Oh, yes. They were here just last week. Remember? They came about the cat. Two weeks ago, Nana took in a stray cat. It didn't have a collar. We didn't know who it belonged to. We were worried about you. I ran off some flyers and put them up, and the next day this couple called us. Harold and Carol Maloney. They own an antique store on Grannis Boulevard. It's five blocks away. I knew there was something sneaky about them. You know where I should have stabbed them? Yeah, I I think we do. Their cat had run away a few days ago, so they came over, but it wasn't theirs. Is that it? They just looked at the cat? Did they say or do anything unusual? No. They were just here a few minutes. We never saw 'em again. Mr. Monk, I don't understand. They're antique dealers. What do they want with Nana? And what's all this crap about turkey dinners? I don't know yet. Why don't we call the captain? Let's wait until tomorrow. I should have more clout by then. What do you mean? Well, thanks to your granddaughter, by this time tomorrow I'll be back on the force. Have a seat. You'll have 30 minutes to answer all 50 questions. Make sure you fill in the little circles completely, so the computer can read them. What if I finish early? You might want to check your work. I don't think that'll be necessary. Are you ready? Go. Good luck. Yes? / Could you take one of these off the table? Why? I can't have two. I get confused. Which one? This one. Wait. Uh, you know what? That one. Wait. You You better choose. All right. Okay? Thanks. I'll I'll do the same for you sometime. You, uh, have a half hour. No problem. No problem. Oh, you finished? I need a new sheet. A little hole. Now, where is he? - He locked himself in. - In my office? I don't think so. Hey, Monk, open the door! Let me guess. He didn't pass the test. He didn't quite finish. How far did he get? He did one question. Over and over and over. - What's that? - His pencil. Adrian, you can retake the test! I'll never pass.! Hey, Monk? Go find a key. Monk, listen to me. Listen. I think that you you failed that test on purpose. You-You don't want to get your badge back on a technicality, right? You want to earn it. You will. Adrian, you will. You'll You're gonna be a great cop again. You're gonna do it the right way, and I respect you for that. Now, open the door. Monk! Open that damn door! I'm gonna give you until three. A.M. Or P.M.? Not three o'clock, you fool! One! Two! Hey, what the heck What is that? Monk! I think that's your chair. Monk, that's my father's chair! If you put one scratch on that chair, I will I will never forgive you! Monk, be careful with that chair. Move the chair, Monk. Monk, move the chair. Are you okay? You said ""Be careful"" because you love that chair. / That's right. The kidnappers said ""Be careful"" when they carried Mrs. Parlo out of the house. They weren't worried about her. They were worried about that chair. What chair? The chair she was tied to. That's what this whole thing has been about. That's my grandmother's chair.! - I recognize it.! - She is lying. People make false claims about pieces like this, all the time. You like opera? Yes, we love it. Is that a crime? It should be. Ooh, captain, please! Tell me about the chair, Mr. Maloney. I'd be happy to. It is a Fanback Windsor in original finish, built in 1774. Dealers like us wait our whole lives for a piece like this. Note the engraving on the back in the shape of Monticello. / Mm-hmm. This chair was personally handcrafted by Thomas Jefferson. In fact, there is some evidence to support the fact that he sat in this very chair while he drafted the Declaration of Independence. Does it swivel? How much is it worth? Two. Maybe 2.5. Million? Yes, Lieutenant, million. Actually, we'll find out for sure next week. We're auctioning it off. I don't imagine any of you will be bidding on it. Well, where did you get it? I'll tell you where they got it. They stole it from my grandmother's house. She's right. Your cat ran away. You saw the flyer, and you went to their house looking for it, and that's where you saw the chair. You must have recognized it right away, but what could you do? You couldn't offer to buy it. They might have had it appraised, and that would have ruined everything. You couldn't steal it. The cops would have been looking for it. You'd never be able to sell it. Then you had an idea. It was brilliant, really. You kidnapped Mrs. Parlo and carried her out of the house with the chair, Made some ridiculous ransom demand / Be careful. And then let her go. You figured anyone would be so relieved to have their nana back that they wouldn't even remember the missing chair. Prepare to be disappointed, Mr. Monk. I can prove providence. I have a receipt. We bought the chair from a dealer in Baton Rouge four years ago. The poor sap. He didn't know what he was sitting on. Literally. I bet it's a forgery. Forgery is a serious offense. It is a class ""C"" felony. Or ""B."" ""B"" or ""C."" The receipt will have to speak for itself. Unfortunately, the dealer has since passed on. Oh, how convenient. So can you prove that the chair belongs to you? Hmm? No. Interesting. Huh. Okay, well, until you can, I suggest you all leave. It's my dinnertime. Well, that could've gone better. Can't we do anything? I cannot question them officially unless you've got something, anything, to prove that you own that chair. Do you have anything on paper? No. Nana bought it at a flea market 20 years ago. She can't even remember where. Do you have a picture of it? I checked all our photo albums. Nothing. Wait a minute. Listen. Listen to what? Listen to you. You're not sneezing. You haven't sneezed at all since we got here. That's true. The Maloneys said they had a cat that ran away. - That's why they went to Julie's house. - Right. They lied. They never had a cat. Otherwise you'd be sneezing your head off. You're right. He's right. I'm lost, as usual. If the Maloneys never had a cat, why did they go to your house in the first place? They must have known about the chair somehow. Do you still have a copy of that flyer? Uh, I think so. That's the prettiest picture I've ever seen. Hi, folks. Remember us? I was wondering if we could bother you again. Thank you. Congratulations. You solved the case. Well, I had a little help. Hi, Nana. Guess what! I'm quitting law school. I'm buying my own bakery. Yes, we can afford it. We can afford anything we want. I love you, Nana."
"There's juice in the blender. Jared's gonna say he hates it, but he has to drink it. - Juice is not negotiable. - I understand. Oh, and I need you to stop at the farmer's market to pick up some vegetables. There's a list on the counter. The farmer's market. Why can't we just shop at the supermarket like everybody else? Leland, please. Do you want your children to be like everybody else and have chemicals and pesticides and God knows what, or do you want them to be better than everybody else? Better. Damn! - What is in there? - Lighting equipment. - Well, how much did that cost? - Oh, don't worry, Leland. I will pay you back. That's not the point. What I meant was that it's We-We can't afford lighting equipment! Move. If I had a digital camera I wouldn't need so much lighting equipment. We cannot afford a new camera! Karen, I do not want to have another fight! I would love to have another fight, because I am sick and tired of this one. Don't forget about the farmer's market, and don't pretend to forget about the farmer's market. I will call you later. And I love you too. Hi. I'm leaving right now. Is Sandy there yet? Tell Jerry I'm bringing my lighting kit. We'll need about an hour to set up.

Captain. - Happy garbage day! - Thank you. What are you doing here? Oh, I was just in the neighborhood. I was going to the farmer's market to buy alfalfa sprouts. I figured I'd drop that off. That's your check for the Rutherford case. Late. - Who's late? - Garbage truck. It's 8:22. They've never been this late. No, it's 8:15. Is that the watch that Trudy gave you? So, you're never gonna know what time it is for the rest of your life? / Maybe. You know, Trudy's been gone for seven years. I I think maybe it's time you think about letting go. - Letting go? - Yeah. You should think about your future. What future? - Your future. - I don't have one. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. And I think that you should you should start thinking about building a life. You should, uh, get on with it. Just let it go. At least buy a new watch. - Just think about it. - I'm afraid to. Here! Here they come. Hold on. Where's - Where's Tully? - On vacation. He never said anything to me about a vacation. Why would he tell you? We have a relationship. He's been collecting my garbage for years. Mister, relax, okay? We know what we're doing. You know, we taught Tully the garbage game, okay? Okay. Yeah, but wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You You have to start from this end. Tully always starts from this end. Didn't Tully mention me? Believe me, I would have remembered. What's in here? Water. You're throwing away water? Don't ask. Okay, now now this one. Dude, what difference does it make, man? I mean, it's all going to the same place. Actually, no. When you get to the dump, uh, my bags go in Sector Nine. Sector Nine? Tully puts my garbage in Sector Nine, so so it's separate. Right. Sector Sector Nine. - You got it, Sector Nine. - Have a good day. Hey, God bless you and your work. Captain, I've been trying to call you. What's going on? This morning This morning / For God's sake, Randy, just say it! It's Karen. I'm Leland Stottlemeyer. My wife, Karen, was just brought in. Captain, I'm Dr. Maulding. I was on duty when she was admitted. Um, would you like to come with me? I have an office upstairs No, no. Now. Tell me now. She has some internal hemorrhaging and a non-displaced fracture of the skull. Bottom line. What's the bottom line? Her vital signs are strong. They seem to be holding. If the swelling goes down, we're going to operate first thing in the morning. Wh-Who's gonna do that? - Dr. Schecter and Dr. Foster. - They're good. I'm an R.N. I interned here seven years ago. She's right. They're the best we have. Okay. Could I see her? In a few minutes. Um, Captain. We're good at our job. Let us do it. Okay. Okay. - Right, right. I'll call you back. - What do you got? Okay, this is what we know Sniper on Highway 9. So far it looks completely random a thrill killing. He took out the tow truck driver, - and the truck spun into the - Into Karen! Who was it? We don't have him yet. - I want everybody. - You've got them, sir. Everybody is volunteering. There's gonna be a task force. I talked to the commissioner. - He said whatever you need. - All right, good. Monk. You / I know. If I lose her / I know. We Karen / I know. - Since Since we were kids. - I know. I know. Is there anything I can do? You know what you can do. The victim's name was Fernandez. Frank Fernandez, 34, unmarried. He lives in Oakland. Witnesses? We're still knocking on doors. Not yet. He shot from over there? Yes. Any idea where he parked? We haven't found any tracks. He could have parked anywhere. There's a million little side roads around here. We're still looking. But why there in the open? The surrounding area is heavily wooded. There'd have been more cover. I don't know. It's a good question. Ooh! Hey, you lost? No. I'm just thinking. I'm not talking to you. Don't, Sharona! Don't Don't touch the dog, okay? Just please don't pat the dog. - Don't touch the dog. - Well, why? Okay, if you touch the dog, Sharona, I'm I have to let you go. You always say you're gonna let me go, but you never do it. Don't listen to him. He doesn't like anybody. - Come on. Whose doggy are you? - We recovered the shell. It's a thirty-aught-six from a Winchester bolt action. It's not a sniper's rifle. He's a hunter. Look at this. He crawled through this hole. Shirt got caught. He fired from over there behind the mound. How did he know the hole was here? Maybe he cased the area? Or he lives nearby. She's gonna want to keep it. We can't have a dog! You don't live together. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You want to see something really weird? No. Okay. He wasn't wearing any shoes. What? - Watch your step. - Bare feet? Why would a sniper go barefoot? Especially at 6:00 in the morning. It's been freezing. Maybe he was an American Indian? An American Indian sniper? Maybe it was an uprising against technology. That doesn't make a lot of sense. Hardly any, really. - Oh, ""Native American. "" - That doesn't help. Lieutenant Disher Really? / Uh-huh. You're gonna wanna to see this. Yahhh! This can't be a coincidence. What are you talking about? Frank Fernandez, the truck driver. They've looked everywhere. They can't find them. Can't find what? His shoes. He was barefoot too. Hey. Hey yourself. - I brought you some coffee. - Thanks. How's Mrs. S.? She's still unconscious. - Have you seen her yet? - Yeah, I've seen her. I'll feel a whole lot better when she can see me. How are the boys doing? They're scared to death. They're with my mother, which is scary enough. What do you got? It's coming together. What does that mean? The killer and the victim were both barefoot. I mean, Monk isn't sure what it means, but he knows it's important. What, do you have a suspect? Do you have a name? Not yet. The task force has a theory. They're checking it out. What? I'm not supposed to tell you. They warned me. You know the local transport union's on strike. / Yeah? Harry Bolston, the union boss, he's made a few threats. It's getting ugly. Okay. The tow truck belonged to a union shop. The driver was a scab. It was a union thing? It's just a theory, sir. - They're not sure yet. - Son of a bitch. - Where are you going? - Never you mind, son. Okay, I'll go with you. No deal, no work! No deal, no work! - No deal, no work! - Who's on the front gate? Little Tommy and his crew. Tell him to take pictures of all the drivers, so we know who they are. And don't hide the cameras. I want them to know that we know. Yes, sir, Mr. Bolston. If you want, they can do more than just take pictures. No. / You're the boss. No deal, no work! No deal, no work! No deal, no work! Okay. Okay, bye. That was Disher. They're on their way. Why are we even here? - I want to protect the captain. - From who? From himself. Adrian? No! You call him ""Adrian""? It seemed to fit. He's nervous, and he's always cleaning himself. - You should be flattered. - I should be, but I'm not. Scabs go home! Scabs! All right. Scabs.! Union! Union! Scabs go home! Union! - What are you doing? - Well, I'm a union girl. - Since when? - Since I started working for you. Scabs go home! I should start my own shop. Do it. I'll join you. You're not allowed. You're management. Oh, yeah? Good. Get rid of the dog. Will you stop worrying about this? I got the vet's number off the collar. They gave me the owner's name, and I'm gonna drop him off later, okay? Okay. I'm gonna miss you. Gonna miss you, honey. No work, no deal! No work, no deal! - Where is Harry Bolston? - Captain, please be careful. Bolston's already sued the department twice. I'm just gonna talk to the man, Randy. That's all. Captain, I think you're making a mistake. / Not now, Monk. I- I don't think the union is involved. Look, you've been reading about this strike. The negotiations are going their way. Every editorial is behind them. Why would they do something stupid now? - It doesn't make any sense. - It makes sense to me. Also, the shooter wasn't wearing shoes. Can you imagine any of these guys running around barefoot? - Well, maybe he wasn't thinking straight. - Maybe you're not. Look, Monk, you don't know what I'm thinking. I think I do. The place you're in now, that's where I live. Look, I'm just gonna go talk to the guy, all right? - There's no - That's all. Stay here. Hey, Bolston. I'm Captain Stottlemeyer, San Francisco Police Department. This is a legal strike, Captain. We've got every right to be here. I don't care about your strike. There was a shooting on Highway 9 this morning. - A driver was killed. - Yeah, I heard about that. I already talked to the cops. I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told them I had nothing to do with that. It's what we call serendipity. ""Serendipity. "" You've got five seconds to wipe that smile off your face. Did you say this? ""We're gonna bring this company down using any means necessary""? - Did you say that? - No. I was misquoted. - You know how that goes. - This is incitement, you son of a bitch. You might as well have pulled the trigger yourself. Now look, Captain. I can't control every member of my union, just like you can't control every stupid, loudmouth cop in your department, can you? You're Frank Wicks, aren't you? I brought you in for assault during the last strike, didn't I? - You got a good memory. - You're damn right I do. - Do you own a hunting rifle, Wicks? - I don't have a gun. - I don't need one. - Right. - Where were you at 6:00 this morning? - He was with me. We were here, okay? All morning, setting up. Captain! The hospital just called. Karen's awake. This isn't over. I got 10 lawyers. Call one of'em! We've stopped the hemorrhaging and all the internal bleeding. About an hour ago she started fasciculating. Oh, my Lord! No, no, no. That's a good thing. It means she's she's stable. She's not out of the woods yet. We still don't know how serious the head injury is. The next six hours will tell the story. Can we see her? Maybe tomorrow after the surgery. I think her husband could use some help. Hey. I hate hospitals. The doctor says she's stable. Thank God. She woke up for a couple minutes. I She could barely breathe. That's how much pain she's in. She asked how the kids were. I said the kids were fine. She passed out again. If I lose her What if I lose her? You're not. You're not. You're not gonna lose her. ""Not gonna lose her. "" I remember I said that to you one time. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Peanut bar. I hate these. Do you want it? - Why'd you buy it? - I didn't buy it. I felt like hitting something. Adrian, I'm gonna spank you. Come on. - Are you talking to me or the dog? - Both. Ooh! / Oh, I'II-I'll-I'll-I'll I'll stay here. That's a good idea. Come on. Come on. Come on. Samson! There you are! Oh! Where you been, huh? Where's you been? Mmm. Where's my squirrel? Usually when he runs away he brings me back a dead squirrel. You must be disappointed. Your taste is getting better. She's a lot cuter than a dead squirrel. Thanks. I'm Evan Coker. Uh, Sharona Fleming. Sharona, I I don't know how to thank you. I I've been going out of my mind. I don't know how he got away. I must have left the gate open. Well, he's really a great dog. I had to leave him at my sister's, 'cause if I brought him home, my son would have fallen in love with him. He gets very attached to pets, you know? I think it's because his father's not around. I I'm divorced. - Okay. - All right. - I like your car. - Thank you. I just got it. It's kind of an impulse thing. Well, impulses can be fun. Excuse me. What are you doing? Hi. I was, uh, just fixing your sundial. - Yeah, leave it alone. It's fine. - Ahhh. It's five hours off. No, it's not. My son checked it last week. Oh! Well, he did it wrong. - Well, he's an astronomer. - Oh. Maybe his watch was broken? Who are you? Just a concerned citizen, ma'am. Just a Good Samaritan just passing by. - You're demented! - Well, that's a matter of opinion. Oh. There you go. It's all done, and you'll thank me later. Get out of my yard, you creep! Do you know him? Yeah, he's my boss. I don't know how he got out. I must have left the gate open. - So what does he do? - He's a detective. We're working with the police now on that sniper case. Oh, yeah, I heard about that. They think it's a union thing, right? No, no. My - My boss doesn't think so. - Oh, he doesn't? No. And believe it or not, he's never wrong. Hi, Karen. Hi! / Hi. - Hello. - Are those lilacs? I love lilacs. Thank you. - Will you put 'em here? - Sure. - How do you feel? - Like I was hit by a truck. Ah, get it? / Oh. I do. Shhh. He's been sleeping there all night. What are you doing? Just making them even. - Even? - You'll sleep better if they're even. What are you talking about? Hey! Did Max draw this? Yeah. The boys were here all morning. You know, they're the best medicine in the world. You know, if if there's anything we can do, we Well, as a matter of fact are you busy tomorrow? Because we need someone to take the boys out to lunch. Yeah. Sharona, I promised my mother that I'd give her a break. But I've got to work, so You know, I'd love to, but Benjy has a dentist appointment. Hey! But Adrian can take 'em! - Uhh - They would love that! Would you mind, Adrian? You mean, take the children to a restaurant? - Uh-huh. - You mean, a public restaurant? - Umm - They would love it. Sure. Great idea. Boy, I can't wait. Monk, I'm wide awake. Wide awake. Get over here.! He's hurt bad.! Hurry up.! Right. Okay, good work. Captain? - What? - You were right. Second shooting at the truck depot? Thirty-aught-six from a Winchester the same gun. So they're both union related. Don't try to tell me any different. - What about the barefoot angle? - What about it? Well, Monk seems to think the union isn't / Look.! It's not his wife being fed through a tube, is it? No, sir. You know, I've been reading about this, uh this sniper. That's, uh, really terrifying. The police think it's union related. And what-what, you don't agree? I think the second shooting was a diversion to throw us all off the trail. Hmm. Well, it's still a tough case. How do you feel? I'm torn. Half of me is worried about Karen, and 40% is worried about Captain Stottlemeyer, and five percent is relieved that somebody finally understands what I've been going through. You know that's not 100%? I know. I always keep part of me empty for-for emergencies. What So-So, what, you-you offered to take the two boys to lunch? I didn't exactly offer. I just felt it was, uh it was something that I- I-I had to, uh Sorry. I can't concentrate. What is that noise? Oh. Oh, that's, uh, the white noise machine. We've always had it here. No, this one's different. Well, yeah. I mean, the-the other one broke. Uh, it's just a new newer model. But it's the same. No, it's not. No. The old one went, ""shuuu. "" And this one goes, ""shiii,"" not ""shuuu,"" ""shiii. "" It's like a half an octave higher. I'm I'm sure all your patients are complaining. No, No, actually, you're the only one. Well, they're being polite. Is that better? No. No. All right, Adrian, would you like me to try to get the old machine fixed? - Oh, that would be great. - Uh-huh. Thank you. I'll wait here. I didn't mean now, Adrian. I'll try to have it for next week. - Captain. - What's that? That savings and loan robbery in Delmare last Monday. Clerk was shot and killed during the get away. - The clerk was 22 years old. - I got it, Rick. Captain? Captain. What? / We've got other cases, sir, and they're starting to pile up. No! Randy, you have other cases. In this room, there are no other cases.! Understood? What the hell is this? What is he doing here? Harry Bolston to see Agent Grooms. Yeah. He'll be right with you. Good. You got a room around here where I can make a call in private? Right out here, first door to your right. - Agent Grooms called him in. - He Without my okay? According to Grooms, he's been cooperating. Yeah, I'll bet he's been cooperating. Sir, don't. Randy. This is my house. Randy, the man is in my house. - Where'd Bolston go? - Conference room. Just spend the money. Yeah, that's what the strike fund is for. Later. Captain Stottlemeyer. Captain Stottlemeyer is not here. It's just us, Harry. Just a couple of guys. I heard about your wife. I'm sorry, I really am. - What's her name? - Her name is Karen. Well, I'll look into it. And if it was one of my crew, I'll take care of it. It was one of your crew, Harry. Probably handpicked. - Everything okay, boss? - Yeah. Why don't you call in some more goons, make it a fair fight? Now, listen, Captain. I can't do business with you hounding me like this. So what's it gonna take to get you off of my back? It's gonna take a heck of lot more than your girlfriend here. Stay down! Stay down! Oh, boy! - What did you do? - He didn't do anything. My friend tripped on his own shoelaces. It wasn't me. Ever been here before, Mr. Monk? No. No, I don't go out much. Oh, we come here all the time. Well, I can see why. It's so loud and loud. - Is this really what the '50s were like? - Exactly. It's like a time machine. Max, stay in the lines, okay? Max, you have to stay inside the lines. I don't want to. Please. It's-It's a rule. Rules are fun, huh? Finish that later, okay? Hey, cats and kittens, what's shaking? I'm Cindy-Lou. I'll be your waitress. Who's ready to roll? I'll have an Astro Burger and a Coke. Me, too. / Yeah. How about you, Pops? Uhhh. Uh, nothing. I'm fine. I'm good. I just ate, uh, nine hours ago. All right. I'll be back in two shakes. Say something crazy. Hey Max, he's not crazy, okay? He's troubled. Thank you, Jared. I saw your mom today. She-She's really doing great. The doctors say she's gonna be coming home soon. I pray for her every night. Yeah, me too. Check please. - Isn't this fun? - Yes, it is. But what are you gonna do? What is it with you and this sundial? I remembered something when I was with Stottlemeyer's kids. - How'd that go? - Fine, fine. Kids love me. Oh, my God, he's back! I told you before! This is private property! We'll just be one second, ma'am. Thank you very much. Call the captain. I solved the case. Go! - Who What She did it? - No. I wish she did. - You solved it with the sundial? - The sundial is the key. Okay, we've got our warrant. We're going into the union headquarters building here. - I need a block at these two intersections. - It's already done, sir. All right, now, the main offices are on floors two and three. - Are they armed? - We're not sure. Assume yes. We're going in heavy. Two entry teams here and here. Nobody's knocking. We pick and ram. - Who's takin' point on Team One? - That would be me. I go in first. Harry Bolston is mine. - Any questions? - Okay, it's showtime! - Disher. - Suit up! Vests and helmets! Okay. Captain, that was Monk. He said he solved the case. - He what? - He says it's not a union thing. Is he sure? He's Monk. It's your call, Captain. Stand down! Hey, Monk! What do you got? You got a name? Okay. - Take it easy. - Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt anybody. I promised Karen. What do you got? Evan Coker. This was his car. This was the car that was being towed when the driver was shot on Monday. Yeah, remember that dog I found? It belonged to Evan Coker. Coker, yeah. Yeah, it was being repossessed. I mean, we checked him out. He was clean. I mean, I don't even think he was worried about losing it. - Didn't he just buy a new T-Bird? - He didn't care about the car. He cared about something in the car. What, money? A handgun in the glove compartment. Look at the owner's manual. That's gun oil, isn't it? It sure is. He kept a handgun in here. - A gun he had to get back. - Why? I I don't know. Obviously, it it connected him to something. Something worth killing for. Here's what happened. On Monday morning, the sound of the tow truck must have woken him up. His car was being repossessed. He knew that if the car ever got to the impound lot, they'd find his gun. Somehow he had to stop that truck. He had less than a minute to come up with a plan. He didn't have time to get dressed or put his shoes on, which explains the footprints. The truck had to go all the way back through town to reach the highway. He knew that if he ran, he could head it off. That's how the dog got loose and how the sundial next door got turned around. He cut through the backyards, across the edge of the park, climbed through the chain-link fence, and waited for the tow truck. Then / Yeah, I know what happened after that. Right after the crash, he retrieved the gun. There was a gravel road, and he didn't want to walk home barefoot. So before he left, he stole the dead driver's shoes. And somehow he managed to get out of there without anyone noticing him. Don't move her! Don't move her! / Get some help! Well, what about the second shooting at the truck depot? Strictly for our benefit. He wanted us to keep thinking it was a union thing. What do you think? - It's good enough for me. - Okay, Captain. Wait a second. Wait a second! Captain, wait. We've got to We've got to call the task force. We need a search warrant. We got this guy. We've got him. Let's do it right. Hey! What are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood. Hi.! He missed you. Actually, we both did. What happened to your feet? Oh, a windsurfing accident. Mm. / You wanna come in? Well, actually I'm not alone. I have a few friends with me. Great. The more the merrier. - What's going on? - It's a warrant. My friends wanna look around. Look for what? A rifle, a handgun, maybe a pair of shoes taken off a dead truck driver. Do you know who I am? I'm Leland Stottlemeyer. I read about you, uh How's your wife? My wife is gonna be fine. The doctors saved her life. You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too. You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you. Why? Are you afraid I'll use it? I would. I understand now, Monk. You can't let it go, can you? No. Don't ever lose that watch. I won't. - Anything? - Not yet. Is that it? Can I start cleaning my place up now, please? No. Step inside. I'd like to ask you some more questions. Thank you. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's garbage day! Hey! Stop! Stop the truck! What are you doing? Hold it.! Hold it there.! Oh, my God, Mo', it's him, man. - How'd he find us? - Leave that garbage! - Let's just go, man. Let's just go. - Don't Wait up! - You've got the gun.! - Go! Go! Let's get out of here! Wait! Don't go! Don't go! Wait! - That guy is demented. - No, no, no, wait! It's going! Stop.! Stop.! There's evidence in there.! Stop. There's evidence in there! Wait up! Turn off the compactor! Did Adrian Monk just jump into a garbage truck? Yeah. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Brown Merrills, ten and a half. You get these off the driver you shot? What else you got in the bag? Beretta, a nine-millimeter. The savings and loan job in Delmare. Do me a favor! Do me a favor! Resist! Go ahead, please! Captain, don't.! Captain. Don't do this. Don't do this. You'll lose your badge. It's not worth it. You're right. He's not. He's not worth it. Arrest him. Don't hurt him. Mr. Coker, you're under arrest for three counts of felony murder. Get him out of here! Read him his rights. Hi! Hi! - Mommy! - Boys! Oh, my little sweeties. Hi. Oh, I missed you so much. I love you fellas. Smile. Oh, my Where did you get that? - I bought it. - A digital camera! Oh, Leland! But we can't afford it, and the other camera was not even insured. - It's only money. - ""Only money""? Yeah. / Who got hit on the head, me or you? That would be me. Oh! Mmm! Ew! - I love you. - I love you too. Mmm."

Well, why didn't you say anything? We're supposed to be partners here. I didn't want to mention it until I was sure. Now you're sure? I mean, this is really authentic? Yes, Dalton. That's what I've been doing on the Internet all month. That house wasn't easy to find. This Joshua Skinner really was a prospector. He discovered a ton of gold in 1849. Then his partner disappeared. Skinner died 30 years later. They never found the gold. - How much is it worth? - Today's market? Six million, maybe more. And nobody knows where it is? It's a mystery. There never was a clue until now. He killed his own partner over some gold. Can you believe it? As a matter of fact, I can.

It's my mom. Oh, my God. Did something happen? She got married. Oh. / Oh. Well, congratulations. She calls me last week and she says she has a date with an antique dealer a guy named Dalton Padron. So, they go out twice. He proposed to her on their second date. Wow. / Four days later that's yesterday they get married at city hall. Oh, then last night, when they get back to the hotel, he tells her that it's not working. They need counseling. They're goin' to a therapy clinic, Monk, for their honeymoon. Randy, that's not a crime. No, no, no, no. Something is up. He's 37 years old. She's 58. It doesn't make sense. Plus, I don't even think he's playin' for our team. What do you mean? What team?

Is Is she rich? No. That's the thing. She doesn't have a nickel. I send her some money every month, which she spends on bingo and paintings of Jesus. I know she's not the prettiest woman in the world, but she's my mom, and I love her. How could anybody else? All right. We'II We'II We'll check it out. Okay? Thank you. I love you guys. You have good taste a beauty who knows beauty. This is an original Bergere. It was actually made in Paris. I can offer you free delivery. And I'll tell you why. It's really the only way I can make sure I get your address before you leave. So what do you say? Wait. Don't stand on that, please. That chest is a hundred years old. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just looking at the map. Yes. It's Well, it's very rare. It's a copper-plated engraved map, hand painted from 1845. - I don't think so. - Pardon me? There was no West Virginia until after the Civil War, unless I'm wrong, which I'm not. - Really? - It's a forgery. You might want to notify the person who bought it. Yeah. I'II I'll be sure to do that. Thank you. Uh, excuse me. Excuse me? Yes, can you tell me about this armoire? Yeah. It's, uh, solid teak. It's turn of the century or actually, it's 19th century, sorry. It's an Indonesian piece. It's solid teak, as you can see. Yeah, I'm looking for something like this for my bedroom but it looks kinda big. - How tall is it? - Excuse me. Can I help you? I I was in here last year. I spoke to your partner. Is he around? No. Raymond had some personal problems. He's disappeared and left me to run this place all by myself, which is really why I don't have time to stand and chat. So, unless I can help you with something else Oh, no. No. That's okay. - We're gonna think about it. - Okay. Sure. The lieutenant was right. This guy is up to something. How do you know? There was an application for a visa on his desk. He's moving to Ecuador in two weeks. And under ""marital status"" he wrote in ""single. "" - Who moves to Ecuador? - People who don't want to come back. It's almost impossible to get extradited. What do you think he's up to? I don't know. Well, we have to do something. Randy's falling apart. I almost feel sorry for him. What? I have an idea, but it's a little crazy. - What is it? - Promise you'll think about it? Okay. What the hell are you talking about? I have to tell you I think this is a bad idea. Why are you saying that? Because I thought of it? No, I'm saying that because I think it's a bad idea. A lot of marriages are like this bouquet. Ah. Look at these roses. Aren't they beautiful? And everyone admires them. But they'll be dead before you leave here Sunday night. Now let's take a look at this geranium over here. No, it's not as pretty as the roses, but it'll be around for quite a while. Why? Well, because it has roots. A good marriage has roots. They dig down deep. And the deeper we go, the stronger we are. I love that geranium. And I left it out all last winter. It can survive anything, and so can you. I used to love to garden. Now we don't even have a windowsill. Here we go again. Rachel, we have a perfectly good apartment. The ants and the cockroaches love it. We could have been in a house by now. My brother offered him a great job. Rachel, I'm not gonna work for your brother. He's allergic to success. Ah-ha. Couple number three. - You made it. - Oh, hello, Doctor. I'm I'm Sharona, and this is Adrian. Of course. Well, we've been expecting you, Mr. And Mrs. Monk. Please, come in. Mr. Monk? Mrs. Monk? Well, our little family is complete. Adrian and Sharona Monk, this is Jeffrey and Rachel Sweeney and Dalton and Maria Padron. We're going to be shipmates together on this wonderful voyage. Gosh, I hope no one gets seasick. You the map expert? You know each other? Oh, we were in, uh, Mr. Dalton's antique store. It - Small world. - It certainly is. Adrian Monk. Do you know my son, Randy Disher? No. No. Does he sell cleaning supplies? That's what I do. Mops and brooms. Mostly brooms. Sell about four brooms for every mop. - It's interesting. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's It's spellbinding. Let's talk about mops and brooms all day. Oh, well. Um, That That's why we're here, because all he can talk about is work. Well, that's not the only reason we're here. What was that? Nothing. Just Now, I'm going to show the Monks around, and while I'm gone I would like for you to write down why you came and what you hope to accomplish while you're here. Come on. I'll show you the garden. Well, I've already had your bags brought upstairs, and I must say, uh, I've never had a guest with so many suitcases. What was that all about? I don't drink. Well, it was We're undercover. I had to say something. Great. Now we have to spend the whole weekend talking about my drinking problem? All I said about you was that you were boring. - Why can't you be the lush? - It's too late now. I already said it. That's our story. We're stuck with it. No, we're not. Just tell them that you were confused because you're too drunk 'cause you're the lush. - You're the lush. / You're the lush. - No, you're the lush. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Whoo. Let's save it for therapy, huh? I don't think you guys should miss a single session. We're in the east wing. Your house is beautiful. Oh, it's not mine. I wish it was. I'm leasing it from the estate of this man, Joshua Skinner. He built this house a hundred and fifty years ago. He's one of the few prospectors in the great gold rush to actually strike it rich. That's an unusual desk. Yeah. I suppose it is. He and his partner, a fella named Gully Watson, found the gold together back in the winter of '49. Gully died two weeks later. He was stung by a bee and had an allergic reaction. He was stung by a bee in the winter? Well, according to Joshua Skinner. You can read all about it in the library. He spent the last 15 years of his life writing his memoirs. Although I tried reading them. They were, uh, Wow. / Mostly gibberish. Dalton. What are you doing here? I thought you were finishing your statement. Yeah. I-I finished mine. I was just, uh, lookin' around. Just sort of a history nut. These are fascinating. He's a wonderful writer. ""June 12, 1856. Raining all morning. "" ""I had beef jerky for breakfast. "" ""There's a cloud in the sky that resembles President Pierce. "" ""This chair is squeaking. Something smells good. "" ""I love smoking 'tobaccy. ' I just sneezed. "" Not every entry was a masterpiece. He filled 947 volumes. I suspect he had a psychological disorder that compelled him to keep writing. This guy needed an editor. He needed a straightjacket. It's nice. Where are you gonna sleep? That is, which side should I take, darling? Why don't you just take your usual side, darling? Uh, that's what I'll do then, darling. I'll take my I'll take my usual side. What are you doing? Don't touch that. I'll do that. - You two okay? - Oh, yeah. We're fine. We're We're well. We're Thank you. Okay. Well, I'll let you settle in, and I'll see you when you come downstairs. - Thank you. - You bet. This ring is too small. - Where'd you get it? - It's the only one I could find. Don't lose it. There's something strange about that picture downstairs prospector sitting at his desk. I've seen that desk before in Dalton's store. The prospector's desk was in Dalton's store? What does that mean? It means that Dalton is not here by accident. Which means that Disher is right. Dalton is up to something. - Can't take this thing. - Whoa, where are you going? What, what Wait. Wait. What are you What are you doing? What I can't get it off my finger. I need some soap. This is my bathroom. What am I supposed to use? There's another bathroom downstairs. Well, how's that gonna look? We're supposed to be married. Just hold it in until later, and then sneak downstairs. Did you just tell me to ""hold it in""? - Hold it in, please. Please. - You know what? You know what? I really hate being your wife. I hate it. I mean, after only 45 minutes, it's worse than my first marriage. - Be careful. - Here. Take it back. Take it back. I want a divorce. / Mmm. Looks like we got our work cut out for us, huh? I, uh, forgot to leave your schedule. - Th-Thanks. - Oh. Who's this? Uh, that's my first wife. She died six years ago. Six years ago? Oh, Adrian, I think obsessing over your late wife is the root cause of your problem. And if Sharona's drinking, maybe this is the reason, huh? - Uh, don't. Don't. Wait. - Doctor, Doctor. Doctor, It's okay. It's very important to him, and I really don't mind. She really doesn't mind. We're moving forward this weekend, Adrian, not backwards. It's time to let go. I'm going to dedicate this weekend to helping you forget the past. - Are you gonna stand? - I'm fine. I'm-I'm-I'm fine. Is that my sandwich? We're never gonna get away with this. They're never gonna believe that we're really married. We have nothing in common. I annoy you all the time. Why wouldn't they believe it? Did you notice in the library Dalton hid something in his pocket? - Yeah. What was that? - I don't know. I think it was a letter. I sure would like to get a closer look at it. Adrian, you have to sit. This is a picnic. I I don't sit on the ground. Animals do things on the ground terrible, terrible things. What if they're watching us? This is gonna look very weird. We're supposed to be doing that outdoor intimacy thing now. So stand up. I'm not going to stand up. This is a picnic. Sit down. You stand up. - You sit down. - You stand up. Adrian, sit down! Okay. Look, all right. How about this? How about if we both squat? See? This is what marriage is. Marriage is compromise. She never thought she was beautiful, which made her even more beautiful. She was 35 when she died. She was just starting to get, uh, some small wrinkles around her eyes. She hated them. I loved them. I told her, ""Those are my wrinkles. "" I gave them to her by making her laugh so much. You made Trudy laugh? We laughed all the time. You two never laugh? Well, I've never seen him laugh. Not once. Oh, Adrian, your wife is in pain. I think she needs a hug, don't you? No. Okay. Then we'll move on. Let's try a little role reversal. Jeffrey, why don't you pretend to be Rachel. - Rachel, you be Jeffrey, and - Uh, excuse me. - What's your problem? - Me? What was that look? What look? Did you just wink at me? What? No. Are you crazy? W- W-Wait. You're calling me crazy? I just saw you wink at me. - Oh, my God! - What are you doing? Aren't you gonna do something about this? Oh, of course not. Why should today be any different than any other day? Just sit there, and I'll defend my own honor. Thank you. Sharona, you're feeling hurt. I can tell. Why don't we all just count to 10? No, no. Stay out of this. This is between me and Dalton. I wasn't winking. Maybe I had somethin' in my eye. I don't Excuse me. He couldn't be interested in you. He's not physically able to you know perform. He stepped on a land mine during Desert Storm. Tell them. That's right. Keep your eyes to yourself! Keep 'em to yourself! Settle down. Sit down. Sit down! Settle down and sit down. Now, it's all over. Everybody gets angry. It's perfectly normal. But we cannot allow anger to drive the bus. Anger has to sit in the back of the bus, or at the very least, it needs to stay behind the yellow line. Because anger is a terrible driver. ""Where is the gold? The answer is in the journals. "" That's why Dalton was reading all those journals. And why he married Randy's mother. He needed a wife to get into this house. Why didn't he just ask a friend? I don't know. He obviously didn't wanna share the money. Oh, poor Maria. She really loves him. What should we do? We don't have a choice. We're gonna have to show her this. What are you doin' here? We're just talkin'. No, I mean here at this clinic. Well, Sharona and I have been drifting apart lately. Yeah, we're we're tryin' to rekindle the spark we had when we were dating. Picking somebody's pocket is a crime, Mrs. Monk. She didn't. It fell out of your jacket. It's just an old letter I found upstairs. It's just crazy talk about a cache of hidden gold. Really? / Yeah. It's just a rumor an old wives' tale. Yeah, but I'd hate for Maria to see this, though, 'cause she might think it's why I brought her here. It might upset her a very fragile person, you know. Just one more thing, Adrian. If you or your wife tangle with me again, you won't know what hit you. Well, I'll have a rough idea. I knew this tent would come in handy. Why don't we just tell Maria what we know? She won't believe us not without proof. Why would she? I'm a I'm a cowardly mop salesman, and you're my crazy, alcoholic wife who attacked her husband. Well, we should at least call Randy. She'd believe her own son. She hasn't believed him so far. - What are you doing? - This shelf. I can't sleep with a crooked shelf in the room. Well, when you turn off the light you won't see it. I wish you could hear yourself sometimes. You live in a dreamworld. Sharona. Go away. What is it? Get your camera. - I'm goin' in. - You can't. No. You can't. Adrian, I have to go in. Randy's depending on us. I promise I'll be careful. I'm just gonna take a few pictures. Don't worry. I I don't know how to not worry. Stay there. What are you doing? There's a coyote out there. Oh, my God. You're in a cave. I can't believe it. I am so proud of you. Thank you. Let's go. Okay, okay. I think Dalton went that way. And I could not care less. Sharona, I have g-got to get out of here. I I can feel myself going numb. Okay. Okay, we're leaving. Here. Follow me this way. This way. - Can I open my eyes? - No, no, no. Not yet. We're almost there. What? - What's happening? - Oh, my God. - Put your head down.! - What's happening? Now don't worry. Once they realize that we're gone, They're gonna start looking for us. They'll never find us. Look, my camera has a built-in flash, okay? Gonna use the light to try and find the entrance, okay? / Okay. You ready? / Uh-huh. Okay. Here we go. Okay.! It's over here.! It's over here. Come on. Come on. Okay. Come on. - You know who I miss? - Who? The coyote. Oh! Ooh! Oh! Oh, here it is! Here it is. I feel the rocks. Hello! Anybody there? Help.! Oh, no. We're gonna have to dig. I got a penknife in my pocket. Shoot! I dropped it! You have a flashlight? - On my key chain. - Why didn't you say anything? It's only for emergencies. Shine it Sharona. / What? - Can I have the ring back? - What ring? The ring I loaned you. I- I-I'd like to hold on to it. This is Trudy's wedding ring, isn't it? I wanna have it with me in case - Hey, hey. - You know, we don't, uh Nobody's gonna die. Hold this. You know, before I was your assistant, I was your nurse. And you know what? That means I'm still your nurse. So I'm not gonna let anything happen to you, and you wanna know why? 'Cause it'll look bad on my resume. Hello? Can't talk now. I'm trapped in a cave. Wha Mr. And Mrs. Monk, how you folks doin'? I found some more of those towelette things. / Thank you. I've been pokin' around down there at the site of the accident. That was no accident. Now, did you actually see this Dalton Padron knock that support beam out? No. That beam is about a hundred and fifty years old. It was bound to give way sometime. If I make it to a hundred and fifty, I expect I'll feel the same. - Hello? - Hey, are you guys all right? What was all that about a cave? Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry. We're fine. It It was nothing. Was it some sort of therapy thing? Yes, Randy. It's called ""cave therapy. "" Listen. I got your message about my stepfather. God, I hate calling him that. Has anything else turned up? Nothing we can prove. Okay. Maybe I've got somethin' on this end. You remember Dalton's partner, Raymond Toliver? Well, guess what? Raymond's disappeared. His brother just filed a missing persons report. I'm gonna go check this out. Keep me posted, okay? Okay. We'll call you later. What is it? We've gotta get back. This might be bigger than we thought. You know, there are many kinds of cave-ins. There are real cave-ins, and then there are emotionaI cave-ins. What were you doing there anyway? Oh, we were just exploring. We're amateur spelunkers. We were spelunking. We love it spelunking around. Did you find anything interesting? Not yet. Did you? Adrian, Sharona, while you were out, I happened to look into your room, and I couldn't help but notice that Sharona is sleeping in a pup tent on the floor. The photo of your late wife is in a place of honor on the mantel above the fireplace, while your current wife is sleeping on the floor. Dear God, I I don't know where to begin. Adrian, Sharona, you loved each other once. You wouldn't be wearing those rings if you didn't, right? Right. Adrian, Sharona, I want you to look at each other, and I want you to say, ""I love you. "" And don't just say the words. Feel the words. Go ahead. I love you. I love you. That was very good. Now I want you to kiss. And not just any kiss. I want you to communicate everything that you mean to each other and all of what you hope for. Go ahead. Eh, we don't kiss. Yeah, it's just not our style. Well, then your new life begins right here, right now. Go ahead. Kiss. Oh, that was so nice. Now, that's just insulting. We're gonna need more mouthwash. Here we go. Ooh, the old journals you stole them from the library? Nobody will miss them. Let's just start reading. What are we looking for, a map? A map or a clue. Something. If Dalton finds that gold before we do, he's gone forever. - He's heading for Ecuador, remember? - Yeah. Here, sit down. No way. There's a bench. I mean, I can understand your not wanting to sit down on the ground, but I've seen you sit on a bench before. No, no, no. Not this one. Yesterday, when we arrived, there was a bird on it. You're impossible. You married me. Just keep reading. Now that you mentioned it, I haven't seen Mr. Toliver around not for a week or two. Although, I'm just the landlord. I'm not their mother. Yes, sir. Aren't you supposed to have a warrant? Aren't you supposed to have a sprinkler system that works? Thank you. Will you step back, please? I'll just be a minute. ""I wonder if anyone's ever really been knocked over by a feather. "" ""It would have to be a pretty big bird. "" You know what's in this one? He copied the first three books of the Bible. - Word for word. - This guy's certifiable. Sure he's not related to you? That's funny. That's funny. Keep reading. You remember what the letter said: ""The answer is in the journals. "" It must be some kind of code. ""There is a chicken in Mexico who can play tic-tac-toe""? Keep reading. Come on. Keep reading. What are you doing? You've been reading all weekend. What's so interesting about these books anyway? Maria, don't do this. I told you on our wedding night, it's never gonna happen. It's physically impossible. Yeah, but I believe in miracles. Maria, you're just embarrassing yourself again. ""Bought a grandfather clock today for the front hall. "" ""Keeps perfect time. It's worth its weight in gold. "" ""I love it so m "" ""Worth its weight in gold""? - Hello? - Mom, are you okay? Am I okay? Mom, listen to me. I want you to get out of there right now. Dalton murdered his partner. Mom Is he there? Is this Sheriff Mathis? This is Lieutenant Randall Disher from the San Francisco Police. I need you to detain a suspect in a homicide a Dalton Padron. He's at the Waterford Institute. Do you know where that is? Good. Don't leave. Nobody gets in or out of this building till Captain Stottlemeyer gets here. I think I've already read this one. No. No, you didn't. - A couple of them are identical. - Oh, God. - That's it. I'm goin' to bed. - You can't. - We still have all these left to do. - I'll wait for the movie. Wake me up if you find any gold. Good night. What is it? The answer. What? That's what Skinner said in his letter: ""Where is the gold?"" ""The answer is in the journals. "" This book must be over 600 pages, but the journal weighs more. The book covers are made of gold. No. No, it's leather. It's ordinary leather. Where is the gold? The answer isn't in the journals. The answer is, ""In the journals. "" You're wasting your time, Mr. Padron. The gold's not there. I know where it is. Dalton Padron, I'm Ronald Mathis of the Hillside County Sheriff's Office. I want you to put that hammer down. Sir, you drop your hammer Or I'll drop mine. Joshua Skinner's fortune was right here under our noses the whole time. ""The answer is in the journals. "" - Which one? - All of'em. Gold paper? Gold ink. Ink? Joshua Skinner didn't trust banks. So he decided to hide his illegitimate fortune. He melted down the gold, mixed in a little black ink any amateur chemist could have done it and then he began to write. And write and write and write and write. It was mostly nonsense, gibberish, really anything that popped into his head. He ran out of things to talk about after five pages, but he just kept on writing. The gold was hidden in plain sight, and it stayed hidden for a hundred and twenty-five years Until tonight. Wow. You figure 30 ounces of gold per journal. That's roughly $6,000 a book, that's $6 million more or less. Hm. Don't forget the real price. Two people died for that gold. Two people? Dalton had a business partner a partner who trusted him. A lot of people trusted him. Dalton, is it true? Well, what can I say, darling? That's a lot of gold. This weekend just will not end. Dalton, if you, uh if you want a hostage, take me. Well, that's awfully sweet, Jeffrey. No, thank you. The only thing I'm taking from this house is my new gun. And the keys to these handcuffs. Come on. And a little reading material. Let's go! Come on. Let's go. Oh, my God. Oh, could could everybody step back? He's claustrophobic. Move, move, move. Great! The battery's dead. Of course. Just relax. It'll just be a few minutes And everybody's safe. That's the important thing. And we're all together. Ah, yes. We are. We're all together. / Mmm. You know, in a way, we're lucky. Not all marriages are ever tested like this. So maybe we should take advantage of this situation and really explore Forget it. - You really would have gone with him? - I'd do anything for you. Don't you know that, Rachel? You're my whole world. You know, I've been thinkin'. I'm I am gonna talk to your brother about that job. - Oh, I love you, Jeff. - Oh, God. - I love you, baby. - No, no, no. No, don't I don't think we've been introduced. I- I'm Ronald. I'm Maria. Don't move! Show me your hands. Where the hell's my mother, you son of a bitch? Mom! Mom? - What took you so long? - Are you all right? Oh, Randy. Randy. Mom, are you okay? What day is it? We were only in there for five minutes. I don't think so. Six million dollars. Who's gonna get all that money? Well, I just spoke to the D.A. Skinner's old partner, Gully, is the rightful heir. He's got some family nearby, and they are in for one pretty surprise. There's my hero. - I'm not a hero, Mom. - You are a hero to me. Thank you, Sheriff. My car's right here, whenever you're ready. Well, honey, I think Ron's gonna drive me home. I'll call you in the morning. Love you. Love you too. In the morning? You can't even get your own mother to go home with you. Hey, what do you say, on the way home, we stop and look at a condo? - Condo? - Hey, one step at a time. Here. I think this is yours. Thanks for letting me wear it. Adrian, Sharona. I'm glad you're still here. There's something that I've been meaning to say. Marriage is very hard, and it takes exceptional people to make it work. But I think you two can do it. I believe in Adrian and Sharona. Thanks a lot, uh, but I think you should know, we're we're not really married. Oh, thank God. Ha! Good. Keep it that way, huh? - Okay, we will. - Thank you. No problem there."
"The federal appeals court just turned him down. So we're a ""go. "" Where's Ray Kaspo? He's in the holding cell having his last meaI ribs and chili. Ribs and chili? That might kill him before we do. Hey, Ray, how you doin'? I'm good. I'm okay. I had 'em add a ton of extra sauce. I told them that's how you liked it. Thanks, Abbie. I, uh I heard about the appeals court. Bastards. Yeah, well, I'm not surprised. Story of my life. Hey. Why don't you give that to your daughter? You told me she likes to draw. - Your paint set. - WelI I didn't have anybody else to give it to.

Well, you've been inside a prison before, right? I've been to holding cells and visiting rooms. They were bad enough. All right, come on. Hi, uh, Adrian Monk, Sharona Fleming. - Captain Stottlemeyer's expecting us. - All right, keep these on. This is how we tell the good guys from the bad guys. - And you'll step right this way. - Okay, thanks. Let's go. Step over here for me, please. Raise your arms, palms up, please. What-What are What are you doing? I have to pat you down. Just raise your arms. Palms up. Very good. Turn around for me. No, not-not in a circle. Face the wall. There you go. Aah! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Okay. Aah! Okay, wait a second. Wait. Whoa. Stop. Just a minute. Just a second. O- O-O-O-Okay. Go ahead. Aah! What are you trying to prove? - What are you doing? - I can't. Yes, you can. - This is - You're acting like a child. Sorry. Okay. Aah! Wait! Okay. Wait, wait, wait. All right, here. How about this? I'll pat myself down. You're gonna pat yourself down? I'm an honest man. I'm an ex-cop. You can trust me. You're an ex-cop? Wait. Wait, wait. What's this? Oh, hey, hold on a second. What is this? Nail clippers? Where do I think I'm goin' with these? Can't bring that in here. I'll get these back when I leave. - Thank you. - Thank you. Hey, Monk. The crime scene is in here. I'm-I'm fine. I'm good. I- I can see it from here. Who-Who made the chili? We did, in our own kitchen. I got Detective Leveaugh talking to the cooks. I think that's a bust. - Who brought him the food? - A trustee named Abernathy. He's one of Kaspo's closest friends. I just talked to him. He's real upset about this, but I think he's clean. What did Ray Kaspo do? Six years ago, he shot a gas station attendant in a robbery. Well, maybe the victim's family did it for revenge. No, no. That letter is from the victim's family. They say they forgive him that they're praying for him. Well, maybe they lied. No. Their name is Lapp. They're from Strasburg, Pennsylvania. They're Mennonite. Pacifists. They don't believe in violence. I think you're right, but that still leaves us with the big question: Why would anybody bother to spike a condemned prisoner's last meal? His last meal? He was scheduled to be executed at midnight. - What do you think? - I think I'm out of here. - I'm going home. - Adrian! I'm not sure it matters who killed this guy. He was gonna die in 45 minutes anyway. Sharona, I hate this place. I- I-I can't breathe in here. It's like - It's like a prison. - It is a prison! - Leaving so soon? - Not soon enough. Could you open the gate, please? Main gate. / Could you open the gate, please? Yeah, he's still here. It's for you. Hello? Adrian Monk, as I live and breathe. - Dale the Whale. - Hey, come in. The door's open. Apparently, they don't consider me much of an escape risk. Hey, hey, hey! Wipe your feet. They just cleaned my carpet. You're looking well. Oh, you smooth talker. Oh! You brought the irrepressible Sharona Fleming. Uh, are you guys hungry? Would you like an egg roll? It's not the best, but it's the only one that delivers. Okay, hit me. Ah.! You slut.! It's cold.! Nuke it! It seems prison agrees with you, Dale. Well, and why wouldn't it? After all, I've been inside this prison all of my life. That's very poetic. Well, of course, it doesn't compare with the prison you built for yourself. What is it you want, Dale? You said it was important. Well, there's the Adrian Monk we know and love. Your fear is huge, but your curiosity is huger. - I wanna make you an offer. - Oh, please, drop dead. Well, you'd think I would have by now, wouldn't you? Please, let's get out of here. Come on. You help me, I'll help you. One hand washes the other. Now, there's a metaphor I know you can relate to. As you know, a man was murdered in here last night. / Come on. Soon, the police, who are not as imaginative as you, will begin to focus on me. I had a motive. The young man owed me $1,200. You wouldn't kill anyone for $1,200. Well, you know that, but they don't. They've already questioned me twice. Here's my problem. As you can see, I have, uh, become accustomed to a certain standard of living in here. And until this case is solved, things are gonna be very difficult for me. For example, they were supposed to install a window in that wall, right there, so I could watch the sun set. I assume the sun still sets every evening. Adrian Monk I want my window! Get me my window.! How? Stay here. Solve the case. Forget about it. We're not gonna work for you, and we never will. Right? Right? In exchange for what? What you want, Adrian. What you need information. You solve this murder, and I tell you everything I know about the man who killed your wife. Huh? You really think Dale the Whale's gonna help you? He hates you. You're the reason why he's in here. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. This is about Trudy now. I need you to help me focus. Mr. Monk, you were asking about our kitchen. It's right down here. I know you spoke to Dale Biederbeck. He's on our list of suspects. Sir, I really don't think he's involved in this. / It's inexplicable. Why would anyone murder a condemned prisoner one hour before his execution? Maybe somebody was trying to shut him up. They were afraid he was gonna confess something in the last minute. Doubtful. Ray Kaspo had recently found religion. He was calling reporters every day apologizing for his sins, confessing to whatever he had ever done. The boy was all talked out. Excuse me. Ex Ex - Thanks, man. - You're welcome. We can get you a smaller sweatshirt. Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks. Our kitchen staff prepares over That's more than most hotels. - How's the food? - Well, it must be good. Everybody here is a repeat customer. Who prepared Mr. Kaspo's last meal? I did. The chili was sitting on that stove for an hour. Anybody in the kitchen could have spiked it. - What are you looking at? - Uh, there's one, uh - It's dangling. - What's it to you? - Maybe-Maybe you could tuck it in. - Why should I? It's-It's-It's distracting to all of us. - I think I'm speaking for everyone here. - Hey, hey. Remember why we're here, okay? Come on. / Did you know the condemned prisoner Ray Kaspo? Never laid eyes on him. I had no beef against the guy. And if I did, hell, I'd just wait until midnight, let the State do the dirty deed for me. Mm-hmm. - I think if you put - Do you love me? - No, no, I - Then don't be touchin' me! Please, please. Stand here. Please? - Hey, hey. You've been in rehab, right? - How did you know? I'm a nurse. I can see the track marks. So you know about addiction, right? Okay. Well, my boss has a jones for neatness, okay? It's my jones. And he needs a fix real bad. You talkin' about my hair? You know what it's like. It's the worst feeling in the world. Sorry, brother. Thank you, brother. Not like that. Like this. Can you get a wipe? I think we're almost done. Mr. Monk, do you have any other questions? Uh, just-just one. Just one. Where is Mr. Tucker? According to this time card, he didn't punch out yesterday. Well, the last time I seen him, he was in the auxiliary freezer doing inventory. I want a total lockdown. Call the medical examiner. What the hell is going on? Check his pockets. Somebody paid him to poison the chili. - And then had second thoughts. - They were afraid he'd talk. At least we know how the meal was poisoned. But we still don't know who was behind it, or why. Excuse me, Mr. Monk. This is for you. Yes, ""from a volcano. "" It's a metaphor. Hey, hey, hey. Look who died. - Lambert Lawson, of kidney failure. - I heard. Five billion dollars. Wonder who's gonna get it? Not us. Mr. Monk and, uh, Miss Fleming, I presume? Ma'am, did you send me this note? Yes. I'm Sylvia Fairbourn. I run the reading program here. Oh, excuse me one minute. Terry, why don't you take that book and keep it? Uh, I have lots of copies. It's my favorite book. And you can read chapter seven on your own? - You mean, read it without you? - Oh, you can do it. You remind me of my son Jimmy. He wasn't very good in school, but I wouldn't let him quit. Okay, Mrs. F. - I'll give it a shot. - There you go. I could've used a teacher like you. Well, I haven't been at it very long, but already it's-it's the most satisfying job I've ever had. Mrs. Fairbourn, you-you said you had some information for me? Yes. I heard you were in here asking about Ray Kaspo. I don't know if it means anything, but he was in here a week ago, and I heard him talking to another inmate. What were they talking about? Well, Mr. Kaspo said that before he was injected, he intended to tell the world about what happened in Calgary. In Calgary? / Yes. And the other inmate said, ""I'll see you in hell first. "" Who was the other inmate? His name is, uh, Darnell Rudner, and I believe they call him Spyder. Who's Spyder Rudner? I already talked to your captain. He said it's up to you. You'll have to sign this release. I'll sign whatever you want. Adrian, he's killed four people. That we know of. Spyder Rudner is evil personified. Oh, my God.! His first arrest was in the seventh grade. Are you sure you want to go undercover as an inmate? There's no other way. If he knows I'm a cop, he'll never talk to me. If Spyder Rudner knows you're a cop, he'll kill you. He may kill you anyway just because it's Wednesday. Lucky for you, he's been in solitary all day, so he hasn't seen you around. You might get away with it for a day or two. Why was he in solitary? He put a guy's head through a wall. Why? The guy touched his stuff. Adrian. It's for Trudy. Turn that down! Welcome home. Meet your new roommate. His name is Van Lincoln. - You got a problem. - No, no. It's not a question. I'm telling you. You have a problem! Listen, Mr. Spyder Aah! Don't ever say ""listen"" to me! Do you understand, meat? I know why you're here. - You do? - It's the warden. He knows I wanna be alone, so he put you here to agitate and punish me. - What happened to my bed? - Uh, I Have you been touching my stuff? No, no, no. Maybe a little. I- I just Your sheets were all piled You are a dead man! I am gonna gut you like a fish! Are you Are you looking for your shiv? Are you looking for your shiv? - I moved it. - You what? It's in the book, in the binding. It-It-It-It's a better place to hide it. - What'd you do to it? - I I retaped it. I- I-I sharpened it. You sharpened my shiv. You made my bed. What are you in here for? Embezzlement. I'm doin' a nickel. What's a ""nickel""? It means ""five years. "" It's prison talk. - No, it ain't. - It is in Lompoc. Hey, give me a cigarette! Shut up. You were in Lompoc? Yeah, for a while. Then they moved me, 'cause I was too much of a bad ass. I had a friend in Lompoc Eddie Corcoran. Know him? Yeah. Yeah, I knew Eddie. What was he in for? He strangled his wife. You might be all right. Who's that, your old lady? Yeah. Is she waitin' for you? Yeah, she is. You're a lucky man. She'll keep you strong. Well, if it isn't ""Captain Shtucklmeyer"" and his cabana boy. I'm gettin' real popular. Is this a bad time, Dale? You're here to talk to me about the late, not so great Ray Kaspo. - How did you guess? - Oh, I never guess, Captain. I knew you were coming before you did. Is that a bagel? Mm-hmm. Want some? Oh, uh, no, thanks. I can't. I'm on a low-carb diet. I understand Ray Kaspo owed you some money. Twelve hundred dollars. I wouldn't bend down to pick up $1,200. I mean, even if I could. No, I think you were trying to make an example of him. That would be more your style. Leland Stottlemeyer is lecturing me about style. The world has gone mad. You hired Adrian Monk to find the real killer. Is that right? - Mm-hmm. - And why would you do that? That's between me and Monk. Well, we heard it's because you wanted a window. They won't install one until the case is closed. Is a window that important to you? Try living without one. It's freezing. I feel like I'm back in Canada. - Is that where you're from? - Yeah, Calgary. Born and raised. You ever been? No, can't say that I have. That's not what I hear. I hear you spent some time up there with Ray Kaspo. - Where'd you hear that? - Around. Is it true? Maybe yes, maybe no. - Hey, what happened to my watch? - Huh? Where the hell is my watch? It was right there! My grandfather gave me that watch. Where is it? I- I didn't take your watch. I swear. You better not be lyin' to me. Do I look like an idiot? Listen Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, Spyder. Look, look. I'm-I'm pretty good at finding things. If I can find it If I can find it, you-you tell me about Calgary. You find out who took the watch, we got a deal. Hold on. I have the autopsy report right here. It's pretty bizarre. Any idea who did this or why they'd bother? - Not yet. - Look at the lungs. They're completely disintegrated. We found traces of mercury, arsenic, Benzedrine. There's enough poison in that body to kill 10 men. - Somebody's going to be disappointed. - What do you mean? Well, Ray Kaspo was donating his organs to medicine. He had a rare blood type. AB-negative with ""D"" antigen. But there's nothing left to donate. Every organ the kidneys, the heart they've all been eaten away. Can you at least tell me where you first met Ray Kaspo? Look, if you get my watch, then we'll talk. Hey, yo.! Little help? Uh - Yo. You got a problem? - Uh, I-I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Pick up the ball, homey. Are you dissin' me? No, no, no, I'm not I'm not dissin' you. I'm-I'm giving you your props. - Man, he clownin' you, man. - Props are good. - Yo. Will you just - Stay there. Just I haven't beaten up a white boy in a long time. It'll come back to you. It's like ridin' a bike. Excuse me. Excuse me. - You'll thank me later. - This is gonna be fun. Okay, but before the fun, you might wanna return Spyder Rudner's watch. What? / The watch you stole from his cell. Uh, you can either give it to Spyder, or you can give it to me, or you can give it to Spyder. - You're gonna wish you were never born. - Oh, I'm way ahead of you. It's a few minutes off. I reset it for you. I'll take care of them later. That was pretty impressive. How'd you know it was him? Well, I figured whoever stole your watch would keep their sleeves rolled down, so you couldn't see it. There were only four guys in the whole yard with their sleeves rolled down, and he was the tallest. Why tall? The shelf in your cell is four feet from the bars. He's the only one who could reach it. That's pretty sharp. Now what can I do for you? All I want is for you to tell me about Calgary and about Ray Kaspo. There's nothin' to tell. I never met the guy, and I swear on my mother's eyes I've never been in Calgary. Now, whoever is telling you that, they're settin' you up. How difficult was it to do research for this book? Well, normally it's not, but this was extremely difficult. He doesn't talk to anybody, so I had to try to get ahold of his family - Mr. Monk. - You look surprised. Why would I be surprised? Maybe because Spyder Rudner didn't kill me. Where's the friggin'remote? 'Cause we're missin'the game. I'm Jim Moret. Welcome to Book Talk. Reclusive billionaire Lambert Lawson died today of kidney failure. - Mrs. Fairbourn? /- Our guest today is the author of Richer Than God Mrs. Fairbourn? - Is this a bad time? - Yes, yes, this is a bad time. Thank you, Jim. Congratulations. This book is a huge success, and I understand it's selling a lot better than your first book. It would be hard not to. My first book sold, like, 50 copies, and I think my mother bought 42 of them. Mrs. Fairbourn, Spyder Rudner said he never met Ray Kaspo and had never been to Calgary. Well, Mr. Monk, who are you going to believe, me or a man who killed four people? - Right now, we're not sure. - Mrs. F., have you seen the remote control? Because the knob's broke, and we're missin' the game. No, Manny, I'm sorry. I haven't. - Have you seen the remote? - No. Are you calling me a liar, Mr. Monk? I think I'm calling you a lot more than that. This is a controversial book, isn't it? Uh, I didn't think so, but, uh, Mr. Lawson apparently did. He was suing me for 70 million dollars when he died. So, I guess you're off the hook now? - I guess so. - Thank you, ma'am. There could only be one reason why you'd want Adrian dead. And why would that be? To prevent me from implicating you in the death of Ray Kaspo. Why would I want to kill Ray Kaspo, especially on the very evening of his execution? What could I possibly gain from that? I don't know. Well, when you find out, we could chat again. Have a good day. He ended up sheltering his whole life, you know, with his money. He kind of kept his whole life out of the public view, out of out of everything. Socially, he was just he was a hermit. That's really interesting. We'll be back with more of J.T. DeMornay right after this. Stay with us. All right! Oh, my God. Okay. We know how, we know who, and the answer to why, it's got to be in this book. - Has Disher called yet? - Uh, not yet. Is this everything on Ray Kaspo? What are you looking for? Letters to or from a hospital. He was an organ donor. Try the blue folders. Hello? Hi, it's Karen in the warden's office. - You guys are working late. - Yeah, tell me about it. Are Mr. Monk and Miss Fleming still there? I'm looking right at them. Well, the warden wants to see 'em right away in the rec room. It's important. That's all I know. Well, I'm glad I decided to stick around. I'll go. You stay here, wait for Disher's call. / Okay. - You sure you're gonna be okay? - I'll be fine. It's just down one, two, three, four, five hallways. Okay, fine. Hello? Warden Christie? Hello? Hello? Hey, you were right. Lambert Lawson was AB-negative with ""D"" antigen. - It's the rarest blood type in the world. - Thanks. I'll call you later. Where's Mr. Monk? I'm guessing that was that was incredibly painful, huh? Hello? Yeah. There are Nazis here in the rec room. This is a Nazi alert! The phone is dead. So are you. - The lines are cut! - Oh, my God! Lock down the whole block. Get security down there now. - Miss Fleming, what the hell's going on? - It's all about him. - Lambert Lawson? - Yes, yes. Lambert Lawson was suing the author of this book for millions of dollars. So what? / So now that he's dead, the lawsuit's gonna be thrown out. What the hell does a dead billionaire have to do with one of my prisoners being poisoned? Everything, everything. Lambert Lawson died because he needed a kidney transplant. He was AB-negative with a ""D"" antigen. It's the rarest blood type in the world. Guess who had the same blood type? Ray Kaspo. Okay. All right. Boys, come on. Hey, no violence. Violence is not the answer. So Lawson was waiting for Ray Kaspo's kidney? Right, right. Meanwhile, J.T. DeMornay, who wrote this book, wanted Lawson dead. - DeMornay. Do I know him? - You know his mother Sylvia. The reading lady? / Yep. She used her maiden name when she applied here. Here, read the dedication. ""For my mother, Sylvia, who makes all things possible. "" She came here to kill Ray Kaspo. She paid Tucker the cook to spike his last meal with enough poison to destroy his organs. Wouldn't a lethal injection have ruined the kidneys anyway? No, no. The injection attacks the nervous system, not the organs. By destroying that kidney, she murdered Lawson to protect her son. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Adrian! Find Mrs. Fairbourn. Don't let her leave the prison. Come on. Follow me. Let's go! Come on! Get him! One second. I'm missing a sock here. All right, Adolf. Let him go. It's not about you, Spyder. - This guy's a friend of mine. - He's a cop! Ah, so I've heard. Let him go. You'd side with a cop over us? I'd side with a cucaracha over you. Get on the ground! - Yeah, right now! - On the ground! Yeah! - Get him out of here! Come on! - Move! Move it! Move! Get these guys out of here! Adrian! Adrian! / Sharona. - Are you okay? - I figured out why Mrs. Fairbourn No, no. I know, I know. I just did the whole summation. Get 'em out of here.! Get 'em out. Spyder, you saved my life. I come up for parole in 50 years. If you're still around, why don't you come around and tell the board all about it? I'll do that. - Get him out of here. - Come on. Good job. Mr. M. Congratulations. - I knew you could do it. - Thank you, Dale. It was your faith in me that kept me going in my darkest hour. Oh, no. - I see you got your window. - Mm-hmm. Yep. Now I can see the world, but still not be part of the world. Something else we have in common. You promised us some information. Did I? Don't make me laugh. It hurts. All right. A deal is a deal. I'll tell you all I know. The bomb that took Trudy from you was not intended for you. It was meant for her. Adrian. It was her they were after. I know you've always blamed yourself for her death. Now you don't have to. I absolve you, Adrian Monk. That's my good deed for the decade. Why? W- Why her? Oh, I can't help you there. You ever been to New York? - No. - Have Sharona pack your bags. That's where you'll find the man you're looking for. His name is Warrick Tennyson. Did Did he kill her? He was involved. That's all I have. - How do you know all this? - Oh, sweetheart, I am Dale the Whale! You'd better not be lying to him. It's the truth, as God is my witness. He is your witness, and so am I. Well, I guess we're going to New York. Well, congratulations, Monk. You solved the case. - It's all over the radio. - Oh, man. What are you doing? Oh, the sky, the grass. I forgot how beautiful they were. Monk, you were only in there for a day and a half. Yeah, Randy, I did my bit, and I did it standing up. I'm gonna tell you people something. Prison changes a man. Don't you wish? Bon voyage, Mr. Monk."
"I guess you've completely given up on trying to be cool, huh? Yeah, pretty much. Wow, this place is amazing. Look at these buildings. Look, look at that one. How did they build that? Actually, they built that one from the top down. - Really? Wow. Wow. Better stick with me. This town's going to eat you alive. - Taxi! - Where'd he go? - Who? The, the man, the other man. The man in the front seat. - The nut? - Yeah, the nut. Where'd he go? What was he complaining about? My taxi is very clean. Why was he wiping, wiping, wiping everything? Look, sir, your taxi is perfect, but where did he go? Look, I don't care. I'll never pick him up again. You tell him that. I see him, I'll keep driving. I don't care if I lose my license. Hey, I'll keep driving. I lost him. What do you mean? He was, he was right here. How could he get lost? We're 15 feet from the hotel. Monk! Oh, my god! Adrian! Adrian! Adrian, you can't just walk away like that. You scared me half to death. Somebody dropped this. You're going to have to forget about that. There is no way that you're going to be able to clean up New york city by yourself. Trust me. New york city wins. It's always going to win. It's so noisy. - So is San Francisco. - No, this, this is different. I can't do this. I can't really function here. It's, this is too much, too much. Adrian, listen to me. Don't forget why you're here, all right? You have a lead, a name. Finally, after all these years, you know? - Warrick Tennyson. - That's right, Warrick Tennyson. And he is connected somehow to Trudy's murder. - But why does he have to live here? - I don't know. When you find him, that can be the first thing you ask him. It won't be the first thing I ask him. Check it out. - Wow. - Wow. Ha ha. I could get used to this place. - Do you think they have cable? - Of course they have cable. - Can we afford this? - Well, we didn't have a choice. Adrian booked the reservation. It's rated the cleanest hotel in New York. Hello, I'm Adrian Monk. Party of four. Not much of a party, really. Here we are, Monk. You have three rooms. Oh, three rooms. - Well, me and Sharona. - Wait, wait. I, I thought I was getting my own room. Look, well, I'd rather not be by myself. Me and the captain. No. No, no. Sharing the cab was bad enough. Well, why don't we just get a fourth room? Sorry, we're completely booked. - Well, uh, how about me and Sharona? - In your dreams. Mr. Ambassador, welcome back. This came for you. - Thank you. Oh, excuse me. Excuse me. Okay, well, uh, whoever gets me, I, I just have to let you know I'm going to need the bathroom all to myself, so Um, Adrian, Adrian, um do you mind if you just guard the luggage over there? - Hmm? Just guard the luggage and I think they're uneven. - Oh. Totally uneven. - Thank you. Good day. - That's the new Latvian ambassador. - Whoop-de-doo. Sis nav mans metelis. - Get down! - Police officers! Everyone down! Down! Down! Get down! Call 911 now. Everybody stay down! Stay calm! Stay down! Monk! Monk! - Are you all right? - Mm. - Did you see him? - Yeah. Can you identify him? MONK Season 3x01 Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan ""It's a jungle out there"" ""Disorder and confusion everywhere"" ""No one seems to care Well, I do, hey"" ""Who's in charge here"" ""It's a jungle out there"" ""Poison in the very air we breathe"" ""Do you know what's in the water that you drink, well, I do"" ""And it's amazing"" ""People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time"" ""If you paid attention you'd be worried too"" ""You better pay attention or this world we love so much"" ""Might just kill you"" ""I could be wrong now"" ""But I don't think so"" ""'Cause it's a jungle out there"" ""It's a jungle out there"" Is he okay? Is there a problem here? He's thinking. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. We know about your reputation, and we, uh, we appreciate your help, but this is a big case. I've got the Feds breathing down my neck. I've got CNN outside. I don't have all day here. I can't focus. It's too noisy. - What's, what's noisy? - It's, uh, it's the traffic. - But we're inside. - I can hear it. Would you like us to shut down midtown Manhattan so you can focus here? Would that be inconvenient? Uh, excuse me. Do you mind if I just talk to him for a sec? - What's going on? - Can't you hear that? - Can't you hear that? - No. - It's, it's relentless. - What? - The sirens. - There's no off switch here, okay? I mean, look, I wish there was, but there isn't, okay? The buses Monk, come here. Come here. Look, these are the people who are going to help us find Tennyson, okay? So let's dazzle them here. That way they'll owe us one. Remember, we're here for Trudy. - Right. - Come on. - His coat. - Whose coat? The ambassador's coat. It's damp. He's right. And the other coats are dry. How'd we miss that? You get used to it. I remember, when the ambassador came in, he brushed up against me. His coat was dry. What, his coat was dry then but it's wet now? - Maybe the shooter switched coats. - Hey. ""Dometri krazluv. "" No, it's the right coat. Now, that's the damnedest thing. This might not have been political. He was an ambassador, for god's sake. His country's on the brink of a civil war. What else could it be? But look at how the bodies fell. The shooter killed the two bodyguards first. Well, sure he did, on account of they were armed. Nope. No. If this was political, he would have taken out his primary target first. The ambassador. And he wouldn't have used a. 22 caliber. It's a pea shooter. Well, it seemed to do the trick. The shooter got lucky. Whatever happened here wasn't planned. It, it just happened. You know, I'm glad you got a good look at him. I'm going to need you to come down to the precinct and work with my sketch artist. You know the drill. You know what? That's going to have to wait, because we're meeting somebody from the D. A's office at 4:00 - about another case, so - Your wife's murder. Yeah, I was sorry to hear. I just talked to the D. A, And the meeting's been canceled. - What? - Since when? Well, since 20 minutes ago. Why? - Well, she didn't say. She never tells me anything. Isn't that how it works in Frisco? First off, the name of our little town is San Francisco, not Frisco. Second of all, we just flew It's the first break we've had in seven years. I understand. I've got people downtown. I'll make some phone calls. - We're all on the same team, captain. - Are we? Denise, we're talking about a cop's wife here. Uh-huh. All they want to do is talk to the guy for five minutes. Uh-huh. Yeah, I, I see. Yeah, well, I'm sorry, too. She won't budge. - Well, who's her boss? - The state attorney general. You're right. I'm going to call him. I'm going to call him right now. Um let me, uh let me, let me clean up, uh, some stuff here. Um hmm. The mole The mole. What about it? The mole on the ear, it, uh, it was darker. Like that? No, it's too dark. Too dark. Mr. Monk, it doesn't need to be perfect, all right? It's, it's just a sketch. We've been here for over an hour and a half. Okay? I, I think we're done with the ear, huh? Okay, not quite. - Hey. Where you been? - Check it out. It's a Rolex. - Where'd you get it? - Met a guy who knew a guy. Never needs batteries. Well, of course not. It runs on stupidity. Randy, you're so gullible, it's frightening. Yeah, well, it does everything. Look, I can tell you what time it is all around the world. It's 5:30 here. In Denver, it's 3:30. In Los Angeles, 12:17. And in Paris, France - time has stopped. - Perfect. Thank god. All right, let's move on, All right, Tell me about this guy's eyes. I didn't see his eyes. He was covering his face, so All I saw was a left ear. What are we supposed to do with this? I can't distribute this. - I'd recognize him. - From this? Every ear is different. They're like fingerprints. - Hey, how's it going? - This is all that he saw. You know what? The earlobe was a little rounder. - Monk! - well? I got bad news and some really bad news. What do you want to hear first? Uh, let's see, I think, uh, the really bad, I guess, first, or no, start, just start with the bad, or, or the really bad. I, I, I this morning, Warrick Tennyson agreed to testify in this big federal racketeering case. He is in protective custody, incommunicado. They're not going to let us or anybody anywhere near him. Didn't you tell them about Trudy? Look, I was up there for an hour and a half screaming my head off. They said yes on one condition. What, what, what, what's the condition? It's about this new case. The, uh, assassination thing. The D. A said if we help with this ambassador case, they'll let us talk to Tennyson. What do you think? Well, well, I guess, I guess I don't have I guess I don't real I guess I don't real I guess I don't.. I guess I don't real I mean, I guess I don't I guess I don't really I guess I don't really I guess I don't I guess I don't really have I guess I don't really I guess I don't really I guess I don't really have a choice! It's big news. Not just here, all over the world. When Trudy died, she wasn't on the front page. She was on page 4. The next day, there was a little story on page 10. And the next day she was gone. Adrian, she's not gone. We're going to find the people who killed her, I promise. And don't forget. if we help them with this, they're going to help us. Vladamir Kazinsky, - Captain Stottlemeyer. - Good to see you. Adrian Monk and, uh, Sharona Fleming. Mr. Kazinsky's with the Latvian embassy. So you were here with the ambassador about an hour before the murder. No, not even one hour. I just can't believe he's gone. What are you looking at? Your left ear. - What's wrong with it? - Nothing. It's Sir, we're trying to retrace where the ambassador was and where he went and who he might have met. Well, uh We, uh, met, uh, for drinks. We met every Wednesday, and we stood right over there. - Just the two of you. - He had his bodyguards with him. Oh, and, and, um, did he seem worried about anything, or frightened? Not at all. He was, uh, how do you, upbeat. Mr. Kazinsky, I overheard the ambassador say something just, just before he was killed. ""She is now gone meatless. "" - ""She is now gone meatless?"" - Does that mean anything to you? Maybe he knew a woman who's a vegetarian. I, I mean does it have any meaning in latvian? No. No, I'm sorry. - Thank you, Mr. Kazinsky. - She's now gone meatless? - No. - That'll be all. I'll show you out. She's, she's now gone meatless? - No. - We appreciate your time. If we have any more questions, we'll get back to you. - Okay, thank you. - Thank you, sir. - Thank you. She's, she's now gone meatless. - ""She's now gone meatless""? - That's what he said. Maybe it's some kind of slang, like hip-hop. - Hip-hop? - Hip-hop. It's a sort of street talk. Why don't you ask around? Well, I'm not going to ask people what ""she's now gone meatless"" means. Why not? I don't know. I might move back here someday. I, I don't know. That was our supposed friend detective Cage. He's got a lead. He wants us to go to Brooklyn, talk to a man named Elmer Gratnik. Gratnik's been sending the ambassador some threatening letters. Brooklyn, that, that's, like, an old bridge, right? - Or a tunnel. - Or a tunnel. Okay, a bridge. Look, I got a plan. Here's the deal. - You two go to Brooklyn. - No, Brooklyn, no. You go to Brooklyn, you talk to Gratnik, you check out his earlobe or whatever it is you do. Randy and I are going to snoop around here and see if we can't figure out where these clowns are hiding our witness. Brooklyn? Great. Let's meet back here at 11:00. Randy, it's 11:00 right now. Trudy loved New York. She always wanted to bring me here. - I guess now she has. - Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. That's Gratnik. Right over there. Cage says he always wears that hat. He's been seeking political asylum for two years, but the INS keeps turning him down. - And he blamed the ambassador. - Among others. So you think he's the guy you saw? Maybe. I can't tell. I need to see his left ear. Look, how about this? You walk by. Maybe, maybe he'll tip his hat. Oh, he's not going to tip his hat. He might if you sashay. - Where are you going? - I'm going to talk to him. Look, sashay. Sharona, sashay. - Um, excuse me, Mr. Gratnik? - Shh. Now we talk. You can bother him all you want. Okay. We're working with the police department on the assassination. That was no assassination. Assassination is a word they use for great men. Ambassador Krazluv was no great man. Vins bija suns, he was a dog. - Excuse me. That, that is a nice hat. - Thank you. Did you threaten him? I get mad, I say things, but I don't hurt people. What is that? Is that, is that mink? - Sable. - Sable. Wow. - Could I, could I hold it? - Why? I love hats. I collect them. - I'm a, chapeau-ologist. - No. Go away! - She's now gone meatless. - What? Before he was killed, the ambassador said something like ""she's now gone meatless. "" Does that mean anything to you? Excuse me. I think you are saying ""sis nav mans metelis,"" ""sis nav mans metelis"" which is not really Latvian. It's a completely different dialect, called high Tamien, but some people speak both. - What does it mean? - That means ""this is not my coat. "" This is not my coat. This is not my coat. Oh, I can teach you a new phrase. Sah mats. Checkmate. Sah mats Velns paravis. Idritvai kocin! Idritvai kocin. Warrick Tennyson. I knew it. Trial transcripts Deposition Cage said he didn't know anything about the Tennyson. He's lying to us. He's lying to us. What is that? It's my watch. It beeps every hour. Well, turn it off. I can't. The instructions were in korean. Well, do it something. - Smash it. - No. It's a Rolex. Mister? Mister, are you okay? - Oh, he, he, he's fine. - He's crying. We couldn't find a cab. Is there anything I can do to help? Make it stop. See? You did it. You rode the subway. I'm proud of you. You're becoming a real New Yorker. I rode on the subway. - Change? - Yes, I think I did. Okay, this is our exit, so stay close to me. I keep thinking about what the ambassador said. ""this is not my coat. "" - But it was his coat. - I know. I can't figure it out. And how did it get wet? I think that coat is the key to, oh, my god. - Oh. - He's urinating! - Oh, come. hey, hey, hey, come on! What are you doing? There are people here! Come on. Adrian, I'm really sorry that what are you doing? Adrian, what are you doing? Are you crazy? Why did you go on there? Adrian, what are you, stop! Stop the train! Adrian! Sir, you have to stop that train! He's all alone! - He's gonna mad, I swear! - Okay, okay, okay. Shh, calm down. Calm down, calm down, calm down. Ma'am, this happens all the time. What's his name? - Um, Adrian Monk. - Okay, how old is he? He's 45. Taxi! Taxi. Taxi. Taxi, Taxi. Find the queen, find the queen, all right? We are happy people here in New York city trying to find the queen, all right? Find the queen, you're living a dream. You find the Jack, you don't get nothing back. Okay, nothing at all. I'm sorry, you don't. Except love. I give love to everyone. Here we go. Who see the queen, huh? Who see it? You see the queen? Come over here, man. Put your money down on the table, boy. Show me you got the cash, all right? $5 will get you $10, $10 will get you $20, all right? Put it down on the table, okay? Show me the queen. Show me the queen, man. Right here? All right, all right. You a pretty smart fella. Smart fella playing the game. No, no, no, no. We going to go again. We going to go again, double or nothing, all right? Double or nothing. Put the money down. There you go. That's all right, you know? I don't get mad when I lose. Never get mad when I lose. I just be glad when I win. Very glad when I win, okay? Here we go. Where the queen, huh? huh? You see the queen again? Game over. Uh, well, what about my winnings? Look, me keeping it. You cheated. Excuse me. I, I'd like to see your license. - My what? - Your gaming license. I left it at home. Yeah, man, oh, I left it at home. You know, you just you reminded me. Stay right here, okay? - I'll go get it. - Don't, don't take all day. No, no, I'll be right back, man. His license better be current. Don't worry. We'll find him. We got 1,000 uniforms out there looking. This whole city's laid out on a grid. That's a good thing. He likes grids. How long has he been missing? Four hours. Okay, look, look, I've seen him in situations like this, okay? He, he gets very overwhelmed, and he can't think straight. Ma'am, you're describing half the people in this city. Afternoon. Oh, I hear, uh, wonder boy is missing in action. Hey, Walter, you got a minute? - Not right now. - I think you do. We didn't fly 3,000 miles to see ""cats. "" Yeah, well, ""cats"" is closed. I was straight up with you from the moment I shook your hand. Are you accusing me of something? Warrick Tennyson is dying from kidney failure and heart disease. He probably will not live long enough to talk to us, and you knew it. How long does he have? He's got two, three days, maybe. He's in some hospital, nobody knows where, and the D. A's been deposing him on that racketeering case, and they're afraid that they're going to lose him before they get what they need. They're not going to let anybody get near him. - You gave me your word. - Come on, I didn't lie to you. If we close the ambassador case Look, I don't care about the frigging ambassador. He means less than zero to me, okay? My friend's wife got blown up. You understand? And it killed him, too. In a way. If we close this case, we can call city hall, we can call the press, we're going to have juice. Come on, you know how this works. They won't dare say no to us. Captain, it's not just your best shot. It's your only shot. And few there be that find it. Praise the lord. A cleansing is coming. There will be a reckoning. A cleansing is coming. Who would like to see a cleansing? I would, I would. They found him. He's in Times Square. Oh, my god. There will be a reckoning because judgment day is coming! Testify, brother! Ha ha! Whoo! Speak unto it, brother! - Get it said! - But it's still not too late. - Is that him? - Yeah. Oh, my god! - Oh, my god! - You fornicators! Save yourselves! - Adrian, what are you doing? - We're spreading the word. Yeah, you're spreading something. Don't listen to her, Jorel. I know her. - She's a fornicator. - Adrian, Adrian, no. - Fornicator! - Fornicator! - Fornicator! - Fornicator! Fornicator! - Stop it! - Come here. - Fornicator! - Shame on you! Hold still. - Is he okay? - Yes, he's fine. Captain, captain, there is, a card game on 49th street. I think it might be rigged. Okay, well, we'll look into that, all right? Adrian, here, here, I bought you some water. Did you ever find Warrick Tennyson? We're working on that. They've got the home field advantage, but we're still working on it. Why don't we go back to the hotel and get some rest, okay? Come on. That's the guy from the hotel. What, the shooter? - How do you know? - His ear. I'd recognize it anywhere. Yeah, his name's Steven Leight. His wife was just killed in Central Park. I was just reading about him. Wait, and he killed the ambassador? - What's the connection? - I don't know, I don't know. But he's the guy. I've never been more sure. What time is it? Not you. Ooh, he's coming, he's coming. Steven Leight. Hi, I'm Leland Stottlemeyer, San Francisco homicide. This is lieutenant Disher, Sharona Fleming and that's Adrian Monk. - He's helping us out. - He's nearsighted. You were supposed to meet us at your apartment nearly an hour ago. - You weren't there. - Are you avoiding us, sir? No, no, no. I, I'm sorry. I, I forgot, you know? It's, I'm just, I'm not thinking very straight right now. It's, it's, it's been a terrible week. Your assistant said we might find you here, that you were doing some errands. Yeah, that's right. I, I went to the pharmacy. You know, I, I've already talked to the police, five times. I told them everything I know. - Oh, my god. - What? Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. - What's wrong? That girl, that, that girl. One of her gloves is missing. Mr. Leight, would you mind telling us your story again? - You guys are from San Francisco, right? - Yep. I, I don't understand. What does Beverly's murder have to do with you? We're working on a different case, but we think there might be a connection. Excuse me. Hey, excuse me. what, what happened to your other glove there? I lost it. She, she lost it, for god's sake. Go ahead. Two days ago, it was, it was our anniversary. We had tickets to the matinee. We were supposed to meet out in front of the theater, and she never showed up. Mr. Leight, excuse me. Uh, I, I called everybody that we knew. Finally I called the police, and - Excuse me! - They had just found her body over by the boat pond in Central Park. The cops, they, they think that, they think that she resisted. - And what do you think? - I don't know, you know? She was, she was wearing her grandmother's necklace, and it meant the world to her. I think if somebody probably tried to take that, she would have fought back. Now I, uh, I can't believe that she's gone. Show me your hands. Show me, see? Okay. Go. Go, go skate. Go. How many years had you been married? Seven years. I'm so, Mr. Leight, um, - do you live alone, sir? - Yeah, now I do. Who are you sleeping with? What, what, what are you talking about? Well, your wife just died, but - you're not sleeping alone, are you? - Of course I am. Well, you just bought some snoring medicine. There's only one reason a man buys snoring medicine. You're keeping somebody else awake. This conversation's over, okay? I don't have to talk to you, and I don't want to talk to you. If you have any more questions, here, I'll tell you what. why don't you take a quarter? You call my lawyer. What, what is that? Uh, a mint? Could I see that? Unbelievable. You want it, take it. Have a good day. They're identical. Which means what? It means Steven Leight was in this bar recently. Steven leight and the ambassador were both in this bar. - Uh, this isn't mine. - Oh, sorry. I was looking at the wrong ticket. What's wrong with me? Here we go. What's going on? Nobody's told me anything. Yeah, join the club. Mr. Leight, have you ever been inside this bar before? Maybe. I don't remember. Maybe I can refresh your memory. You were here on Wednesday just minutes after you killed your wife. Ha ha. You're crazy. Here's what happened. You took your wife to the park, and you found a secluded area, and when you were sure no one was watching, you shot her. Then you took her jewelry to make it look like a robbery. Afterwards, you were pretty shaken up. Cold-blooded murder has a tendency to do that. So you decided to have a drink before you called the police. Of course, you didn't notice that the ambassador from Latvia was sitting just a few feet away. Why would you? You'd never met the man. But then your worlds collided. The coat check girl gave him your coat by mistake. From what I've seen, that happens around here all the time. Later, when she gave you the ambassador's coat, you immediately realized what had happened. You had to get your coat back, because your wife's jewelry was still in the pocket. It could have easily been traced. If anybody found it, they'd know you'd killed her. You found the hotel key card, so you knew where he was staying. You ran the whole way. You probably didn't even notice that it started to rain. You. It was you. You filthy, disgusting animal. You make me sick! Me? What are you doing? He's a busboy. Sharona, don't you recognize him from the subway? He's the urinator. Urinator! It was you. Don't, don't, don't, don't try to deny it. - Monk - We saw what you Monk! could we get back to the quadruple homicide, please? Yeah, he followed the ambassador to the hotel, the ambassador must have noticed the jewelry, Leight killed them all, switched coats, and that's how one of them was wet. You. Where were you raised? I mean, how can you live with yourself? Disgusting pig. And you work in the food service industry, for god's sake. You control yourself. The ballistics check out. The wife was killed with the same gun. Mr. Leight, you're under arrest for four counts of premeditated homicide. Sir, captain Cage, I'm going to need to borrow these handcuffs, 'cause you're going down, Mr. Pee. - Monk. - Adrian That man took a whiz in the subway. That man killed four people in cold blood. Now, who do you think we should arrest? The murderer. How is he? He's on morphine, so there's no pain. That's too bad. Could you excuse us for a minute? Thank you. Uh, Mr. Tennyson, we're here from San Francisco to talk to you about Trudy Monk. Do you remember her? Car bomb. That's right. A man, a man paid me $2,000 cash to build a bomb. magnesium charge. How, how was it detonated? Cell phone. Who was it? Who hired you? I don't know. I only met him one time parking garage. What did he look like? It was dark. I never saw his face. But I saw his hand. He had six fingers on his right hand. Freak. Could you leave us alone for a minute? I'll meet you outside. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Let's go. You were the husband. I am the husband. Forgive me. Forgive you? This is me turning off your morphine. And this is Trudy the woman you killed turning it back on. You know, it's a shame. New York's the greatest city in the world, and we couldn't even enjoy it. Well, I promise we're coming back. I promise. Oh, yeah, let's do that. No, wait, I have a better idea. Why don't we never travel anywhere ever again? We're going to be late. Is that a new watch? - Did you buy it in a store? - Yeah. I bought it near a store. I mean, this one keeps perfect time. Swiss accuracy. - Your watch is smoking. - What? Your watch is on fire. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You guys, fine. Not him. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hang on, hang on. I'm handcuffing him, okay? Yeah, I'm handcuffing him. He won't touch anything. - I promise. - Plus double the meter. Yeah, let's come back here real soon. And no talking!"

MONK Season 3 Epi. 02 Mr. Monk and the Panic Room Benjy, I am so disappointed in you, and you were lucky. you weren't expelled. - Uh-oh. - What? - Oh, the band-aid is - It's okay. It doesn't have to be perfect. Ow! You'll heal faster if it's straighter. - Mom, can you please do this? - You don't want me near you, and it serves you right for fighting. I wasn't fighting. You said I should defend myself. You weren't defending yourself. You were defending that little boy, and you know it. His name is Reuben. Everyone was picking on him. - They were giving him a wedgie. - What's a wedgie? It's when they lift your underwear all the way out of your pants. Oh. When I was a kid, they called it something else. - What? - An Adrian. I feel sorry for Reuben, too. I really do. But he's not your problem, and you should have gone to another teacher. Teachers don't do anything. He gets picked on every day. - He's too little to fight back. - Benjy, rules are rules. Now, you're punished, and there's no TV, - and there's no playstation. - Mom. Sharona, he was just sticking up for a friend. Adrian, you stay out of it. You're not his father. That's true, but I care about him as much as any father. Ow! Stop it! Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's here. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. Yeah. Uh, 715 vinton street. Okay, great. Yeah, we'll be there. Okay, bye. Adrian, we have a job. We got to go. What please look at me. Benjy, I'm going to call aunt Gail, and she's going to make you dinner tonight, okay? - Yeah. Now, I want you to go to your room and think about what you've done. - Yep. You know I still love you, right? All right. Go to your room. - Monk. Sharona. - Lieutenant. Thank you for coming. We've got a very bizarre situation here. I could use a second opinion. - Third opinion. - What? Well, I already told you what I thought, so this would be a third opinion. Whatever. A third opinion. - Who's the victim? - Ian Blackburn. He's a major-league record producer, and he's worked with everybody. The Stones, Springsteen, The Eagles. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Isn't he married to Chloe? Yeah, yeah, they've been married for two years. He produces all of her stuff. At least he did until 5:09 this morning. Who's Chloe? Well, she's the most famous singer on the planet. Oh, Chloe. Yeah, sure. She's great. I love that song she does about loving that guy, 'cause look, the press hasn't gotten wind of this yet, but it won't be long. Captain? You wanted to see the window? - Yes, sir. - He got in through here? - No, he never got in. He broke the glass, set off the alarm, and that scared him away. Probably just some neighborhood kid. - Yep. - That is strange. - What's strange? These footprints heading toward the house, you see the whole foot. - He's walking. - So? Look at these heading the other way. You see the whole foot. Still walking. If somebody tripped an alarm, especially a kid, you'd think they'd run away. You might be right, but it doesn't matter, because whoever broke that glass never got into the house. - He's not the killer. - Then who is? - Do you have a suspect? - Yep. You want to meet him? It's a monkey. Actually, uh, he's a chimpanzee. His name's Darwin. He's 5 years old. He's been living with Mr. Blackburn since he was a baby. I mean a baby chimp. He was never a regular baby. - I don't understand. - He's our suspect. He's the shooter. I don't understand. That chimp was alone in a locked room with the victim. We found a gun in his hand. I don't understand. Oh, he's scared to death. Come on, baby. Sharona, don't touch him. Don't touch it. Don't, now you're going, you're going to have to be quarantined, and you will, too. You all will. I think he's hungry. Has anybody fed him? We called animal control. They'll be here soon. - Is there a kitchen around here? - Yeah, in there. - I'll go with you. - Why? He's dangerous, Sharona. He's killed before. Oh, please. He wouldn't hurt a fly. Look at him. Come on, honey. Come on. This is his own private recording studio. State of the art. - Is that the wife? - Yep, Chloe. She's state of the art, too. I just talked to her. She was in Dallas doing a show last night. - How did she take the news? - Shock, tears. - It sounded genuine. - Whoa, whoa. Um She's canceling her tour. She's flying back here. She'll be here later today. She told me she spoke to Ian at around 4:00 A. M. He was in here mixing a song. Monk. And, uh, at 5:09, somebody broke the window downstairs. - Which, which set off the alarm. - Right. - Right. At which point Blackburn grabbed the monkey, and they skedaddled down that hall toward the bedroom. - Monk, stop it. - What is that? - Do you, do you hear that? - What? - Listen. It's a pill dispenser. Oh, yeah, she said that he was on antidepressants. Karen's got one of those. It's got a built-in alarm in it. It reminds her when to take the pills. This one's set for 4:30 A. M., But you said the alarm went off at 5:09. - So why didn't he take his pills? - Why didn't he take his pills? - That's pretty weird. - Hang on. It gets weirder. Come on. Come on, honey. Feel better? Do you feel better? Okay. What happened last night? Guess he's not going to be the best witness. He's not a witness, Sharona. He's the killer. Whoa. Hey, watch it. He did it. We'll see what Adrian says. He's very smart. He's going to figure it all out. They call it a panic room. I know that's a difficult concept, because for you, every room is a panic room. - Thank you. If there's an intruder in the house, you run in there, you lock the door, - and wait for the cavalry. - Which is what Blackburn did. Exactly. The alarm came in at 5:09, two uniforms responded, no sign of an intruder. They run upstairs, knock, knock, door's locked, no answer. They cut their way in. They find him right there, shot four times. Once in the chest, once in the head, twice in the back. King kong is right there next to him, covered with blood, with a gun in his hand. - And the room was locked from the inside? - Oh, yeah, locked and bolted. As you can see, it's completely self-contained. You could live in here for a week. Well, not you, but a person could. - Who owned the gun? - He did. He kept it in here. So what do you think? I mean, am I missing anything? Because I, I want to be sure before I go on television and - utter the words ""killer monkey."" - Mm. I don't know. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Help! Somebody! Oh, my I'm trapped in here. I'm trapped in here! - Monk, you're not trapped. - Captain! Monk, just push this button here on the wall. It's sound proof. Can you hear me? - Monk, I can hear you. - I'm trapped in here! Monk, I can hear you. I can see you. - There's a hole in the door. Monk. - I'm running out of air. No, you're not running out of air, Monk. Monk. - I'm running out of air! - You're not running out of air. - There's a - I can't breathe! - Monk. Monk! - I can't breathe! Monk, you can breathe. There's a hole in the door. No more talking. Monk, look at me. Monk, push the button. No more talking! Monk, look at me! Monk. Help me! Got to conserve air. Monk, just push the button. Push, push, push the green button. Monk. The green button that says ""open."" No, the button here that says ""open"" by the door. Monk. That's a panic room. - Adrian, are you all right? - I almost ran out of air. Well, at least you didn't lose your head, and that's the important thing. Excuse me. We're from animal control. Please, darling, come here. Oh, shh, shh. Here you go, fella. You got to come with us now. - That's a good boy. - No, what are you going to do with him? If he killed somebody, we're going to have to put him down. - You're going to put him down? - I'm afraid so. That's the law. - What? Adrian, you have to do something. He didn't do it. Sharona, the room was locked. There was nobody else in there. I don't care! He didn't do it! I, he didn't do it. I know he didn't do it. You like that? You miss me? Huh? - I missed you. - So how long have you two been dating? He's just jealous 'cause you're cuter than him, and you smell better. Well, they finally spelled my name right, the one time I wish they hadn't. I can't believe I let her talk me into this. There are a few things that don't add up. What? Footprints? And the pill dispenser. Monk, there's always going to be a loose end or two. Lest we forget that the monkey and the victim were in a locked room alone. There is that. Look, I called the San francisco zoo, and they don't think a chimpanzee can fire a handgun. Of course he can. If you can peel a banana, you can fire a gun. - What, are you an expert now? - Are you? More than you. Hey, children, let's not fight in front of the monkey, okay? It's a legitimate question, and we're going to settle it once and for all right now. Lieutenant, give me that gun. - Is it loaded? - No, sir. - I emptied it myself. - Good. Okay. I'm going downstairs with our suspect. I'm going to hand him a gun, and we'll see what happens. Great. I'm going with you. No, Sharona, it's just me and Darwin. I'm trying to recreate the conditions in the panic room. I'm going to lock the door, and I'm not coming out until I'm satisfied. Let's go. Come on. Have a seat. So I understand you can use tools. I know you've seen one of these before. There's a tool for you. - Monk, can I run a theory by you? - Sure. Suicide by monkey. - Suicide by monkey? - Yeah, what if Ian blackburn trained the chimp to shoot him in the panic room? Why would he do that? So his wife could collect on the insurance. Thus, suicide by monkey. Thus, theory by monkey. Randy, Ian blackburn had a $100,000 life insurance policy. Chloe is worth, what, $20 million? It doesn't seem worth it. - That's true. - You keep thinking, butch. You think you're pretty cute, don't you? Hey, get your fingers out of your ears. I'm talking to you. I'm talking to you. Are you laughing at me? I said, are you laughing at me. I think you've got an attitude problem, my friend. Okay, opposable thumbs. Whoop-de-doo. Here, pick it up. Here you go. What do you think of that? - Randy, do you have another piece of gum? - Yeah, sure. Uh-oh. Is there a problem? Wrong gun. Go on, pull the trigger. Go on, pull it. Pull it. Pull it. Pull, pull the trigger. You hungry, huh? Bang. Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on! Here you go. Monkey. Hey. You like that? Do you like him? Huh? Captain, open the door! Open the door! Go away! Go away! I'm not done yet! I told you to leave me alone! Go away! I'm not done yet! The other door! Captain, captain! The gun's loaded! Captain, the gun's loaded! - It's loaded! - You've got the wrong gun! It's loaded! Come on, come on. - Empty gun!??? empty! - It's loaded! Give me your best shot, your stupid primate! The case is closed. Sharona, you were there. He fired the gun. Yeah, but he didn't aim it. He didn't hit anything. Look, in the panic room, Ian blackburn was shot four times. Four shots, four hits. There is no way Darwin could have done that. - There's no way. - Maybe you're right. Okay, now, are you saying that because you agree with me or because you're afraid of me? I'm saying that because I'm afraid of you. Hey, good choice. That's the ultra 4000. The strongest safe in the world. Hi, I'm Kurt wolff. - Welcome to wolff security. - Oh, thank you, thank you. I'm, I'm Sharona, and this is Adrian monk. Hi, how are you? All right, well, what can I do for you guys today? We've got everything you'll need to sleep a little easier at night. Oh, I doubt that. Let's see, I design most of the stuff myself, like this necklace, for instance. Take a look. It shoots pepper spray. I custom-made it for a famous movie star. Joey heatherton? Um, I can't tell you who. All I can say is, uh, she's very beautiful. Joey heatherton. - Mr. Wolff? - Yeah? We're helping the police investigate the death of Ian blackburn. Oh. Um, according to the news, they already know who did it. - That monkey of his. - Well, he's a chimpanzee, okay? Um, you built the panic room for them, huh? - Is that right? - Um, yes, that's true. I designed it and installed it. Excuse me. Could I see that, please? Could I take a look at this? Sure. Excuse me. That $17,000 camera? Are you sure you're still interested? Okay. Well, I got to hand it to you. You got great taste. That is the best camera in the world. I just sold five of them to the British secret service. How did Chloe hire you? Oh, I've known Chloe for years. I used to do security for her band when they were on the road. You know, most musicians can be a little - but, uh, she's okay. - The silver one. Good people. It's a shame what happened to them. Too big. That's too big. - So there's only one way in, huh? - Um, yeah. Once that door is locked, there is, you'd need a tank to get inside. Ah. Here we go. The finest camera in the world. - Is that it? - That's it. Thank you. - Let's go. - Thanks a lot. I already told the police everything I know. Well, we really appreciate your time. I, I'm a big fan. And what about you? Me, no. I haven't really listened to the pop rock 'n' roll since, uh - Ever. That's about right. Ever. But I have heard of you. - Thank you. And not just because the monkey killed your husband. Can I get you something? A drink? No, no, no, we're okay. Um, we just want to ask a couple of questions, that's all. - Go ahead. - Go ahead. Go ahead. - Mrs. Blackburn.. - Chloe. Chloe blackburn. On sunday night, the police phoned you while they were trying to open the panic room. Yeah, I was in Dallas. At least, I think it was Dallas. It's all sort of a blur. And at that time, you said that Ian probably killed himself. Ian was clinically depressed. He was in therapy and on medication. He talked about suicide all the time. Did you use the panic room a lot? Ian did. Um, he went there to meditate and to get away from the world. Maybe even to get away from me. I don't know. Look, this isn't the best time for me. The memorial service is tomorrow. Maybe we can talk next week. Next week's too late. They're going to put Darwin to sleep. Good. That animal killed my husband. I couldn't stand having that beast around. - Is that all? - Um I'm in mourning, Mr. Monk. - I really need to be alone. - Of course. - So then who was here last night? - Um, I had a friend over. - We had some wine. - Well, champagne. - Well, you're wearing a man's shirt. - It's my husband's. Now do you believe me? She's sleeping around. That's not a crime. In her world, it's standard operating procedure. Can't we get a court order? Adrian, they're going to put Darwin to sleep. He's innocent. Sharona, I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do. Honey, it's okay, okay. It's okay, honey. I got you. It's okay. - I hate this. - Why don't you stay out here, sir? - I can handle her. - Oh, you can? Since when? - Hey. - Sharona, we need to talk. - About what? - I think you know. What happened here? Did you have a party? Uh, it's Benjy. He never picks anything up. Sharona, where's Darwin? - What are you talking about? - We're going to find him. Is he here? Hey, will you put that away? This is my house. - He's killed before. - No, he hasn't. Sharona we know that you took him. Now, either you tell us where he is, or I'm going to have to take you in. That is the law. Living room secure. I'm heading to the kitchen. Randyyou don't have to use the walkie-talkie. I'm 10 feet away. Roger. Roger that. - Hey, what happened here? - Benjy threw up. - On the wall? - It was pretty awful. Kitchen secure. Monkey! Monkey! Monkey! False alarm! False alarm. False alarm. Stuffed bear. - Give me that. - Sharona You were seen. The animal shelter has a surveillance camera. It recorded your car's license plate as you drove away. They were going to kill him. Are you going to tell me where he is? I can't. Then I'm going to have to arrest you for breaking and entering and obstruction. Go ahead. - You have the right to remain silent. - Oh, Randy, give me a break. Damn it, Sharona, you're under arrest. Just turn around. - Mom. - Benjy, hey. What are you doing? Um, your mom bet Randy that she could get out of his handcuffs, and, uh, she couldn't, so, uh Take them off. Take them off. - Benjy, you were right. - About what? About standing up for that little boy in school. You did the right thing. So now I'm standing up for somebody who can't protect himself. - You mean Darwin? - Yeah. Look, everything's going to be okay, all right? Captain Stottlemeyer's going to take you to aunt Gail's, and you tell her to call Adrian. He'll know what to do after I tell him. All right. Hi. Remember me? Adrian, it's only been two hours. Come on. - How's Benjy? - Oh, he's good. I just talked to him. Said he's very proud of you. - Yeah. - Oh. Oh. Wipe. Sharona, wipe. I don't have any wipes. I'm in jail. Oh, what is it? Oh, my god, get it off me. Oh, god, get it off. It's jail goo. - This is, this is jail goo. - You know what? You know what? I put an extra wipe in your pocket. Give me, give me the wipe. Oh, god. It's connected. Will you please relax? I'm in no mood. Oh, my god. Jail goo. God. Oh. Listen, Sharona, you have to tell the police where Darwin is. - Please. - I can't do that. They'll kill him. I'm falling apart here. Look, if you want me out of here, all you have to do is prove that Darwin is innocent. - I think Chloe did it. - Chloe? How? I don't know. You're the genius. You figure it out. Dr, Dr. Kroger, please. It's Adrian monk. Yes. When, when do you expect him back? I understand. Well, it is, uh.. it is rather important. All right, good bye. Thank you. - Adrian, are you all right? - Dr. Kroger, yes. Thank you for coming. Well, yeah, I usually don't make house calls, but you said that it couldn't wait. Would you like some juice? There's an ape in my house. I have an ape in my house. Well, I've never, I've never been to your house before. Adrian, is, is that Darwin from the murder case? Well, uh, uh, Uh, maybe, maybe you should just call the police. I can't do that. Sharona left him here. She, she's protecting him. She'd never forgive me. Hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Um, okay, okay. Why don't we just leave him here and - and we'll just go back to my office? - I can't do that, either. She expects me to take care of him. Well, you know, Adrian, I, I can see that, that your space has been violated, and I think you're handling it very well. I'm, I'm proud of you. - How do, how do you feel? - I'm fine. These things happen. - What can you do? - Exactly, exactly. See, these are all just material objects. You know, you can always replace anything that he breaks or chews orpees on. Chews or pees on. Chews or pees on. Where are you? Are you in here? Hey, monk, did you put this up? You can't sell this house. You're renting. - I can't live here anymore. - But it's not your house. - Chews or pees on. - What are you, mental? Excuse me. I'm Adrian's psychiatrist Dr. Kroger. You are - I'm Leo navarro. I'm Adrian's landlord. What the hell is going on here? Adrian is having a dissociative episode. He's just not thinking straight. What the hell is that? No pets allowed. You know the rules. Hey! Get off of that! What did I do? Excuse me. Let me try something. What, he hates bald guys? Ad, Adrian, what's, what's going on? I think I just solved the case. I think I know what happened in that panic room. It was here the whole time. I can't believe we missed it. - What is it? - Digital tape recorder. Ian blackburn used to record memos to himself. Lookthe record switch is still in the on position. I think it might have recorded the murder. - Well, let's just play it back. - No, no, we can't touch it. It's broken. If we move it, we might damage the chip. The FBI will be here tomorrow with a tech crew. - It'll be safe in there until then, right? - Uh, yes, sir. Safer than the bank of England. - Here's the key for you. - Good deal. - Is there anything else, uh - No, that'll do it. - Thank you very much. - All right. - When's the FBI coming? - First thing in the morning. Excuse me. - I can't wait to hear what's on that tape. We'll finally know exactly what happened in there. - Yep. - Ow! - Sharona? - Adrian? - Shh! Over here! Come here, come here. Sit down. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I'm okay, too. I think we're all really okay. By the way, I found your monkey. Oh, god, I'm sorry about that. Look, I'll help you clean it up. Nah, I'll be fine. I've got 17 maids in there working on it. Shh! He's going to hear us. We're on a stakeout. Look, so, so what's going on? They let me out, but they didn't tell me anything. You were right about the chimp. He wasn't involved at all. You were right about Chloe, too. She had a lover. They were in on it together. - They killed her husband. - Now, are you sure? There was a witness. Your new boyfriend Darwin. Actually, Darwin solved the case. Yesterday at my apartment, my landlord came in. Darwin went berserk. Then I remembered he acted the same way on monday when he saw the animal control officer. The two men have something in common. - They're both bald. - Bald. - Darwin is afraid of bald men. - Why wouldn't he be? Ian blackburn was killed by a bald man, and Darwin saw it happen. A bald man, the security guy. Kurt wolff. The man who built the panic room. When he installed it, he built a secret crawl space. It goes from the basement to the panic room. There's a secret panel behind the furnace. We found it last night. Excuse me, would you stop pointing that in my face? - But you're talking. - You can hear me talking. You don't need to see me talking. You know it's me. Thank you. - He needs to see you. - Okay, fine. So why? - Love and money, the oldest motive in the world. Chloe met Wolff when he was doing security for her, and they hooked up, as the kids would say. The divorce would have cost her $10 million. So they were planning this for, like, a year? - Exactly. Kurt didn't build the panic room to protect Ian blackburn. He built it to kill him. The plan was to make it look like a suicide. It was a brilliant plan. That night Wolff snuck into the panic room. He set the test alarm button, so the alarm rang, but only inside the house. That's how he lured Ian into the panic room. The plan was for Ian to be found dead the next day in a locked room. Everybody would think that he killed himself. There would be no other explanation. It was a perfect plan. Not quite perfect. They didn't count on one thing. Darwin. Darwin must have grabbed for the gun, and there was a struggle. Ian was shot four times, twice in the back. Their suicide story wasn't going to fly. - So he framed Darwin? - Well, it was a long shot, but what else could he do? Of course, now he had to explain what Ian was doing in the panic room, So as he left, he broke a window to make it look like a burglar had tried to get in. And that's how we found it. Broken window, killer monkey. - Can we prove it? - That's why we're here. Shh. He's here. He took the bait. He's in the basement. He just climbed into the crawl space. Okay. It's showtime. - What took you so long? - Were you looking for this? You shouldn't have bothered. We already played it. There's nothing on it. Ah, this is all going to go bad. Would you excuse me? You're under arrest, Mr. Wolff, for the murder of Ian blackburn. You have a right to remain silent. Uh, can we, can we go now? - Hey, Darwin. Hey, buddy. - Hey, Darwin, hey. How you doing? You remember us? - Oh, he asks about you all the time. - Really? Is he doing good? He's fine, as long as I keep my hat on. He still doesn't like guys who are b, a, l, d. Bald. So what's going to happen to him? Well, he's off to the san francisco zoo, where he's going to be treated like a prince. They say you can come visit anytime you want. You, Benjy, and Mr. Monk have a lifetime pass. Oh, a lifetime pass to the zoo. Your mom's a hero. - Is this for me? Is that for me? - He's saying thank you. Yeah, that's good. Then we have to go. Mr. Monk, he's trying to say something to you. No, that's okay. We got to go. No, no, no, no. Wipe. Wipe, wipe. God. Worse than jail goo."
"It's that new game doodle fever. Oh, good, I love games. Okay, I'm going to draw something. You have to guess what I'm drawing in two minutes. Why don't you just tell me what it is? Then we don't have to play. Well, that wouldn't be very fun, now, would it? We're supposed to be having fun, right? - Hey, you ready? - Yeah. All right. Go. It's a line. It's a slightly crooked line. It's, um It's a line that should be straighter. Two lines. They're not parallel. They're uneven lines. They're uneve.. two uneven lines. Uh Asymmetrical. It's an asymmetrical shape. A disturbing asymmetrical shape. Am I close? - No. It's, uh Uh - Time's up. - It's a houseboat. Oh, yeah, yeah, I can see that now. - Oh, I can see the wave. - That's a shark. Oh, yeah. That should have been a clue. - Well, that was fun. - Ooh, wait, it's 9:00. - The show's about to start. - Thank god. What are we watching? That concert for the San francisco bicentennial. It's with Willie nelson. Hey, remember when you guys saved his life? - Yes. And he gave Adrian one of his own harmonicas. - Can I see it? - Oh, no. I, I had to throw it out. Mr. Nelson put his, you know, mouth on it. We're on tape at the Miranda auditorium in San francisco. It's the bicentennial jamboree with special guest Wille nelson. Sharona MONK Season 3 Epi. 03 Mr. Monk and the Blackout You know that nine months after every blackout, the birth rate goes up? Nine months? Ohh. I get it. Uh Adrian, it's going to be okay. Just relax, all right? Benjy, hold his hand. Ow. He's squeezing it. - Let him squeeze it. - Uh Adrian, please don't worry, all right? The lights are going to come on soon, I'm telling you. Now I'm going to go in the kitchen, fill the sink up with water, and look for another candle. When will it be over? I just told you, it won't be long. - When will it be over? - Adrian, they're working on it. When will it be over? - Will you stop asking me that? I don't know. - When will it be over? - I don't know. - When will it be over? - Make him stop! God, Adrian, for the love of god, please, come on! You see? Now, was that so bad? I didn't know when it would be over. So I heard. I didn't know when it would be over. - Uh, miss, um - Rivas. Miss Rivas. You're saying that there was no security here at all, no camera, no guard? The cameras were all on the outside. There are none here in the main yard. Well, if the bomber knew that, then this is probably an inside job. We're assuming it was, or at least he knew what he was doing. You see, when this station went down, the next one on the grid tried to compensate, then the one after that, causing a full reactive power surge. sector went dark. Actually, we got lucky. The bomb went off at exactly 9:00. would have been on the primary grid, and we would have lost half of california. Doesn't make sense. He knew where to set the bomb, but not when to set the bomb. - He screwed up. - Maybe. Or maybe he was being selective. Maybe he didn't want to black out the whole state. Captain. Feds found a note, uh, more like a manifesto. - Well, how are the Feds treating us? - So far it's a love fest. They're sharing everything. Well, let's check it out before they sober up. - Michelle. - Yeah. - Where's Edelson? - I don't know. If you see him, will you tell him to get his butt over there? There's a reporter from the Chronicle. She's got a technical question, needs to talk to an engineer. And tell that man to put his hat on. I'm sorry, sir. You're going to have to put your hat on. I can't wear a hat. Well, you have to wear it, so just put it on. You look great. Here you go. - Are you Adrian monk? - Yes. Wow, I can't believe I'm meeting you. I'm a huge fan of yours. I think you're mistaking me for anybody else. I was just reading about you. I was just reading about how you recovered that stolen Picasso. - Oh. You're a genius. I'm Michelle rivas, resident P. R. flack and hardhat adjuster. Are you afraid of cooties? Yes. Among other things. The article said that you were single. I was married. She died. Wow. And you still wear the ring. I like that. That kind of devotion you don't see that much anymore. No, you sure don't. Well, I'm Sharona, Adrian's assistant. - It's very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. Gene, what are you doing up there? What am I doing? I am checking the auxiliary generator. Well, there's a reporter looking for you. You're the company mouth. You talk to them. It's not my job. Excuse me. Uh, do you see the sign? Oh, no problem. I got it. I've been dying to do that for six months. Hey, Monk, we've got the prelim on the explosive. We think 4 to 5 pounds of a high-density plastique, magnesium charge. It was detonated with an egg timer. You mentioned a letter. Is that the letter? Yeah, three pages taped to the back door. It's unsigned. Yeah, it's your basic environmental laundry list. Solar power, fossil fuel, Saudi arabia, it's the only planet we have ""We are free men, unshackled by your barbarous laws."" I know that phrase. I've heard that before. Unshackled barbarous laws phrase was in a letter written by a guy named Winston, no. Yes. Winston brenner. Trudy wrote, wrote an article about him. I remember that guy. He was a serious radical in Boston. He blew up a recruiting station, couple of soldiers got killed. That's right. - Well, it looks like he just came out of retirement. Let's check him out. Okay. Sharona, would you, um, give this to Adrian? You know, just in case he has any questions at all. - Sure. Or even if he doesn't. That's my home number on the back. - Do you like him? - Well, he's a very interesting man. - Yes, he is. - And he's obviously brilliant. Well, he can be, yes. Does he date? Does, does he date? Umno. Is there something wrong with him? No. I'm going to hell. I'm a horrible person. Why? I just told that woman Michelle that there was nothing wrong with you. She should have asked me. I just didn't know what to say. I just thought You know, you might want to call her. Maybe it's time. I don't think so. Adrian, I'm talking to you as a friend, okay? She seems really nice, and I think you should call her. Just see what happens. Mm, no. All right, here, here, here, here. Why don't you take this in case you change your mind? - Her number's on the back. - No. All right, then I'll say the number. I know once you hear it, you're not going to forget it. - 555 - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! na na na na na na na na Captain. Monk was right. And you were right, too, sir, about Monk being right. Good work. - What do you got, Randy? - Winston brenner. He was an activist in the '90s. He was indicted in a series of bombings in Boston. Pretty angry individual. Here, look at this. This is the letter from the power plant. This one is from 11 years ago. He uses a lot of the same phrases. ""The blood I shed today,"" ""the blood I shed today."" ""Price of absolute freedom,"" ""price of absolute freedom."" Check this out. The handwriting is identical. This is definitely the guy. The only thing is, is that back then, Brenner didn't really care about the environment. Anti-military was his thing. Did you read the rest of the file, Randy? We've got some pictures, too. They're blurry but good. - Read the rest of the file, Randy. - Which part? The part here where it says that he died. Deceased 1995. He blew himself up before the trial. He's dead. No, I won't be reasonable. I'm sick and tired of being reasonable. I'm not coming down until you agree to build your stupid condo somewhere else! - Did you call Michelle? - No. - Did you think about it? - No. Well, did you think about thinking about it? Sharona, I'm a married man. - Captain, lieutenant. - Sharona, Monk. - What's going on? - Tree hugger. His name is Alby drake. He was Winston brenner's oldest friend. They were roommates at M. I. T. - How long has he been up there? - 10 days. He'll be down soon. The judge will be ordering an eviction notice by tomorrow morning. The FBI, in their infinite wisdom, now agrees that Winston brenner may have faked his own death back in 1995. If Brenner is still alive, that scruffy bird up there may still be in contact with him. How does he go to the bathroom? Mr. Drake. My name is Leland stottlemeyer. I'm with the San francisco police. He is filthy. I need some wipes. I've got a copy of a document here. I'd like you to take a look at it. I'm sending it up. What is it? There was a bombing at a power plant on monday night. Yeah. I saw the lights go out. It was a beautiful thing, man. The stars were awesome! We need you to look at that document and tell me if you recognize the handwriting. Why should I? We believe that your friend Winston brenner is still alive. Mr. Drake, we are also sending up some wipes. What for? To clean yourself. They're pre-moistened. They have a million and one uses. Go to hell! Mr. Drake, this isn't a game. During that blackout, three people died. - They died? - Yes, sir, they did. There were two heart attacks and one young woman on a dialysis machine, which makes this a homicide investigation. Do you understand me? It's me again. You know Ralph nader uses the wipes. He loves them. And, uh and Fidel castro. All the radicals love the pre-moistened wipes. Sting he uses them all the time. - Sting? - He's a rock 'n' roller. Look, I'm going to need to think about this. I need a little time here, okay? That's fine, Mr. Drake. Take your time. We'll be back tomorrow. - Don't go anywhere. - Not a problem. Oh. Oh. Aah. Oh, god. Wipe. - Give him a wipe. - Wipe. - You took them all. - Oh. - You took them all. - Ugh. Yo, Mr. Drake, wait, wait. we need, we need some wipes down here. Could you, could you send a couple down, please? - Sure. Hey! Hey! Thank you. You know, I, I thought about you during the blackout. Were you, were you all right? I was at Sharona's. Good. Good, you weren't alone. A bomb at a power plant. - It's a scary world, huh? - Yes. Yes, it is. I'm, I'm working on the case. - How's it going? - It's tough. We have a suspect, but, um He's officially been dead for nine years. What? Something happened. This is pretty funny. - Mm, you're going to laugh. - Okay. There's this woman. She works at the power plant. She, um She said that she thought I was interesting. She, she gave me her number. I, I told you it was funny. Is she nice? Adrian? Is she attractive? Are those new shoes? No, no, Adrian, don't change the subject. Not today. I would like to talk about this woman. Is she attractive? I don't know. How am I supposed to know if a woman is attractive? By looking at her. Adrian, there's a reason why you mentioned this, and I think you should give her a call. It's been eight years, Adrian. Maybe it's time for you to take a tiny little baby step forward. Adrian, I'm your doctor, and I'm writing you a prescription. I can't read your writing. It's upside-down. It says ""call her"". You don't have to go out with her. You don't even have to meet her. Just give her a call. What's the worst that could happen? I I might not hate it. Hey. It's me. I'm good. I thought you might like to know some cops were here asking about you. I didn't tell them anything, but I thought about it. Three people died in that blackout. That's not cool. Innocent blood, man. I thought those days were over. Don't even try to justify it. Yeah, well, if it happens again, you're going to be sorry. No, brother, you be careful. - Hello? - Hello. It's me. Adrian monk. The detective. Hey. I was just thinking about you. I've been thinking about you, too. - How was your day? - Oh, just still not over. I have 10 more press releases to write. Is there anything new in the investigation? Not yet. - This is a very tough case. - Yeah. What is it about San francisco that attracts so many kooks? Bombers and radicals. I mean, does San antonio, Texas have problems like this? Texas. Hold, please. Texas. Texas. Texas. Texas. - Where are you from? - San francisco, born and bred. - How about you? - Chicago, but I went to college here and just never left, like everybody else, I guess. - Oh. What college did you attend, and what did you study? Stanford. I majored in journalism. - Trudy majored in journalism. - Oh. What was she like? She loved poetry. She could recite 100 poems by heart. She went barefoot all the time, even when it was freezing. She kept every promise she ever made. I loved the way she looked at me. I think I miss that more than anything. Hey! What are you doing? I'm up here, man! What are you doing? Hey! Stop! Stop! Hello, police? Somebody's trying to kill me! I'm at the spring hills development at the construction site. Aah! I'm in the big oak tree. No, wait, don't hang up! Aah! Aah! Aah! - Did you really call her? - Yes, I called her. Is that so hard to believe? Oh, no, no. I'm, I'm just stunned. - I, were you honest with her? - Yes, I was. I laid all my cards on the table. I am so proud of you. I, are you going to see her? I don't know what happened. She said, ""do you want to get together?"" And I panicked. I, I lost my head. I said ""okay."" So you have a date. I have a date. - Aren't you excited? - Yes, I am if by excited you mean petrified and full of regret. Petrified and full of regret. Welcome to the world of dating. Captain. Monk. Sharona. I'm sure you've noticed by now there used to be a big tree standing right over there. - What time? - 4:35 A. M. A security guard heard somebody start up the bulldozer. Moments later Timber. Drake was dead on impact. Yeah, he made a phone call, though, at about midnight. - To a pay phone, right? - You guessed it. Palo alto. Oh, well, it had to be Brenner. He's the guy. So not only is Winston brenner alive and well, he's making sure his old pals don't rat him out. That's right. The FBI is calling a powwow tonight. They want to compare notes and synchronize watches. Whoa. Ouch. Tonight I, I, I can't make it. He has a date. - He has a date? - Yes. It's that P. R. lady from the power plant, right? - Ah, okay. Adrian monk, you're a stud. - I'm not a stud. - You're a stud. Where are you going to take her? A place called Bianca's. What? Is there a problem? Hi. It, it's me. Adrian monk. Right on time, Mr. Punctuality. Actually, that used to be my nickname, Mr. Punctuality. - In college? - Kindergarten. - I bought you a dozen roses. - Well, they're beautiful. - What happened to the rest? - I had to throw them out. They were all different. Well, thank you. Should we go up? I read the most amazing review about this place. - It got four stars. - Oh, good. And look, it says the most spectacular view in town. - Ohgood. - Are you okay? - Uh, the elevator's, - it's uneven. I think it's broken. - No. - No, they always do that. - It's broken. - I hope you don't mind. - No, no, this is fine. - We're working up an appetite. - That's the spirit. - I like your hat. - Yeah, it's new. Although I think it's too small or my head's too big. - Your head? No, it's perfect. - Thank you. - It's perfectly round like Charlie brown. - Thank you. - Were you born Caesarean? - I don't know. I was born naturally, but I was raised Caesarean. - Okay. Trudy's head was more of an oval. Yes, you mentioned that on the phone, - and that she loved poetry - That's right. And loved going barefoot even when it was freezing. - Exactly. So, do you have any brothers or sisters? Yes, I have a sister. She's nine months pregnant. Oh, so you're gonna you're gonna be, uh - An aunt. - Exactly. Uhh - You all right? - Mm. So do you have any brothers or sisters? Yes. Yes, I have a sister. She's pregnant. Well, by now she might have had the baby. Good. A sense of humor. You're gonna need it. The last 20 flights are the hardest. Ahh. Oh, you dropped your flowers. Oh. You dropped your flowers fell down a little bit. Yes, sir? We have a reservation. - And the name? - Monk. M as in ""My God, that was a lot of stairs."" - O as in - oh, yes. I have you right here. Uh, your reservation was for 35 minutes ago. Uh, I'm sorry. We had to give away your table. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. We just walked up 52 flights of stairs. You need to feed us. Uh, I'm sorry. There's really nothing I can do - Until 12:15. - Okay. No problem. - We'll wait. - That's three hours. - Why don't you just take me home? - Okay. No problem. Let's go. - It'll be a lot easier going down. - You got that right. 'Cause we're taking the elevator. - Hey, Benjy, put on channel 11. - Why? They're showing that music special again with Willie nelson. Why do we always watch what you want to watch? Because you're sweet and you love me. We're on tape at the Miranda auditorium in San francisco. It's the bicentennial jamboree with special - Oh, man. - what? - Again? - I'll get the candles. - Oh, my god. - What? Adrian's on his date. Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby, - lobby, lobby, lobby - Thank you, phil. - You're my hero. - Lobby, lobby, lobby - Fire department's on the way. - Thank god. What happened? It was another bomb. At an auxiliary station. - Oh, my god. I work for the power company. My job just got a whole lot harder. Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby. Sir, there's no power. It's not going to move. You're probably right. Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby - Want to hear something sad? - Hmm? This isn't even the worst date I've had this year. - Really? - Yeah. I went out with this guy from work, - Gene edelson. You met him. - The engineer? Lobby, lobby I guess I felt sorry for him. I could tell he never got out much. He's into country/western. Took me line-dancing. Oh, I'm so sorry. He had a couple drinks, then a couple more, groped me for half an hour, and puked all over the mechanical bull. Those quiet guys are the worst. Yeah, he sounds like a real loser. Lobby, lobby, lobby, lobby! You ok? All clear, here. Sir! You can let go now. We're in the lobby. Lobby, Lobby, lobby, lobby. Oh, my god! Oh, my god, Adrian! - Adrian, are you all right? - I'm fine. Where's Benjy? Don't, don't worry. He's with my sister. No, don't confirm anything or deny anything until I get there. Nothing wrong with him, huh? First dates are always tough. - How was your night? - Not much better. I ate pizza with Benjy and saw the first 30 seconds of that TV special. - What special? - The one with Willie nelson. Remember, we tried to watch it monday night? I swear to god, somebody at that power company doesn't want me to see it. The blackout was at 9:15. What kind of show starts at 9:15? I don't know. There was a movie on before it. Maybe it was just really long. - what are the odds of that? - Adrian. Two blackouts three days apart at different times interrupting the same show? - What are you doing? - You were right. Somebody doesn't want you to see that TV special. That's what this whole thing has been about. Willie nelson? The explosive device appears to be identical to the first bomb. We are assuming this is the work of the same individual or group. There will be another statement at 6:00 A. M. If I have anything before then, I will let you know. Thank you. - Michelle. - Hello, Gene. How was your date with the detective? Don't you have anything else to worry about, Gene? I overheard some cops talking, and the reason that he was kicked off the force. He's off his rocker. Maybe so, but he's about to solve this case. - Really? - He's very close. They're going to make an arrest anytime. Maybe tomorrow. Oh, great. We've been waiting for this. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Sharona, is that it? Is it the copy of the TV special? Yeah. I'll finally be able to see it. - What is that? - It's night-vision goggles. I bought them after the first blackout. - How do I look? - Like the fly. Oh, well. It'll be dark. We're on tape at the Miranda auditorium in San francisco. It's the bicentennial jamboree with special guest Wille nelson. You can fast-forward. I want to watch it. Sharona, it is so late. I've got to go to sleep. If I don't get my 45 minutes, I can't function. Since when do you function? - So what are we looking for? - I'm not sure, but I'll know it when I see it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, push play, push play. I think this is it. - Oh, my god. - Unbelievable. It's that engineer from the power company. what's his name? Gene - Edelson. - Edelson. Gene edelson. Except his real name is Winston brenner. - The fugitive? - Of course! Michelle mentioned that Edelson liked country music. Okay, freeze. Freeze frame. Look at his face. He obviously never expected to be on camera. Wait, wait, he he blacked out the whole city twice to keep people from seeing this concert? He was supposed to be dead. He was afraid somebody watching would recognize him. What, what is - Lobby, lobby, lobby - What My god, my god why would he do this again? The show's not on TV. I - Ouch! Ouch! - Oh, my god! - What is it? What? What? What? - It's not a blackout. - It's only your block. - Oh, that's bad. That is bad. - That's bad. - Oh, god. Captain, hey, it's Sharona. Listen to me. I'm at Adrian's house, and somebody just cut off his power. We think it's Winston. Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, god. The line's been cut! I cannot find my night-vision goggles. There is a fatal flaw in the night-vision goggle plan. Adrian, he's breaking in. I hear him Where's my broom? - Oh, god, will you forget the broom? - But the broken glass. Forget the glass! We got to get out of here! Adrian Sharona? Sharona? Too smart for your own good, Mr. Monk. You should have let sleeping dogs lie. Where do you think you're going? I'm not done with you yet. - Sharona. - OhAdrian. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You're okay. No, no. Just stay there. Don't try and move. - You've got to get out of here. - Shh. Don't worry about me. I'm wearing the goggles. - Yes. - Monk? You can't hide from me forever. I'm over here, Winston. Or am I over here? Be careful. Your left shoe lace is untied. How did you know that? What's going on? Boo. Hey! Get those lights back on now! Maybe I'm a ghost. - You can see me, can't you? - Yeah. - The lights are on, aren't they? - Yep. - Brenner! - Sharona, you okay? Drop the knife. Lieutenant, these are night-vision goggles. Turn the lights back off. I'll have the advantage. Turn them off! Yeah, we could do that or we could just arrest him. Okay. Yeah. All right. Just arrest him. Yeah, let's. Winston brenner, you're under arrest. Give me your other hand. You have the right to remain silent. I suggest you do so. As you know, Winston brenner, also known as Gene edelson, was indicted this morning in federal district court. The San francisco power company would like to thank the ATF, the FBI, and the local police for their dedication and professionalism. We especially would like to thank former detective Adrian Monk, who was instrumental in bringing this fugitive to justice. Thank you. Thank you. Adrian? - Don't worry, I didn't come to ask you out again. I, I wanted you to have these a dozen roses. You deserve all 12. But they're all different. They're your problem now. Ah, Adrian, you're such a sweet man. And whenever you work through whatever it is that you're working through, would you call me? You mean you, you'd go out with me again? - Sure. - But only on the ground floor. - Huh If I didn't have cooties, I'd kiss you right now. If you didn't have cooties, I'd let you. - Well, see you. - Bye."
"- Hey, baby. - Hey. Paul, what are you doing? It's a surprise. What is it? I don't like surprises. Mm, you're going to love this one, I promise. Come on. Where are we going? Tell me a clue. Is it in the garage? Okay, you want a clue? Here's a clue. A car. A new car. - Is it that convertible I want? - Maybe. I thought you were mad with me. How could anybody stay mad with you? You know, I would never really tell your ex-wife anything about your bank accounts. Of course you wouldn't. I say crazy things because I love you. I love you, too. - Can I take it off? - No. Not yet. Okay. Now. I don't understand. - There is no surprise. - Sure there is. MONK Season 3 Epi. 04 Mr. Monk gets fired Okay, everybody, listen up. You all know my wife Karen. - She's making a movie. - A documentary, Leland. This is cinema verite. Right. It's for public television. Um, about me. It's about all of us. Behind the scenes at a typical detective division. The department figures it'd be a good idea, good P. R. Just be yourselves. Just pretend that we're not even here. Chambers. Good work on that robbery in north beach. - You really nailed them. - I hope so. I hate those punks. Uh, we don't hate. No, we don't really hate anybody. We, um we try to understand them. the, uh, underlying causes, the, uh particularly the minorities. Captain, we got the prelim on that fire from the hair outlet. - Looks like arson. - That's what I thought. Yes, sir, you were right, again. I don't know how you do it you and your hunches. Uh, what does the fire marshal have to say? Two points of origin. And the test for artificial accelerant came back negative. Uh, positive. Could I, shall I go back and do that again? No, that's ok. Uh, the question is why would anybody torch a wig factory? Does anybody have a motive? Probably the owner, for the insurance. That's an interesting theory, Randy, but, uh, the, uh the guy's dead, right? He died in the fire. Right. I forgot that. - Yeah. - Am I interrupting something? Commissioner. No, what a pleasant surprise. I'm sure it is. What's going on? Oh, uh, they're filming a documentary about this division. - No kidding. - Yeah. Yeah, the, uh, public relations thought that it would probably be good P. R. To do an educational film. How about good police work? That's the kind of P. R. we need. - You're right. - Maybe it's a good thing, because at least now, there'll be a record of me telling you to get your priorities straight What were you just talking about? Uh, the, uh, fire up on 24th street, sir. - Oh, you mean this fire? - Yes, sir. You mean this story? Because I thought you might be working on this case. ""Body headless, police clueless."" What page is this on? - That's the front page. - That's right. Front page, page 22. Very important, not important. Press are all over us, nobody cares. What case do you think we should concentrate on, captain? - The torso case. - Good choice. And in case you forget, you can always rewind your tape and play it back. - Yeah. Commissioner! Is there a suspect in the torso murder? We're working on the case 24/7. It's our number one priority. Can you identify the torso? She's female, caucasian. That's all we know. The medical examiner will be issuing his own report in the morning. Do you have any new leads? The investigation's at a critical stage right now, and I don't want to do anything or say anything that might compromise it, but I will say this. we're going to find the monster who did this, and when we do, I can personally guarantee that he'll be taken off the streets forever. - That's it for today. - How about a motive, sir? You, wake up! Let's go! What the hell? Don't just stand there! Do something! - Are you okay, sir? - Why wouldn't I be? That's insane. Why would somebody steal your hat? How the hell do I know? College prank, maybe? - Was it valuable? - Forget the hat. We got bigger things to worry about, detective. - The torso case, remember? - Yes. I want you to go down to the M. E.'s office, sit on the autopsy, - and let me know where we are. - Yes, sir. Um, you remember Sharona fleming, Adrian monk. I've asked Adrian in as a consultant I thought a fresh pair of eyes Consultant? What the hell am I paying you for? I know Mr. Monk. Do you remember the last time we met, Monk? You were lying under oath about a friend of mine. - John marotta was a good cop. - Marotta planted that gun. - Well, that's a matter of opinion. - Well, not according to the jury. Don't touch me. As far as I'm concerned, Monk, You're coming into this with two strikes. - Understand me? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do. Why are you still here? I can't stand that smell. Disinfectant. - It doesn't bother you? - No, no. No, I like it. Victim is a female caucasian, All four extremities have been severed at a 45-degree angle, - posterior to anterior - She's older. - Pardon me? - She's at least 26. She was raised in one of the baltic states. Estonia, Latvia, probably Lithuania. Anything else? No, no, that's it. Except the killer was a mountain climber, very experienced, and, uh he's left-handed. You can tell all of that from this? Well, that scar on her upper arm is from a smallpox vaccination. It was common in the baltic states. They stopped vaccinating in 1978, so she had to have been born before then. - What about mountain climber? - The fiber rope and the knot. I believe it's called the prusik knot. Mountain climbers use it. And it's tied with the top loop facing right, so of course, he's left-handed. Of course. - Um - What? - Well, um, uh - Oh, my god. What did you do? There were, there were some crumbs in the, uh No, no My case files. - You've deleted all of them. - I'm sorry. Is it true? He deleted 10 years' worth of forensic files? Yes, sir. It was an accident. He's an accident. This is indefensible, captain. Look, the files were almost all backed up. They're trying to retrieve them now. I don't care. The man is toast. He'll never work for this department, with this department, or in this department again. - Oh. And I'm pulling his private license. - No, you can't do that. - It's already done. Commissioner Brooks Police work, detection, that's all Monk knows. If you do that, it will kill him. That's N. M. P. Not my problem. You You and I both know that this has nothing to do with a few deleted files. This is payback because he testified against your pal. Don't you second-guess me on this one, captain. Adrian monk's detective days are over. Now, do you want to tell him, or should I? No, I'll tell him. Sharona? - Yeah? It's your friend Mr. Monk. He's here again. Oh, god. Just hold on one sec, okay? He's out front. He's been there for an hour. Look, he's having a really tough week, okay? He just lost his job. Sharona, you know how I feel about you. You're the best nurse I ever trained, and you're welcome back anytime. But he's out there every day, just sitting there. It's kind of creepy. It's not creepy. He's just sad. And creepy. I guess he's both, okay? - I'll go talk to him. - Thank you. Would you like a cough drop? Cough drop? Here. Ah. Ah. Adrian, what are you doing? What are you doing? He, he was coughing, the poor guy. Come on. Here, take this. Take this. Are you okay? What are you doing here? Have you talked to Stottlemeyer? I called him this morning. The commissioner still hasn't changed his mind. Adrian, I know you're scared, but you can't keep following me around like this. I can't afford to lose two jobs in one week. - I just can't. - Where should I go? It's a beautiful day outside. Why don't you try taking a walk? But you just can't stay here. You're not allowed. You are not a patient. Actually, I haven't been feeling so good. Really? I think I'm may becoming down with something. I might have caught what he has. - So you want to be admitted? - Well Mm, then I have to take your temperature. - Okay. It's not that kind of thermometer. You know, I think I will take that walk. Thought so. Captain, we caught a break. - Swish. - Nice shot. Thank you. What do you got? I think we I. Ded the torso. We got a report of a missing person. Her name is Larysa zeryeva, Guess where she's from. Uh one of the baltic states. - Which baltic state? - Uh Estonia. Latvia. - Lithuania? - Lithuania. - Is there a DNA match? - No, that's the problem. We've got plenty of DNA from the torso, but we've got nothing to match it against. We can't find a sample from the missing girl. - Okay, well, who filed this report? - Uh Ellen harley. Zeryeva was her housekeeper. Get this. Mrs. Harley is sure that her ex-husband Paul is somehow involved in the disappearance. And guess what Paul was doing last summer. Lieutenant, I'm not guessing anymore. He was climbing Mt. Mckinley. He's a mountain climber. Monk nailed it. You and monk. Congratulations, sir. To both of you. But mostly you. Oh, oh, oh, and then - That's a leaf. - I know, but as long as you're here You think you're better than me, sitting there pointing at leaves? I used to make 210 grand a year. What, what happened? What happened? I'll tell you what happened. I made a mistake. I took a week off, and they realized they didn't need me anymore. Okay, Mrs. Harley, let's start again. When was the last time you saw her? I don't know. I mean I can't remember. This is very entertaining, captain, but, really, I got to get back to work, - so how much longer are you going to be? - As long as it takes, Mr. Harley. She's not here. For the 500th time, we had a fight, She left. She went home. - You killed her. - Who says? My ex-wife? Larysa zeryeva is alive and well. She called me three days ago from Paris. Check the phone records. We already did. Somebody called you from the Paris airport, but it wasn't her. Captain, Monk's here. - He's where? - He's outside in the garage. What's he doing here? I don't know. He's Monk. For god's sake, Monk, what are you doing here? Okay, look, you can't stay. The commissioner could be here any minute. If he finds you here, we're both out of work. This garage has been cleaned.. scrubbed with bleach recently. Yeah, you should see the house. It's like a hospital in there. You could almost live in it. - He's left-handed. - That's right. He's a left-handed mountain climber. - Is he the guy? - Oh, yeah, he's not only the guy, he's almost bragging about it. We got a boatload of circumstantial evidence, but the D. A. Will not move until we can I. D. The torso. Hey, Monk. - How you doing? - I'm doing great. Really? Monk was just leaving. What do you got? The ex-wife is absolutely She gave me these photos. Which one is the most recent? - The one with the short hair. - This one? Yeah, it's a month old. Should we publish it? Yeah, we might as well. Somebody might have seen something. - Right. - Excuse me, cap, you know, they're cutting up my carpet in there, and that's imported shag, man. Am I going to get reimbursed for that? Why don't you file a complaint with the county clerk? You killed her in here, didn't you? I know you. You're that detective Monk. Yeah, I've seen you on the news, man. I've seen your work, too, on a table in a forensics lab. Did you cut her up in here, too? I'll bet you did. Do you own a chain saw? No. But You have a spare blade for a chain saw and a space on your pegboard here for a chain saw, but no chain saw. Oh, I had one. It broke. I tossed it. - When? - I forget. You know how DNA works, Mr. Harley? All we need is a speck piece of fiber, piece of skin, a strand of hair that ties the torso they found to this house. You think your house is that clean, mister? You don't know the meaning of clean. So what are you saying? You forgot something. You made a mistake, and I'm going to find it. Roger that. The commissioner's here. He just pulled up. Monk, you got to go. Randy's going to take you out the back way. Come on. come on, come on, come on. I must've walked for two, maybe three hours. I don't even remember. I, I just found myself there at the crime scene. Well, it's understandable. You've been a detective for a long time. You can't just let that go. I never appreciated how much the job meant to me. I feel lost. Nothing fits. You know, maybe it's a blessing. An opportunity. One of my favorite expressions is when god closes a window, he opens a door. Do you believe that? Do I believe it's one of your favorite expressions? No. Do you believe that change can be a positive thing? Huh. I - I have a job interview tomorrow. - Really? - That's, that's wonderful. - It's Sharona's idea. It's at a magazine. They're looking for a fact checker. Perfect. You excited? I'm scared to death. It's my first job interview in 20 years. You're going to be fine. You just have to be your Myself? Why don't we practice right now? Okay? I'll be the personnel director. Who am I? You're you. Fine. Fine, I'll be me. Okay. Hello, Adrian. Thank you for coming in. Why don't you tell me a little bit about yourself? Well, I was married for seven years until a car bomb killed my wife. I've spent the last seven years trying to track down the people responsible for my wife's murder. - Do you have any hobbies? - I do. I spend my free time tracking down the people who planted the car bomb that killed my wife. Okay, Adrian, just a little pointer here. Maybe you don't have to keep mentioning the car bomb. Okay. I'll just say bomb. Captain? The commissioner is on line one. Uh I'm busy. I'll call him back. Right. Sir? Hi, yeah, he's a little bit busy right now. Could he call you back Yes, sir. Speaker phone. He wants us both to hear this. Commissioner, hi, I was just about to call you. Why? To tell me how you're screwing up the case? I have a press conference tomorrow morning. What can I tell them? Do we have a suspect? Not officially, sir. We still cannot link Paul harley to the torso. You can't find a single follicle or fiber? We're still at the house, sir. We're still looking. It's probably right under your nose. Where did you get your badge, captain? in a box of cracker jacks? Are you a police captain or not, hmm? Yes, I am, sir. Then act like one, or I'll find someone who will. Yes, sir, thank you. I'll talk to you later. I'm not even sure that was the commissioner. Randy, give me a moment here? You, too, boomer. Thank you. Honey So how do you think it's going? It's great. This is some of the best footage I've ever gotten. So, how do you think it's going? Karen, it was a big, big mistake. Then why did you agree to do it? Because you were relentless. You kept coming at me. And I, I guess I was flattered that you asked. Because I love you. But, honey, I have hit a wall with this case. I haven't got monk. I've got the commissioner all over me. It's embarrassing. Wait, is that thing on? It's all part of it, Leland. This is a documentary. Karen, please. Leland, this is the most important thing I've ever done in my entire life, and to stop now would destroy me, but if you want me to I will. No, it's okay. It's okay. Are you okay? I'm fine, thank you. The chair is a little wobbly. You'd think it would bother me, but it doesn't. Let's see, Adrian monk. When did you fill this out? Just now in the waiting room. But it's typed. No, ma'am, I, I used a pencil. This is the neatest handwriting I've ever seen. Thank you. Sharona said I should start off with a joke to break the ice. - Who's Sharona? - My nurse. - Do you like marmaduke? - Who? He's in the comics. He's a dog. But he's big. He's the biggest dog in the world. Today he got stuck in the doggie door again. And the man said, ""at least this time, he's facing the right way."" You can learn a lot from marmaduke. I think I just did. Mr. Monk, what would you say is your greatest strength? Oh. Mm my decisiveness. - Would you like another chair? - No. I'm fine. I'm normal. I'm a normal person. I see here you worked as a consultant for the police department. That must've been very exciting. Um, have you ever done any fact checking? Um, no, ma'am, unless you count this morning. What happened this morning? Well, Sharona took me to the library to look at some back issues of your magazine. I found a few mistakes. I page 32, ""the building was decimated."" Technically inaccurate. Decimate means ""to reduce by 1/10th."" - Deci-mate. - Wow. And you did all this this morning in the library. How many magazines did you read? One. Just that, just that one. One. Wow. It's a gift. And, and a curse. I can see that. Do you have any questions for me? Just, uh, yes. If, if I get the job, will this be my chair? Not while I'm here. Adrian? Adrian! Adrian. Are you okay? You know, I I, I've been worrying about you. Me too. Did you go on the interview? Was it that bad? It was pretty bad. Adrian, I am so sorry. But you know what? The most important thing is that you did it. So don't be so discouraged. I mean, there's a million other jobs out there. I got the job. What? I start on monday. $42,000 a year, plus a medical plan? Four weeks paid vacation and a dental plan? You got that on your, on your first interview? - How did you do that? - I don't know. Did you tell her that marmaduke joke? You told her that stupid joke, and now you have a medical plan? I'm sorry. Adrian, I didn't mean that. I'm really happy for you. Really. Congratulations. What's the problem? It's a great job. I had a great job. I was a cop. That's all I ever wanted to be. I couldn't fix the whole world. I knew that. But I could fix little pieces of it. One little piece at a time. Put things back together. Sharona, I, I need it. I need it. I miss it. - I miss it so much. - Hey. I miss it, too. It's, it's gonna kill me. Every time I watch the news or read a newspaper or I'm gonna wish I was there. Even a stupid story like ""the mad hatter"" ""The mad hatter""? Yeah, remember somebody grabbed the commissioner's hat? Well, he did it again at a parking garage downtown. - Was it the same guy? They don't know. He got away. But at least he got his hat back this time. Well, he grabbed the commissioner's hat twice and dropped it? He, he didn't want it? - What? - I just solved the case. Wait, wait, wait, you figured out who grabbed the hat? The other case, the big one. The torso murder and the commissioner's hat. - They're both connected. - They are? Sharona, they're gonna have to rehire me. They're gonna have to. - Adrian, what are you doing? - I solved the case! Yeah, I know, but What are you doing? I'm happy. I'm doing a jig. - That's not a jig. - What is it, then? You know what? I don't know. And I don't wanna know. I'm back, baby! I'm back! Where's the captain? He said it was urgent. We're in here, commissioner. What's going on? - What's he doing here? - He's here as my guest. We have an arrest warrant for Paul harley. It's all filled out and ready to roll. So you finally found some DNA. - You can finally identify the torso. - Yes, sir. So, what are you waiting for? We're waiting for you, commissioner. Why are you smiling? You'll find out soon enough. Mr. Monk why don't you tell us why we're all here? Paul harley killed his girlfriend Larysa zeryeva. He cut her up and dumped her body into the bay. He cleaned his house. He scrubbed, he dusted. He wiped away any trace of her until she disappeared. And then he must've found something, a piece of paper that scared him half to death. Well, what was it? It was a receipt from the hair outlet on 24th street. They make wigs from human hair. Larysa had very long hair. A month before she was murdered, she cut it all off. We all saw the picture. She sold her hair to a wigmaker. - Lots of women do that. - The hair outlet. - Isn't that the place that - That burned down last week. - That's right. - Harley was in trouble. He knew there was a wig out there somewhere made from Larysa's hair a wig full of her DNA. He had to get it back before we tracked it down. So he broke into the hair outlet, killed the owner and he rifled through the sales receipts until he found what he needed. And then destroyed the evidence. Ortried to. We got lucky. Some of the records survived the fire. We know who bought Larysa's hair. So, who is it? Where's the wig? It's not a wig. It's a toupee. Hmm. It's your toupee, sir. A toupee. Your toupee. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Come on, it's a rug. - What, are you gonna deny it? - I don't wear a toupee. It was Paul harley that was grabbing your hat. Except he wasn't after your hat. - He was trying to grab your - Head doily. - I can see it from here. - This is my own hair. You mean you would let a murderer a man who killed two people in cold blood walk because, because you refuse to admit that you're wearing a piece? I get it. You're trying to embarrass me in front of the camera. Nobody's trying to embarrass you, commissioner, but I am going to rip that hairpiece off of your head. It is a critical piece of evidence. You wouldn't dare. - Are you sure? - 100% Are you finished? Okay. The answer isyes. You, my friend, are finished in every sense of the word! Aah, get off me, get off me! Get her off me! You said it was right under our noses. Lieutenant. I think the lab is looking for that. You can edit this out, right? This doesn't have to be in the movie. Well, I don't know, commissioner. It's a pretty amazing scene, you know. I'd hate to lose it. What can I say? It's cinema veite. Isn't there anything I can do? Actually, commissioner, there is one thing. Do you remember my friend Adrian monk? And action! Cover the back. - Keep your eyes open. - Yes, sir. Paul harley? Open up. San francisco P. D. Good morning, Paul. Step out on the porch, please. I have a warrant here. A warrant here for your arrest for the premeditated murder of Larysa zeryeva. Lieutenant, take this piece of garbage downtown. With pleasure. You're under arrest, Mr. Harley. - Get him outta here! - Let's go. You know, captain, it's moments like these that I remember why I joined the force. I realized that's where I belonged. I belong behind the badge. Nevermind. Lieutenant, just go downtown. Book him. What did you think? - You're a star. You're my star. - Thank you. - That was great. - Thanks. Good versus evil it's just more of a constant struggle between right and wrong. Good and evil, it's the oldest struggle in the world. Am I afraid of dying? Everybody dies. Dying is just a part of living. But when I go, I'm gonna go with my badge held high and then to my house justified because it's my life. My life behind the badge."
"Oh, yeah. People try to tell you it's not a same thing. But it is. You gotta go. Spring training's like a real baseball. You know, like it used to be. when we're kids. Grown up. Have a seat. You're on deck. And kids love it. They can sit up close to meet ball players. I can see the ballpark from the back patio. Nice. Hey, hey, hey, watch what you're doing, would you? I'm counting here. - I'll be right back. - Take your time. What the hell are you doing? MONK Season 3 Epi. 05 Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather - How's it look? - Not so good. - It's your suspension. - What? Again? You you just fixed my suspension three months ago. Yeah, that was your struts and your shocks. This is the, uh, tie bars. What the hell is a tie bar? It connects your, uh, steering knuckle to the center link right there. Can you see that? Tell him about that noise your radio keeps making. That's my music. So you think I can drive it? Oh, not like this. It's a death trap. What do you think? Well, that death trap thing sort of concerns me. I think he's yanking my chain. I mean, what am I going to do? I can't fix this myself. Maybe I can take a look at it. I'm, I'm pretty handy. Remember that one time? Norm, you win. How much? $900? Where the hell am I supposed to get $900? I haven't even seen a check from my ex in four months. How are we going to get home? Well, I guess we're going to have to walk. We could call a taxi. Taxis cost money. - Are you going to pay for it? - I guess we'll walk. - Ah. - Whoa. Uh, excuse me. Adrian monk? - Yes. - I'm Tony lucarelli. This is Vince, my, uh Associate. My associate. Look, if it's not too inconvenient, my uncle would like to talk to you about a possible job. - A job? - Uh, Lucarelli as in Salvatore lucarelli? You've heard of him. That'll make his day. No, thank you. Um Oh, oh. It's, is that the right time? We're already late. Uh, we've got, we've got that bris. Whoa. Whoa. This is a job. We can't afford to walk away. We can't afford not to. Sharona, Sal lucarelli is the boss of bosses. He's the, he's the west coast godfather. - So what? - So what? You'd take their money? People who have 110,000 miles on their car can't be picky. Fine. Fine. You go talk to him. I'll meet you back at the house. Mr. Monk you want my advice, I'd listen to your friend here. She's as smart as she is pretty. It'll only take 20 minutes. I'm saying please. All right, pretty please. With a cherry on top? With a cherry on top. - Vince. - Come on. Uh, no, not, not, not in the back seat. Wait, wait, wait, Vince, he has a thing about back seats. Everybody sits in the back. Uh, Mr, Mr. Monk. You can ride in the front with Vince. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. - Come on. Well, I guess that just leaves you in the back seat with me. - Are you scared? - Are you? Mr. Monk, thank you for coming on such short notice. It means the world to me. Oh, he does this all the time. He doesn't mean any disrespect. I understand. I got blood on my hands. Yes, you do. I'm supposed to be in pebble beach. Instead I'm here preparing for a wake. Did fat Tony tell you about the job? My sister's boy Ernie got killed yesterday, plus four of my friends. Good friends. Barbershop massacre, right? Yeah, massacre, That's the word. I checked around, Mr. Monk. and other detectives, good detectives told me you were the best. Called you a legend. I'll pay you three times your usual fee if you tell me who's behind this. Oh. I'm sorry. I, I I can't help you. Can't? or won't? My family is hurt, Mr. Monk. And angry. I understand how you feel more than you know. They're screaming for vengeance. They want me to strike out at one of the chinese gangs or the russians. I don't want to make a mistake. I'm trying to prevent a bloodbath here. Mm. I'm sorry. I'm very very, very, very sorry. I'm very, very, very sorry. You know, why don't we just sleep on it? Then maybe Mr. Monk will reconsider. Yeah, fat Tony's right. Let's all think about it. Oh, Mr. Monk Are you right-handed or left-handed? I'm right-handed. But I, I use my left hand, too. Almost every day. Yeah, you used your left hand this morning. Right. That's right. I'm ambidextrous, really. Yeah, well, why don't you think about that, too? This conversation is over. Oh, he's a charmer. - Sharona? - I'll be right there. I love you both. I'd never let anything happen to you. - I, I love both my hands. - Good. Even though I don't use my left hand as much, - I, I still love it. - Okay. - Let's try a different restaurant. - Thank you. It was great talking to you. I feel better. Agent Colmes. Mr. Monk, how are you? Get in the van. - I'm, I'm waiting for Sharona. - Well, you can wait in the van. - She won't know where I am. - Oh, we'll tell her. Just get in the van, please. Don't make me say it again. I can't, uh, I, I can't sit in the back. There's no other seat. Really, I am not playing favorites here. I, I just told the mafia, the, the same thing. You can ask them. Yeah, that's really adorable. In the van now. Get in the van. I'm getting in, I'm getting in, I'm getting in. Look, just for the record, I'm, I'm using my left hand. That's fascinating. Get in the van. The government can't help but wonder what you were doing with Salvatore lucarelli and his underboss fat Tony. Excuse me. Why do they call him fat Tony? Uh, because he used to weigh 250 pounds. Oh, my god. Is this the same guy? / Mm. f Now, the Lucarelli family's been under surveillance by a joint ATF/FBI task force for the last three months. - Is this the barbershop? - That is right. That was taken a week ago, right before the massacre. Now, had we stayed there one more day, we would have been able to see the whole thing go down. Excuse me. What does he weigh now? Okay, you know what? I have no idea. Mr. Monk, you still haven't answered my question. What the hell were you doing there? Salvatore wanted to hire me. Well, that's excellent. What'd you say? Well, I told him I'd see him in hell first. But not in those exact words. - We'd like you to take that job. - No. No, if I take that job and I I. D. the killers, Salvatore will go ballistic, and he'll wipe them all out, and I, I couldn't live with myself. Mr. Monk, you're ignoring the big picture here. This is an incredible opportunity. No one's ever been inside the family before. You can get us the evidence that we need to bring the whole entire family down. Hey, I showed them my I. D. downstairs. I just gotto talk to my friend. What, are you reaching for your gun? If you're reaching for your gun, you'd better pull it or step aside. Monk. Hey. Colmes. What do you think you're doing? Okay, this is a federal operation, captain. You have no business being here. Well, neither does he. What's going on? They want Adrian to go undercover and look Lucarelli family. What's up with this picture of you and fat Tony? Nothing, and don't call him that. You're defending him? Why don't you start by telling them what happened to the last agent that tried to infiltrate that family? Oh, start by telling them where they found the body buried. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Buried? - Actually, the parts that they found. Okay, that's a different situation. That agent's cover was blown. Monk's been invited in. They already know he's a cop. - But I'm not a cop. - Well, you could be if you help us out. What? What? Hang on. Whoa, whoa. What's going on here? What do you mean? Monk, he's playing you. Just walk away. No, wait, no. I want to hear this. What, what, what are you saying? What I'm saying is is that if you do me this favor this one little tiny favor I will call the police commissioner the next time you're up for reinstatement. Come here. Monk, I know this son of a bitch. He's not to be trusted, okay? You could go get yourself killed, he would not so much as bat an eye. He's right. It's too dangerous. But what, what if it was you, and you didn't have this, and you wanted it back? I'll do it. I'm your I'm your man. Good. There was a witness eating lunch across the street around 11:45. He saw three guys walk in here. They stood here, rat-a-tat-tat, like fish in a barrel. Must have been horrible. This barbershop was being used by Salvatore and his crew as a front for a numbers game they were running out of this back room. - What's this? - Your friend fat Tony, it's his life story. There was 7 grand on that table. Two indictments? That doesn't mean anything. It means he got lucky. Look, I know why you're attracted to him. I get it. You think he's dangerous. Some people think I'm dangerous. Yeah, people driving behind you. The ballistic report says, and special agent Colmes concurs, that all five victims were killed with the same weapon, an Ingram MAC-10. Three killers, but only one gun? Yeah, maybe they took turns. - The money was still here? - Yep, 7 grand. Why wouldn't they just take it? It wasn't a robbery. These people don't send e-mails to each other, Monk. This is how they send a message. - What's this? - From the gumball machine. The killers must have ripped it out. Yeah, they used it to break the window in the back. That was their only way of escape, because there were two uniforms out front. - Randy. - Hmm? Right. Sorry. Evidence. Yes, it's evidence. It's also been on the ground. Yeah, you're dangerous. Hey, Monk you can still back out. This is not your case. - It is now. - He's just using you. I'm using him, too. I don't remember you testifying for me when you had the chance. That's right, because I knew that you weren't ready. Somebody was sitting right here doing this crossword puzzle. Aah. Didn't finish. I hate that. Well, whoever it was, he must have left before it went down. But why wouldn't he take it with him? To to finish. Maybe it wasn't his. No, this is the barbershop copy here. This had to have been his copy. He must have been working on this unfinished puzzle for a while. If I was almost finished with a difficult crossword, I'd, I'd take it with me. Wouldn't you? To finish? No. Tell me about the witness. Uh, his name's Philip bedard, - Is he reliable? - I hope so. He works at the U. S. Mint. I can't believe you just said that. Well, you don't even know me. Yeah, okay. Okay. I'll call you later. Bye. - That was Tony. - Fat Tony? He's not fat. You know, he asked me out on a date, and, uh I told him I'd think about it. Sharona, you know what kind of man he is. Yeah, but that's what I like about him. Look, I, I know you always want to check out my dates and find out what's wrong with them, but at least with Tony, I already know he's a criminal. I mean, I can't be surprised. I've been surprised enough, you know? Well, as long as that makes sense to you. Is everything all right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Hey, Vince. Vince, you know, you, you don't have to follow us around. If we have something to report back to you, I, I promise we're going to call. Uncle Sal told me to keep an eye on you. - It's for your own protection. - It's a little insulting. I haven't needed a babysitter since I was 19. You had a babysitter when you were 19? Everybody did. It was the late '70s. It was a crazy time. Mr. Monk, Ms. Fleming, I'm Phil bedard. Oh, hello. Thank you so much for seeing us. Yes. Thank you. - This is, uh - Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. Uh, this is, uh, Vince. He he's our friend. - Do they really make money here? - Yes, they do. This is the second-largest mint in the country. You got any free samples? That's funny. I've never heard that one. Anyway, sorry to keep you waiting. It takes forever to get through security these days after last week. - What happened last week? - We came up 5 cents short. - All this for 5 cents? - Well, they weren't just any 5 cents. They were five coins that were accidentally misstamped. Heads on both sides. Hmm. Were they valuable? Maybe to a collector. There's a lot of nuts out there. You can say you got a license to print money. Yeah, and that is original as well. A 4-letter word for infatuation. - Are you any good at these? - Nope. Can't do crossword puzzles. So you witnessed the massacre, right? Uh, not exactly. Like I told the police, I was across the street. I saw three men go inside, and then I heard the gunshots. Don't look now, but we're being followed. Don't look back, I said don't, didn't I? - Where is he? - Black leather jacket. He's been following us since we left the Mint. - I'll take care of him. - No, it's okay. He works for the Mint. Just ignore him. They follow employees at random as we leave the building. Now you got two babysitters. These, these three men that you saw, what, what did they look like? I never got a good look at their faces. - I'm sorry. - What were they wearing? Uh, jackets. One, one guy had number 15 on the back. - Like a ballplayer? - No, uh - it was, it was written funny. - Written written funny. Like like this? - Did it look like this? - Maybe. Yeah. Chinese gang. The Tongs, that's their symbol. Yeah, now that you mention it, they, they could have been asian. But everyone else is going. Benjy, I told you, money is tight right now. - We can only afford basic necessities. - This is a basic necessity to me. It's a theme park. It costs an arm and a leg just to walk in. Look, I'm sorry, okay? Maybe next time. - Sharona fleming? - Mm-hmm. - Thank you. - Sure. Well looks like you're going. - Your father sent us a check. - For how much? For everything, plus four months in advance. What's that? - Hey, Norm. - It's good as new. Actually, it's better than new. I left the keys under the mat, okay? - You take checks? - Uh, no charge. No charge at all. It was my pleasure. My pleasure. Now, I've got to get back to the garage, so you have a really nice day, okay? Okay? See you later. Bye. Wow, you must have a fairy godmother or something. Who's that? My fairy godmother. VYou know, I'm, I'm really glad that your boss changed his mind about helping my uncle Sal. How's it going? Oh, it's going good. Really good. We have a couple of leads. The, the guy at the Mint, uh do you think he's involved? Well, we checked him out, and he has no mob connections at all. No motive. Did you really lose 55 pounds? You know, it was easy. I just got used to being hungry. I, I realized that no food tastes as good as being thin feels. Except for this. You know what? I really think you should talk to your uncle about your nickname. It, it doesn't fit you anymore. I thought about it, but Uncle Sal is from another century, you know? - He's kind of set in his ways. - Yeah. I get the feeling Mr. Monk's the same way. Well, he's either from another century or another planet. I can't decide. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. How did you get my ex to send me a check? I just called him up, had a little chat. - I can be very persuasive. - No, I, I was just afraid that, um That what? That I'd hurt him? Come on, Sharona. Who do you think I am? - That's a good question. - Well, I'm not my uncle. Okay? I just run some errands for him, you know, to pay my tuition. I'm going to night school, Sharona. By this time next year, I will have my MBA. Really? / Yeah, I'm going to hopefully have my own business. Oh. Doing what? - Okay, promise you won't laugh. - Oh, of course not. - I really want to open a bookstore. - Bookstore. Okay, you sound a little disappointed. What, you, you'd prefer me to be a real badass, you know, a gangster, like you see on TV, huh? No. I'm not disappointed. Not at all. Uh, yeah, um, excuse me. We're looking for Jimmy lu. Um, you, you speak english? Send them in. - Mr. Lu. My name is Adrian. - I know who you are, Mr. Monk. I know who you're working for. I also know you've been asking people about me. - Why? - Um, is this your jacket? That's right. / Yeah, well, a man was seen wearing a jacket like this in Salvatore lucarelli's barbershop just before the murders. It wasn't me or my crew. Someone's lying or setting me up. Excuse me, um, I've been working on this puzzle. Maybe you can help me out. Blank, Jaworski It's, uh, four letters. - Any, any ideas? - 98 No. Sorry. Uh, are you, are you stopping? Are you stopping? You just, you did 99. - You can't just stop. - Why not? Well, it's not, it's just. it's not right. - Why don't you do one more? - 99 is plenty. 99 is my record. Uh, Mr. Lu, have you ever been to Salvatore's barbershop? Let's just make it an even 100. Come on, one more. one more. - Sharona, give him a little boost there. - I'm not giving him a boost. - How many can you do, Mr. Monk? - I don't know. But I know this. if I ever did 99, I, I wouldn't stop. I'd dig down, deep down. All right. I'll do one more. Because you're a friend of Salvatore's. Tell Salvatore I'm sorry about what happened. It's bad business. Bad for everybody. No. No. You just did two. Why did you do that? Now he's gotta do 99 more. Now you have to do 99 more. I'm just, I'm exhausted. Look out! Well, congratulations, Mr. Monk. You just about started a mob war. What about them? your undercover agents? They were almost killed in that fire. Please, no, they weren't. My shirt was singed. You saw it. It was all singed. My sleeve why did you tell Salvatore that you thought the Tongs were behind the barbershop massacre? - You knew he'd go ballistic. - We didn't tell Salvatore anything. Whoever, then! Vinnie spaghetti obviously heard you talking about it. I'm not so sure Salvatore had anything to do with this fire. A molotov cocktail doesn't really seem like his style, does it? Really? Then who was it then? Who was it? Don't know. Hey, this has been oodles of fun. Sorry it didn't work out. We're outta here. Thanks very much. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just, we could use this, all right? What if you get Salvatore to admit - on tape that he ordered the attack? - On tape. What, you want him to wear a wire? Are you insane? If Salvatore finds a wire on him, - he'll slit his throat. - Or he'd have fat Tony do it. He's not fat. If you do this, it won't just be me supporting your reinstatement, all right? It'll be the attorney general. Okay, okay. Here's the thing. I can't have anything taped to my chest. Oh, that's fine. Come here, let me show you this. Uh, you see, these days we can put a transmitter just about anywhere on the human body. We have six options. Number one is out. Number two uh you wouldn't actually shave me there, would you? Okay. No thank you. Number three what if you have to sit down? Right. Good point. Number four Even if I die, don't let them do number four. - Number five. - I'll do. okay, I'll, I'll try that. That's only for women. - Oh, right. - Oh, yeah. Uh, number six. Number six, I can do that. - Number six? Great. - Not four. Don't touch that, please. - Randy. - Sorry. - Hey, Joey. - Hey, Sal. Thank you for coming. - He was a sweet kid. - Yes, he was. I gave him his first job, collecting for me after school on his bicycle. I remember. I was there when he stole that bike. Testing. Testing, testing Leave it alone. Mr. Monk, Sharona. I'm so glad you could come. Well, we're so sorry about your loss. Uh, how was the service? It was heartbreaking. I'm gonna have to frisk you. - You understand. - Oh, sure. - Mm - Mr. Monk. - That is a very nice tie. - It's mine. I've had it for years. Well, uh, who's next? You're very thorough. - Please. - Adrian, Sharona. - Thank you for coming. - Salvatore, how you holding up? I buried five good men today. But I'll survive. I always do. It's my curse. You're missing a knife. It's not missing. I know where it is. - Try this scungilli. - No. Uh, no, no thank you. - I made it myself. - Oh, I'd love some. Thank you. Octopus. I must have this recipe. You didn't even taste it. - Oh, this is delicious. - I must, I must have this recipe. So, um, so, Salvatore, um, I guess you heard about the, uh, the firebombing in, in china town. - You just nodded. Yes? - Right. You have any theories about who might havemight have done that? Theories? Theories are for smart guys like you. I don't need theories. I know who did it. A couple of kids from L. A. A couple of wannabes trying to impress me. I took care of them. So you didn't do the firebombing. When I want Jimmy lu dead, believe me, he'll know it. Hey, Luigi. What? Uh, what is that? Get on that now. Right, right, try this. - Wait, wait, I think I got it. I got it. - What, what, what? - It's still there. It's there. - Now it's a water stain. It's gone. There's something bothering me about this case. I can't put my finger on it, but I would love to get back to that barbershop. I'll go with you. I haven't been back since it happened. Oh, well, you know, it's an official crime scene. They don't let civilians in. Maybe they'll make an exception. I'll make a call. Okay, but you'd be wasting your time. Cause they never let any anybody in. What's he doing? Thinking. Brainpower, do you see that? That is the way to solve a problem. Maybe we ought to try more of that. Fewer people to bury. The mystery man is here, doing the crossword puzzle. They grab the gumball machine run out the back they could have grabbed anything. Why the gumball machine? Why the gumball machine? - Sharona. The crime scene photos. - Here. Mr. Lucarelli, can I say something? Your nephew Tony here is in really great shape. - Oh, come on, Sharona - I mean, he's lost a ton of weight, and he kept it off, which is really the hard part, so Don't you think he should have a different nickname? Uncle Sal, I didn't say anything. He's always been fat Tony ever since he was a kid. Yeah, I know, but look at him. What about big Tony? - That's pretty close. - We already got a big Tony. - Who? - Big Tony. This conversation is over. In fact, it never happened. Oh, that's a shame. - It's not here. - What, what's not here? The gumball machine. Well, they used it to smash the window, then took off down the alley. I know, but where is it? These pictures were taken that morning. But it's not in the street. It's not in the back room. They must have taken it with them. Why would they do that? Salvatore, sir, what happened here, these murders, had nothing to do with you or your family. It was all about these. Gumballs. Gumballs? Hey, Phil, how you doing? Remember us? You said you didn't like crossword puzzles. I thought I'd try one. Pretty good. Greek vowel, four letters, beginning with ""I."" - lota. I, O, T, A. - Thank you. I like puzzles, too. I've been working on a pretty tough one. It involves you, Mr. Bedard. That's you, isn't it? It was taken in front of the barbershop the day before the massacre. Maybe. That's a pretty big bubble, Phil. You must've bought, what, four, maybe five, gumballs? It was five. Five gumballs. Here's what happened You stole five cents from your employer last week. On any other job, no one would miss it. Of course, you work for the U. S. Mint. They were those five double-headed pennies. We did a little research. They're worth $200,000 each. One of their security guards must've followed you. You panicked. You had to get rid of those coins. You needed to hide them for a day or two, but where? The gumball machine. It was perfect. You figured you'd come back when the coast was clear and pick them up. But you had no idea that the barbershop was a front for the mob. You found out, though. The next day, when you tried to steal the machine. - I'll be right back. - Take your time. So was it the barber that tried to stop you? Or maybe it was a customer. What the hell are you doing? Whoever it was, they had a gun That you somehow managed to grab, and then all hell broke loose. All for five pennies. That's a penny for every person you killed. Then you said you witnessed the attack so that you could steer everyone, me, the cops, the Lucarelli family toward that gang in china town. I didn't want to hurt anyone. Those idiots pulled out their guns. It was an accident. Things just got out of hand. Anyway, who's going to miss them? They're gangsters like you said. Well, accident or not, you're going to jail. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How are you going to prove any of this without the pennies? - Did you get that, guys? - What are you doing? See that van over there? Okay, fellas. You can pick him up now. Hello. Here we go. Watch this. Let's go! Here we go. Now. - Excuse me. Just keep an eye on him. - Yeah, yeah. Why don't you finish your puzzle? What, what are you doing? He just confessed. / He did? - Didn't you hear that? - No. No, we got nothing but static. Your necktie, what happened to the stain? I finally got it out. - What did you do to the tie? - I washed it ironed it. Excuse me. Ironed it? Are you insane? That transmitter cost $20,000. - But the stain is out. - Great, great, we blew it. Maybe we can trick him into saying it again. Oh, really? How are we gonna do that? Well, I'll just go back there, sit down, and say What? It might be worth a try. Okay, okay, I, I did it! It was me! All right? I confess! - Just, just let me in! - Hey! I did it, all right? I stole it. I stole the pennies, and I shot the place up, so just arrest me. What are you waiting for? What the He's very persuasive. Sharona. You still seeing Tony? Yeah. So? I've been logging these surveillance tapes from last week. This is from Salvatore's car Tuesday night. I think you should hear it. So what's with you and the nurse? Just having a few laughs, you know me. Hey, get this. I told her I'm gonna open up a bookstore. You? I've never even seen you inside a bookstore. What was I gonna tell her, the truth? That I'm your enforcer, that I hurt people for a living? And she bought it? Hey, they always buy it. You know why? 'Cause I tell them what they want to hear. You okay? I'm sorry. Thanks, Randy. Maybe you won't make such fun of me all the time now, huh? No chance of that. So, Colmes, where are you going? Denver. Other fish to fry. What about Monk? You had a deal. The reinstatement hearing. Yeah, that was if we nailed Lucarelli. He's out playing golf today. We just nailed a trigger-happy coin collector, so the deal is void, captain. - You gave him your word. - The deal's void, captain. Let me tell you something, Colmes. Adrian monk may be afraid of milk and germs and elevators and puppies, but you, you couldn't pack that man's lunch. Uh, that's true, actually. I've seen that man pack a lunch. He's insane. It was great working with you, captain. - He's not gonna help me, is he? - No. I'm sorry. I guess I never really expected him to. Never trust a Fed. I should've decked him. No. Don't worry. I got him back. Really? What'd you do? - See their vans? - Yeah? One of them is packed full. The other one isn't even half full. They're uneven. I didn't tell him. I didn't say a word. I'm just gonna let them drive away like that. That'll teach him to mess with us. - Damn straight. - Yep."
"Do you want to wait here or meet me inside? Uh.. um.. II will say no. - Why don't you just come with me? - No.. uh.. down there? I'm not, not good with garage. It's so, garage like. Why do you have to go the bank? Why can't you just use one of those machines? - Because I lost ATM card. - I thought you just lost your check book. Yes. And I also lost address book. You'll stay here, I'll be back in 5 minutes, ok? Sharona. - Douglas is worried about you. - Oh, my god! We need a paramedic! He had multiple stab wounds. The parking garage on 10th and Van ness. - He's been stabbed? - Yes, I think he's dead! And he said my name. He's right over here. What? I'm telling you, he was right here! MONK Season 3 Epi. 06 Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf - Anything? - Captain, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I think I know whether or not there's a body in the room. - Hey, here you go. - Thanks. So listen, I got to file a report here. You understand, right? This man you saw he was, what, medium build, about 30 years old? Maybe 35. And he was wearing boots and a cowboy shirt. And he, uh, had a knife in his chest. Yeah, and a screwdriver in his ear. Flat head or Phillips head? Sorry. And this guy, he called you by your name. - Yep. I mean, did he say anything else? - ""Douglas is worried about you."" - ""Douglas is worried about you."" Who's Douglas? Douglas was my father's name. Well, where's he now? He's been dead for 20 years. The luminol tests are negative. There is no sign of blood. Well, maybe whoever killed the guy, cleaned up. What, in two minutes, and got rid of a body? Even you couldn't do that. Look at the windshield. Okay, what about it? There were four dead bugs on that windshield in the shape of a trapezoid. - A trapezoid. - Yeah. They've been there all day. Somebody wiped it off. Well, maybe she wiped it off. - Why would she do that? - You tell me. Look, Monk, you're the best on-site detective I know. Do you see anything here, anything at all besides the missing trapezoid bugs to corroborate her story? I'm not at my best in parking garages. Oh. Trudy. I'm sorry. Look, I don't know what to think. Sharona has been under a lot of stress. She's been losing things. She's been forgetting appointments. Maybe she needs some time off. - From what? - From you. Monk, that lady's got the most stressful job in North america. I know guys on the bomb squad, tough as nails, nerves of steel, that couldn't work for you. They'd have cracked four years ago. I'd say give her a break. A week off with pay. Send her home. There, case closed. Well, I can't believe you've never played dominos before. Me neither. That's the last one. We did it. Hold it. - Okay. - All right. - Good job. - Now the best part. - I know. I know. I've been waiting for this. Okay, on your mark Get set Go! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What, what are you doing? Putting them away. Hey, watch this. Two at a time. No, no, no. You're supposed to knock them down. What? - You're supposed to knock them over. No, no, wait, wait, wait, Benjy, Benjy, Benjamin. No, no, see, if, if you knock that one over, then they're all going to go. And then, then you have a giant mess. Thank god I was here. Let's put them away. This is fun. - But, you know Hey, hey. Let's put them away in order. - Here. Here's a 2 dotter. - Fine. Looking for all the 2 dotters. Hey, Benjy, listen, I'm going to be back in two hours, and there's no TV until you do your homework, okay? All right, now my my wallet keys the window. Adrian, can you get this window for me? - Because I'm, I'm running late. - Sure. - How's your class going? - Great. I used to write all the time in high school, but I, I think it's very important that I have a creative outlet, you know? Something to express myself. So, uh, when are you coming back to work? Um Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Really? - Yeah. Adrian, I really appreciate the time off. And, uh, listen I know you were worried about me, but it was so real. His face, the blood it's not going to happen again. All right. Benjy, be good. Listen to him, okay? - Okay. I can't believe she actually likes going to school. She stays up all night writing her stories. - What kind of stories? I don't know. She doesn't let me read them. I saw the name of one, though. - ""The fatal recipe."" - Yeah. I think it's a mystery. Stop! stop! Benjy, stop, stop it. stop it. Stop! Oh Stop! What have we done? Gandoroh watched the pilgrims of Zenlahf enter the valley below. He saluted them with his robotic right arm. In his left arm he held the cloak of invisibility, while he slipped his middle arm behind his back to pull the final arrow from his quiver. The end. Thank you, Billy. That was very vivid. - Any questions or comments? - Yeah, I got a question. Who do I see about getting the last 15 minutes of my life back? For your information, Varla, fantasy fiction is very hot right now, okay? For your information, you're delusional. You know what I do all day? I'm a nurse. I know sick when I see it, and this is one sad, sick, geeky puppy. Varla, please, no negatives. We are here to support each other and respect each other. Okay. Here are your papers from last week. Eddie, very good. Rita, love the metaphor. George, not bad. Varla A B-? Oh, we're going to have to talk about this. Okay, um, continue to work on your papers. Remember to write your first draft by hand. Just let it flow. I will see you all Wednesday. - Um, Ms. Preminger? - Yes? - I didn't get my paper. - Sharona, you didn't turn one in. What? Yeah, I did. I, I gave it to you on Wednesday. I was going to mention that, actually, but I just assumed you didn't finish and you'd turn it in later. No. no, no, no. I, I handed it in. I, you were looking at it. Did you check your car? Maybe it fell between the seats? No. I Sharona, are you okay? Oh, my god! You know, it's a confusing time, not just for you, but for everyone. It's hard to feel centered. These days, it's hard to even know where the center is. what are you feeling right now? Well, I feel weird being here like I'm trespassing. I bet those pillows must drive him crazy, huh? I'm not at liberty to say. Well, I see my window is cleaner than your window. That's got to be him. Sometimes I wish that we could switch seats, So I could get this window a little You, you said that, um, You've been, what, losing things, right? Besides my sanity? Look I thought I handed in a paper at school, and it turned out I didn't. That happens. Okay, well, last week I found a remote control in the freezer. are in the basement, And I haven't been down there in months. Are you next? I'm just waiting for a friend. I've never been here on Tuesday before. I'm here on Mondays And Fridays. And every other Wednesday. What do you think of the new white noise machine? I don't like it. It's half-decibel louder. Exactly. - Yeah. How do you feel when, when you lose something? Scared But I can't show it because of Benjy. Okay, what, what are you afraid of? That I'm falling apart like my father. Tell me about that. My father was a very active man. Because he owned a hardware store back in Jersey, and, um, one morning, he never came downstairs. He wouldn't get out of bed. He said he couldn't. He said he was too tired. And he never got out of bed and my mother had sold the store. - I'm sorry. - Everybody was sorry. And then he ended up in the hospital. Everybody called it a rest home, but I knew what that really was. So you know what? All, all I can remember was that, that his room was this ugly blue color, and that it smelled like fish, and that's where he died in that room. I was 12 at that time and Oh, that's how old Benjy is. I swear to god, if I have a breakdown, I am never going to forgive him. Your father? Adrian. Sharona, you're, you're not you're not saying that Adrian is responsible for this. You're a nurse. You know he's not contagious. Look, I am with him all day, and all I know is that I was fine before I met him. what are you doing? Just making them even two, two and two. - That's the way Dr. Kroger likes it. - Did he tell you that? I didn't think so. No, Dr. Kroger and I have a system. We, we arrange them by titles. I don't think so. So this is why I have to fix it every time I come in. I was just about to say the same thing. - Right up here. - Stop acting like a child now. You are being ridiculous. You are spiraling Not only do you have serious control issues, - you're a pathological liar. - Well, you are a fool. Because I know, I have known Dr. Kroger for a much longer time than you. Don't drop it on the floor! Well, now, now we have to throw it out. You're being ridiculous. This goes up here. - You're very selfish. - Harold, Harold Dr. Kroger, he keeps messing up our system. It has to be even. We always make them even. - You need help, buddy. - Adrian! Harold! When you're in your own homes, you can arrange everything just the way you'd like. This happens to be my office. If things are a little messy, I like it that way. I hope you'll both respect that. Harold, would you like to step in? I'll be with you in a minute. Yes, why don't you go in the office now? Adrian, I'll take care of it from here. Thank you. Harold, go in the office. I'll be there in a second. - Thank you, Harold. - I'll see you in hell, Harold. - Adrian. Sharona, that was a very good start. I'll see you on Thursday. Harold! Thank you. Adrian. - Thank you, doctor. - Thank you. How was it in there? I don't want to talk about it. I'm going to go wash up. You can get through this. You can get through this. Oh, my god. - Daddy needs you. - Oh, my god! Adrian, I He, he was right there. Look, Check the stall. - I, I'd rather not check the stall. - Check the stall! All right. I'll check the stall. Oh, god. I remember when bathroom walls were for phone numbers and dirty limericks. And funny drawings of your commanding officer. What drawings? Like that? I don't know. Maybe the eyebrows were a little bit thicker. Mm, like that. Maybe. I, I don't know. So what do you think? - I want to believe her. - Well, I want to believe her, too, but that's not what I asked you. I don't know. Maybe I'm too close to it, like I am with the Trudy case. - There is zero physical evidence. - There was the hook in the ceiling. We checked it, Monk. It was always there. There it is. Right there. This? Oh, that's a perfect match. What's that white stuff? - Plaster - from the wall. Well, now we know what ""help me"" means. Sharona Adrian I can't take care of you anymore. What? - Look, I have to take some time off, okay? Now, I just called a really good friend of mine who's a registered nurse, and she's going to fill in for me. What's she like? - Are you Adam? - Uh, no. Wait. Hold on. Anthony. - Adrian. - No, that's not it. Shoot, I can't read my own handwriting. It's Adrian. I'm pretty sure. Hold on. A, adrian. You were right. I'm Varla, Sharona's friend from her writing class. - She told you I was coming, right? - Well, um - uh - what are you looking at? My eyes are up here. I, uh, no. Uh, no, I wasn't What's a Monk doing looking at my breasts? I'm not a Monk. My name is Monk. My boyfriend teaches kickboxing. You don't want to be messing with me. - Uh, are you a nurse or - I'm not just a nurse. Honey, I'm your nurse. And I got to pee. Hold my note. Got to go make my bladder gladder. Not, not, not, no. No, please, don't. That, not really a public restroom. What do you want from me? I have a knife! Hey. You don't recognize your own ex-husband? Trevor. You scared me half to death. How did you get in here? You still hide your spare keys above the door. Well, you just can't come walking into my house like this, okay? I'm waiting for Benjy. - He called me. - Benjy called you? He said he was worried about you. Well, you're wasting your time. You should go back to Jersey. We're fine. Are you? I'm going to need a list of your meds and the proper dosages. - Don't take any medication. - What the hell am I doing here, then? I have, I just need a little help. - Doing what? - Everything. I'm hungry. What's in here? - Shoes? - No, that's my food. I keep it all airtight containers. It's in a certain order. It's color-coded. There's a chart on the inside of the door here. What's in this one? - Turkey? - That's for you. For me? You didn't even know I was coming. I know, but it's yours now. No meds, huh? Sharona wanted me to, to give you this. What's on? Adrian monk, care and feeding. Special diet, he's got phobias. Heights, germs, snakes, crowds, milk you're afraid of milk? How old are you, man? I got a 2 year old nephew who's not afraid of milk. - You must be very proud of him. - For what, not being afraid of milk? That just mean she's normal. You don't need this. Sharona's a good nurse, but she's been treating you like a baby. The party is over, Adrian monk, Because I'm going to treat you like a man. Don't do that. And since we're going to be together for two weeks, there's a few things you need to know, - No, no, no. all right? I get a hour for lunch by myself with a TV. Okay, by 5:30, what? In my car driving away waving goodbye. I get weekends off. Don't call me at home unless it's an emergency, which it won't be, so don't ever call me. - Yeah. - There you go again, - looking at my chest. - No, no, I'm Touch me again and I'm going to smack you so hard, even your children will feel it. - Now, where you keep the chips? - I don't, I don't have any children. Um, Trudy and I talked about it, but, uh Oh, shoot, there's a crumb. So how's Sharona, anyway? I, I don't know. Uh - I was just going to call her, though. - I'm worried about that girl. I have never seen anybody fall apart that fast. Really? - I used to work in the psycho wards. Nobody starts hallucinating overnight, unless they've been chewing on mushrooms. But with Sharona, there were no warning signs at all. It just doesn't make sense. - You're right. - I know I'm right. I don't need you to tell me I'm right. - What are you doing? - I want to check something out. That's what I do. You come with me. - What? - It's part of the job. I'm a detective, and you are my helper. I'm your what? - Ms. Preminger. - Oh, Sharona. Thank you for coming. I wanted to talk to you in person. Are you really dropping my class? Yeah. I'm sorry. Was, was it something I did or said? Oh, no, no, no, no. You, you've been great. I I just have some personal issues. Sharona, promise me that you will continue to write. You have such a unique voice, and I don't say that to everybody. That essay you wrote about your father - I cried when I read that. - Thanks. Well, if you go to the registrar's office, you might be able to get a partial refund on your tuition. Sharona? Sharona, are you okay? There's somebody outside the window. Where? You know, I'm I'm just really tired. Ms., Um, thanks for everything. You're going to have to take care of Benjy for a little while. - Since when? - Since now. Hey, don't give me that look. You didn't win anything. This isn't about custody. This is about what's doing best for Benjy right now, and when I'm feeling more up to it, he's going to come back with me. Right? She parks the car here. She gets out, come on. You be her. Screwdriver man appears. He walks toward her. What is it? Is that a clue? It's a silver tip from a cowboy boot. Sharona said he was wearing cowboy boots. Ooh, may it was Garth brooks. There. I solved the case. What? Am I right about Garth brooks? She wasn't hallucinating. He was here. - Wipe. - Wipe what? When I say ""wipe,"" you give me a handwipe. That's how it works. That's how what works? - It. You better get over it real fast. Is this home made? - Don't you have a class? - I'm taking the night off. - That's a first. - How would you know? You'd have to be paying attention to know something like that. Meredith let's don't start. Are you sick? No. But you are. In fact I'll be calling the paramedics in about 2 and half to 3 minutes. What for? Maxwell, You're going to have a heart attack. Right on time as always. Oh, he's dead. He's been dead for a long time. He just didn't know it. - This wine OK? - Oh, no. Wine's fine. It was just in the soup. To our partner, Sharona fleming. We couldn't have done it without her. Sharona! Great news! Hey, you're not going to believe it. What, what happened here? Nothing. It fell. What is it? Aw, let me help you. - What, what is it? - One second. Hey, coconut, you were talking to the lady. Finish what you were saying. - You're not crazy. -What? You are not crazy. You might want a second opinion. This man's not exactly an expert on not crazy. Why didn't you tell me he thinks he's Kojak? A friend has an obligation to tell another friend when somebody think he's Kojak. - I'm sorry. - What is all this paper? It's scrap paper. I use it for packing. - Well, it's all crumpled now. - It's supposed to be crumpled. He's not on meds? Honey, he was made for meds. Hey, let me do this. You talk to her. I went back to the garage. I found a boot tip. Kojak and I were very excited about that boot tip. There is a shoe repair shop on Lark avenue that replaced a tip on a cowboy boot last monday. The customer's name was Denny graf. Does it mean anything to you? - No. Well, he's a security guard at the community college. My college? That mystery story that you wrote, ""the fatal recipe"", what was the plot? Well, it's about a woman who kills her husband and makes it look like a heart attack. Mrs. Preminger canceled her class last night because her husband Max died of a heart attack. - Right after he ate some tomato soup. - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. That's my story. It, it's based on a real case when I was an intern. The teckolic acid in the tomato soup activates the poison. It's virtually untraceable. They stole my story! That's plagiarism! Yeah, well, actually, it's murder. Did you keep a copy of the story? Whoa, mom. are you okay? Yeah, I'm great, and you're not going to Jersey. Trevor, if you want to hang out here, that's fine, but, uh, Benjy's staying with me. He's not leaving. I'll be right back. What's going on? - Are you okay? - Yeah. This is Varla davis. She's my newsomething. How y'all doing? Are y'all pretend police officers, too? No, ma'am. We are real policemen. - What's so important? - I'm not crazy. It's true. A woman named Meredith preminger lives right there. She's Sharona and Varla's creative writing teacher, and last night she killed her husband. - And it was Sharona's idea. - No, it wasn't. Well, in a way, I Here's what happened. A month ago, Sharona wrote a murder mystery about a woman who kills her husband using a virtually untraceable poison. The story was a blueprint for a perfect murder, exactly what Meredith and her lover were looking for. But they had a problem. If they stole her idea, after he died, Sharona might become suspicious. Somehow they had to discredit her in advance before the murder. - So nobody would believe her. - Exactly. So Sharona started seeing things. - Like dead people. - And losing things. Yeah, they must have stolen the keys from my purse and made copies of them, and that's how they got into my house and moved everything around. Look, at 5:30, I am off the clock. I don't care if y'all are still looking for Waldo. I'm outta here. - So that's the new nurse. - Yeah. - How's that going? - Oh, I love her. Couldn't be better. Help me. - Ms. Preminger? - That's right. Excuse me, I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time. I'm captain Stottlemeyer. This is Adrian monk, lieutenant Disher, and I believe you know Varla davis and Sharona fleming. What's going on? Well, ma'am, there have been some questions raised about the death of your husband. By her? Captain, she's delusional. You can ask anyone. Meredith, is there a problem? God, that's, that's him. They want to talk to me about Max's death. It's not a good time. Maybe after the services on Saturday. You mean after the body's been cremated? You poisoned him, and you got the idea from that story I wrote. - Did I? - Yes. - Can you prove it? - Yes, I can. It's right here. This is my second draft. The fatal recipe. That's a good title. Help me, help me, somebody help me. Help me, please. - Help me now. - Shoot. You know this is going to affect our grade. Is there anything else? I didn't think so. They, they must have taken the real papers when, when they were in my house. They My fault. I should have read it first. Well, it couldn't have hurt. Sharona, has anybody else read your story? No, she told me not to show it to anyone. Would the poison show up in an autopsy? Probably, but no judge is going to order one without any evidence. Listen, there has to be something. There, there Oh, I know where there's a copy, a copy of your story in your own handwriting. - That's impossible. - Oh, it's possible, and I'll show it to you on three conditions. Number one, I'm not waiting two weeks. You taking him back today. Right now. The party is over. What are the other two conditions? Forget the other conditions. I want you to stay with her, Because y'all are a perfect team, - Sharona, Monk, and not me. - Deal. Where's the story? Mrs. Preminger always told us to write our first draft by hand, - something about feeling the words. - Right, but I threw it out. She told us to throw away our first drafts. Yeah, but you didn't. You used it as scrap paper and packing material. Kenny smiled icily. Don't worry about the police, he said. The teckolic acid in the soup is 100 % untraceable. - Just call me Mrs. Kojak. - Well, where were you? I, she makes me very nervous. Well, I'm going to have another talk with the grieving widow. Yes, you do that. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on, dishwater. I need you to take me home, baby. It's 5:30. - I have to go with the captain. - No, you need to take me home. I'm not going to be standing around here watching y'all read nobody their rights, now. I'm ready to go. I said I say 5:30, I get off at 5:30. Get in the car. Come on. Get in the car. Let's go. What are you looking at? My eyes are up here! That's the D. A. with a search warrant. There'll be an autopsy tomorrow. - Let's go home. - Good idea. What? - I missed you. - I missed you, too. - Get in the car. - And, uh can I be the one with all the problems again? Sure. - Get in the car. - What a relief. Unless, of course, you miss it. We could take turns. I can go off the rails Monday through Friday, you can have the weekends. Actually, you know what? That would be perfect, because even though I would be on my own for those two days, you couldn't stick me with Varla again, because she always takes the weekends off. Of course, then you would have to prepare my Saturday and Sunday meals in advance."
"Oh, gosh. Hello? Hello? Mr. Donovan? Mr. Donovan? What, what are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. What are you, what are you doing?! Oh! No! Oh! Oh! Help! Help! Oh! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! What are you doing? Help! Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! Help me! MONK Season 3 Epi. 07 Monk and the Employee of the Month Over there, over there. Maybe I should just buy a TV while I'm here. What's the matter with the one you have? / It broke. All we get is the science channel. I swear, if I see one more show about the moon landing, I'm going to scream. Yeah, what could be more dull than the conquest of space? Exactly. Hi. Um, we're with the police. - We're looking for the - Dead body? Take your pick. We got a whole store full of them. The police are in the back. On the loading dock. Ignore it. You don't have to pop them all. Monk, Sharona. - You having fun? - No. - What have we got? - It's pretty routine, an industrial accident. Yeah, her name was Edna coruthers. The manager says she was a model employee, first one here, last one to leave. He figured she was checking on a delivery for a customer and, uh, She was killed instantly. That's horrible. Does the TV still work? Sharona the TV just killed a woman. What are you going to do, lock it up? Tired? / Yeah, I was up all last night with my girlfriend. Yeah, those imaginary girlfriends can be pretty wild. - She's not imaginary. - Ooh. - What's her name? - Crystal. - What's her last name, Glassware? - No, it's Smith. - Do you have a picture? - Yeah. - Oh. - She's pretty. - Randy, this came with the wallet. - Yeah, I know. - She's a wallet model. - That's sad. Sharona, she's one of the top five wallet models in the world, thank you very much. Meanwhile, back on earth I don't know why the D. A. called you. We're wrapping up our tent. There's nothing to see here. No, no, the D. A. didn't call me. It was the store security manager, right? Yeah, I took the call, but he didn't give me his name. Well, there's a reason for that, Monk. If you knew who it was, you probably wouldn't be here. Who was it? Who's he? His name's Joe christie. He's an ex-cop. Hey, as far as I'm concerned, he never was a cop. What'd he do? He stole some drugs, got a couple of good cops killed. Joe christie was my partner. Just after I left the department, he was promoted to major narcotics, and he arrested this dealer named Gutner with 21/2 kilos of uncut cocaine. The drugs disappeared magically. They never made it to the evidence room. What about the cops? Well, without the drugs, the dealer walked. He got pulled over a month later for a routine traffic violation, and he shot two good cops. I knew one of them. I knew them both. Well, somebody's got to take his statement. No, no, no. Not, not me. I go near him, I deck him. - Fine, I'll do it. - I'll go with you. You can tell me all about Crystal, the famous wallet model. I can't believe anybody even hired that guy. Well, he never was convicted of anything. So, uh, what, are you going to pop all of these? No choice. You have to press down with your thumb. Monk, I know how to pop bubble wrap. Thank you. Hey, Chandler, Roberto, get over here. Start popping these. - Is there a reason why we're doing this? - Nope. Just keep popping. Hey, I really appreciate this. Hey, he doesn't think it was an accident. He says she was allergic to dust, and she never came back here. Plus he found this. It's a heel. He found it 15 yards from the body. He thinks she was running from something. Nah, it just snapped off and went flying. I've seen that before. Did she have any enemies? Not really, but the store did get three complaints about her last month. Yeah, but from three different customers. They were all anonymous. - What did they say? - Nothing much. Uh, she had alcohol on her breath, she was rude to somebody He wants you to check that out. No. No, I can't, can't do it. I can't, I can't work with him. We're pouring two jigsaw puzzles out, 500 pieces each. Now we're mixing them together. Okay, open your eyes. Ready Go. - Is he a robot? - No, he's a person. Wow. What else can he do? He vacuums a lot, and he solves murders. You could sell tickets to this. I know, I know. I want to, but my mom won't let me. He's her boss. Benjy, what are you doing? He's not a toy. He doesn't care. He likes it. Don't you, Mr. Monk? Oh, yeah. This one's missing the corner. Do you think he could do three? Let's find out. - Uh-oh. We broke him. - Adrian. - Hey, are you okay? - Sharona you don't still have those letters. What letters? The letters Joe christie gave us. I don't know. That was over a month ago. A month. Close enough. Hey, it's your lucky day. They're right here. - What's he doing now? - Oh, he's just thinking. - Want to play video games? - Good idea. Morning, Jennie. Adrian. I gave up on you three weeks ago. Thanks for coming. Are you not shaking because it's me or because you still don't shake hands? Look, for whatever it's worth, I didn't steal those drugs. They were never logged in. I logged them in. That's all I know. I thought you, of all people, might give me the benefit of the doubt. Look, I'm not here for you. I'm here for the woman who was killed on the loading dock. Well, accordingto the M. E., What happened was an accident. Look, I noticed something about the letters that you gave us. They all have different postmarks, different handwriting, but they were sent by the same person. How do you know? The stamps are from the same roll. The edges are uneven but they fit together like puzzle pieces. I'll be damned. You're still the man. Somebody was out to get her. Any ideas? It doesn't make sense. Edna lived alone. She never talked to anybody. All she had was this job. She was employee of the month for 11 months in a row. Whoever did it knew her schedule and how to lure her to the loading dock. It has to be somebody here in the store. That's what worries me. Can you help me out? For old times' sake? Don't say that. I talked to home office in Sacramento. I have full authority to hire anybody I want. Even if I wanted to poke around, no one's going to talk to me. What am I supposed to do, just hang out in the mens wear department all day? Excuse me, where is the paint thinner? Aisle two, back of the store. - Thank you very much. - Have a Mega Mart day. When I told home office about my suspicion, they decided to beef up security. The dog is going to guard the loading dock after hours. A yellow squirt gun was found in the break room, and a three-pack of fish squirters. That's Brent donovan, the shift manager. He's by the book, he's married to the job. You know the type. Does he know about me? I'm not sure I trust him. Yeah. It's hard to know who to trust. I didn't steal those drugs, Adrian. Do you want to hear my side of the story or not? No. No, thank you. - Who are they? - One is Ronnie, one is Morris. I forget which is which. I'm not sure they know which is which. I mean, they've been here a couple of months. They're not going to last long. Dear god, you might be the best employee we have. Hi, hello. Welcome to Mega Mart. Thank you for shopping at Mega Mart. Hi, hello. Thank you for shopping at Mega Mart. Thank you for shopping at Mega Mart. Hi, hello. Welcome. Thank you for waiting. It is a madhouse today. I couldn't find them in brown, but we do have the black. Hi, hello. Welcome to Mega Mart. That is a wide foot. Thank you for shopping at Mega Mart. - Deodorant, aisle 4. - What? - Why would you say that? - No reason. Thank you for Okay, well, why don't you walk around, give them a try? And we are looking at Cleanup on aisle four. Cleanup on aisle four. I got it! I got it. Mine. Coming through. I called it. Coming through. Excuse me. It's mine. Who is that man? What is your problem? It doesn't have to be perfect. Well, as long as we're here, we might as well do the job right. I said the same thing when I started. When was that? I don't remember. Did you know Edna coruthers? Everybody knew Edna. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but she was a royal pain in the rump, always coming in early, working late. She was making the rest of us look bad. Did she ever argue or fight with anyone? She'd argue with anybody who messed up her department. I worked with her over in housewares. Everything had to be spic and span. She was a regular profectionist. You mean perfectionist. I'm not one, so I can say it any damn way I want. Great, okay, you almost got it. Just a little bit higher. All right, buddy, okay. He's right there, right there. You rock. You rock, dude. Try for the cheese crackers. Can't reach it. - How about chuckles? - Nah. Try for the barbecue chips. Dude, you have longer arms. Why don't you do it? What are you doing? Uh, I, I dropped a quarter. Donovan's looking for you guys. Yeah, well, we're on break. You already took your break. If you're not out there in two minutes, I'm going to report you both. What a tool! Who is she? Jennie silvertool. She used to be cool. Remember when she used to cover for us? Yeah, yeah. She used to hang out in the parking lot with us, - Sipping on some brews. - What happened? Maybe she got religion. Yeah, 'cause, like, two months ago, she suddenly started punching in early and working all late and stuff like that. Hmm. Looks like you have some competition. This is basically hose central, so if you got a hose, this is where it goes. - Mr. Donovan is very, very - Down. What is it? What? - Dude, those are the guys. - What guys? The guys who beat me up in the parking lot. When was this? Couple of months ago. No, wait, it was last week. You know, I was putting the promotional flyers all over the windshields and stuff. These two dudes came up from nowhere, just started pounding on me. Beat the bejesus out of me. - Did they take your money? - No, man. They were just beating me up. Wailing on me, no reason. And you're sure it was them. Not 100%. To be honest with you, at the time, I wasn't what you'd really call sober. Dude, it's ancient history. Don't dwell on it. Let's take a break. - I got your back. - You're right. You, uh, find everything you were looking for? / Sure. - Wouldn't you rather pay cash? - Oh, yeah. Sorry. What's going on? I don't know. She just typed in their zip code without asking what it was. She knows them, but she's pretending not to. What do you know about her? That's Jennie silverman. She's the best employee we got. They just offered her a management position at the new store in Livingston, and she turned it down. - Why would she do that? - I don't know. Maybe she has friends here she's loyal to. Those two cops were married, and one of them had kids. I'm loyal to them. I've never seen you this quiet. What's on your mind? I'm working on a case. I'm in a store working undercover. Mm. Sounds interesting. It's the Mega Mart on columbus avenue. Mm-hmm. I saw you in there yesterday. Yeah, I, I sometimes stop there on the way home. Why didn't you say hi? I saw you You saw me what? You stole a granola bar. You took a bite and you put it in your pocket. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Adrian, that, that really hurts me. It hurts me, too. I am not a thief. I had that bar with me when I went into the store. I, I carry them in my pocket all the time just to keep upmy energy. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. So there's, um there's one in your pocket right now? Yes, Adrian, there is one in my pocket right now, and I hope I do not have to take it out to prove it to you. I, I/ you know, Adrian, I see this all the time. I work with cops, I work with ex-cops. You You see terrible things. People lie to you. After a while, you don't believe anything. - I, I, I, I, I - Adrian, you're going to have to make the leap. You're going to have to trust. Otherwise, you're going to be completely alone, and I hope that that doesn't happen to you. You're right. - I'm sorry. - All right. Okay, let's, um talk about the case. A woman was killed in the store. Officially, it's been called an accident. You're working in the store. Yes. It's going pretty well. Mr. Donovan, the shift manager, said he might move me up to register one. Mm-hmm. Oh. Thank god. Of course I, I knew it. - I knew it all along. - Of course you did. Yeah. You planning a trip? Excuse me? Couldn't help but notice you're taking quinine. Malaria pills. - Who are you? - I'm Adrian. I know your name. I can see your name, but who are you? I'm just a curious person. It's a gift and a curse. For example, yesterday, you were ringing up a customer. You pretended not to know him, but you knew his zip code. I don't know what you're talking about. That curiosity of yours It's not a gift and a curse. It's a curse. Attention, Mega Mart customers! Door will be closing in 10 minutes. Good, good, good dog. You're a fine little fella. See, here's the, the thing. I'm working undercover. There was this woman, Edna coruthers. She was killed on the loading dock, and I think it might have been premeditated. Hey. Where's Adrian? I don't know. He said he'd meet us here. So you want to sit down? Sure. Got that information you wanted on Jennie silverman. Her adult record was clean, but she spent some time in juvie. Uh, age 15, she had minor-league possession and trespassing, and at age 16, she stole a car. I thought juvenile records were sealed. Yeah, well, there's a clerk downtown named Ned, who has four cats and lives with his mom, and he bought me a drink. I don't get paid enough. Monk was right. You are good. I'm glad you have his back. Take care of him. Can I ask you something? What was he like as a cop? I remember the day we met. I walked down the hall to shake his hand, this was, you know, back when he was shaking hands. And there were seven detectives lined up outside his office just waiting to run cases by him, just to see what he thought, just to pick his brain. I learned more from Adrian monk in two days than I did in the two years that I was at the academy. Were you there when Trudy Yeah, yeah, I was there when he got the call. He was laughing when the phone rang, and he never laughed again. Where is he? The last I saw him, he was in the shoe department putting boxes away. - He's putting boxes away? - Yeah. Oh, god. I think we better start ordering. Oh, it's the store. Well, ask him what's keeping him. Hello? Randy? What the hell is - Come on. - What? /- Come on. Hey! Over here! Over here, huh? Huh? Fresh meat. Fresh meat! Come on! Come on! Are you okay? Sure. I think so. Joe, are you okay? I'll live. He must have got out of the loading dock. Or maybe somebody let him out. Thank you. Forget it. Hey He saved your life. Maybe you can return the favor. So you two are pals again? I just, I just want to give him the benefit of the doubt. He is a dirty cop, Monk. Maybe. Maybe. Are you wearing cologne? Yeah, Crystal got it for me. Hey, captain, you ever met Crystal? No, I can't say that I have. We were supposed to go out to dinner last week, but she canceled at the last minute. - She wasn't feeling well. - Mm-hmm. Maybe you blew her up too much. She's not a balloon. Oh, that's right. - She's a living, breathing wallet model. - Here we go. Internal affairs division, case number 922. Detective lieutenant Joseph christie. What's, what's this? That, my friend, is the evidence room. Bin number four. That's where your pal said that he put all of the cocaine. As you can plainly see, bin number four is empty. Okay, wait. Some of these items were sold at a police auction / Yep! - a few days later? - That's routine. Three televisions, one boy's bicycle, two computers. So? Wait. Wait. Look. Look. Look at this bicycle. Well, that's a girl's bike. There's no metal bar. But when it was sold two days later, it was a boy's bike. Somebody added that metal tube. Do we know who bought that boy's bike? Yeah, it's right here. Item 422, boy's bike, sold to Clara toplin. Toplin. Clara toplin used to be the properties clerk here. She quit about four years ago. That's right. It's four years old, but the residue's still there. It tests positive for cocaine hydrochloride. Guess you should have gotten rid of the bike, Clara. I was saving it for my grandson. You're under arrest. Joe I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. That's a good start. Come on. You don't want to wipe that off? No. I don't. Let's get back to work. Well, this will come as no big surprise to anybody, but our employee of the month for the second straight month is Drum roll, please. It's Jennie silverman. Well done, Jennie. And as winner, Jennie will enjoy another month of special privileges. the employee of the month parking spot right in front of the main entrance, of course, the Mega Mart mug, the, uh, gift certificate for dinner for two at the lobster barrel on 17th street. Good only on weekdays and does not include lobster. And the winner's plaque, which will be on display right at the main entrance for the entire month, which should inspire all of us to reach deep inside us so we can find it, the best inside us so we can do the best. Well said. / Didn't Edna die at the end of last month? Yeah, that's right. Here we go. I can't believe I found this. This is the performance chart from last month. See, Edna was out front. She would have won. You're not suggesting that somebody was killed because of this. You're saying Jennie silverman committed cold-blooded murder just so she could be employee of the month? Why? I don't know. As employee of the month, she gets a ceramic mug, dinner for two at the world-famous lobster barrel, and a plaque. And, of course, the thanks of a grateful nation. Do you really think there's something here worth killing for? Oh, yes. It's here. We just can't see it. What do you think? I think Edna was obviously killed for this mug. Really? / No. Well, maybe it's made out of gold and painted over. Joe Hey, you said try 300 theories until one fits. I said that? Yeah, I remember everything you ever said, god help me. It wasn't about the mug. What's next? Dinner for two at the lobster barrel. Tell me about the lobster barrel. It's a family place. It's noisy, there's a million kids. You wouldn't last five minutes there. It's got a great all-you-can-eat buffet with seven different kinds of shrimp. They got jumbo shrimp, batter-dipped shrimp, tempura shrimp Okay, stop telling me about the lobster barrel. Barbecue shrimp../Stop! What's next? Would you kill somebody to get this? I'd kill somebody not to get it. That's it. That's what she gets. Except, of course, for the parking space. There it is. Did you see that? What, the speed bump? Trucks are always scraping it when they're loaded down. I saw Jennie's van scrape it two days ago. You're right. I've seen it, too. But the first time I saw her, in the morning, the van didn't scrape at all. You remember a vehicle not scraping on a speed bump? Damn, I've missed you. Her van is always heavier at the end of the day. Why? - It's loaded down. - With what? Oh, my god. Do you remember her two friends? They were buying shovels and drill bits. There's a sewer grate right under the van. It was loaded down with dirt. They're digging into the vault. They're robbing the bank. She wanted that parking space. That's what this whole thing has been about. Monk, I've been looking for you. Mr. Donovan, where's Jennie? Never mind Jennie. You're supposed to be in housewares. There's inventory piled up This is police business. Do you understand? My partner asked you a question. Was that an earthquake? They blew the vault. It's going down now. That makes sense. First of the month. The bank's probably loaded with cash. - What are you talking about? - I'll call it in. No, no, no. They'll never make it in time. Joe, I need a gun. Sporting goods, aisle seven. Gun? / What the hell is going on in here? Let's go, go, go! Hey! Hey, Ronnie, Ronnie. Yes? Listen to me. No, man, he's Ronnie. Yeah, we switched name tags to see if anybody would notice. But don't tell anyone, because it's like an experiment, so I'm in a rush here. I need a gun. Oh, you finally decided to use your employee discount, huh? All right, Mr. Monk, what do you want? We got these I don't care! Just give me something. Look, it's a police emergency. I'll bring it right back. I just need it for two minutes, okay? Yeah, that's going to be a problem, because that's against, like, a million federal laws and regulations. Yeah, there's supposed to be, like, a waiting period or something. - Please - No, but you know what? We'll get you started on your paperwork. / No paperwork. No, no, no. No paper No, / I'll be right back. It's/ Stay off the glass there. I just washed that. What the hell were you doing in there? - This stuff's heavy. - Good. Good. Heavy's good. If it was up to us, dude, you could totally have it, but, uh, Mr. Donovan's been riding us a lot lately. Yeah, like yesterday, when we were in housewares For the love of god, it's Jennie silverman! She's getting away. Oh. Oh, it's for Jennie? Yeah, we both had the same thought. Jennie's a real tool. Yeah, but, man, this is not the answer. - Whoa! - Morris - He's Morris. - Ronnie give me the ammo. Okay, okay. Calm down, man. Yo, it wasn't even loaded. I quit. It's loaded! Get back! Loud. Get out of the car! Away from the vehicle! Put your hands up where I can see them! Hands up! Hands over your head, you in the driver's seat! Detective Joe christie, welcome back. We could sure use you. Congratulations. Thank you, brother. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. You'll be next. She's right. And when you make it back, I get to ride with you. Hey! Sharona, captain, everyone, could you all come with me, please? Everybody, come here. I want to show you guys something. - What is it? - Crystal. She's downstairs. Why didn't you tell her to come up here? She couldn't stay. She's flying to Aruba for a photo shoot. - So sad. - There she is. - Where? - In the taxi. - Hey! Crystal! - It's so pathetic - Huh, she's waving. - Goodbye, Randy! I love you! - I miss you already. - See? Where are you going? She's right here! What? Oh, come on. She was just I swear to god, she was just here!"
"Here's another geography question for $1000. What mountain range separates Casablanca from Sahara desert? Is it A, the Himalayas, B, the Atlas mountains, C, the Pyrenees or D, the Aberdare mountains? - Doesn't prove anything. - It proves everything, and you know it. - Do you want to see it again? - No, thanks. I hate watching myself on TV. Roddy, why did you do it? Have you ever been in debt, Lizzie? And I mean real debt. It changes everything. - That's no excuse. - What are you doing? - The right thing. - Look, Lizzie, if this is your way of asking for a raise, it worked. Hey, how much do you want? I don't want money, Roddy. I'm not you. All right, you don't want money. What do you want? I want to be able to sleep at night. I want to be able to be proud of the show the way I used to be. What are you going to do, slip it under the producer's door anonymously? Didn't even have the courage to write your own name on it. Aw, Lizzie, all right, look, I'm sorry. - Hey, it'll never happen again. - Damn right it won't. Okay, okay. Look, you win. I'll quit the show. But just give me one day. Let me do it on my own, so I can do it with whatever's left of my dignity. - If this is a trick, I don't - it's not a trick. It's not a trick. I swear to you. Watch, watch tonight. Before the bonus round, I'll make an announcement. God help me. Okay. Okay. How about another drink before I walk the plank? Sure. Thank you. Welcome back to Treasure chest. I'm Roddy Lankman. Well, before we start the bonus round, I do have an important announcement to make. It's about time. - My contract here at Treasure chest is almost up, and a lot of people have been asking what my plans are. Well, this afternoon, I made a big decision, and I'd like to share it with all you people. I just signed a new 5 year contract, which means I'm going to be right here doing what I always do for as long as they want me to be here. What do you think about that? Come on. Oh, my god. Come on. Oh, my god. MONK Season 3 Epi. 08 Mr. Monk and the Gameshow - Oh, this is looking good. - You think so? Oh, it's looking fantastic. A little more mayonnaise, a pinch of paprika. Maybe two pinches. Maybe three pinches. - Okay, that's perfect. - Maybe four pinches. Okay, Kevin, I think that's enough. Thank you. We are going to need some pepper, and I think I have some upstairs. Maybe I should bring all my seasonings down here if we're going to be cooking all week. All week? - Here's something you might find interesting. This is only the eighth time in my life I have ever had egg salad. - Really? And how much do you want to bet I can name all eight? The first time was in third grade. I traded sandwiches with a kid named Stuart kramer. Then three years after that, my cousin's confirmation party. Two years after that, I was in a restaurant. I ordered tuna fish. - Do you like to laugh? - No, I don't. Well, get ready to, because I knew it was egg salad. I could smell it, but the waitress kept saying to me, ""No, it's tuna fish."" Phone. We're on number three. Remember where we are. Hello? Oh, Sharona. Sharona, how, how's your mom? Oh, good. Oh, thank god. Thank god for modern medicine. Not, not too good, actually. He's in the kitchen right now naming every egg salad sandwich he ever had. Eight, including today. It's not funny. Stop, stop laughing. Sharona, I don't, I don't know why you asked him to look in on me. I'm not a child. Please stop laughing. Okay, I'll call you back. Give her my best. Okay. And when you come back bring a gun. Okay. bye. That was Sharona. She won't be coming back until monday. Monday. Wow. We are going to need some more food. Let's make a list. Okay. Bread, juice paprika, milk No milk. Right. Crossing that off the list. Adding to the list, bok choy. Doorbell. Who is it? It's Trudy's father. It's my father-in-law. - Yeah, he called this morning. - Why didn't you tell me? I did. I wrote it on a post-it note. We need more of those, by the way. We're out of them. - Adrian. - Dwight. Dad. Yeah. I missed you, too. Mr. E., here's your coffee. Sorry it took so long. I'm still not used to that kitchen. - Careful. It's hot. - Thank you, Kevin. - Oh. There's something in there. - That's a raisin. I put it in to sweeten the coffee. Little trick I picked up when I was waiting tables in Aspen, Colorado, which I did for two summers. Not two consecutive summers, 'cause there was a summer in between - Thank you, Kevin. - Thank you, Kevin. - Delicious. - Okay. - Oh, happy birthday. - Oh, thank you. - Did you get my card? - Uh, yes, I did. Did you look inside? 'Cause the punch line was on the inside. - Yes, I did. - It was very funny. - It was a pun. It was very funny. It's on my mantel. Everybody likes it. - How is Marcia? - Much better. She's, uh, volunteering as a grief counselor. Believe me, she's good at it. Send her my love. Well, I was hoping that wouldn't be necessary. That's why I'm here. I was hoping you might come back with me to Los angeles. I'm producing a new game show. It's called ""Treasure chest."" Wow. Wow. Is that your show? Because I love that show. Who comes up with all those questions? Well, we have a staff of writers. 'Cause I'll tell you something, that is something I've always thought I would be good at. I'm always asking people questions, and a lot of the time, they are genuinely stumped. That's true. We are. Adrian My little show's in trouble. - I think it's serious. - What is it? Well, I'd rather you see for yourself. Do you think you could come down to L. A. for a couple of days? Plenty of room. Marcia would love it. Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Dwight, I, I can't. Uh, I, I, I can't just leave. - Sharona's not here. - I'm here. We could go. Uh, I don't know. Come on, it'll be fun. Three guys on a road trip to Hollywood. - Is Roddy Lankman here? - Lenny, tell Bernie not to start the music cues too soon, and make sure the affiliates are sitting in the front row. - Mr. E., is Roddy Lankman here? - He's probably in makeup. Okay, do you think I could talk to him? 'Cause I have some ideas that I'd like to run by him. Don't worry, mr. E., I won't embarrass you. - I'm sure you won't. It's just that Roddy doesn't like to be disturbed before the show. Tanya. This is Kevin dorfman, a friend of mine from San francisco. Would you mind showing him around? - I'd be happy to. - You're the pointer. Oh, point to something. It looks better. She makes everything look better, Tanya. - Hey, how did you get this job? - I want you to meet someone. Val birch. This is my old friend, Adrian monk. Adrian. Well, gym class must have been hell with a name like that. Yes. Yes, it was. Thank you. Are you nearly done, or do you just like touching me? Adrian's here from San francisco. Oh, Frisco. God-awful town. I was there last year. It was foggy the whole week. When are they going to do something about all that fog? Well, I, I don't know. I'll make some calls. I couldn't see a damn thing, not even that, um Uh, Golden bridge they got. - The Golden gate. - No, genius, the bridge. Right. That's what they call it the golden Okay, okay. Testing, 1, 2, 3. We're done, okay? That idiot's won seven times in a row. Adrian, I know he's cheating. I just can't figure out how. - Roddy Lankman? - Uh, yeah. Kevin dorfman. I'm a big fan of yours, sir. A major fan. - Okay, how you doing? - Look, I know we just met, Roddy, but I understand you have your own production company. Well, that's good, because I have an idea for a show, and if you're interested, we can produce it together. - I really can't. - Okay. It's called ""40 winks."" In a nutshell, three contestants, three beds. The first one who falls asleep wins. So we're watching people fall asleep? - Exactly. - You snooze, you win. - I can't do that. I, I can't even really talk to strangers about ideas. It's for legal reasons. Well, it's a good thing I'm not a stranger, then. - I'm friends with Dwight Ellison. - Oh, really? I'm here with Adrian monk, the detective. - Detective? Yeah, from San francisco. Dwight brought him here to look around. He's having some sort of problem with the show. Huh. - Nice to meet you. - All right. - A detective? - Will you keep it down? He's from San francisco. That's all I know. - So what? - So what? - He's going to be watching us. - So let him watch. He's not going to figure it out. The system is perfect. Now, look, here's what's going to happen. I'm going to win tonight, I'm going to win tomorrow, and I'm going to keep on winning until I say we're done. - It's too dangerous. - It's too dangerous, huh? Well, I guess you should have thought of that before you killed your assistant. Now let's go back inside. It's showtime. It's driving me nuts, Adrian. I need someone to look at this from a different angle. - Maybe I'm missing something. - Are you sure he's cheating? He has to be. That Neanderthal Val birch he's been answering graduate-level questions in geography, history, astronomy. Nobody's that smart, not even you. So he has to be getting the questions in advance. Maybe somebody's helping him, one of the writers. I thought of that. For the last two weeks, I've been writing all the questions myself. These are the ones we're using tonight. - Who else gets to see these? - Nobody. Not the director, not even Roddy. These envelopes stay sealed until he opens them on stage during the actual game. What are you doing? What is that? It's Roddy Lankman's pencil. Yeah, those are his teeth marks. This is what you call a collectible. You can look, but don't touch. - I don't want to touch it. - Yeah, right. Seriously, don't touch it. Live from Hollywood, California, let's grab those shovels and go digging, 'cause the name of the game is ""Treasure chest"". Here's your host, Roddy Lankman! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome back to ""Treasure chest."" I'm Roddy Lankman, and, boy, what a nice crowd we have today, but let's welcome back our reigning champion. He's been here for three weeks. He shows absolutely no signs of slowing down. He's a retired limousine driver from Woodland hills. In his free time, he likes hunting and fishing up in the Bluestone valley. Welcome back to the show, Val birch! What is the largest desert in Asia? Is it A, the Sahara, B, the Negev, C, the Gobi, D.. C, the Gobi. Correct for $1,000! Thank you, Tanya. The next question, for $1,500. which Monarch is sometimes known as ""the Tragic queen""? Was it A, queen Elizabeth, B, Marie antoinette, C, Catherine the Great B, Mary ann tonette. Uh, that is correct. Marie antoinette. He mispronounced it. Here's a $2,000 question, and I see this one has a visual clue, so, Tanya, if you could bring up our visual. Thank yon very much! Which founding father lived in this house? Was it A, George washington, B, Thomas jefferson, C - B, Jefferson. - Jefferson is correct for $2,000. Pitching another perfect game, Val birch. - Did you see that? - What? He didn't even look at the picture, and he still got it right. How? - Maybe they're signaling each other. Val birch is still in the lead with a grand total of $234,000! That's a lot of money, Val. What do you plan to do with it? I don't know. Let's just keep playing. Marcia. Come see what the cat dragged in. - Adrian. - Marcia. Welcome home. Thank you. You okay? Yes, I'm, I'm just - there are so many memories. - I know. That's why we could never move. Oh, honey, this is Kevin dorfman. Hello. Kevin dorfman. I live above Adrian. May I say what a lovely home you have here. - Oh, thank you. - Spanish style, isn't it? - Yes. Yes, I thought so. I grew up in a house just like this, except the dining room was over on this side Hello. Hi, mom, dad. This is Adrian. - Mr. and Mrs. Ellison. - It's Dwight and Marcia. I feel like we're old friends, the way Trudy talks about you. She's been sending us articles and newspaper stories. You can believe about 40% of that stuff. Come in, come in. You must be exhausted. - Nice to see you. - So good to see you, too. Oh, that's okay. We don't mind a little dirt. - Almost done. - Okay. You have a beautiful home. Well, that's fascinating. Well, come on in. I'm sure you must all be exhausted. Adrian, you remember where the guest room is? Oh, yeah. It's still how she left it. Do you want to go in? There might be something you want to keep. I can't. I know. It took me 2 and half years. How did you do it, Marcia? How did you survive? I didn't think I would. I was buried alive. Buried alive. And then one day, the sun came up. My garden was blooming. Kids were riding by the house on their bikes, and I decided to give the world a second chance. It's still a beautiful world, Adrian. - You don't have to do that. - It's no problem. I remember how you like everything separated. It's okay. So, Kevin, did I understand Adrian correctly? You won the lottery a couple years ago? Yes, I did. That is accurate. And you're probably wondering what happened to all the money. That's a fair question. Here's a tip. if you're ever lucky enough to win the big jackpot, you should probably not make some of the mistakes I made. For one thing, Vegas. it's a good place to avoid. Secondly, if you're ever going to hire an accountant, you might want to make sure he's certified. And most importantly, never, under any circumstances, marry Lisa Abromowitz. I'll try to remember that. Or her sister Shelly. Is something wrong with the food? Oh, no, mom. It's perfect. I'll, um, explain later. Adrian, I'm producing a new cop show in the fall. We're looking for a consultant to work with the writers, keep us honest. The position is yours if you want it. - Wow. Dwight, I don't know what to say. Why don't you say yes? Dad, that's really sweet, but Adrian would never quit his job. It's his life. Oh, you guys should see him. - He is so brilliant. - Here we go. When he's at a crime scene, the other policemen, they just stand back and watch him work. They watch me so they know what not to do. Oh, you are so modest. Besides, we love San francisco. I really can't see us ever leaving. It's so far away. Not the way Trudy drives. So you won't be moving back. Well, Adrian, you take care of my little girl. - She's all we have. - Yes, sir. I will. I'm so sorry. - About what? - Wait a minute. Hold the phone. I've got it. Got what? - How they're cheating on the show. It's a code. Roddy Lankman is blinking when he asks the questions. Like once for A, two for B. - That's what he does. - No, no, no, no. I thought about that. I've studied every frame from every show. It's impossible. He never blinks or gestures or changes his voice, at least that I could tell. Well, you were there. Did you notice anything? - No, no. But when can I talk to this Mr. Lankman? I've already asked him. He won't talk to you or anybody. These days, he hardly ever leaves his trailer. Poor guy's had a pretty tough year. What happened? Well, for one thing, he's broke. He declared bankruptcy last January. - And then there was the accident. - What accident? Last month his personal assistant, a girl named Lizzie Talvo, was killed. Her car went off the road in Bluestone valley. - Roddy took it pretty hard. - Bluestone valley? Val birch goes fishing in Bluestone valley. They mentioned it on the show when they introduced him. Val birch fishes where the girl was killed. He fishes where the girl was killed. That's probably important. Did you notice he said it twice? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Why are you making that face? - We're in rugged terrain. This is my rugged terrain face. - Okay. Okay, she was, she was traveling east. Her car went off the road up there, ended up right here between these two rocks. - Haven't the police already been here? - Well, that's true but they weren't really looking for anything. This wasn't a criminal investigation. What is it? Something? Something intended for Dwight Ellison. - An exercise tape. - Did you bring those baggies? Oh, this is real evidence, isn't it? Oh, goodness. I feel like a - What's the matter? Are you okay? - I just swallowed a bug. - You, you what? - I'm okay. - - Oh, god. What is it? It's Val birch. He was here. Kevin? - It's okay. I spit that one out. Oh, god. Just, let's get out of here, and just, for god's sake, cover your mouth. - Okay. It's just a videotape. ""Thighs and abs: 10 minutes a day to a perfect you."" Does that mean anything to you? Yeah, me neither. We're at Val birch's house now. I want to have another word with him. No, I'll be fine. Thanks. I appreciate that, Dwight. I don't think he's home. Hello, Mr. Birch? Hello, it's Adrian monk. We spoke yesterday at the show. Mr. Birch? I'm here, too. Kevin dorfman. I'm his upstairs neighbor. It looks unlocked? What do you think? Well, we can't go in without a reason. - I'm kind of thirsty. Does that count? - No, Kevin. Thirst is no excuse for breaking and entering. - Wouldn't it be cool if it was? - Yes, that would be cool. Here. Let me what are you doing? What are you doing? I'm leaning in. Yeah, I went to law school for three semesters. You can lean anywhere you want. It's in the constitution. I can't imagine which constitution you're referring to. You know what? Grab my pants. Pardon me? - Grab my pants. I need the counterweight. Kevin, I really don't want to grab your pants. If I touch that floor, it's a felony. Mr. Birch? Hello? Mr. Birch?. Hello? Kevin, you see that pencil on the chair? Can you reach that? - You got it? - I got it. Pull me. Yes, I got it. Do you still have the pencil that Roddy Lankman gave you yesterday? - The collectible. - The collectible. - Kevin, do you have the pencil? - I have the pencil. He was here. Roddy Lankman was here but why? Maybe they were trying to figure out how to cheat. Let's go. Hi, this is your old pal Val. Leave your message when you hear the beep. He's checking his messages. You have one saved message. May 2nd, 7:39 P. M. He's skipping that one. You have one new message. Today, 10:15 A. M. Mr. Birch, this is Tony Forrest at Southland mercedes. I have some good news for you. The new 640 you ordered will be in tomorrow. I got it here in three weeks just like I promised. Let me know when you want to pick it up. He ordered a new Mercedes-Benz four weeks ago. Before he went on the show. That's what I call confidence. He knew he was going to win. If we can figure out how they're cheating, we can nail them both. - I have to get closer. - Closer? Yesterday we were in the front row. You can't get much closer than that. Please welcome to the show, Adrian monk. Welcome to the show, Adrian. Mr. E., You are not going to regret this. Is there anybody you'd like to say hello to? - Yes. Okay, who would that be? - Sharona. She's in New Jersey visiting her mother. Oh, that's very nice. How long have you and Sharona been married? No, no, no. Uh, Sharona is my nurse. I was married, but my wife Trudy was killed by a car bomb. Did he just say ""car bomb""? Which is why I have devoted my life to putting criminals behind bars, even famous, powerful men who think they're above the law. Uh, I'm sure you do a great job, too. - All right, who wants to - Dig for treasure? All right, Tanya, let's get this game started. We're going to start out with a $1,000 question. Where Adrian. I'm sorry. Um, there was a smudge on my buzzer thing. Well, I'm sorry, but according to our rule book, you'll have to answer the question. Could you repeat the question, please? Yes, but unfortunately, only the part that you've already heard, so where? Where? Where? Once more, please. - Where? - Where you have 10 seconds. Constantinople. Well, we're a multiple choice show, so all we need is A, B, C, or D. - D. - D? - No, B. - B. B. B. Definitely B. - B, and that's your final answer. - A. Uh, well, the correct answer is C, Macy's. Moving on, let's go to our $1,500 question. Oh, for the love of god. I'm sorry. It's still a little grimy here. Time is money for some of us. Okay, I'll try. All right, moving onto the $1,500 question Okay. I'm done. That's it. - What element do you add to iron to make steel? Is it A, aluminum, B, carbon, - C, lead, or - B, carbon. Carbon is correct for $1,500. They're still cheating. But why would they do that with Adrian out there? They have no choice. - If Val loses today, he can't come back. - What Greek city hosted - the original olympics? - That's a good point. Was it A, Athens, B, Rhodes, - C, Olympia - C, Olympia. Correct again for $1,500. He figured it out. He knows how they're cheating. One minute. We are back in one. - So you figured it out? - Yes, sir. I know how they're cheating. Was I right about the blinking? - No. - Was I close? - No. But it is a code. Lankman is holding the question cards differently every time. If he holds it by this corner, it means the answer is A. This corner means B, and this one's for C. What do we do now? I guess we call the police. Hi, it's me. It's 7:15. Call me when you get home. I love you. Dwight Dwight! When did Lizzie Talvo die? - What was the date? - May 2nd. May 2nd. About what time? - Evening, while the show was on. - Around 7:39 P. M.? - That sounds about right. - Don't call the police. Not yet. These men are guilty of more than just cheating, and I think I can prove it. - You're going to prove it now? - If I don't do it now, they might destroy the evidence. - 15 seconds! Places! - I got to go. I got to go. Listen, isn't there a way to make a phone call during the show? Well, you can phone a friend, but only if you make it to the bonus round. Oh, you're so far behind. You'll never make it. Five seconds! Welcome back to ""Treasure chest."" My name is Roddy Lankman, and our reigning champ Val birch is in the lead again with $3,000. In second place, Susan with zero, and, Adrian, you're at negative $1,000. Well, Roddy, I think my luck is about to change. Well, there's only one way to find out. Let's do round two and dig for treasure. For $4,000, the bone that connects your knee to your ankle is - the A, fibula, B, tibia - B, tibia. That is correct. Next question. How many square yards in an acre? Is C. Uh, C is correct. It's 4,840 square yards. Lucky guess. A lucky guess indeed. For $5,000 - D. - D is correct. Another lucky guess. For $5,500, president Mckinley was assassinated - D./- B. - D. The answer is D, Roddy. D is correct, yes. Next question - who - B, B, B, B, B. B is correct. It's Jackson Browne. - Susan, are you okay? - I, I just it looked so much easier when I was watching at home. Yes, it always looks easier at home. - For $6,000 - C! - No, C is not right. - A. A is correct. The wombat. And for the last question, for $6,000, - what element - D. D is correct, and that's the end of round two. A couple of very intelligent gentlemen here. Uh, that means Adrian monk is the winner of round two. Val birch, you're going to have to sit this one out this time. Adrian, you understand what happens in round two. You answer these five questions correctly, and you not only win this game, but you win this great big pot of gold! You know how we play our game. You have five questions. Let's see how you do. Adrian, who was the first president to win the nobel peace prize? Roddy, I understand I can phone a friend. You want to phone a friend on the first question. Well, you're the boss. Tanya, let's bring him the phone. For those joining us for the first time, Adrian is going to call a friend to see if he can get a little help on this very important bonus round question. All right, who would you like to call? Well, Roddy, I would like to call - him. - Me? You want to call me? I don't think I'm at home. Well, Mr. Monk, what are you doing? Do you know what he's doing? Because I don't know what he's doing. I'm trying to prove that you are guilty of murder, Mr. Lankman, or at the very least, manslaughter. Lizzie Talvo, your personal assistant, discovered that you were cheating on the show. - Uh can we go to a commercial? - You do and you're fired. She died about a month ago in a car crash, and this man has been blackmailing you ever since, and you have been paying him off here on your show by feeding him the answers. I knew it. Do over. Mr. Birch, you were in Bluestone valley the night she died. You must have seen the crash. She was still alive when you got to the car. She had to have said something to you before she died something about Mr. Lankman. You must have realized you just hit the jackpot. You called your own answering machine and recorded her dying words. You can't prove any of this. I was at your house yesterday, and I happened to hear the date and time stamp of a phone message that you had saved May 2nd, 7:39 P. M. I think I can prove it, sir. What's your number? Adrian, it's 555-0137. Thank you, Dwight. Hi, this is your old pal Val. Leave your message when you hear the beep. You have one saved message. May 2nd, 7:39 P. M. It was Roddy. It was Roddy Lankman. He was cheating on the show. I was going to blow the whistle. He cut my brakes. Roddy. Mr. Lankman, Mr. Birch, some homicide detectives are outside. They want to talk to you. Adrian. You were amazing. Just like Trudy always said. Thank you for this. Thank you for Trudy. Monday. Dear diary, it is a terrible day. Ginger died this morning. I was too sad to go to school or even eat. I cried all day. I will never be happy again. Friday. Tomorrow I'm going to camp. I have been packing all day. It's going to be so much fun. I can't wait. I still think about Ginger sometimes, but now I just remember the good times. I guess daddy was right. God wants people to be happy. Nobody can stay sad forever."
"- Oh, man. - Hi, Dewey. Did you miss me? Come on. Get off the bike. Arrest me, do whatever you want with me, just don't touch the bike. Come on. You skipped out on your assault hearing yesterday. You made our captain very, very angry. Well, you tell Stottlemeyer he can kiss my ass. You can tell him yourself. He'll be here any second. Come on, you know the routine. Put your hands on the car. - God - Come on. Haven't you guys got anything better to do? What about my bike? You're not going to just leave it there, are you? - You know, I think I'll take it for a ride. - Don't do that. Don't ride what is this, a heritage softail? I always wanted to ride one of these.

Strangers, people on the street. Maybe they envy you. You're an extraordinary man. Yeah, I don't want to be an extraordinary man. I want to be the guy on the bus coming home at 5:00 to help his kids with their homework. Where's the trash? It's over there, but you can, you can just put it down there. Just put it right there. It's fine. Good. Good. That's really good. I'm just so tired so tired of being me. For example, that tissue.. I know, I know it's crazy right now, that's all I can think about. Adrian, let's not make this about the tissue. You know sometimes late at night, I start to think that I never really Oh, forget it. Look at me. I'm, I'm helpless. I'm, I'm pathetic. I'm not even a man. I'm just a I'm just a broken machine. All right, look, Adrian, maybe I can help you. I know how you feel about medication. No, no, no. No pharmaceuticals. We talked about this. Yes, we did talk about that, but there is a new drug that's just been approved. It's called doxinyl, and the side effects are supposed to be minimal, and I really think that it might help in your case. I can't do it. The thought of chemicals inside me, in my head - I can't do it. - All right, we can take it slow. We can start off with, with half a dose. All right, look. Uh This, this is enough for one week, and it's This is enough for one week, okay? So you keep those with you. If you're feeling overwhelmed, take one, but call me so that I can just monitor your reaction. - I can't do it. - Nobody is forcing you, Adrian. Keep them with you, just in case. Adrian! I, I'm sorry. I know I'm interrupting, but - Sharona. - Stottlemeyer's been shot. Taylor, make sure that street is shut down. - Yes, sir. - We got guys going door to door? - Huh-uh. - Good. Are there cameras on these traffic lights? - Yes, sir. All right, check them out. Maybe they caught something. Hey, I want you to get pictures of this crowd. The shooter might still be here. All right? Please get me another forensics team down here now! Randy! How is he? I don't know. He took one in the shoulder. He's in the hospital now. So tell me what you need. Look, I don't know what I need. I'm barely holding it together here. No, you're doing great. He'd be proud of you. - So what, what happened? - Okay. Okay, we're shaking down a biker. Lieutenant Cooper's over here by the bike. The captain and I drive up, we get out of the car, bam, eight shots, eight shots.. Nine, I don't know, Monk. From, from where? - From one of these windows, maybe. I mean Maybe that one. I was behind the car. I didn't see anything. - Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. It wasn't from up there. No, no, it was, it was from ground level. It was from the street, maybe, maybe from a car. - Who got here first? - Hensley and Salvatore. - Hensley!, Sal! - Yes, sir. Hensley, tell him what you just told me. We were four blocks away. There was a suicide over on Vinton avenue. A woman went belly-flopping off her balcony in her bathrobe. We were waiting for the coroner when the call came in. We dropped everything and came running. Okay, the shooter might have been in a car. - Did you see anything? - As we were driving up, we did see a guy making a U-turn. - What, what kind of car? - Midsize. - Color, color, color. - It might have been blue. It was two blocks up on Fulton. He turned around and headed back this way. It could have been a bystander or a witness, Monk. No, no, no, no, no, no. This guy drove back toward the shots, not away from the shots. Did you get a look at him? I think he may have made a left turn up here. Away from the highway. - What's down there? - Reservoir. - Water. He dumped the gun. - He dumped the gun. Get me a team of divers. I need a team of divers down at the reservoir. Meet me there. Now. Go. I don't understand. Why shoot the captain? - Some cop hater? - No, no, no, he's a friend of Dewey's, trying to keep him out of jail. Well, you can ask Dewey yourself when you see him. - Monk, he's halfway to Mexico. - I don't know. Look. - What's this? Gas leak. He's got a gas leak. He's got a gas leak. Start checking gas stations, garages. He did not get far. Dewey Alber, that's who we want. - Thank you. - He's my captain, too. Okay, watch yourselves, watch each other. Be ready. - What do you got? - Well, he's in there. - He's working on his bike. - Alone? - Yeah. Let's take him now. Three go in with me, two go around the back. Monk, stay here. Let's go. - Thanks a lot. Bye. - What? What, what did they say? Well, they removed the bullets, and he's out of surgery, okay? - Really? Yes. You'll be driving him crazy again in no time. - Thank god. Hey. I know you and Stottlemeyer go way back. Oh, yeah, we first met two weeks after I made detective. He was my fourth partner. You had three partners in two weeks? Aah, they were all nice enough guys, but we just didn't really click, you know? Hard to believe. Oh, my god! Adrian, get him! Get him! Get him! - Hey, what is wrong with you? - Disher in foot pursuit! Code three! You had him. Here. Here. I had him. I I had him. I It was, it wasn't your fault. Yes, it was. It always is. Hello, Adrian. You're not still smelling my pillow, are you? You can't really smell me on that old thing. Sure I can. It's your strawberry shampoo and the lilac lotion you always wore. You never even liked that lotion. I love it now. I love it now. Trudy it's so hard. - I know it is. - I screwed up bad. I let a suspect run right by me. You're doing the best you can. I am so so proud of you. Dr. Kroger gave me some pills. He said they might help. But I'm afraid. - What are you afraid of? - I'm afraid of change. And I'm afraid of not changing. I'm afraid of change, and I'm afraid of not changing. What do you think? I want you to be happy. That's all I've ever wanted. Be happy, my darling. You deserve it. - I think it's down here. - I don't know. - What? - Your button. What about it? It's, it's not buttoned. You always button it up. Oh, how'd that happen? I don't know. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Here it is. I don't know. I haven't tried walking. - Yeah. - Hi. How you doing? I'm mad as hell. Hey, Mikey? I got, I got visitors. Keep me posted. There he is. There he is. - It's good to see you. - What are you doing? Sharona. - I, I don't know. - Good to see you. Oh, my god. What have you heard? - What do you mean? - He never hugs anybody. - What's wrong with me? - Nothing. Nothing. Adrian, Adrian, come on. There's nothing wrong. We just talked to your doctor, and you're going to be out in a few days. You're fine. - Really? - Yeah. - So who was that on the phone? - Captain Hadley. They caught Dewey Alber, my biker buddy. He was hiding out at his girlfriend's apartment. - See? Told you they'd find him. - Well, it's a dead end. He passed a polygraph test. He didn't have anything to do with my getting shot. He was just running for his life. Well, if it wasn't Dewey, who was it, and why? I was just wondering the same thing. Are you going to finish that? No, you can throw this out. - Monk, I just took a bite of that. - Mmm, it's good, isn't it? I'm hungry. Is that a crime? Captain. Hey. We found the weapon. It was in the reservoir. Thank you very much, Mr. Monk. It's a Kregmer.45. Ballistics match. - It's definitely the same gun. - Anything else? Yeah, guess who it was registered to, the jumper. - What jumper? The woman who took a swan dive out of her apartment five blocks away just before the shooting. Her name's Marlene highsmith. No, I meant, is there anything else to eat? Oh. The pudding's got my name on it. - Did you bump your head? - No. Did you? Oh, to hell with this. I'm outta here. Captain, they haven't released you yet. Just Okay, you know what? I'm just going out in the hallway. Randy, there's a guy out there shooting cops. Sir, just take it slow, then, please. - I got to get a look at that apartment. - What apartment? Marlene highsmith's. She owned the gun that shot the captain. Oh, yeah. Move out. Smoke them if you got them. She landed right here in a bathrobe. Splat, huh? Uh-huh. - This was at 12:05? - Yes, sir, 12:05. We've got five witnesses who saw her on the ledge just before she jumped. - Was she alone? - We're not sure. That's gotta hurt. - What is your problem? - What is your problem? We got here five minutes later, at 12:10 exactly. We were securing the area, about to head upstairs. That's when we got your call, ""officer down."" There was a meter maid nearby. We asked her to stay with the body, and we took off. - Any questions? - No. No, I'm fine. Why don't you take a look upstairs? Why don't you take a look upstairs? - Get out of here. - Let's go. Sorry I'm late. - You should have called or something. I'm jumping out of my skin here. I heard about Marlene. That's tough. - I guess she won't be asking for her share. It'll make the math a lot easier. How can you joke about it? It's your own wife. Ex-wife. She's probably happier, wherever she is. I'm going to miss her, especially on Friday. She was the driver. You can drive. It's easy. Drive fast. If we're being followed, drive faster. - What about the second guard? - Leave him to me. Relax. The plan is rock solid, even with two people. Me and Marlene pulled off the same thing in Cincinnati without any help. As long as nobody gets hurt. You understand I'm shooting the second guard. I'm going to kill him. Yeah, I mean, as, as long as we don't get hurt. - I'm going to need another gun. - What happened to your piece? I had to dump it. - Was the door locked? - Yes, ma'am. The cops didn't get here till after dinner. They were busy down the street. Some detective got shot. Yeah, we heard about that. Guess it all hits the fan at once sometimes. What hits the fan? It. Ah. Ah. It. It hits the fan. - How long did she live here? - Almost three years. - I know what ""it"" means. - What was she like? She paid her rent, kept to herself. You know, like, ""nice day,"" ""good morning."" That's all I know. Mr. Monk, she left a note. They found it over there on the kitchen table. ""The pain is too much. I am so sorry. Marlene."" There's something wrong with this note. - What? - I don't know. Hey. Are you getting enough sleep? - Me? - Yes, you. - Yeah, I'm fine. Never felt better. These nuts are great. Are these organic? What are you doing? - What do you mean? - The captain's been shot. You're right. You're right. Here we go. Unbelievable. It's some kind of pecan hybrid or something. - What? - I got nothing. What do you mean? I mean I got nothing. I'm dry. It happens. No, it doesn't. Not to you. Hey, back off. You can't rush the Monk. The monk? - Adrian, what's going on? - What do you mean? Come over here. Hey. Are you on something? - What's this? - It's called doxinyl. Dr. Kroger gave them to me. He is a genius. - You're taking this? - Yeah. They're great. You want one? Why didn't you tell me? I'm your nurse. This is why, because I knew you'd bring me down. You're bringing the Monk down, man. Okay, you know what? The Monk and I are going to talk later, but right now, everybody is counting on you. Now, we are in the apartment of the woman who owned the gun that shot the captain. Do you understand? I know, I know, I know. It's a conundrum. Conundrum. Conun.. conundrum. Conundrum. That's a funny word. Excuse me. - Is this her? - Yes, ma'am. - Who's he? - Ex-husband. Lester highsmith, 38. Divorced a year. He's a security guard, works at an armored car company in Diamond Heights. - What do you think? - About what? - The ex-husband. - Absolutely. The ex-husband. Let's check him out. God, these are good. Okay, the Monk needs a little fresh air. I will see you cats and kittens outside. Who the hell was that? Welcome to Rocket burger. May I help you? Yeah, uh, yeah, listen, I, I've lived down the street for, like, 12 years. I've never been in here. - Okay. - So what's good? - That's the menu. Ah, pictures. - Rocket burger, what's that? - A hamburger. And, uh, is it good? I mean, do people like it, regular people? It's popular. Super rocket, what's that? It's bigger, and it has secret sauce. Secret sauce. Fantastic. - What's in that? - They don't tell us. So it's like a mystery. Uh, the Monk loves mysteries. I'm a detective. - I think it's just Russian dressing. - Oh, man - you just ruined it for me. - Sorry. Why'd you do that? It's no fun now, is it? You're bringing the Monk down, man. You're bringing us all down. Isn't this great? - What's that? - Oh, just this. people, hamburgers, condiments us, you know? Just two. two regular guys. - How's your super rocket? - It's good. Um you got a little ketchup on your shirt there. Who gives a crap? I don't. That is a weird case. You know, there was a suicide five blocks away three minutes before the shooting. - Yeah, I hope they get this guy. - Oh, they'll get him. Know why? I'm on the case. I'm a detective. Maybe you've heard of me. Adrian monk. I'm pretty famous. I don't want to brag but I solve a lot of high-profile cases. Hey, if it's true, it's not bragging. - Huh? - Yeah. - Can I steal that? My name's Salvatore. My friends call me Sal. - Sal? - Yeah. - What do you do? - Car salesman. - 11 years. What kind of car you drive? I'm currently between vehicles, as they say. Really? Why are you smiling? Lester! Lester! Lester! How you doing? Listen, I talked to Denny. He can cover Thursday and Friday if you want to take some time off. No, I'm good. Are you sure? They're pretty heavy days. Friday, we got that big federal money transfer. I'd rather work. I don't blame you. I'm the same way. It's best to stay busy. - Call him again. - I've been calling him every 10 minutes. Well, then try his shrink. I already did, and he missed his appointment this morning. - Has that ever happened? - No. He never misses anything. You know, maybe I should just call the police. Hey, how's it going? Oh, man. - What are you wearing? - It's a little something called style. You wouldn't understand. Where's the captain? He's signing us in. - How you doing, toy store? - What did you call me? Toy store. Your name is Disher. Dish, plate, plato. Play-doh. And where do you buy play-doh? - A toy store. That's what I'm talking about. Adrian, you have got to tell Dr. Kroger to adjust your dosage. My dosage is fine. Everybody needs to wear one of these. Mother of mercy, what happened to you? Listen to me. You are having a terrible reaction to this medicine. I'm having a terrible reaction, all right, to you guys, all of you. - Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? - Can this wait? Because I'm about to tear this one. Look at me, Monk. Take off the glasses. Sharona's right. You need help. Leland. Leland, I, I'm fine. I feel fine. Really. My mind is clear for the first time in years. Like a curtain has been lifted, okay? Let, let's do some police work here. Is there a suspect in the house? - Yeah. He's right over there. You thought I was good before, wait till you see this. Hey, you might want to take some notes or something. - Lester highsmith. - That's me. Lester highsmith. You've been a bad boy, Lester. Me and my posse would like to have a little word with you. Lester highsmith, you were married to Marlene highsmith. Is that correct? That's right. - We're sorry about what happened. - Are you? - How long have you worked here, Les? About a year and a half. Is this guy with you? I could never work here. I couldn't wear the uniform. - It's not my scene. - I would never hire you. Were you here on Monday? - That depends. What time? - Oh, say about 12:05 P. M. Just about the time your ex was jumping off her own balcony wearing nothing but a bathrobe. - You think I killed her? - Oh, yeah. At 12:05, I was standing right here. That's true. We were with him. I have his time card right here. - You left at 12:15. - Yes, sir. I checked my voice mail. There was a message from Marlene. She was depressed again. She said she was really gonna do it this time. - Why didn't you call the police? Well, she's been threatening to jump for years. It's kind of her theme song. I drove over there to calm her down. It was a couple of miles away, but I couldn't get anywhere near the place. The whole place had roadblocks. A cop had been shot. That was me. Oh, that's tough. I know. I was shot a couple of years ago on the job. They found a gun. It was registered to your wife. - Can you explain that? - I can't. Can you? Can you? I just said I can't. I didn't even know she had a gun. What kind of car do you drive? A corolla. - What color is it? - Turquoise. - That's blue, isn't it? - I guess it is. - Did you shoot my partner? - What? No! Why would I shoot you, huh? I mean, do I even know you? Have we even met? Give me one good reason why I would hurt you, especially then, 10 minutes after my ex-wife jumps off a balcony in her bathrobe? Whoa, whoa, time-out. Time-out. How did you know she was in a bathrobe? We never said anything about a bathrobe. Yes, you did. Two minutes ago. All right. - Come on. Give me those, give me those pills. No. No, Sharona, no. The Monk needs the pills, okay? Give them to me. - No. Just don't do this. - No. - Randy. - Hey, Randy, give them to me. - No. Monk, no. - Give them to me. All right, come on, give them to me! I want them. Sharona, give them to me. - Just give them to me. - Captain! I am so out of here. - Why'd you throw it to him? - I thought he would catch it. Sorry. Will you give me those pills? - No. Adrian, give me the pills. - No. Hey, will you stop? Give me those pills? - Adrian, you're sick. - No. No, I'm well, and you can't stand it, can you? I'm doing fine without you, and it drives you crazy. - Come on. - I'm happy, Sharona, for the first time in years, and I love it. I love the Monk. Is that your car? Pretty righteous, huh? - You can't afford this! - I couldn't afford not to buy it. You wouldn't understand. Will you please call Dr. Kroger? Will you please call Dr I thought you'd be happy for me. But you're just like the others. You're a big L-7. It's a square. That's what you are. - Where are you going? - New orleans. Mardi gras. Mardi gras's not for another nine months! Hey, you know what they say. wherever the monk is, it's mardi gras. Oh, you're going down! Hold on, hold on, I got you! I got you! What are you doing? Having fun. Horsing around in the pool. Could you please stop that, sir? Hey, hey, I'm heading down to New orleans for mardi gras. Ever been? I went last year. That is so tight. But dig it. The Monk on Bourbon street. That should be pretty wild, am I right? Seriously, seriously, cut it out. Hey, you guys wanna come? I got a car. - I can't. My old man would kill me. Your old man's bringing me down. That whole generation Man, they just don't get it. He's younger than you. Word. So what do you guys want to play now? You ever play a game called Marco polo? Marco! Marco! Marco! Marco! Wait, I'm not sure I get A citywide manhunt continues today for the gunman who shot and wounded deputy chief of detectives, Leland stottlemeyer on Monday. Stottlemeyer, who's still recovering from his wounds, spoke to reporters today outside of police headquarters. We're asking anyone with any information to please come forward if they've seen anything unusual. We believe that there's somebody out there, um, shooting at cops. - Miss Fleming? - Yes. He's here. Is it you? I think so. What happened to the Monk? - Trudy didn't like him. - Neither did I. I wanted to strangle him, but that would've meant hurting you. - Yeah I don't remember. Did I, did I say anything stupid? - No. I mean, no more than usual. So, tell me, why did you want me to meet you here? Well, there's something wrong with this room. It's been bothering me. Do you have a copy of the suicide note? ""The pain is too much. I'm so sorry."" ""The pain is too much. I'm so sorry."" ""The pain is too much. I'm so sorry."" - Sharona. - What? - Where's the pen? - What pen? This note was written with a red pen. I don't see a red pen in here, do you? - No. I mean, the letter was written over here, but No red pen. But no red pen. And there wasn't one on the body when she jumped. Somebody else wrote that note. Get a wipe ready? - What is it? - It's the first suicide note. The real one. Two years ago in Cincinnati, I helped my husband stage an armored car robbery. Oh, my god. Here. Officer! Officer! Listen, I want you to call the captain, tell him that there's an armed robbery in progress at the mountain view industrial park, do you understand? Come on, it's 2 miles away. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, we're on our way now! We'll meet you right there. He wants to know if it's the old you or the new you. - Blinker, blinker, blinker, blinker! - You hear that? He says welcome back. Fill him in! Captain, yes, it was Lester highsmith. He's definitely the guy. Dog, dog! Yeah, right. We found his ex-wife's suicide note. The real one! That's what this whole thing has been about Trolley, trolley, trolley! Aah! Look out! Lester and Marlene were, aah! Lester and Marlene pulled an armored car job two years ago. Right, and they were planning another one. But Marlene was racked by guilt. She couldn't go through it again. She spilled her guts out in that suicide note. You missed it! What are you.. Whoa. Listen to this. Two years ago, in Cincinnati, I helped my husband stage an armored car robbery. We killed the driver. And now he wants us to do it again Friday, 10:00 A. M., at the mountain view industrial park. I'd rather die. May god forgive me. Before Marlene killed herself, she called Lester and left him a message. She must've mentioned the note she had just written. Lester knew that note could send him to death row, so he had to recover it before we found it. Listen to this. That was a red light. He got to her building, but he was too late. Some cops had already shown up. He couldn't go inside. He had to stop them from finding that note. He needed a diversion something serious enough to draw the cops away from her building. - But what? - Shooting me. Exactly! He drove a few blocks and shot the first cop he saw. He knew every officer in the city would respond, including the two cops that were outside Marlene's building, which meant he had plenty of time to go back to her place, destroy the real suicide note, and replace it with one of his own. - A stop sign is not a suggestion! - Yes, it is! Sorry, Kelly. Nothing personal. Lester! Drop the gun! Just drop it! Drop it. You. Is that a water pistol? No. Maybe. It's hot water. It's scalding. Scalding hot water. Just drop it. Highsmith, drop it! Drop the gun! Get down! Get down! Show me your hands! Show me your hands! Down, down! Down on your knees! Hey, Lester, you remember my partner, don't you? You put a bullet in his shoulder. You got anything to say to him? Yeah. It's all right, Randy. He's got at least 50 years to think of something. Good job, son. Get this piece of crap out of here. Do you think Dr. Kroger would want me to throw these away? I think everybody wants you to throw them away. You understand that if, if I toss these out, you'll never see the Monk again. - I missed you. - I missed me, too. I love you."
"MONK Season 3 Epi. 10 Mr. Monk and the Red Herring It's been three months. How are you holding up? Well, I've made a decision. - Good. When she comes back, I'm not gonna pay her for the weeks she missed. I have to draw the line. - I'm docking her pay. - Adrian - Sharona is not coming back. - She'll be back. Believe me. I, I think I know her a lot better than you do. Didn't she sell her house? - Yes. And she moved back to New Jersey. - Yes. And she remarried her ex-husband. I'm not sure I like where you're going here. Adrian, Sharona is moving on with her life, and if you loved her, you'd be happy for her. She wasn't just my assistant. I know. - When she found me, I was drowning. - She saved my life. - I know. I know. I was there. You're a doctor. Can't you make her come back? What would you like me to do? Fly back to New Jersey and drug her, bring her back here? No. But thank you. She's pretty smart. She'd probably escape. Adrian, you were lucky to know her. And I know you'll always be grateful, but it's time for you to move on. You've gotta start looking for your new assistant. - Impossible. Yeah, well, that's what you said before you found Sharona. But, Adrian, you've got to start looking. Your new assistant is out there somewhere. God help her. I've been a registered nurse for 14 years. These are my references. Your staple's crooked. I've been voted California nurse of the year three years in a row. Mm-hmm, yeah. What's up with this staple? You're looking for someone to start right away? - That's right. What would my hours be? - 9 A. M - until? - Until one - 1 P. M? - Until one of us dies. So who was he? So far he's John Doe. No wallet, no I. D. We're running the prints now. Miss Teeger, I'd like to go through the story. Um, you heard a noise, you came to check it out. He comes, he grabs you from behind. - Right. You struggle. Now, there were some scissors on that table. What were they doing there? Julie, my daughter, was working on a school project. - Where's the girl? - She's with a neighbor. - Didn't see anything. - Good. So you grabbed the scissors and you stabbed him? I wasn't trying to kill him. Maybe I was. I, I don't know. Natalie. You had every right to defend yourself. - where's your husband? - Uh, he died. Uh, six years ago. He's a, uh, was a navy pilot. - I'm sorry. - Captain, why are they doing this? - What do they want from me? - Who's ""they""? There was, uh another intruder two days ago. On Tuesday, a man came to my house. He said he was here to check my water meter. But he didn't go downstairs. I, I caught him over there just looking around. But when he saw me, he ran out the back door. We called water and power, but there's no record. And this was a different guy? - Yeah. You're sure about that? - Yeah. Sir. There's gotta be a connection here. Do you know the odds against two different men breaking into the same house in the same week? No, I don't. Do you? No. Is there anything of value in your house? Yeah. My daughter. Of course. I mean cash or jewelry? - Medicine? - No. - Drugs? - No. And you've never seen these men before? Either this guy or the meter guy? - No. Huh. Miss Teeger, there's a person we sometimes bring in. He's a former detective. He sort of specializes in cases like this. Great, let's call him. It's not that easy. You see, he's, uh, he's taking some time off. He's sort of working through one or two personal issues right now. But I think if you were to talk to him and ask him yourself, he might change his mind. Mr. Monk, I'm a little confused. - Me, too. See, I'm a registered nurse. And physically, you seem to be fine. Are you looking for a housekeeper? No, what? No, no. I, I, I can clean the house. Don't worry about that. That's covered. She didn't give me any notice. I guess she was worried that I'd have a nervous breakdown or But, but her son, Benjy, he he gave me this letter. - He left me this. - It's in a baggie. It's an evidence bag. Read the P. S. - Did you read the P. S.? - Yeah, it's heartbreaking. Uh, Mr. Monk, can I be honest with you? - I wish you wouldn't. - I've had tons of patients like you. There is nothing wrong with you. It's all up here. - It's psychological. - Right, right. What you really need is a wife. Oh, whoa. Uh, we just met. Okay? I don't even know you. It's not me. I'm not proposing to you. It's a statement of fact. - Excuse me. - you gotta stop whining, you know? - There, there's no smoking. - Sharona moved away, wah, wah, wah. You know what? You have got to get out of the house. You gotta do something. Go bowling. You know, meet some people. - That is my advice to you. - You gotta, you gotta put that out! All right. Don't get all twisted up. There. It's out. And so am I. Another morning shot to hell. Hold upright. Pull away pin. Stand eight feet from the flame. One, two, three, four Hello? Mr. Monk? - Hello? Mr. Monk? - One, two, three Are you okay? - What are you doing? - Measuring. It says eight feet, stay back! You know, they, they mean approximately. - No, no. It doesn't say approximately. You have to trust the label makers, professional label makers. - Just give me that! - Wait a second, you're too close! Are you okay? We did it. I'm gonna write these people a letter. We could've been killed. They should say ""approximately."" - Are you Monk? - Yeah. - Adrian Monk? - Right. The detective? The famous, admired, respected detective? If you still want the job, we can go talk in the kitchen. - What job? - Aren't you here from the agency? No. I came here to hire you. I'm Natalie Teeger. Captain Stottlemeyer said that you might be able to help me. - No. He said you were the best cop he's ever met. I guess he's never seen you put out a fire. Well, I'm sorry, but, um, I'm not really taking any work right now. I recently lost a dear friend. Oh. I'm so sorry. Who died? Nobody died. My nurse quit. The captain said you might change your mind. - Well Okay, look, I can pay you. I'm not rich, but I can borrow money if I have to. No. - I can take out a loan. I can't. Um, I just, I can't. There was a man in my house last night. I killed him. There was another man in my house a couple of days ago. They're after something. I can't figure it out. Nobody can. Do you have kids? - No. I do. I have an 11-year-old daughter. Mr. Monk, I don't say this very often. - I'm scared. - Yeah, look. Please, help me. Please, help us. It's okay. Is there money in the house? - No. What about the coffee can? Isn't that where you hide your money? How did you know that? There's coffee grounds on the counter indicating that it's been opened recently, but you don't have a coffeemaker. Wow, he's like Velma from Scooby-doo. I, I had money in there, but I spent in on luxury items like food and rent. You grew 5/8s of an inch. - Your husband was in the navy? - Yeah, he died six years ago. He was a pilot. And you recently started dating again. - How did you know that? - It's patently obvious. I happened to notice these in your coat pocket. Birth control pills. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I can't believe you just did that! Right in front of my daughter? What is wrong with you? Do you have, like, zero social skills? Mom, it's okay. I'm not a baby. Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Oh, my mistake. These are not birth control pills. These are, these are Tic-tacs. Just little pink and green Tic-tac candies. But don't eat them. They're They're special, adult, you know, Tic-tacs Detective Monk, what What do you think these guys are after? I don't know. Okay, we, we have two intruders? One last night, one two days ago. Both in this room? - Where were they exactly? - Uh, just around the television, Is this yours? Um, no, mine's over there. It's brand-new. It's never been used. I can't believe all those detectives missed that. Well, they probably saw it. They just didn't give it a second thought. - Do you have a baggie? - Uh, yes. Is this light always on? Actually, it was off last night. I didn't turn it on. - Me neither. - Tell me about the fish. - His name is Mr. Henry. My father gave him to me. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You think they're after the fish? Why? You smell that? What is that? It's a pet store. Haven't you ever been in a pet store? - No. What have you been doing? For one thing, I've been avoiding pet stores. - Hey, Carl. - Hello, Mrs. Teeger. Hey. I wanna talk to you about this fish. Is there anything special? Anything unusual about him I should know? Like what? Is he sick? - He looks okay to me. - No, no, I mean, - is he valuable? - He's just a marble fish, Mrs. Teeger. We sell them for 99 cents. We got about a thousand of them. - If you'd like your money back.. - No, Carl, I'm not returning him. Is there any reason why someone might want this particular fish? I mean, really, really want him? Uh, well, he's sorta pretty. And he's got a thin, black stripe on his dorsal fin Mr. Monk, what do you think? Mr. Monk? Look at this guy. He's eating out of two trays at one time. He's keeping them even. They're perfectly even. Yeah, it's sergeant pepper. Hey, you want him? You can have him for free. We can't get rid of him. Customers keep bringing him back. How come? Mm, he's depressing, he doesn't talk, he just mopes around, cleaning himself, straightening up his cage. His cage always has to be perfect. - What's wrong with him? - His wife died. Yeah. That's right. We had a female in there with him. She died about a year ago. He hasn't been the same ever since. Well, why don't you put another female in there? - It won't work. He'll never feel the same way about anybody else. Yeah, that's right. We tried it, but I'm afraid sergeant pepper's just gonna grow old and die alone in his little cage. So what was her name? Trudy. It's a goldfish. Well, technically, it's a crimson marble fish. Is it extinct? If it was extinct, we wouldn't be looking at it, would we? Is it rare? Valuable? - Costs about a dollar. Any pet store has a hundred of them. I don't know. He brought a fishing net into the house. And he turned on the light over the aquarium. Well, does anybody have any ideas? Maybe it swallowed something. Like, a diamond. Does anybody besides Randy have any ideas? Monk, come here. Look, how's it going? I've been worried about you. No, uh, I've been worried about me, too. How are those interviews going? Did you find anybody? I've narrowed it down. To nobody. Whatever happened with your wife's niece? The one who's the nurse? - She never called me. - Yeah, I know. Um here's the thing, Monk. - I love her. - I understand. Captain! We IDed the intruder that, uh, miss teeger killed. Brian Lemmon. Minor league creep. - Does that ring a bell? - Nah, never heard of him. One, two, three five falls. Couple of B&E's and receiving stolen property. Was there an address book or anything in his wallet? - No wallet, no keys. - This is, uh, all we found. - It was in his back pocket. - ""2:30 Sea of Tranquility."" - What is that? A club? - No, I don't think so. Who'd want to go to a club called the Sea of Tranquility? Besides you. I think it's some kind of spa or holistic retreat No, it's not a spa? It's an exhibit at the science museum. My kid went there last week on a field trip. Mitch wanted to be an astronaut. That was his dream. Three days after his plane went down, he got a registered letter from NASA. He'd been accepted into their training program. - It hurts, I know. - Life goes on. Doesn't it? Hello! I'm a white corpuscle! I'm an important part of your body's defense system. I travel through your bloodstream and I fight bacteria and diseases. Would you like to know more about me? No. I'd like to know less about you. They weren't big on dental hygiene, were they? - Natalie. - Hm? This man didn't freeze to death. He was murdered. There's a puncture wound in the side of his skull. It was over 30,000 years ago. Well, there's no statute of limitations on murder. I think I know what happened. Detective Monk, why don't we solve my case first? Then we'll come back here later and figure out who killed Og, okay? Welcome to the Sea of Tranquility, where, on July 20th, 1969, commander Neil Armstrong took one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Those of us that are old enough to have seen it will never forget it. Now, over here is the highlight of our exhibit. This is an actual moon rock that was brought back by the crew of Apollo 11. There are only 234 moon rocks that were brought back to planet Earth. And we've cut a little hole here in the side of the exhibit so that you can reach in with your fingers and touch it if you want to. That's the guy. - Who, the tour guide? - He's the meter reader. That's the guy that was in my house. This is called a plasma sphere. And inside the sphere, there are millions of ions reacting to the electrical charge to create what? - You said the meter man had black hair. - He must've been wearing a wig. But that's the guy. I work in a bar. I'm good with faces. Maybe we should say something. See how he reacts. No, if he is the guy, we don't want him to know we know. - Okay. - Let's go. Welcome to the Miracle of Birth. Sexual reproduction is the fertilization of the female egg We're gonna step carefully through this opening into the womb, and then we're gonna take a left up the fallopian tubes. Here we go. Do it carefully. That's it. Turn sideways if you have to. Now you're in the womb. Go left up the fallopian tubes. There we go. Welcome to the Miracle of Birth. Oh, no. No, no. Detective Monk, hurry up. He's getting away! You are standing in the uterus Hurry! What are you doing? Wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Wait, listen. Maybe I should've mentioned this earlier, but I, see, the thing is, I have a number of phobias. - You? No. - Oh, yes. Yes, and one of them, near the top of the list, actually, is the miracle of birth. You're gonna be okay. Just take my hand. Okay, fetus ahead! Oh, no! Ooh, I can't go up there. Ah, I, I don't even know this woman. Okay, but we're gonna lose him! - Pretend you're in a funhouse! - Funhouse, no. What's fun about fallopian tubes? I can't, I gotta I can't now. Okay, you know what, just forget it, okay? - We're outta here. - Okay. No, no, no. We have to go through the pelvis. I think this is gonna be a cesarean. Here he is. Lyle Peck, tour guide. Okay, all right. I will have the captain run a check on him. I can't believe you freaked out like that. Human sexuality is a natural thing. Well, we disagree about that. Are you hungry? Here you go. You bought this kit in the gift shop at the museum? Uh-huh. Was the box open when you bought it? Maybe, I don't know. You think they're after something from the kit? Well, Peck works at the museum. He might've stashed something in the box, and now he's trying to get it back. Honey, when you bought this, did you give them your name? I might've signed a mailing list. What exactly was in the kit? Um, a rock, a treasure chest, a deep sea diver, and some gravel. - Look in the treasure chest. - Nah, nothing. - What about the gravel? - I don't see it. I'd like to take this whole aquarium back to the lab. - Okay. Oh, wait, you know what, you can't. Uh, there's a science fair at Julie's school tonight. - This is her project. - Not anymore. - What do you mean? - Mr. Franklin disqualified me. He disqualified you? Mr. Franklin, I'm Natalie Teeger. I'm Julie's mother. Oh, yes. I remember you from parents' night. Excuse the mess. We've been making volcanoes. Did you tell Julie that she couldn't bring her fish to the science fair? Yes. I did. Mrs. Teeger, sit, please. Or stand. That's fine. Mrs. Teeger, you need to understand I teach science, not science fiction. I can't approve a project if a student is just making things up. Are you saying Julie is lying? I don't know what to say. I've seen Julie's fish. It's an ordinary crimson marble fish. She said she's had it since she was five. - Yeah, that's right. - That's impossible. A marble fish lives a year, year and a half at most. Either Julie's mistaken, or she's trying to pull a fast one. Either way, I have an obligation to my other students. What are you doing? - Well, I was not happy about the way - Okay, you know, it doesn't matter. What do you call a guy who studies fish? - An ichthyologist. - That's what you are. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. I really don't think I am. - Yeah, for the next five minutes, you are. I need you to tell Julie's teacher that a marble fish can live longer than two years, okay? Wait a minute, what? Wait, Natalie. Wait a second. Wait. Here's the thing. Uh, I can't lie. Uh, I'm not good at it. I got lucky with that Tic-tac thing. - Are you a man? - Am I - Are you a man? - Yes. Then you can lie. That's what men do. Mr. Franklin? Uh, when Julie told me about your problem, I called Berkeley and talked to the science department, and found my own expert. This is professor Larry Tilburn. He was kind enough to meet me here this morning. - Hi. - Hello. - He's an ick icky - Ichthyologist. Ichthyologist. He's world renowned. Has written just a page-turner of a book on fresh water fish. - Really? What's it called? - Fresh water fish, by Larry Tilburn. - Great title. I tried to read it, and just forget it. Professor? Professor Tilburn? Professor Tilburn. Mr. Franklin here doesn't think that Julie's fish you know the one that I showed you, could live longer than a year or two. What do you think? - I think it can. - I don't see how. It's a common variety marble fish. Has a miniscule genome size and almost no immune system. Let's go. Let's get outta here. That's true. That's true about most marble fish. But this is a completely different species. This is the north korean marble fish. North korean? It's a very strong fish. It's a very tough fish. Would have to be to live in a country like, uh - North korea. - Right. This fish could live for oh, my god, three or four years. Four and a half or five. Or six. Or six, six, that's it. - Six years. - I'd like to read your book. What did you say your name was? Tilburn. Larry - T, I, L, B, U, R, N? - Okay, okay, okay, okay! Truth is, it's not the same fish. - Yes, it is. Sure it is. - Let it go. I've replaced it every year. Julie's dad gave it to her before he died. I don't have the heart to tell her the truth. It's all that she has left of him. So, Mr. Franklin, if you wanna call that little girl and tell her that the fish that she's been talking to and praying to for the last six years is dead then, you know what, go ahead! I'll dial it for you. Okay, okay. I didn't know. She can bring the fish to the science fair. If you like, I'll even swing by your house later and pick up the aquarium. - Thank you. - But I can't give her an award. Mr. Franklin, she doesn't need an award. She just needs to make it through middle school without falling apart. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. You really are the worst liar in the whole world. I tried to tell you that. An honest man. Who'd have thunk it? Come on, Larry. I'll take you home. Just be a minute. I have to pick up my check. It's a nice place. It's a toilet. - Uh, wouldn't exactly call it a toilet. - Um, have a seat. - Where? Well, there's a lot of chairs. Take your pick. How about that one? Or that one? Natalie, so I've been thinking. Uh, if you, if you really hate it here. I mean, if you're really not happy, if you really hate it here I am looking for a new assistant. Thank you, Adrian. I appreciate that. But I'm not the ""girl friday"" type. Yeah, I understand. I couldn't work for me, either. To tell you the truth, I don't know how, how Sharona lasted as long as she did. Hey, Clem, I need to pick up my paycheck. - Yeah, right here. Actually, I was just about to call you. Carly just walked. I need you to fill in tonight. Yeah, I can't help you. There's a science fair at my kid's school. Well, I got a kid, too, but I'm here. - Your kid's in jail, Clem. - You think that's funny, huh? You know, Teeger, I'm getting pretty tired of your attitude. All right, the last time I asked you to help me out here, you bailed on me. Are you talking about yesterday? Sorry I couldn't be here, Clem. I was watching the cops carry a body out of my house. Yeah. I heard about that. Well, I guess you did what you had to do. - Yeah. And that's exactly what I'm doing right now. I got a business to run, Teeger. So you wanna see more of these or not? - Fine. I'll be here. - Good. Where are you? Ready? - Natalie. I know what they're after. - You do? - Where's Julie? Where, where's Julie? This is my fire extinguisher. I invented it myself using an oxygen tank, some compressed air, and an ordinary garden hose. - Where is she? - I don't know. I don't know. - Oh, Stacy. Have you seen Julie? - I think she's over there. Captain, thank you for coming. Okay, fill me in. I know what they've been after. Look. - The moonrock? - It's the most valuable rock in the world. It's more valuable than any diamond. A rock half this size was sold in Japan for $2 million. Okay. - Well, I knew that I had seen that rock before somewhere. It was in Julie Teeger's aquarium. It was right in front of us the whole time. Here's what happened. There's a tour guide at the museum named Peck. Lyle Peck. Last weekend, he stole the moonrock. It was probably Sunday night after they closed. He waited until the guards were distracted or between shifts. Peck has worked there for years. He's practically a fixture, so he definitely knew the routine. Why didn't the museum report it? The museum never missed it. They didn't know it was stolen. They still don't. Peck replaced it with an exact duplicate. Wait, you mean this is just a regular rock? Son of a bitch, I stood in line for half an hour just to touch this stupid thing. Right. But Peck had a problem. He still had to get the moonrock out of the building. They were searching everybody. Even the employees. So since there was no way for him to get it through security, he had to improvise. He hid the rock in the gift shop. Inside one of those aquarium kits. Then he marked the box. He probably planned to have his accomplice, Brian Lemmon, pick it up the next morning. But the girl got there first. Exactly, Julie Teeger bought it that morning and took it home. The next day Peck tried to steal it, posing as a meter reader. When that didn't work, Brian Lemmon broke in. But he didn't count on Natalie waking up or that pair of scissors. - What? - You're back. - Natalie. - This is Mr. Henry. - We gotta grab that rock. - Mr. Henry is a marble fish. And most marble fish only live for about a year. But Mr. Henry is six years old, and he's still as frisky as ever. And that is thanks to my special diet of ground-up vitamins, rice crispies, and cucumbers. Fire! It's on fire! All right, everybody stay calm. No running. Stay calm. Here use this. It's a fire extinguisher. Thanks, kid. - What's in this? - Turpentine. He stole my fish! - Hey! - Peck! Oh, god. I got him. Peck! Don't move. On your face. Look out, I got a fish here! Coming through, flapping around! Flapping fish here! Oh, Monk! Monk. - Get him. - Get him. Hurry, hurry. Look out! Coming through. Coming through. You saved him. Pretty crazy day, huh? Think you'll be able to sleep? Yeah, I think so. How's Mr. Henry? Oh, he's fine. He's a very brave fish. Mr. Monk saved his life. You know that moonrock is worth over two million bucks? But when Mr. Henry was in trouble, Mr. Monk forgot all about that moonrock. All he cared about was saving Mr. Henry. I could only think of one other man in the whole world who would have done something like that. - Daddy? - Daddy. - I love you, angel. - Love you, too. - Okay, good night. - Good night. Oh, sleep well. Mr. Monk, it's Natalie Teeger. Yeah, I was calling to see if you still needed the assistant. No, I can't come tonight. Because I can't leave my daughter. Okay, okay, okay, just relax. How big is the spider?"
"That, of course, is a clip from the classic Sonny Chow film called. Legend of the Cobra. Got to be one of my favorites. We're talking with John Ricca. He is the author of a sensational new book about the late, great martial arts superstar, called Paper Cobra. I believe you're supposed to hold the book up when you say that. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. You know, John, - this book is very controversial. - I hope so. And, in the book, you claim that many of Sonny Chow's stunts, including the ones we were just showing you, were actually performed by stunt doubles. I don't just claim it. I prove it. And you say that for most of his career, Sonny Chow was addicted to morphine. That's right. That's what killed him. Wasn't a brain hemorrhage, like the studio said. We've all heard these rumors, this notion that Sonny Chow isn't actually dead. The story goes that a Hong Kong drug cartel put a price on his head Believe me, Karen, Sonny Chow is dead. I talked to the medical examiner who did the autopsy, and I've seen the death certificate. Well, based on the way you talk about Sonny Chow in this book, you better hope he's dead. Idiot. That's the last time I do your show. Hello? My God! Who are you? What do you want? What do you want? No, no, no! No, this is impossible. Chow, is that you? No. MONK Season 3 Epi. 11 Mr. Monk vs. the Cobra Ah. - No, W-Wait, what's wrong with that one? The ""K"" went below the line. N-no, don't throw it away! Mr. Monk, please, I am begging you. We've been here for three hours. We've paid two bills. I don't think the bank will take this. T-they'll cash it. I I promise. If I'm wrong, I'll pay your water bill myself. But, uh, let me just start over. I I It'll only take a minute. - What are you doing, now? - There you go. - Don't, don't, don't, don't! - Too late. Already sealed it. Do you want it? You'll have to rip open the envelope. Good. All right, next thing, um - Here you go. - What? Wh-what's this? Those are my expenses. They come to $310. Oh, I don't pay those. Oh, Mr. Monk, they're all business-related. Here, look, um This is my gas bill, from driving you around all day. - Uh-huh. - This is my cell phone bill. All these calls are from you. And this is from the drugstore. I'm buying over 200 wipes a week. Here's the thing. I pay you exactly what I paid Sharona. I didn't pay her expenses. Here's the thing. I am not Sharona. I'm an individual. I'm unique. Don't ever compare me to anybody else. Sharona used to say the exact same thing. Word for word. Isn't that funny? Mr. Monk, are you going to reimburse me or not? I would, if I could. But I can't afford it. Oh, look, it's the Captain. It's probably about a job. Aren't you gonna answer that? No, I don't want to go over my maximum minutes. You've got to be the cheapest man I've ever met. Hello? Yes, sir, he's right here. Well, that sounds fascinating. Really? Well, I hope the crime scene is within walking distance, 'cause I'm not drivin' him. Get a list of tenants. Start knockin' on doors. Lieutenant, I thought you had the perimeter. Fist of the Cobra. 1975. I've got that same poster in my room. Oh, look at this. That's from Ten Fingers of Doom. He broke his arm doing that stunt. He still finished the scene, though. - Oh, my God! - What? He's got a bootleg copy of Enter the Cobra. Can I have this? No, you can't have it, Detective. This is a crime scene. Let's watch it. Fine, I'll put it back. Sir, I've got a theory on this. This guy John Ricca, he's published a book about Sonny Chow, right? Right. - Well, it's a real hatchet job. I mean, it made the Cobra look terrible. - ""The Cobra""? - Sonny Chow. I mean, maybe we should be looking for a Sonny Chow fan. I mean, they all hated the book. And most of them are pretty nuts. I mean, I see them at conventions all the time, and they are real fanatics. Captain? Monk, thank you for coming. Miss Teeger. I assume that they filled you in downstairs. More or less. How did he enter the building? He broke in through a door on the roof around 4:00 a. m. But get this, when he left after the murder, he took the elevator down and ran out. He didn't mind being seen. - Uh-uh. Was he really killed with nunchakus? - Yeah. Hmm, check this out. Gold-plated. Look at those insignias. Sonny used a pair just like these in Ninja Fury. The killer left these behind? Well, they either belong to the killer or the victim. I mean, he was writing a book on all of this crap. Captain. Here's the videotape you wanted. Ah, thank you. Elevator B at 4:07. Let's have a look. - Can't even see his face. - He looks like the Cobra. And Sonny wore a uniform just like that in Kung Fu Assassins. Sonny Chow is dead. - Doctor, give me the good news. - He was clutching some hair. He must have grabbed it off the killer's head. That means we have a good shot at some DNA. How could he grab any hair? We just saw the tape. The intruder was wearing a hood. Well, it could've fallen off during the fight. It gets weirder. The victim wrote you a note. ""Ow."" Why would anybody write ""ow""? Usually that's something you'd say. Oh, my God. Chow. He's alive. Sir, the rumors are true. He's been hiding out overseas, just waiting for the right time to make a comeback. - Captain, he's alive. - Nah. Nah, there's got to be another explanation, right? Wipe. Oh, you know what, these are mine. I paid for them. Captain. - Hey, got a minute? - Sure. What are you doin'? Well, nothing, I was just polishing the the light bulbs. What's going on? Uh, you remember that convention I went to in Atlanta about three years ago? Uh Well, something happened there that I didn't tell you about. I landed, I hailed a cab, and I recognized the cab driver. It was Harold Burnshaw. - Burnshaw? - Burnshaw. He used to be a Fed. He was a real player. He used to head the FBI's field office in Atlanta until the 1996 Olympic games. - The plaza bombing? - Exactly. They accused the wrong guy. Burnshaw booted it big time on network television. Instant career killer. Now he's drivin' a cab. Monk, you should've seen his face. I'll never forget it. Well, uh, what does this have to do with - Twenty years ago, Sonny Chow froze some of his own blood in the event that he needed surgery. So they've got bulletproof DNA for a comparison. And that's a prelim on the hair we found at the crime scene. - It's a match. - It's Sonny Chow's hair. No question about it. He's been dead for six years, and he's my primary suspect. - Yeah. Now, if I go public with this and I'm wrong I'm going to wind up at the airport, picking up cops who still have jobs. Can you help me with this? I mean, I've got to know. I've got to be certain: Is this guy alive or dead? I thought Sonny Chow lived in Hollywood. No, he lived in this house, before he became famous. Then he moved back here when he was sick. According to his file, this is where he died. Or did he? Whoo! No, don't, don't don't do that. - What's this guy's name? - Zee Tai Wen. They called him Master Zee. He was Sonny Chow's mentor. If Chow is still alive, Master Zee would know it. Look, Mr. Monk, can we please talk about reimbursing me? Not now. Hello. We phoned earlier. I'm Adrian Monk. This is Natalie Teeger. We're helping the police with a very important matter. - How are you? - I am well. Hello. How are you? - Well, how are you? - Do not be insulted. Wee Ling has not spoken in nine years. A vow of silence. He is cleansing his soul. You should give that a shot. We were hoping to speak with Master Zee. Please, come in. The Master always has time for a stranger in need. Please remove your shoes. Oh. Oh. Here's the thing. I'd rather not, if that's okay? There are no exceptions, Mr. Monk. Even the Master's feet are bare. I understand. Here's the thing. I'm a little shy. I never I never go barefoot. It's true, I've never seen his feet. I've never seen my feet. For all I know, I could have 18 toes. - He's good. - So, you are refusing. Not just that. Uh, I would like to ask all of you, as a favor, as a personal favor, to put your shoes back on. If that's not too much trouble. I am sorry, Mr. Monk, but I must ask both of you to leave. Where are you going? Where It's not that big a deal. Just take off the shoes. - Take 'em off. - Okay. Um, have the the rugs been cleaned recently? And shampooed? I don't know. Has the Master heard of athlete's foot? Because the fungus and the bacteria, can get up in between the toes Oh, for Christ's sake, just take 'em off! Wee Ling, you have spoken. You must begin again. Oh, forget it. Nine years, huh? - Please don't look. - You have nice feet. You shouldn't be embarrassed. Oh, yeah. Students from around the world come to study at Master Zee's feet. His bare feet? That is correct. This is where Sonny Chow, learned the art of Bow Yu Chuan. This is where he became the Cobra. Did you know him? Can one man truly know another man? Okay, but did you ever meet him? Yes. Once, near the end. He was very sick, could not speak. But his spirit was strong. He was a great man. Well, there's there's a rumor that he is still alive. Sonny Chow is alive in all of us. Right. Right. Right. But is is is he here? Right here, right now? You're a very curious man, Mr. Monk. He certainly is. Let me let me ask you, are you guys reimbursed for your business-related expenses, Natalie - like your laundry, and these boards that everybody's breakin'? Who pays for that stuff? - Natalie. Please stay here. I will see if Master Zee is ready for you. I told you I cannot afford to pay your expenses. Okay, then what about this? I do your bills with you, remember? This is a rent receipt. You're renting an office downtown for $600 a month? That's right. Wh-when was the last time you were there? I I never use it. It's just sitting there, empty? I could really use that money, Mr. Monk. - I don't wanna talk about it. - You don't wanna talk about it. All right, then let's do this. We'll ask the wizard what he thinks and then we'll both agree to do whatever he says. First off, he is not a wizard. We are not over the rainbow. We're in the middle of a homicide investigation. This is a serious matter. - I'm going to ask him. - No, don't ask him. I'm asking him. - What did you do? - Sorry. He was a little off center. It was not, you know, in harmony. The Master will see you now. A great sorrow has entered this room. That would be me. And there is a woman with you. She is very beautiful. How can you tell? I could hear Mr. Huang's heart beating faster. Now that I see you, it is obvious why. Master Zee, my name is Adrian Monk. This is Natalie Teeger. We would like to ask you some questions about Sonny Chow. You were his teacher? That is true. But I also learned from him. A man was murdered t-two nights ago, and there is evidence that Sonny Chow was responsible. Cobra is dead, Mr. Monk. Are you sure about that? He died in my arms six years ago. I felt his spirit leaving his body. If he were still alive and you were hiding him, that would be a very serious crime. It would be worse than a crime. It would be a lie. A man who speaks only the truth has nothing to fear. Don't you agree? Yes, I do. I'm sorry. I disappointed you. But I am feeling something else. Oh, my. A troubled soul. You are on a quest, Mr. Monk. That's right. You live in a very dark place. The darkness is your fear. Take this as a gift. Light is your weapon, Mr. Monk. Be the light. Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me, Mr. Master man. I am also troubled. He is not paying me what he promised. - That is not true. - Could you please talk to him? There's no way I can cover my expenses. Mr. Zee, I pay her exactly what I paid my other assistant. Which is exactly why she had to quit. - That's not the reason, really. - It was a factor. - I don't think you really understand - Excuse me. Miss Teeger, this man is your employer. He is your master. It is your job to serve him unquestioningly. Mr. Monk, you should not pay her any more money. - Okay. She must learn that true wealth is in the heart. Not in the bank. - It's it's not in the bank. - All right. You you are a wise and learned man. As are you. It must be a tremendous burden to possess such wisdom. It is a gift. And a curse. Exactly. - Okay, okay, oh, my God, get a room, really. I would. Just get it over with. Hello? What is it? He's alive. Sonny Chow is alive. He pulled an Elvis, faked his own death. - He pulled an Elvis? - Yes. Check this out. Six years ago, a man named Joseph Lee disappeared from a homeless shelter in the Presidio one day before Sonny Chow ""died."" They were the same height and same weight. - It could be a coincidence. - Well, we're about to find out. We just got a court order to exhume the body. They're diggin' it up now. Lieutenant, you understand if Sonny Chow is alive, he's murdered at least two people. Uh-huh. - You'd have to arrest him. I'd get to meet him. He might try to kill you. You think so? Wow, that would be so cool. Sonny Chow. Captain, how are you feelin'? I'm a nervous wreck. How'd things go with the Zen master? Oh, he said Sonny Chow died in his arms. I believe him. Good. At least the press hasn't gotten wind of this yet. Once they do, it's gonna be like Christmas morning for those vultures. - Look at that thing. - Oh, yeah. His fan club from the Philippines paid for it. Be be careful with that. - Tell him to be careful with that. - What did you say? Well, you'll wanna be careful with that. I've been doing this job since I was 18 years old. I think I know what I'm doin', all right? I don't come to your station house and tell you how to beat a confession out of some kid. Do I know you? Maybe you do. You're Chris Downey. They let you out? I did my time. Now I'm doing my job. Or at least I'm trying to. I busted this low-life for assault and armed robbery. Got me on the assault. There was no robbery. Right, we never did recover the jewels you stole. Allegedly stole. Allegedly. I love that word. All righty. What do you think? I think he's in there. For how much? Mr. Monk, this was not in my job description. Let's get out of here. Oh, I'm okay. What a beautiful pancreas. Okay, here we go. - Hello. - Oh, my God. We're so sorry to disturb you. Hey, you're the expert. Is it him or not? It's just hard to say. Sonny had a lot more hair. And skin. We'll know soon enough. It'll take two minutes to compare these with his old dental records. - I'm going with you. - Me, too. Look. I'm crazy about spleens. Why don't you ask 'em, maybe they'll give you one. You can keep it in your office downtown? It's not my office. What do you mean, it's not your office? It's Trudy's office. Yeah, all her things are in there: Her books and her pictures, her files. - I can't give it up. - It's Trudy's office? Sonny, is there an echo in here? - She died nine years ago, right? - That's right. You've been keeping an office downtown for nine years. Meanwhile, I'm counting pennies at Safeway? Get rid of the office! Put her stuff in storage or an attic. I'll do it for you. I can't. - You can't, or you won't? I can't, and I won't. So, you're just gonna have to deal with that. - I quit my job over this! - Ow! That hurt! Oh, it's only a pillow. Well, it hurt. That came from the coffin? That's a death pillow. You hit me with a death pillow? Give me a wipe. - Here. - Wipe! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I hit you with the death pillow. Mr. Monk, I lost my husband. I know what you're going through. But I have a daughter to think about. If you don't cover these expenses, I can't work for you. But it's Trudy's office. It is official. Sonny Chow is dead. - So it is him. - Yeah, it's a positive ID. All the x-rays match. Well, that was the opposite of fun. So, I guess we're back to square one. Lieutenant, see that Mr. Chow makes it back to the cemetery. And tell my old pal, Chris Downey, - to stick him back in his hole. - Yes, sir. Well, I guess I'm off the hook. - Yeah. But, what the hell's goin' on here, Monk? Well, somebody, somehow got hold of a few strands of Sonny Chow's hair and left them at the crime scene. Yeah, but why would anybody want to frame a guy that's been dead for six years? I don't know. I'm sorry, Lieutenant. Yeah, well, at least I got to have my picture with Sonny Chow. You took a picture? - Yeah. Maybe I'll donate it. - What? There's a Sonny Chow museum in Daly City. Probably give me a lifetime pass for this. There's a museum? Hello? Looks like we missed the crowd. - It says $5. - Suggested donation. I considered their suggestion. I appreciate their suggestion. - I decided to give less. - I have a suggestion for you. Oh, hey! I didn't hear you come in. Welcome to Cobra's Lair. I'm Eddie Frankel, the proprietor. You, can ask me anything about Sonny Chow. I've been a Cobra-head ever since I first saw Fist of the Cobra when I was 12. You guys big Sonny Chow fans? - You are or you wouldn't be here. - Well, we're not exactly. Well, we've the second-largest collection of his memorabilia in the country. Oh, here's an interesting fact: Most people think that Jackie Chan invented the martial arts style referred to as Wing Fu Do. But Sonny was doing triple roundhouse kicks as early as 1968. Watch the opening scene of Night of the Cobra, if you don't believe me. We believe you. We believe you. Um, I'm Adrian Monk and this is Natalie Teeger. Oh, here. Here's a pamphlet, tells you about upcoming events. Got a floor plan of the museum inside. We had a self-guided tour but my stupid cousin borrowed my headphones and never returned them. Oh, hey, almost forgot, have to stamp the back of your hand - in case you want to come back. - Hey, now that's not really necessary. Oh, here, here, here, you can stamp mine. Okay, well, um, most people start over here. And they work their way counterclockwise. As you can see it's all arranged chronologically, from the birth of the Cobra until six years ago when he faked his own death and went underground. Here, Oh, here, this is Sonny Chow's actual birth certificate. His real name was what? Anybody? Anybody? - Uh That's right! Chow Chiang Wu. He was born here in San Francisco, but raised in Hong Kong. We-we're really not here to see the museum today. Um, we're working with the police on a homicide investigation. Homicide? You mean, murder? Eddie, where were you Tuesday night around midnight? I was at home watching Blood rage Two. No, Three. Uh, I guess both. - Were you alone? - No. - I was watching with my girlfriend. - And what's her name? - Natalie. - Eddie. Eddie, is anything missing from the museum? - Like what? Like a personal item of Sonny Chow's, uh, a a piece of clothing, or or or a hat. Something that might have had his hair on it. No. There was a break-in last week. Somebody pried open the back door but they didn't take anything. Uh, excuse me, remember, you're supposed to go counterclockwise? - Is this his hairbrush? - Oh, that's right. Sonny used that brush while he was filming Death and the Darkness in 1985. I bought it from his personal hairstylist. So that's his actual hair in the bristles. Could I see that? - Sure. ""Made in Croatia."" - So? Croatia's a new country. It didn't exist until 1992. Oh, my God. I've been rooked! He sold me a phony hairbrush! I don't think so. Somebody picked this lock. Someone broke in here, took the real brush, and replaced it with this one. - Oh, my God. - What? I've got it. At least, I think I do. We got to get back to the Fair Lawn Cemetery fast. W-wait, wait, wait! Did you say Fair Lawn Cemetery? That's where Sonny Chow's empty coffin is buried. You see, the Hong Kong drug cartel, they own 20% Eddie, Eddie. Sonny Chow is dead. We dug him up three hours ago, he's dead. - It can't be true. - Sorry, Eddie. Feel this one. I don't want to feel the pillow, Mr. Monk. It's after 5:00. - It's soft, huh? They're all so soft. - I'm sure they are. But I told you, I have to have an answer by the end of today. Natalie. Natalie, you remember that pillow you threw at me, the one from the coffin? I think there was something in it. That's why it hurt. Here's what happened. That gravedigger, Chris Downey, the one that Capt. Stottlemeyer I don't care about the case, Mr. Monk. Julie is at home waiting for me. So what's the deal? Are you going to pay for my expenses or not? I'm sorry. So that's it. Well, I'm sorry, too, Mr. Monk. I guess this is goodbye. It was nice working with you. Natalie. I I I solved the case! - Aren't you interested? - I'm interested. Mr. Monk? Hello? Listen, I'm really sorry that I ran out like that, I Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk? Trudy. Hello, Adrian. - Where are we? - We're near the Botanical Gardens. Do you remember that Sunday we just walked and walked and walked? I loved that day. That was the best day of my life. Darling, I think you should put the candle out. - It's using up all the oxygen. - No. I don't care. I don't know, I don't know what happened. He mentioned something about that gravedigger, Downey. I left for maybe 30 minutes. When I came back, he was gone. So, what what do I do? What do you think? Well, I I I can't do it. I I I can't do it. - Adrian. I'm not 25 anymore. We need to talk about this sometime. What kind of father would I be? You know what my family was like. Our children will be much happier than you were, I promise. I should have said yes. I should have said yes. Turn off the motor and throw your keys out the window! Show me your hands, Downey! Show me your hands! Get out of the car! Get out of the car! Natalie, stay back. Stay back. Where's Monk? What did you do with him? Relax, Captain. He's still alive. For now. Where is he? What did you do? You'll be savin' both your lives. You wanna find your friend. I want somethin', too. I want a car to the airport. I'm already packed. I want a jet that can fly When I'm in the air, I'll tell you, A: Where I'm goin', and B: Where you can dig up Yeah, ""dig."" You can dig Oh, my God, I think he's having a heart attack! - Downey! - He's got no pulse. - Downey! Don't die on us! Don't die on us! Where's Monk? Downey! Where's Monk? Where's Monk? We both know what's happening here, Adrian. You're having what Dr. Kroger would call a psychotic break. It's a defense mechanism. How long do you have? Uh, there's Let's talk about something else. How did you know it was the gravedigger? I noticed the stamp on the back of his hand. At the time, I didn't think anything about it. But then later, I saw the exact same stamp on Natalie's hand. So you knew Chris Downey had been to the museum. That's right. He stole Sonny Chow's hairbrush. Because he needed Chow's DNA, so he could frame him for murder. - But why Sonny Chow? - So the police would exhume his body. It all started six years ago. I remember the case. Downey had stolen $500,000 in jewels from a courier. During the getaway, he assaulted an off-duty cop. He was convicted on the assault, but they couldn't get him on the robbery. - They never found the diamonds. - Exactly. He was working here at the cemetery. Before he went home, he must've stopped here and hid the jewels. Where? - In Sonny Chow's coffin. It was perfect. Chow was scheduled to be buried the next day. Downey figured he could always come back and dig it up. Even five or six years later. You felt 'em in the pillowcase. You felt 'em when Natalie hit you in the back. - That's right. I want that backhoe running. Ready and running! Keep it running! All right, listen up! We figure he's got about 40 minutes of air if he's not panicking. Figure on 15 minutes. This is Monk. I want the best you got. So, we're gonna spread out and we're gonna work the grid, all right? We're looking for fresh dirt, tire tracks, boot prints, anything! - Captain - Go, go! Captain, there's a problem. The cemetery has just expanded. They just tore down a restaurant over there. It's all dug up. It's like an acre-and-a-half. Monk could be anywhere. Captain, it's already been 20 minutes. Even if we find him, he'll be a basket case. Heads up, everybody! This way! Let's go! So Chris Downey went to prison for six years. He was paroled three weeks ago. When he came back to dig up the jewels, He must've had the shock of his life. - The monument? - Exactly. While he was gone, some fan club put up a monument. Solid granite. Weight, 3 tons. He realized he couldn't Dig the coffin up. At least, not quietly. - Uh-huh. Or by himself. So he got his old job back at the cemetery and then framed Sonny Chow for murder and got the police to dig up the jewels - For him. - Congratulations, Detective. Lot of good it does me here. All right, darling. Shh. It's all right. - I can't breathe. - It's all right. - Adrian, Adrian. - I can't - Okay, save your breath. - breathe. Save your breath. It's all right. Should we bring in the cadaver dogs? Not yet. - The traffic light's out. - What? That traffic light is out. It was working three hours ago when I got here. - Son of a bitch! - What? What? I think he cut the power line when he was digging the hole! - Dig along here! - Over here! Over here! He cut the cable, everyone! Start there! There, there! Dig along this line. Find the power cable. - You're so beautiful. I - Shh. I should have taken more pictures. Darling, don't talk. Don't talk. - Anything? - I'm not sure. Captain! He's talking. He's talking? He's saying: ""I love you."" Over here! Over here! Get that backhoe over here now! Here! Here! Adrian. Adrian, listen. Listen, they're digging. They're coming for you. Natalie must have come back to look for you. That's how they knew you were missing. - Yeah. Adrian, listen to me. I want you to do something for me. I want you to close my office and pay her what she needs. I can't I can't close it. It's just four walls and a door. It means nothing. - No. - Adrian, you have to go now. - No, no. - Adrian, you have to go. - Oh, no. You have to go. - No. - I love you. I love you. He's breathing. Get him some oxygen. Call Dr. Charles Kroger. Tell him to meet us at the hospital. He's smiling. I've never seen him look happier. Well, I guess that's it. Oh, sir, sir, sir. - The thumb tacks? - Yeah, we're takin' everything. Okay? Let's go."
"That's Julie's dance studio right there. She'll be out soon. - She has a big recital coming up. - Do you have pliers? - What for? - Huh, that antenna, it's bent. So what? Well, we could straighten it out. It'll just take a second. Well, it's none of our business. Forget about it. I happen to believe that all men are brothers. Every man's bent antenna diminishes me. - What are you talking about? - I don't know. Maybe he likes it like that. You don't know. Maybe he did it himself. He didn't bend his own antenna. People don't like things bent. People like things straight. Nice and straight. And even. I'll tell you what people like, Mr. Monk. People like people who mind their own business. Every time I poke my nose some place, I end up regrettin' it. It's bad karma. I will be right back. Stay here. Stay. Good boy. MONK Season 3 Epi. 12 Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever - Why couldn't we stay in the city? - Because a man there wants you dead. Right, I know. And that man packs a lot of muscle in the Bay Area. I know. That's why they have a witness protection program. Captain, please stay in the vehicle until we get to the cabin. What are you afraid of, Grooms? A sharp-shooting raccoon with a high-powered rifle? All right, this is not a joke, Captain. Tommy Win has already had two other federal witnesses killed. I know he has. That's why I'm here. Miss Teeger, please. Stay in the vehicle. - No. All right, you can stretch your legs. Just don't call any attention to yourself. Good advice coming from a guy wearin' a three-piece suit in the middle of the woods. - Where are we? - You're safe, that's where you are. How long do we have to stay here? - Until the deposition on Monday. - Six days. You're doing God's work. We finally have Tommy Win behind bars, and thanks to you, he's gonna stay there. Six days, piece of cake. - What? Are you okay? - I should tell you. - I'm afraid of places. - You're always someplace. This is your own fault. You should have stayed in the car. Now we're in the middle of nowhere, my kid has to stay with my parents and she is missing a whole week of school. You've got some drug lord with a price on your head plus you broke that guy's antenna. I know you mean well, but you're bad karma. Bad karma. Yeah, bad, bad. Look, are you thirsty? - Yes. Uh, here. I've got some water. I I brought two cases in the back. I can only drink Sierra Springs. - What? What, is it like some medical thing? - Yes. - Bought the wrong water. - All right, look. Make it fast. Make it fast. Hey, Monk, now remember, as long as you're here, your name is Conway. Frank Conway. We made up an ID for you. Wait, he doesn't look like me. That's a picture of you. - It is? Excuse me, do you carry Sierra Springs bottled water? In the cooler. Help yourself. - Thanks. You folks just passin' through? I'm I'm a hunter. I'm gonna do some hunting. The season doesn't start for three months. - I know. Uh, I like to get here early, get a good spot. What are you gonna do, squat in the woods for 12 weeks? Kathy? - What? It's none of our business. This gentleman isn't poking his nose into your life, is he? He can ask me anything he likes. I've got nothin' to hide. Turn that up! Martin hates country music. He never lets me play it at home, ain't that right, darling? That is why the good lord invented headphones. Oh, Martin, I got those dipsy-diggitys you were asking about. Oh, thank you much. - Yeah. Yeah. The best bass lure in the whole world. Yeah, every lure you buy is the best lure in the world. Well, that's 'cause they keep improving 'em. I'll take two. One for the fish and one for my lucky hat. Okay, that'll be $22 even. $22 go Mr. Conway, we have to go. Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway? Mr. Conway? Frank? Frank! Hello! Mr. Conway, we have to go! - Sorry. I've been calling you for five minutes. Then I should have answered you, because that is my name. Frank Conway. Thank you very much. The bureau's been using this place for 30 years. Remember that guy that testified against Marty Vincenzo? - He stayed here. - Wasn't he killed? - Yep. - Not here, he wasn't. Okay. Cell phones off and keep 'em off. Not that it matters. There's no signal up here. - All right. - The landline is for FBI use only. No calls in or out. As of this moment, we are closed off from the outside world. - Can we see the rest of it? - This is it. Look, I know it's not the Four Seasons, but we've all seen worse. I actually don't think I have. It's no picnic for me, either, but I suggest we all try to make the best of it. Try to think of it like a little vacation, hmm? - Okay. I can't do this. I can't live like this. I wanna go home. You go home now, you'll get shot in the head. - Shot in the head. - Mr. Monk, you're not going anywhere. You're going to testify in open court against Tommy Win on Monday and you're gonna stay in this cabin until you do. I'm by the door. Miss Teeger, you have the bedroom. Captain, you and Monk take the bunk bed. - Huh? Top or bottom? - Oh. Um - Okay, I'll flip a coin. Heads or tails? - Um Hey, Monk, have a seat. I'll sit when I get home. Suit yourself. Hey there, Mr. Conway. You know, I could get used to this. Yeah, it's nice. You know what would make it even nicer? - Hmm? If we were someplace else. Well, I'm gonna make the most of it. - Hey, guess what tomorrow is? - It's your birthday, of course. Happy birthday to me. What the hell happened to me, Monk? I was supposed to be the Deputy Commissioner by now. I was the fair-haired boy, remember? Youngest detective in the history of the department. And now, I'm the guy that knows how to find you. - Oh, look, Captain, there isn't - Forget about it. - Say, how's Natalie workin' out? - Oh, Natalie's great. Just pick 'em up, pick 'em up. I like her, I I trust her, and hey, I I depend on her. She'll probably be quitting soon. Hey, uh, Monk, that's just dirt. You can throw it anywhere. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. I really appreciate you comin' out here. All the way here. Especially on your birthday. - You didn't have to do this. - Yes, I did. I don't trust these guys, particularly not Grooms. You could have asked Lieutenant Disher, or I thought about that, but he has a big date. The kid thinks he's in love. - Really? - Yeah. He's the one who ought to be in protective custody. You are right. This place is great. I used to come here with my grandfather. We used to sit in that booth over there. Well, I, uh, hope your grandfather wasn't thinking what I'm thinking right now. Actually, my grandfather died last year. It's It's funny. Every time I'm here, it's like he's with me. Like I can feel him, his spirit. Thank you very much. Don't forget your cookies. My favorite part. I'm taking this one. - Okay. What does it say? ""True love has finally come your way."" No way. It does not say that. - It does not say that. - Yes, it does. Look. Read it. Wow. Maybe they know something. - Maybe they do. Okay. - Here. Here is mine. ""A friendly hand will save you from a dirty death."" Really? Wow, that's weird. - So what are you doin' tomorrow night? - What are you doing in 20 minutes? - You like to move fast, don't you? - Well, I wouldn't say that. So what do you want to name our first child? Okay, now you're scaring me. Randy! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Ooh. ""A friendly hand. A dirty death."" You hear that? Thunder. I better pull the car around. I already did and I covered the boat. What on earth would you do without me? You mean what would I do first? As soon as that insurance kicks in, I'd get me one of those new Lebarons, fully loaded, with leather seats. Yeah. Sounds like you've been thinkin' about it. Only every waking minute. Then I'd take me one of them cruises to Hawaii. Yeah, yeah, in your dreams. Oh, turn that off. You know I hate that crap. Turn it off yourself. Did you hear that? Huh? Hear what? My leg. Untie my leg. Monk. Monk! Are you ready for your fortune? I don't know after the last one. Listen, I've been thinking about my grandfather all day. I know it sounds crazy, but before he died, he said he would always look out for me. What if he's communicating with me, with us, through the cookies? Or What if it's just a coincidence? Hayley, I'm a cop. I'm gonna wait till I see some real evidence. Okay, Lieutenant, let's check out Exhibit A. ""Follow your heart."" Yeah, that's kind of boring. My turn. ""You will receive unexpected money from your uncle."" Sorry. It looks like your grandpa's having an off day. - What do you mean? - I don't have any uncles. Two aunts, but no uncles. Oh. It was fun while it lasted. Is that Adrian Monk the detective? Yeah. That's right. You know him? Yeah, we work together all the time. See, that's me. And, uh, that's me. Is he really that smart? I hear he's like Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, well, you know, it's really a team effort. - I'd love to meet him. - I'll introduce you. Really? - Yes. But not right away because he's out of town. Oh, is he working on some case? Well, I'm not at liberty to say. It's confidential. - Mmm. - Hang on. Randall Disher? - Yeah. Certified letter. Sign right here. All right, thanks. Oh, it's from the IRS. Ooh, you are in trouble now. It's a check, for $2,400 dollars. - What? - Yeah. It's a refund. It says that they've been miscalculating my taxes or the past six years. Good old Uncle Sam. Good old Uncle Sam? She's carryin' two packages, looks like ice. Exactly. She's been buying ice all day. That makes 16 bags she's carried in so far. - Maybe she's havin' a party. - No food! No beer, no chips, just ice. Maybe she's having an Adrian Monk party. The only other thing she bought today - was a new radio. - What are you gettin' at? Plus, I am positive I heard a man screaming at 1:15 last night. That was me. You tied my foot to the bed. I mean before that. It was definitely coming from that cabin. - What? - Hear that? - What? She said her husband didn't let her listen to country music in the house. Maybe he's not home. Well, where did he go? There's his boat. - They only have the one car. - Maybe he went on a walk. No, I have been watching the house all day. Captain, I have not seen him. - It's ringing. - Well, Agent Grooms said no calls. - Agent Grooms can kiss - Hello? Oh, hello, Mrs. Willowby. - Yes? - Uh, is Martin there? My name is Darrell Hindershot. I'm a friend of Martin's. We went to high school together. We're havin' a big high-school reunion. Oh, I'm so sorry. He is on the lake, fishin'. Oh, okay. Well, I'll I'll try back, then. - You do that. - Thank you very much. She says he's on the lake fishing. She killed him. Oh, you've got to be kidding. Can't I take you anywhere? She was playing country music? - Oh, yeah. - And buying ice. - That's right. About 20 bags. Okay, I've seen this before. You're cooped up for a long time away from home under a lot of stress, you begin to imagine things. I'm not imagining anything. I heard him screaming. - Then their lights flickered. - And he hasn't been seen since. Uh-huh, it's not exactly a slam-dunk, is it? Well, it sure as hell is probable cause. It's only thunder. It's only thunder. It can't hurt you. - What do you want me to do? - Do your job. Call the sheriff. If I call the local yokels they're gonna want to talk to Monk. I can't allow that. W-what kind of cop are you? I'm a cop who has his priorities straight, Captain. It's my job to protect that man. What if he's wrong? We'll be blowing his cover for nothing. He is never wrong. Maybe he heard something. I don't know, a scream. Maybe the TV was on. Well, why did she lie to me when I called her? You called her? Yes, I called her. It was a local call. It can't be traced. Okay. First thing in the morning, I'm gonna go into town and talk to the sheriff. No, no, no, no, no, no. Tomorrow's too late. She could be getting rid of the evidence right now. That's the best I can do. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna wash up and go to bed. Monk, are you sure? I mean, are you really sure? And don't give me any of that 95% crap. Captain, I am 100% sure that she probably killed him. What does that mean? Whoa-ho, hey, I need some privacy here. - Okay. Take your time. Be careful out there! Which way, left or right? - Uh Not you. - Um, left. I think the lake is that way. Hey, guys, joke's over. Come on! Okay, when we get there, what's the plan? We knock on the door. If Mr. Willowby answers, we owe everybody a great big apology. He's not gonna be there. I'm telling you, she killed him. Okay, can I say something? I'm freaking out back here. - Why? Everywhere you go, every time you turn around, somebody is killing somebody else. That's true. - What? Well, there was the time you went on vacation - and then on the airplane - These things happen. Oh, and then that that stage play. - It happens. - To you! Not to me, not to anybody else. It follows you around. You're not just unlucky, it's it's something else. - Bad karma? - You're like a magnet. Bad karma. - It's like you're causing it somehow. You're the Prince of Darkness. No, no. He's not the Prince of Darkness. I've seen him vacuum the ceiling. You wouldn't see the Prince of Darkness vacuuming the ceiling. I can picture the Prince of Darkness vacuuming the ceiling to trick us. - He's very tricky. - Stop calling me the Prince of Darkness. That's how rumors get started. - Son of a bitch! - What happened? We're stuck! Maybe we can back out. I'm trying. Maybe we can go forward. We can't go forward, we're stuck. Maybe we can back out. Back. Back out. Back out. Ow. We're stuck. Open the door! Oh! God! I think the main road's about two miles up ahead. I'll stay here with Mr. Monk, and you go ahead and get help! No, I can't leave you. Technically, he is still in protective custody. Well, maybe we should all go. Or we could just stay here. What's this? Oh, oh, it's your birthday cake. We were gonna surprise you. Ready? Happy birthday, Captain. Thank you very much, Natalie. This is probably the most depressing birthday I've ever had. I've had worse. - Did you make a wish? - Yes, I did. What was it? - Did it involve me? - Yes, it did. Cake? I'm almost scared to open this. It's like a Twilight Zone episode. First I almost get run over, and then a check from the IRS? - Do you believe me now? - I don't know what to think. Look at me. I'm afraid of a cookie. What does it say? ""An old friend is in danger. Only you can save him."" - An old friend? - Monk? The number you dialed is not in service at this time. Listen, I, uh I gotta go. Uh, can you get yourself home okay? - What's going on? - I'll tell you later. I promise. I love you. It worked. He actually fell for it. Of course he did. Now he's gonna lead us right to Monk. You visiting Tommy tonight? Tell him to relax. Adrian Monk won't live to testify against him. - What do you think? - I think that north is that way. Are we lost? Just tell me. I I I I have to know. Are are we lost? We're not lost. Oh, my God. We're lost! - Hey, water! - Oh, oh. Water. Water. What? What are you doing? Hey, don't, don't! No, no, don't drink that! You don't wanna do that. You don't wanna drink that. - Oh. - Oh. Mr. Monk, you have to take a sip. You're dehydrated. I'm not that thirsty. I'm not drinkin' that. You have no idea what's in there. Monk, don't you know what this is? This is Sierra Springs! This is the water you drink all the time. Yeah, he's right. And I saw it on the map. Which means the bottling plant is right over that hill. - Sierra Springs? - The one and only. This is where they get it. This is the exact same water, only it's free! Oh, uh It is! It's Sierra Springs! And it's free. Son of a bitch! Ah, ah, I got nature There's There's nature on my hand. I need a wipe. Wipe! No, y-you can't clean nature with nature! Shh! Listen. - It's a car! - A car! It's probably people. Yeah, Monk, it's probably people. I'm gonna take a few more pictures. I'll meet you guys back at the station. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Can I help you folks? Our car broke down. We got a little lost. Yeah, we got a little lost in the woods. We got a little lost. What happened here? - The guy who lived here got hit by lightning. Guess when your number's up, your number's up. What's your name, son? Coby. Paul Coby. Deputy Paul Coby. Deputy Coby, I'm a homicide detective from San Francisco. We're staying in a cabin across the lake. - Oh, the FBI cabin. - Yeah. Uh uh uh Yeah, we've been watching the woman that lives here, a Mrs. Willowby. That's right. Kathy Willowby. They wanna ask her a few questions. It'll take just a minute. Captain? Hello? Hello? Excuse me. He, uh, he was killed in this boat? That's right. I don't know what he was doing out in the storm. He must be pretty serious about his fishing. Got an uncle like that. That's where the lightning hit. - Uh-huh. This rod is metal. Why didn't the lightning hit the fishing rod first? I don't know. Here's the thing. I heard him screaming for help two nights ago. That doesn't make sense. The medical examiner was just here. He put the time of death at midnight last night. Is Mrs. Willowby here? Have a little respect here. My husband died last night. I don't think so. I think he died the night before. I heard him screaming. - You heard him. - They're stayin' at the FBI cabin. Would you please stop calling it that? Well, talk to Dr. Culver. He was just here. He can tell you that Martin died last night on the lake. I told him not to go out in the rain. The old fool. Isn't that Martin's lucky fishing hat? - Why wasn't he wearing it? - I don't know. Maybe he didn't want to get it wet. He seemed pretty excited about his new lures. I was there when he bought them. Wonder why he didn't try them out. I don't have to talk to you, do I? I don't know, Kathy. I think he's asking some mighty interesting questions. Mrs. Willowby, did Martin have a life insurance policy? - Maybe. Did it have a double indemnity clause, which pays double for an act of God? A lot of policies do. Look, I know my rights. If you people think you've got something to prove, then prove it. Otherwise, I want you to go. - Lieutenant. - Thank God. Randy, what are you doing here? Captain, I think Monk is in danger. I tried to call you, but Okay, this sounds crazy, I've been getting these fortune cookies and they've all been coming true. - Fortune cookies? - Yeah. Today I got that one. - What, you got this today? - Yeah, at lunch. Look, I don't believe in any of this stuff, but that's the third one, and they've all been coming true. Lieutenant, this was made by hand. You see the edge? It was cut with a scissors. Randy, did you just drive up here? - Yeah. Get down! Stay away from the window! - How many? - There's at least two! - One behind the canoes - Where's the other one? - I don't know. - Who the hell are they? - Hit men from San Francisco. - They're here to kill Monk! - Good! Oh, my God. I've got it. Here's what happened! - We didn't meet by accident. - She electrocuted him. It was a set-up from the very beginning. Oh, I can see that now. God, I'm such an idiot! She dropped the radio into the tub while he was bathing. She wanted to make it look like an act of God to collect the extra insurance Maybe I believed it because I wanted to believe it. All those fortunes were printed in advance, just for me! She had to preserve the body until the storm came. That's why she bought those bags of ice. My head is spinning. Which one are you listening to? - Neither one. She froze the body so the coroner would never know the time of death. The first fortune predicted that I'd be saved from a dirty death which is exactly what happened when I left the restaurant. Last night, during the storm, she put her husband in the boat, then cut it loose, waited a few hours, and then reported it as an accident. Now I have to go back and arrest my girlfriend for conspiracy and attempted murder. She'll probably break up with me. FBI! Freeze! Grooms! A little vacation, huh? - Is it over? - Not for you. I'm gonna order a full autopsy on Martin's body. They'll know if it was lightning or electrocution. - So, what the hell happened here? - She electrocuted her husband. Well, it looks like we all had a pretty full day. - Huh? You guys solved a homicide, and I led those two hit men into our trap. - Yeah, that was - Right, Randy. - Brilliant. Really good. - Thanks. - I get it now. - Get what? It's not bad karma, people getting killed whenever he's around. It's good karma, because he's there to catch 'em and make it right. It's a good thing, isn't it? Yes, it is. It's a good thing. Come on. I'll buy you a wipe."
"- I was gettin' worried. - You didn't think I'd show, did you? - I'm not afraid of you, Ray. - No reason to be. So, what's all this about a deal? I just wanted to talk to you, man to man. Without the judge and the lawyers. If you think we're withdrawing that lawsuit, you can forget it. Hey, look, kid. Steve. You don't think I care about the environment, but I do. My heart bleeds for the albino whip snakes. - Alameda whip snakes. - Whatever. Look, I got 85 guys workin' on this crew. And they all got families. And I care about them, too. When you called, I thought you were going to offer to sell the land back so you could build your stupid strip mall someplace else. And start all over again? I'd lose my shirt. I'm already hemorrhaging money thanks to you and your buddies. Steve, Steve, wait, wait, wait. Steve, Hold on, hold on. Come on, now. You got expenses, right? Now, what will it take for you to find another swamp to cry over, huh? You're trying to bribe me, Ray? Who do you think I am, you? Listen, I told you, this isn't about me. It's about an endangered species that doesn't live anyplace else on the planet. Oh, what the hell is a whip snake? Will you tell me? You know, I've never seen one in my life. Have you? I'll see you in court, Ray. Okay, look, Steve, Steve. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I guess I guess I just didn't appreciate how deeply you felt about this thing. I get it now, I do. Come on. I hate to argue with a passionate guy, And that is what you are. A passionate guy. Huh? Ah. What are you doin'? Well, I gotta find a pipe. It's gotta be the right size. - Not too big, not too small. - For what? Well, it's gotta look like you hit your head on the steering wheel. Whip snakes. MONK Season 3 Epi. 13 Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic Seatbelts on? Everybody, seatbelt check. - Yes, yes. They're on, they're on. - That was the 20th time. Well, that was really, you know, fun. Who knew that spending four hours in a car to watch a two-hour field hockey game could be so much fun? Thanks for inviting me. When's your next game? Oh, that was, uh, Julie's last game of the season. Oh, that's too bad. Mom, I gotta go. Sweetie, why didn't you go at the game? There was a porta-john right there. I wanted to, but Mr. Monk says it wasn't sanitary. - You'll thank me later. - I'm going to pee all over the seat. - Natalie. - Honey, honey, there is a rest stop up ahead. You're okay. Maybe when there's pee all over the back seat, maybe then you'll believe me. Uh, okay. Julie, wait. No, don't don't don't do that. Not, not in the car. I will give you $10 to hold it in. Really? - What are you doing? You can't pay a person not to pee. - Best money I ever spent. - Oh, sure he can. It's called ""the free market."" I learned about it in school. So, Mr. Monk, how much would you pay me not to throw up? Oh, my gosh! Did you see that guy? - I'm gonna report him. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Mr. Monk, do not get involved. You will always regret it. How am I gonna regret this? Hello. Yes, I would like to report one of your drivers. We're heading north on the 101. His license plate is CPO 8852. The problem? He he's driving like a maniac. He's all over the road. He's gonna kill somebody. Really? Well, thank you very much. Thank you. He said that driver's done this before, and they're taking disciplinary measures. - Here. - What's this? I'm returning your money. I can't hold it in. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Julie, okay, look, just think about something else. Let's play a game. Uh, let's play the numbers game. - How do you play? - Oh, it's fun. I'll say a number. Then you you say a completely different number. And then we just keep going until you never pee. Ready? 72. Hey, hey, you know what I used to play? I used to try to make the truckers honk their horns. Watch this. - What a jerk. - Would you like me to report him? No, no, no. Who cares if the sidelines are perfectly straight? It was not a rectangle. That's not fair to the children. Mr. Monk, you are the only person in North America - Oh, my God! - Look out. Look out! Oh, my God. Ugh. Is everybody okay? Julie? - I think so. - Oh, my God. - What is it? What is it? - Oh, no. Mr. Monk, what is it? The pen in my pocket. It broke. Huh, leaked all over. See? Look. I think you're going to live. - What do you think happened? - Uh The ink cartridge got snapped by the seatbelt. - I mean, up ahead. - I don't know. - Mr. Monk, why don't you check it out? - I can't go like this, can I? I picked up your laundry this morning. It's in the back. I hope it didn't get wrinkled in the accident. - Hello? - Steven? - No. You got the wrong number. - I don't think so. It's on my speed dial. I call it every day. Damn it. Pass it on. Party in our car in 10 minutes. Okay, but you might've to start without me. There's going to be a party in that turquoise 1964 Mercury Comet convertible in 10 minutes. Pass it on. - Do you know what happened? - No, I was going to take a look. I'll come with you. They might need some help. - You're a doctor? - Wouldn't that be great? I should've been a doctor. My brother's a doctor. That's the life. I'm a lawyer. At least, for now. This time next year, I'll probably be selling real estate. If I'm lucky. Which I'm not. - That's the spirit. - Ha. - Garrett Price. - Monk. Adrian Monk. Nice to meet you, Adrian. You know what? Take the rest. I don't need 'em. Use them to pick your teeth. Man, what a mess. Oh, my God. Officer, how fast was he going? Too fast. About 80 miles an hour. He never passed me. How's that? This car. He never passed me. If he was going that fast, I would've seen him. You probably missed him. You can't remember every car on the highway. Can you? Skid marks all up and down, but none near this vehicle. He didn't put on his brakes. I think you're right. Wow, you could be a cop. I am. At least, I used to be. Then we have something in common. Two guys who used to be something. The car's in neutral. Well, maybe the gear thing slipped in the collision. Maybe. The air conditioning is off. So is the fan. - Okay, what does that mean? - Both the windows, they're shut. Must be 90 degrees out here. I couldn't drive like that, could you? You're absolutely right. Can I ask you something? Why aren't you on the force? Uh, something happened. Was it a wrongful termination? I could help you out with that. I mean I used to be pretty good. I was as good as you. Excuse me. Gentlemen, you're not allowed back here. - It's all right. He's a cop. - Uh I'm not technically a cop anymore, technically. - If you want to be technical. - Yes, I do. I want to be technical. Now, let's move it. But, Sergeant, there is something wrong here. You're absolutely right, sir. And it's you. Ahem, excuse me, General, but I think you need to listen to him because he's brilliant and he happens to be noticing things - that maybe some people aren't. - Okay, sirs, I will not ask you again. I need you both to go back to your vehicles. Step away from this accident! Man, where did that come from? This was no accident. - Adrian. - Garrett. Garrett, you see this blood? Great. You can't have too much blood. But look at this smudge. It's on the outside. How did it get on the outside? Maybe it just tried very hard. I really don't know. Listen, can I get my cards back from you? I wanna pass them out to these people. I mean they've all been hurt. I'm a lawyer, right? You got a dead guy. This is great. We're on the comeback trail. - You're not still here, are you? - No. Yes. Yes, Sergeant, I'm telling you, there's something wrong with this crime scene. It's an accident scene, sir. But he never slowed down. There are no skid marks. Well, perhaps he fell asleep or he had a heart attack. - It happens all the time. - Sergeant, this guy, who was he? What did he do? He worked for a nonprofit environmental group. He was some sort of activist. Of course. Do you know what he was working on? - You used to be a cop, right? - Right. All right. Then maybe you can appreciate this. I will tell you what I do know about the victim. His name was Steve Marriot. He died in a tragic single car accident. There is no doubt about that. We have an eyewitness. The driver of that truck saw the whole thing. The victim's car was spinning out of control. It was traveling at 80, There was nobody else in the vehicle. There was nobody else near the vehicle. Nobody else ran from the vehicle. Okay? - But Sergeant - Look, Detective, or whatever you are, I've been very patient with you, sir. You have to let this go. Mr. Monk, Mom says you'll help me find a bathroom. Oh, Julie, look, look, look. We're almost We're almost moving. Any any any minute now. So, can't you please Can't you hold it in? Excuse me, could you spare some of that ice? - Sure, you want a beer? - No, thanks. Hey hey, guys, listen up. Nobody gets near that vehicle unless they're on the job. Do you understand? Let's lock this down. This is an accident scene. Get that barrier in here. Get these people behind the barrier. Come on, come on, folks, please, please. Step this way. Step lively. Hey, there you are. And my parents wanted me to take French. - What's up? - This is Garrett Price. - Used to be a lawyer. - I am a lawyer. Excuse me. I'm a lawyer again because I'm reborn, my friend, because you'reyou're a cop. Look, I got my inspiration from you. You're a cop, it's in your blood. You can't turn it off. It's who you are. Well, this is who I am. Hey, don't move until I get there and he signs a release! This is unbelievable here. I mean, I hit the mother lode. I got three cases of whiplash. One of them pregnant. A pregnant woman with whiplash. Are you kidding me? That's a summer home, right there. So, uh, how's your case going? It'sStill working on it. Listen, I need to borrow your cell phone. Call my captain, maybe he can help me out on this. It doesn't work. The goofy mountains here. I can't get a signal myself. Ask one of these truck drivers. They all got two-way radios. Excuse me, sir. Whoa! Ma'am. Ma'am or sir. Mademoiselle. Uh, my friend here is a big detective and he has a very important phone call to make. Is there any way - Damn it! Damn it to hell. - Don't be afraid. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. I just got fired. Stay close. The owner just told me some cretin called in complained about my driving. Said I cut him off. Call came in just before the accident. I'll bet he's still here. When I find out who did it, his ass is mine! $10 says she's got an automatic. Owner played back the tape of the phone call. Think I'd recognize his voice. - You're a detective, huh? - Is he a detective? The biggest. Want to make a little money? A little cash under the table? Help me find this guy. WellWell, I would like to, but I'm a little busy now. - You need a lozenge? - It's probably all for the best. You don't want to be party to what happens when I find this guy. Excuse me, we don't know each other. But if you find him, don't hurt him because that'd be wrong and violence never solves anything. But if you hurt him, please give him one of these. Excuse me, are you Adrian Monk? - Well, if he's not, I am. - Yes. Y-Your friend, Natalie, she wants to talk to you. I think she's hurt. - Let's go. - I'll come, too, to help. Excuse me, I was on my way back from Harleysburg when I heard. Figured I'd swing by and see if I could help out. It's appreciated. Talk to the EMS captain. He's over there. He'll tell you what we need. Hey, excuse me? You got a minute? It's my wife. She got banged up pretty bad. She's four months pregnant. She's scared to death. - Where is she? - She's right back here. Thanks. - She She's right back here. - What's she doin' back here? Oh, they put her back here to check her blood pressure. - Her blood pressure? - Yeah. - Hey. - Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I think I just sprained it or somethin'. - Why didn't you tell me you were hurt? - Miss Teeger. My name is Garrett Price. I'm a personal injury attorney. What a surprise. Sarcasm is a very good sign with trauma. And I must say that any friend of Adrian Monk's is a client of mine. The man is a magnificent detective and one of my greatest personal heroes. - We just met. - Modesty becomes the brave, Mr. Monk. You're my hero. End of discussion. Let's take a look at that wrist. Oh, that doesn't look too bad. That is a very serious injury. I could tell from here. How about a couple of pictures? Always helps in front of a jury. You see, my thinking on this is that someone owes you a great deal of money. - Can you lick your lips for this one? - Cute. I'm kidding. Isn't that sweet? She doesn't know when I'm teasing. The money, by the way, has nothing to do with medical expenses. That's going to be considerable. The main body, where you really kill them, is with mental anguish. You know, Mr. Price, I wasn't aware of any mental anguish until I met you. That's why I'm here, darling. That's the point of the whole exercise. She's a nice girl, but doesn't understand. That's a five-star bruise, don't you understand that? This is gonna change your life, and yours as well. In fact, I wish we had one of those paramedics here to document it. You mean, to treat it? That's my point. You document it, then you treat it. What, are we savages? I'll be right back. So, what happened up there? - A guy was killed. - Oh, my God. Mr. Monk says he was murdered. Of course he does. You know, Mr. Monk, there'd be no crime in all of San Francisco if you never left your house. I can't help it. The man was murdered. - Sweetie, did you find a bathroom? - No. Isn't she a trooper? You, you. Yeah, where are you going? Never mind that. I got a lady who broke her wrist back there. I need you to check it out. Thanks, and I'm sorry I called you ""General."" Come on. You know, I would have found a doctor for you. Mr. Monk, you didn't even ask how I was. It didn't even occur to you. All you cared about was the stupid ink stain on your shirt. I was busy. I was talking to the patrolman. I'm sure you were talking, because I know you weren't listening. You never listen to anyone. You're just lost in your own world. Mr. Monk, this is a very dangerous job. What if I am ever in real trouble? - Are you gonna be there for me? - I'll be there. See, I don't believe you. It's a two-way street, Mr. Monk. We have to look out for each other. I'll be there. How's our patient? I found a medic. He didn't want to come, but no one says no to Garrett Price. What seems to be the problem? - So, what happened here? - The wrist is broken. No, shattered. And there's nerve damage. It's heartbreaking. A young woman, a mother cut down in the prime of life. This is all great stuff. Anyway, excuse me. Make sure you get a copy of his report, okay? Look at that face. I can't wait to get you in front of a jury. You'll wear something nice, huh? If I were 20 years younger, and a completely different guy I I really appreciate this. There must be other people that need help more than me. Everybody's important, ma'am, but, uh, well, let's take a quick look, huh? Must be tired. Workin' too hard. - You're in construction. - Mmm? - Uh, your boots. - Oh, yeah. It's my other job. There we are. Look into the light. Oh, there's no sign of concussion. I heard you talking before. You're a detective or something? - Or something. - You don't think it was an accident? - Mr. Monk doesn't believe in accidents. - Does that hurt? - Yeah! - How about that? - Mmm-hmm. Mmm. - What do you think? - Well, I'm no expert, but the driver was alone in his car doing 80 miles an hour, right? Sounds like an accident to me. I think you're wasting your time. You're not gonna take her pulse? I just did when I was holding her wrist. She's fine. It's not broken. EGG Calling Your phone. You you got a call coming there. Yeah, whoever it is, they'll call back. Look, I gotta go. They're waiting for me. So, uh, let's keep plenty of ice on that, okay? And no tennis for at least two weeks. I'm gonna leave you in charge. Stay here with her. Take care of her, okay? - Nice meeting you both. - Yeah. There's something wrong with that guy. What, he was empathetic? He cared about other people? Hey, I found some ice. Hey, guess who's here. - Who? - Korn. - What's Korn? - They're a band. They're famous. That's their tour bus over there. Oh, do you still have to go? I'm sure the tour bus has a bathroom. Maybe Mr. Monk will take you. - I don't really think - Maybe Mr. Monk will take you now. Now. Right now. I'll take her. Right now. ""Korn."" They spelled it wrong. Shh, don't say anything. Sorry, sorry to interrupt. You have a great sound. Very, very musical. I wish I could understand more of the words. Do you Do you have a ladies room? This is Julie, and, uh, it's kind of an emergency. Yeah, we have a bathroom. Our bus driver, Detox, is in there right now. Okay, great. We'll just wait for Detox. Easy now. Easy. I play the clarinet. I played with Willie, you know, Nelson. I played with Willie Nelson. And now I'm just waiting for Detox. I love your socks. They're not socks. It's all yours. So, you know what's goin' on out there? Uh, big car crash. Driver was killed. Oh, that sucks. Maybe we should find out his name and dedicate a song to him. No, I can tell you his name. Steven Marriot. - Steven Marriot the activist? - Wait, you guys know him? Yeah, man, I think we did like this, uh, benefit gig a while ago, remember? Uh, it was the Environmental Guerilla Group. Environmental Environmental group. You got a call coming there. Whoever it is, they'll call back. - EGG? - EGG. EGG, yeah. Julie. Hey. Hey, hurry up. - Come on. We're we're going. - I haven't started yet. Come on, Julie. Let's go. Mom was right, you don't care about anybody else. Julie, go back to your mom. Tell her I was right about the paramedic. She'll know what I mean. Mr. Monk, she never knows what you mean. Nobody does. Hey, Mr. M. Looks like the party's over. They brought in some cranes. We'll all be going home soon. Garrett, where did you find that paramedic? At the crash site. Why? - Have you seen him? Do you know where he is now? Not a clue. What's going on? I think he might be involved, somehow, in all of this. What did you say? It's you. You son of a bitch! You cost me my job. You cut us off. That's not right. - You're a dead man! - Wait a second, wait a minute. Look, it wasn't my fault. I mean, it was my fault. But I never thought they would fire anybody. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. - Let her hit you. - What? One shot, we got witnesses. Try and take it to the nose. - Bleeds like a fountain. - Garret. - You'll be fine. I needed that job. Do you understand? Oh, look, I'm sorry. I am really, really sorry. - If there's anything I can do - Maybe there is. All right. Okay. You're gonna call my supervisor and get my job back. - Mary Jane. - Yeah. It's Krystal. Is Danny still there? There's somebody here that wants to talk to him. Click and talk. - What do I say? - Think of something. This is Daniel. Who the hell is this? Hello. How are you? 10-4. This is the guy who called earlier to complain about Krystal. Yeah, yeah, I recognize your voice. I've changed my mind. I'd like to withdraw that complaint. Why? WellI was trying to get her fired, because I was mad at her because I wouldn't marry you. She wouldn't marry me. Who? Krystal? You can't be serious. I love her. - Ha! - I love everything about her. I love how she drives, which is exemplary. And her smile. And the way she controls her rage. No, wait, don't leave. No, come on, she still might hit him. If you're withdrawing the complaint, there's nothing I can do. Tell Krystal, ""Get back to work."" Are we finished? There is something I have to do. Go ahead. But stay off the phone. Excuse me. Can I see some ID? You're talkin' to me? - Yes, I am. Do you have any identification? Not on me, no. I don't think you're a paramedic. I don't think you're a cop. What's your name? - Excuse me. - You killed him, didn't you? What the hell is going on here? I thought I asked you to return to your vehicle, Mr. Monk. Sergeant, you've got to stop this tow truck. - I gotta what? - Listen to me, you cannot move this car. You'd be destroying evidence. That'd be a big mistake. And this man is not a paramedic. - I am not going to ask you again. - I can't let you move this car! Stop him! All right, that's it. I warned you. Get him down. Give me those keys. Give me those keys. Hands behind your back. Hold the keys. You gotta listen to me. This was no accident, sir. - Hello, boss. - Oh, Natalie. And the next time we go someplace, I think we should leave a little early. You know, to factor in traffic problems, homicide investigations, you getting arrested. That's funny. That's very, very funny. Listen, uhOh, by the way, how is your, um What is it? Your wrist, is it? Forget about it, Mr. Monk. It's never gonna be a two-way street. I'll just have to accept that. So what is going on? - You see that dump truck over there? - Yeah. That's the one that passed us on the highway. - Do you remember? - Yeah, he wouldn't honk his horn. - He must not be a very happy person. - The guy who was killed. - Steve Marriot. - Marriot, right. I think he was already dead. There's no other explanation. Because his car never passed us. I think it was inside that dump truck. And then it got dumped out in the middle of the highway. - By who? - By him. - The paramedic who was treating you. - What? He's got mud on his boots that matches the mud on the tires of the Volkswagen. He's the guy. - What's he doin'? - He's looking for something. Remember the phone call he got? The caller ID read EGG. - EGG? What's that? - Environmental Guerilla Group. That's the organization that Marriot worked for. I think he's got Marriot's cell phone. Somehow they got mixed up. Now we gotta get you out of here. You know what? If that Volkswagen was in the dump truck, there's gotta be some evidence in there. Maybe some tire tracks or somethin'. You're right. - I'm gonna go check it out. - No, no, no, no. You can't. You can't do that, Natalie, it's too risky. Mr. Monk, when they dropped that Volkswagen on the highway, it could have killed a lot of people. It could have killed Julie. Don't worry, I'm going to be okay. Nat - Give you a hand? - No. We're good. Just droppin' this guy at the morgue. Natalie! Somebody. Officer, listen to me, sir. Help! Natalie. Natalie! Sir. Sir, please. Sergeant, listen to me. You gotta listen to me. There's a woman in the back of that dump truck. Sergeant, she's in danger. You gotta believe me. Officer. Ugh. Sir. Sir, please. Sergeant. Officer. Hey, hey. Officer, just listen to me for one second. Son of a bitch. They're setting up a roadblock 10 miles south. I heard him. Is your seatbelt on? - Yes, it is. - Nice and tight. Blinkers! Blinkers! Do you understand this is a car chase? Left lane ends 2 miles. Left lane ends 2 miles. Help! Help! Up here. Help! Here, help! Look here, look! Help! Help! Help! Oh, my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Get alongside. Can you get alongside? Got you. Be careful! Get closer! Show me both your hands! Step down out of the truck! Easy! Easy! Sir, I found this. - Thank you. - Thank you. How's your wrist? Better. Thank you for asking. You unbuckled your seatbelt? Two-way street. Two-way street. I think you got it. Mr. Monk. Adrian. Adrian. Just like the movie. Listen, I wanted to thank you. I needed to thank you. This has seriously been the best day of my life. And I don't respect a lot of people by the way. And I know you don't like to hug, so I'm back, pal. Nice meeting you. There you are. Do you feel better? A lot better. Good. What took you so long? Um, well, I got a tattoo. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Mom, it's okay. It's fake. Oh, that's very funny. Well, let's go. We'll laugh in the car. - Come on, here we go. - It's not rubbing off. Hey, there's a special rate for buses. Remember, you can't win if you don't try. Call me. Attaboy, all right. Hey, buddy. Did you get a card? All right. Whoo. Nice car."
"Have you seen my earring? Why can't I just write these people a check and stay home? - Nobody's gonna miss me. - You're not getting out of this one.

I did? Okay. This way. Over here. Right. This This is where she was killed. Does any of this look familiar? I don't know. Wait. Captain, you-you're only supposed to take two of those. ""As necessary."" You don't remember anything? Nothing? Um, I know I left the party upstairs at about 1:30. Okay, okay. Were you alone? I don't know. I came down, I played some craps, lost some money. I talked to someone. Good. There you go. Who? It was a man. Or a woman. Oh, man or a woman. That narrows it down. So, it wasn't a child? - Could have been. - All right, got the case file. Lt. Waliver said don't make any copies of it and I have nice eyes. Okay, cause of death: Uh, ligature strangulation and a broken neck. Waliver said you're wasting your time. It was an accident. She strangled on her own scarf. Okay, let's check it out. Uh, excuse me. I'm sorry, these are private elevators. The public elevators are across the lobby. Yeah. Um, PD. We're just gonna look around a little bit, okay? Sure, sure. What's, uh, going on? Can I help? Were you on duty the night Mrs. Thorn was Why? Is this, like, an insurance thing? No, this is a ""we ask you some questions and you answer"" thing. Okay, okay, but you owe me one. Here's what happened. They got off the elevator. Sheryl, that's Mrs. Thorn, said, ""Do you have the tickets?"" Daniel, Mr. Thorn, checked his pockets, ""No."" She got back on the elevator, elevator doors closed, and her scarf got caught. You could hear her screaming from inside: ""Help me, Daniel. Help me"" That's pretty much it. They found her upstairs. And she was definitely alone? Oh, yeah, I was standing right there. I got a question. Were you working last night at 2:00? Oh, yes, sir. - Was I here? - Were you here? Do you remember me? Did we talk? No, sir. I've never seen you before. Exactly. We never met. Right. I was just testing you. You You passed. Good job. Um, we're just gonna be a minute, okay? - Okay. - Thank you. Yeah. So it's an express. Yeah, it goes straight to the penthouse, non-stop. There is an access panel. Can we get up there? Monk, we're not supposed to be here. Let's make it quick. - Ok. Look. Thumbprint scanner. - Yeah. This elevator doesn't move for anyone but Thorn or his wife. Right, it's all here. See, Daniel Thorn, uh, pressed the elevator scanner at 5:52 to come down, and then Sheryl Thorn pressed the scanner at 5:55, three minutes later, to go back up in the elevator. So it was definitely her. Yeah, positive ID. What are you doing? Look, look. It's odd, look at her thumbprint. It's at a weird angle. Why would she press it like that? I would have pressed it like that. - Wouldn't you? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, that is weird. What is that? It's a fingernail. It's dug right into the leather. It probably broke off when she was choking to death. No, I don't think so. She's too far away from the door. What do you think? I think you were right. Something happened in here. It was murder. You know, some people thought that we should reschedule this groundbreaking ceremony after what happened last week. But I know that Sheryl would want us here today. And as you know, uh, she and I were never able to have children of our own. So, uh, she always considered this project, this hospital to be her baby. Our baby. - If in 100 years - He didn't love her. - How do you know? - I know. with my casinos or my bestseller books. No, it will be for this hospital. So let's get started on this hospital. Will somebody hold this? - What are you doing? - Poking around. - You can't do that. - I can do anything I want. I'm cute. I wanna thank everybody for coming out here today. So let's get this thing built, huh? Well, thanks, I appreciate that. Uh, Mr. Thorn, do you have a minute? Yeah, sure. No, no, no, sir, we don't want your autograph. My name is Natalie Teeger, this is Adrian Monk. We're here with some homicide detectives from San Francisco. Oh, I hope you're staying here at the Monticello. Yes, sir, we are. We just have some questions about your wife. And how she died. You do? Well, uh, we have our own police force here, Mr. Monk, and, uh, they've already looked into it. If you want a copy of that report, I can assist you with that. Well, I-I've already seen the report, sir. It doesn't add up. - Oh, yeah? What doesn't add up? - The night she died, the two of you were going to a fundraiser at the Baker Street Pavilion. Yeah, that's right. It was a fundraising concert. For this hospital. Right, but she forgot the tickets and that's why she went back upstairs. Yeah. These were in your pocket, sir. Baker Street Pavilion, May 2. Oh, my, well, uh I didn't realize they were there. You know, if I'd have known that, she'd be alive here today. We've spoken to some witnesses. They said that you looked for the tickets. They said that you checked your pockets. They were mistaken! Look, why why don't you just relax here, Mr. Monk, huh? You're in Las Vegas, do some gambling. I'd be happy to comp you and your friend here. I don't gamble. Well, then have a drink. Don't drink. Well, you don't gamble, you don't drink. You wanna know a secret? I don't, either. You and I, we got a lot in common, Mr. Monk. Yes, we do. My wife was murdered, too. - No, Sheryl wasn't murdered. - I think she was. We're done here. - Goodbye, Mr. Monk. Miss Teeger. - Mr. Thorn. Okay, just take your time. Does any of this look familiar? Maybe that way. Hey, there's Randy. Randy! Randy! How you doin'? Hey, uh, I'm down. But that's to be expected. Money is like the tide, it ebbs and it flows. It's all in the book. Right now, I'm, uh, sort of ebbing. Uh, son, exactly how much are you ebbing? Down $800. But that's not including the complimentary breakfast and all the free drinks. Don't panic. Don't panic. The worst thing you can do is panic. It's all in the book. Hey, uh, how's the case coming? - Actually, we're narrowing it. - Great. Great. I want to hear all about it later. - How are you? - Julie, I'm back. - Let's play. - All right, here you go. That bar. I've been in that bar. Hey, there he is. This is the guy. Hey, Leland, welcome back. - Yeah, I think you've been here before. - Hey, Leland, how you feeling, brother? I figured you'd be back. You forgot this. - Everybody is still talking about it, man. - Thank you for last night. You're welcome. - ""First place, karaoke contest""? - Karaoke. Do you sing? Apparently. Look, last night is a bit of a blur. What did I sing? Ain't No Sunshine. That's a good song. You made me cry. Sing it again. I don't think so. Look, um Did anything else happen? It's kind of important. You did a lot of drinkin'. You were very thirsty. - Did he talk to anybody? - Hell, he talked to everybody. You don't remember anything? - Um - Let's see. You came in around 2:00, you sang the song, you won the trophy, you threw up, and you collapsed on a table over there. - Was he alone? - I didn't notice. About 10 minutes later you came back, you were all excited and you kept saying, ""I solved the case!"" Anything else? No, sir, you just ran outside looking for a payphone. You sat at this table and you solved the case. Look, do you have any idea what I meant? - No. - I do. You told me all about it. Um What exactly did I say? I'll tell you on one condition. Hi. Remember me? Oh, Miss Teeger. Room 1523. Wow. You're pretty good. You're gonna own this place someday. That's the plan. Give me five years. Listen, my friend Adrian Monk just checked in Room 1525. That's right. Anyway, uh, he's a little peculiar. He has to have 60-watt light bulbs in all the lamps. Did you try Guest Services? Yeah, there were 10 people in front of me. Could you help me out? I would so appreciate it. Done. But you owe me one. All right. - Is that Daniel Thorn's book? - Oh, yeah. You must be a pretty big fan, huh? I'd say I'm more of a student. I keep my eyes open. You can learn more in this lobby than you can at any business school. I'm sure you can, Lewis. I bet you have some great stories. Well, uhLet's just say if I wrote a book about Thorn, about the things I've seen, it'd be pretty wild. I have a perfect view of who comes and goes. And who comes and goes with who. - Ah. Do you really? - Mmm. ¢Ü Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ¢Ü ¢Ü It's not warm when she's away ¢Ü ¢Ü Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ¢Ü ¢Ü She's always gone too long ¢Ü - Don't ask. ¢Ü Any time she goes away ¢Ü ¢Ü Wonder this time where she's gone ¢Ü ¢Ü Wonder if she's gone to stay ¢Ü Do the dance. Y-you did a little dance. ¢Ü Ain't no sunshine when she's gone ¢Ü ¢Ü She's always gone too long ¢Ü ¢Ü Anytime she goes away ¢Ü Turn around, I wanna see your tush. ¢Ü I know, I know, I know, I know ¢Ü Those are different pants. Where are the jeans? Look, lady, a deal is a deal. I sang the song, now tell me what I said last night. All you said was, ""They don't match."" ""They don't match""? What doesn't match? I don't know. You didn't say. Wait, wait, wait, is that it? Is that all you got? Leland. Sing it again. I just love the way you sing. Thank you. - You were good. - Shut up. Daniel Thorn has a mistress. She's a dancer at another casino. How do you know that? Lewis the bellboy told me. He told you just like that? - Mmm-hmm. - Oh, that's right. You're cute. ¢Ü I know the time is right ¢Ü ¢Ü For a rendezvous, only me and you ¢Ü - Mr. Monk, they're not naked. - They're naked-ish. Well, you can't argue with that. They are naked-ish. Where's the Captain? He went back to get Randy out of the casino. He's down $4,000. What, he's never gonna leave. Nobody walks away. It's like a drug. I used to gamble. I had a big problem. That's why I left. - Sir, Teresa Telenko? - Yeah. - Is he pointing? - Yes, he's pointing. - Where is he pointing? - To a woman. She's walking this way. Excuse me, uh, Miss Telenko. Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger, this is Adrian Monk. We're, uh, working with the police department, looking into the death of Sheryl Thorn. - Why are you telling me? - Because you're sleeping with her husband. Sweetie, it'll take us half a day to check your phone records. Okay, maybe that's true. But that's my business. Has nothing to do with his wife or what happened. Miss Telenko, we already checked. The night Mrs. Thorn was killed, you called in sick. You missed the show. - Is he blind? - Define ""blind."" - * I I called in sick because I was sick. I miss a lot of shows. Would you like to see a note from my doctor? What happened to Sheryl Thorn was an accident. She was on that elevator alone and she choked to death. I don't think so. Look, if you're gonna accuse me of something, the least you can do is look me in the eye. Mr. Monk, come on. Thorn killed her. I don't know how he did it, but he did it. I think you knew something about it, either before the fact or after. Are you arresting me? No. Then I have a show to do. Excuse me. Miss Telenko. When you talk to Mr. Thorn, you tell him that I'm not going anywhere. Tell him that he's smart, but I'm smarter. And I am gonna figure out how he did it. Is she still there? - Where's your boyfriend? - I sent him out. I told him I needed a special kind of shampoo. Boy, it's like you have superpowers. It's a gift. - And a curse? - No, just a gift. All right, we have about 10 minutes. Let me have the scarf. What are you doing? - We're reenacting the crime. You're the victim. What if What if the elevator starts up? It'll get caught again. It's not gonna get caught. Then you be the victim. No, no, no, uh, Sharona was always the victim. - Yeah, I'm sure she was. - No, l I can't be the victim. I'm the detective. I have to step back and observe the scene. Yeah, well, I can observe stuff, too. - A: This is a crime scene - No, no, no, no, you don't look You don't know what to look for. Okay? I mean, we have a system. It's a good system. There's an old saying: ""Don't change anything ever."" - That's an old saying? - I've been saying it for years. I know it's only $2 million. But $2 million here, $4 million there, after a while, we're talkin' about real money. Yeah, the answer is no. Okay, I'm Mrs. Thorn. W-w-w-wait. Oh, looks fantastic on you, by the way. All right, all right. We walk out. We stop. I forgot the tickets. We look for the tickets. I must've left them upstairs. I walk back to the elevator. I press ""P"" for penthouse. The doors close. The scarf gets caught. Maybe somebody was hiding up there. Well, that's possible. But Mrs. Thorn was yelling about the scarf, not not about some attacker. Yeah. So she's alone. She presses her thumb. Mr. Monk! Oh, my God! Here, I have a knife. Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Almost got it. Almost got it. Okay, you're there, you're there! What are you doing, huh? Do you think this is funny? I mean, you you you rifle through my pockets. - You're stepping on it. - You make a mockery of me like this. I just buried my wife. We are not mocking you, Mr. Thorn, we are trying an experiment. I could have you arrested and I'm going to. Are you okay? Do you need some water? - No, I'm okay. I'm okay. - Okay. What? - Questions. - Questions for me? No, I'm I'm sorry. I'm on my way to a board meeting. I'm already late. It won't take a minute. One One minute. Did I do something to offend you, sir? I mean, why don't you let this thing go? What happened to my wife was an accident. get onto the elevator alone. When it stopped, she was dead. They said your wife was screaming for help. And that she called your name. Yeah, that's true. That's true. I I will never forget that moment. But just now, I was being strangled by the scarf like your wife, but I couldn't yell anything. I I couldn't even breathe. How do you explain that, sir? I can't explain it. Can you? I loved my wife, Mr. Monk. - As much as you loved Terri Telenko? - Yeah, I know you talked to Terri. Virtue was not one of my virtues, and, uh, Sheryl knew that. Uh, she accepted it. And, you know, she realized that being married to Daniel Thorn in this town had other compensations. Now you, you don't have any idea who you're dealing with, do you? Come here. Let Let me show you somethin'. The local rag put this picture on the front page. Now, I asked them not to publish it and they ignored me. So yesterday morning, I bought controlling interest in that company so I could personally fire that son of a bitch editor and the photographer and the publisher. Now you understand? Now, that's who you're dealing with. I own this town. Now, Miss Teeger, you worked at the Bellagio. All right, so you've done your homework. Yes, so why don't you tell your friend what the first rule of Vegas is? The golden rule. The only rule. The house always wins. Always. - Ah, there it is. - It's ruined now.

I mean, how are you doing? I'm good. I'm I'm I'm okay. I'm okay. Monk, I really appreciate this. I'm never gambling again for as long as I live. - Wanna bet? - $1,000? Sorry. We can't cover that. There's a $500 limit. I think we can make an exception in Mr. Monk's case. I mean, we're not afraid of him, are we? Nah. You're the boss. But first, let's make it a little more interesting. Why don't you add two more decks to the shoe? Yes, sir. Mr. Monk, that's 10 decks. That's too many. Bring it. If you're trying to cheat me, Mr. Monk, we'll catch you. I got friends hiding in the ceiling. Friends in the ceiling? That's right. There's an access panel above. I know how you did it. I know how he did it. He murdered his wife. Good for him. Congratulations. Let's play cards. Stay. Hit me. Here's what happened. You and your wife went out to that fundraiser. She left the penthouse with you, but she never made it downstairs. You killed her in the elevator on the way down. You had less than two minutes, that's all the time you needed. After all, you had help. - Are you going to play or not? - Sorry. Hit me. This man is delusional. He was discharged from the police force six years ago. - He's not even a real cop. - Yeah, that's true. But we are. Go on. That wasn't your wife in the lobby. That was Teresa Telenko, your mistress in disguise. Come on, hit me! Stay! Teresa was a trained actress. Is that why you seduced her in the first place, I wonder? I'll split these. Stay. Hit me. Double down. Hit me. You hoisted her up through the access panel. Hit me again. And make it a 10. Genius! What is that, 17? I'll stay. Hit me. Then Teresa took your wife's place in the elevator. You had 45 seconds. That was plenty of time. Hit me and hit me. Stay. Stay. The elevator door opened, and you two went into your act. $2,000, uptown and down. Let's keep it sassy. Sure you wanna do that? You said you'd quit. Natalie, I know what I'm doing. When the door closed again, Teresa started to scream your name. Whoa. Blackjack. I believe that's the name of the game. Sheryl was already dead when she pressed the glass. That's why her thumbprint was upside down. Wait. I wanna raise my bets. You said it yourself, you have friends hiding in the ceiling. It was a perfect plan. Everybody knew Sheryl was always catching her scarf on something. Nobody was surprised when it happened again. This is a very interesting fairytale, Mr. Monk, but that's all it is: A fairytale. There might be something in the elevator shaft: Blood, hair. You'd need a court order to even look. Which you're not gonna get, not in this town. So, unless you got something else I did, I had it. I had proof, I just can't remember it. It doesn't matter. You're leaving anyway. This man here is cheating. He's been counting cards. I want him and his friends out of here now. Wait, wait, wait! I'm on fire here. Look, double down! No, no, no, I told you, Mr. Monk. The house always wins. - Hey! - Trust me, even is better. - No more bets. - What the hell? - Hey, man. That's for you. Thanks. - Thank you. - But you said you'd walk away. - I did. I walked away. You were dragged away, Mr. Monk. - Should we call Lt. Waliver? - He can't do anything without proof. That game with the dice, that looks like a lot of fun. Craps? Yeah. Craps, I can show you how to play that. I got a great book. - Okay. - Probably still have a little bit of time. - Randy, give me the money. - You'll get it back when you get home. - I'm not 10 years old. Yeah, that's true. Give me the money. Mr. Stottlemeyer. Here. Groundskeeping found these in the bushes. Are they yours? - Yeah, these are my pants. - Well, don't worry, sir. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Monk. This is it. Remember I was saying that they didn't match? I was talking about the pictures. Look, look, look, look, look. See, that's her body, right? She's wearing hoop earrings. - So? - So, check this out. Moments before she gets on the elevator - Different earrings. - Different girl. I'll call Waliver. That's enough for a search warrant. How many people read this paper? So, that means if if I'm drunk as a skunk, completely plastered, I'm as smart as you. Smarter. They found hair and rope fiber on top of the elevator. With that and those photographs, we got him. - Mr. Monk. - Daniel. Don't go now, Mr. Monk. This game of ours is far from over, my friend. I will be out by tomorrow morning. I wouldn't bet on it. Hey, Professor. I'm playing a few hands. Should I save you a seat? I can't, thanks. - Good luck. - Yeah. You said you gambled? I couldn't stop. I was a mess. But you walked away. How did you do it? I had Mitch. How did you do it? I have you."
"Hello, I'm calling on behalf of Natalie Teeger, who's running for the school board in your district. Are you registered to vote? Oh, my goodness. I just love that sign in the window. Who Who made the sign, do you know? - Her daughter. - Oh, it's so colorful! - Where should I put these? - I don't know. Oh, well. You know, I've never run for anything in my life, but I just got so angry. You know, My daughter Julie goes to Ashton, and I love it. It is such a wonderful school. But they want to close it and consolidate it with the high school, - which would be such a huge mistake. - Piece-of-crap copier. Could you excuse me for one second? I'll be right back. Just one second. All right, tell me something good. You know, this company, Tazarr, went out of business, which is a good thing. Where did you get it? Uh, at a police auction. They just delivered it this morning. I got the fax machine and the computer there, too. - They don't work either. - Well, you get what you pay for. Here's your problem. The primary feeder is jammed. There's somethin' in there, I can't get to it. See? - It's locked. - Mmm-hmm. Did they give you a key for this? Oh, yeah, I think so. Let me check. Oh. Vote Teeger. Hello. Uh, I'm with the Fairfield Eagle. We're doing a story on the election. Why did you decide to volunteer? I'm not a volunteer. I'm her boss. That's an interesting angle. Not every boss would allow his employee time off to run for office. Well, I didn't have a choice. She just said she was doing it. Got it. Now, what do you think is the most important issue in this campaign? For me, there's really only one issue here. If Natalie wins, who will take care of me? No, I'm asking you. Who? - Do you know? No. - No, sorry. Not even close. Can't Can't you just break it open? I only need if for five days. The election is on Tuesday. Watch out! Watch out! Get down! Get down! Natalie, get down! MONK Season 3 Epi. 15 Mr. Monk and the Election Hey, Monk. - I got you. I got you. - All right. How's Natalie doing? She's scared to death. So, the security guard? Yeah, wrong place, wrong time. Hmm, where was the shooter? Right over here. You can kind of see an impression in the tar paper, but Well, uh How are the footprints? Unusable. The witnesses are all over the map, too. Some say they heard five shots, some say nine. You sure? Of course you're sure. How did they come? Were they evenly spaced? Bang. Bang, bang. Bang. - Bang, bang, bang, bang. - Rapid fire, semi-automatic. We haven't found any shells. Guy did a pretty good cleanup job. Well, maybe he's done this before. Monk, what do you got? Well, the The roof slants at a weird angle right here. Do you have a bullet? He missed one. It's a 7.62. AK? Yeah, Kalashnikov. Russian. That's somethin'. Call Grooms at the Bureau, and the ATF. Maybe they have an idea. Captain, we found something. You might want to check it out. What you got? Looks like a note. ""Natalie Teeger must withdraw."" Son of a bitch, he was after Natalie. Well, that doesn't make sense. It's just a school board election. I mean, who cares? He spelled her name wrong. He was probably in a rush. I don't think so. It looks like he took his time. He dotted all the ""I's,"" crossed the ""T's."" - He spelled her name wrong. - Whatever. Motive. Motive, motive. Let's start with the obvious. Who's running against her? Yeah, I've got it right here. Harold Jay Krenshaw. You've got to be kidding. Harold Jay Krenshaw? He's running for school board? - You know him? - He's a patient of Dr. Kroger's. Uh, I met him in the waiting room. This guy has got some serious problems. He drives everybody he meets crazy. I mean, he's He's just Nobody is accusing anybody of anything here. This is just a friendly conversation. In fact, I bought some doughnuts. Mr. Krenshaw, do you know why you're here? Well, it's pretty obvious. I'm running for school board against Natalie Teeger and somebody took a shot at her. A security guard was killed. I heard about that. I'm sorry. Do you own a gun, Mr. Krenshaw? Yes, I do. My father was a a hunter. He bought me a Remington rifle when I was a kid. - Just the Remington? - That's right. Are you a good shot? I'm an exceptional shot. Miss Teeger has decided to drop out of the Out of the race. How do you feel about that? Well, it doesn't matter. She couldn't win anyway. Why? That school needs to be closed. Everybody knows it. I'd be happy to take a polygraph test if you want. What are you What are you doing? I'm eating a doughnut. It's food. - W-Why that one? - Because I like the coconut. - Now you have to eat a sugar one. - I don't want a sugar one. Or you could take three more coconuts and two chocolate. Or one coconut and two glazed. Or you could just eat them all. That would probably be easier, huh? - That's a good idea. - Probably be easiest. - Yeah. - Or I could do this. There. Now there's one doughnut. One big damn doughnut. - You see what you did? - Could we get back to this? Mr. Krenshaw, where were you at 10:30 this morning? I was at Dr. Kroger's office. I had my my appointment. Your appointment ends at 10:00. It was a double session. Dr. Kroger doesn't do double sessions anymore. I'm just telling you. He made an exception for me. If you don't believe me, call him. - Do you want his beeper number? - I have his beeper number, okay? Well, if that doesn't work, try his cell phone. - He gave you his cell phone number? - Mmm-hmm. - That's a lie. He's lying, Captain. - Hmm. 'Cause Dr. Kroger would never give anybody his cell phone number, ever. Not ever. Monk, I really don't care. I've been to his home. - Have you no shame? - Excuse me. A man died today. - I met his daughter. - Liar! Liar! Are you seeing this? Kindergarten playground in there. Captain, captain, it's not me, is it? Am I? Just tell me, am I am I that guy? Am I am I that far gone? Relax, Monk, you are completely different. You put the chocolate doughnuts in the middle, which makes perfect sense, because that way the different groups are together. Exactly! That's all I'm saying. And he put the chocolate donuts on either end, which j-just isn't as good, because that way, they're they're separated. - Hello! - No comparison. I told you. He will he will drive you crazy. - So, is he the guy? - Uh, no. I wish he was, but he's not the guy. He never would have misspelled Natalie's name on the note. How do you know? Because Because I wouldn't have. Let's do the polygraph test anyway, to be sure. Right. Well, what's he doing now? What's this? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Not vertically. Not vertically! Be right back. - You hungry? - Yeah. Let's get something to eat. What about them? - They'll be fine. - Yup. Ow! I'm I'm glad you're quitting. Really, it's just just a stupid election. I mean, it's not worth getting killed over. Right? Besides, you can run again in another four years. Right? Mom? What are you guys doin'? Well, we're packin' everything up. Put it back. Come on. Let's get to work. We have an election to win. I'm Natalie, please vote for me. Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger. I'm running for school board. - Miss Teeger? - Hi, my name's Natalie Teeger. Hey, Miss Teeger? What are you doing? I'm running for office. Hi, Natalie Teeger. Thank you. I thought you had dropped out of the race. Changed my mind. - Why? - I have my reasons. Hi, uh, are you registered to vote? Who are you gonna vote for? It's time to wear a pin. Mr. Ellis? You're scaring him. - Okay. - He's scaring me. Vote Teeger! Hi, vote for Natalie Teeger. Vote Teeger! Hi, vote for Natalie Teeger. Where did you find them? They heard about the shooting and wanted to help. I can't protect you out here. There are too many rooftops, too many windows. That's a risk I'm willing to take. Thank you. You have to think about Julie. I am thinking about Julie, Mr. Monk. More than you know. She won't listen to me. Did you talk to Harold Krenshaw? We don't think Mr. Krenshaw is involved. His alibi is airtight, and he just passed a polygraph. We're working with ATF to track down the weapon. In the meantime, Miss Teeger, I need for you to cancel all public appearances. I can't do that. Okay. We need to sweep the campaign office for explosives every morning. - Yes, sir. I want a lockdown. Two uniforms, round the clock. Even when she's not there. Yes, sir. And I am assigning you a bodyguard. Lieutenant, thank you for volunteering. - He's my bodyguard? - 24-7. I'm still not droppin' out. That's not my job. It is now. All clear. - Is Julie here today? - No. She's staying with my parents until you guys figure out what's the hell is going on. Okay, Natalie, if this school closes, who would benefit? Would they sell the building? No. The city would keep it and use it for special education classes. That doesn't make any sense. I mean, there there is no motive. I I know. There are 14 other members on the board. Most of them agree with me. What, is this maniac going to kill off the whole school board? Oh. - Yo! - Miss Teeger! Please, don't do that. - What? - Walk away without telling me. - I went 5 feet. - Still. It's protocol. Ow! I don't think this was about the school at all. I can't stop thinking about that note and how he misspelled your name. What do you think it means? I don't know. - But it's important. - Hmm. Hmm, brings back memories, huh? Yeah. But what are you gonna do? I used to love tetherball. It wasn't really my game. - What was your game, Mr. Monk? - Give it, give it! Keep-away. I played a lot of keep-away. Keep-away? I was usually the jumper. That was my position. - It was good exercise, too. - Hey, jump for it, squirt. The ball was movin' around Cardiovascular. Jump. Now, now! Jump! Oh, this kid's timing is way off. - It's all about timing. - Crybaby. Now, now he's crying? I usually started crying a lot earlier. But everybody's got a different style. You played this a lot? All through high school. Some college. Got pretty good at it. The secret to keep-away is you have to have a lot of other hats at home, and not get too attached to any of them. It was a good match. Oh, honey, I can't. Not tonight. I have a big debate tomorrow. I have to go home and practice. I know, I miss you too. I love you, angel. You be good for Grandma and Grandpa, okay? All right, bye. Mr. Monk? Please. A little help? Hi, hello. Can I help? Of course, you can. The more the merrier. Here you go. You take a flyer, you fold it up, in the envelope, and seal it. Here you go. - There's five. - All right. Hey, hey, Karen. Hey, Donna. Hey, Lee-John. Who's hungry? I have homemade lasagna. A little fuel to keep us going. Mr. Monk, are you hungry? An army marches on its stomach. Oh, no. No, thank you. Herr General, eat. Keep your strength up. You've got a big debate tomorrow. Excuse me. I think I'd better try this. A little too much oregano, but it's not poison. That's what every cook likes to hear. Ahem, listen, Natalie, do you want me to get this copier out of here? I could take it to the junkyard for you. I got a buddy with a truck. Thank you, Jack, but I got the repair guy comin' back tomorrow to check it out. Besides, it makes a hell of a buffet, right? Miss Teeger, you have a phone call. - No, don't put me on hold. - Natalie, do you still have the poster Julie made? The one that was above the door? Yeah, I think it's behind those boxes. It was missing an ""R."" I found it over there. Oh, It must've fallen off when she was putting it up. The sniper didn't know her name. That's why he misspelled it. So, all he knew was what he saw on this poster. What does it mean? Well, it means, the note he left was just a diversion. This wasn't about you at all. All right, this will be the podium. Uh, Lieutenant, do you have the questions? - Yeah. - All right, let's get started. Mr. Monk, you will be the moderator. If you'll come right over here. He had to be shooting at somebody. So why was he trying to scare you? You said it was a diversion. But diversion from what? It doesn't make any sense. No, I can't worry about that. I have a debate tomorrow. I have to practice. - Sorry. - Sorry. - Okay. - Hello, welcome to the debate. I'll be your moderator. Who has the first question? Lieutenant. Miss Teeger, ""Why should the entire community pay to keep Ashton Junior High open?"" Miss Teeger, you have 30 seconds. That's a very good question. It's true that closing Ashton Junior High would save the taxpayers money. But it would cost $1.20 - What are you doing? - 22. I don't have a stopwatch. 20 - 19 - Mr. Monk, I can't concentrate. 17,16 more than offset Please stop. Just stop counting! Thank you. Could you repeat the question? - Miss Teeger - Time's up. Come on! Miss Teeger, are you all right? I'm fine. It's a grenade. Get rid of it! - You all right? - Yeah. Disher told me that you put the grenade in the refrigerator. - Yeah. And then he said you went back and opened it again. You just had to straighten something out, didn't you? I'm gonna ask the Mayor to give you a medal for what you did. And then I'm gonna ask the Mayor to take that medal back. Because you just had to open that door, didn't you? - So it's a wash? - Yeah, it's a wash. Captain, that grenade had Russian markings. I know. We found a piece of it. It was made in Chechnya. This guy must be very well connected. Whoever he is, you must be making him nervous. - How's Natalie? - She's fine. But you got to talk to her, Monk. She still won't quit. Even after this. Natalie, it's me. Come in. I'm not quitting. Natalie, look. We We We don't know who this guy is. We don't know what's going on. Then figure it out, Mr. Brilliant Detective, figure it out, because I'm not quitting. - I can't quit. - Of course you can! I see. You can't quit because Mitch was a hero. You don't understand. I can't quit because Mitch wasn't a hero. Close the door. What I'm about to tell you dies with you. Do you understand? Okay. My husband and two crewmembers were shot down over Kosovo in 1998. They crash-landed behind enemy lines. Mitch didn't make it out. But they rescued the other crewmembers. And when they got back, they said They said he panicked. They said that after the crash, he ran off with the radio and all their supplies. - They said he was a coward. - Oh, my God. And the Navy can't prove their version of the story, but it's in the record. It's in a file somewhere. - Natalie. - I don't know what the real story is. But all I know is some day, Julie is going to start asking questions about her father. He's not here. But I'm here. I'm all she has. I can't be a coward, too. Hello. Welcome to the fifth District School Board debate. We're all aware of the controversy and tragedy surrounding this election. But tonight we're going to try to rise above all that and focus on the issues. I'm going to ask our two candidates to make a brief opening statement. Natalie, why don't you go first? Uh Good evening. I'm Natalie Teeger, and I'm running for school board for one reason. To save my daughter's school. As a mother, I know you can't put a price on a good education. - And if we don't invest in our children - Jack. - What are you doin'? - not only their future - Oh, well, I I have a question. - Cool. Give 'em hell, man! - Yeah. Hey, check this out. I designed a new flyer for the campaign. We can hang them up tomorrow near the polls. - Okay, great, thanks. - I will work with all of you to make this school, and the entire system, work even better. Thank you. Next, we'll hear from her opponent, Mr. Harold Krenshaw. Hello. I'm Harold Krenshaw. You all know me. You know where I stand. Reduce the budget, lower taxes. If that means consolidating a few of our schools, then that's what we have to do. Yeah. Okay. Who has the first question? Please state your name. My name is Adrian Monk. Uh, my question is for Mr. Krenshaw. Mr. Krenshaw, during this campaign, you have made a number of statements. I wonder if you might be able to substantiate one of those statements for us right now. You said that you have been to Dr. Kroger's house. - Oh, God. - That's right. In fact, I believe you said that you had Christmas dinner with him last year. - Yeah. - But Dr. Kroger is Jewish. He doesn't celebrate Christmas, does he, Mr. Krenshaw? His first wife, Alisha, was Jewish. But Madeline, his fiancee, is Irish Catholic. They celebrate both. His fiancee? Yeah. I introduced them. That is a lie. Dr. Kroger never said anything to me about a fiancee. Let me repeat that for you. Dr. Kroger never said anything to me about a fiancee. Go to hell, Monk. - You You can go to hell. - You go to hell! You! You! Okay. Thank you. Natalie, you have 30 seconds for rebuttal. Uh, I I don't know where Dr. Kroger is this evening, but our prayers are with him. - Monk, what's goin' on? - Did you see that? - See what? - That guy. Whitman. He got to the door, then he stopped. He's done time. In prison, you never open your own door. They open them for you, and after a while, it becomes a habit. - He must have just been released. - Okay, so, he's done time. Look. He just handed me this. Look how it's folded. Four corners to the center, then in half, and half again. In my whole life, I've only ever seen one piece of paper folded like this. The sniper's note. He's the guy. Why? What's he after? I don't know. But he's the guy. Oh, yeah. Don't you ever get tired of being right? I do feel tired. More fatigued, really. I don't know if it's from being right It was a rhetorical question, Monk. You could be on to something here. Jack Whitman. He's been sent up twice. First time for mail fraud and receiving stolen property. Lately, he's been importing rugs. Rugs? Yeah, rugs, from places like Chechnya, Uzbekistan. Sound familiar? The shell casing and the grenade. The Feds think that he's a major arms dealer. They raided his office six months ago. They came up empty-handed. No guns, no nothing, no paper trail. All they could get him on was tax evasion. He did five months. He just got out last Wednesday. And two days later, he's on a roof taking shots at Natalie. Then he joins her campaign, and then he tries to take you out. What's he after? I'm not going to wait to find out. - Let's go get him. - Oh, I can't go. You're on your own. Natalie's waiting for me downstairs. I have to go vote. Well, that's good. You're doing your civic duty. There's that. Also, if I don't vote, Natalie will You know. Oh. Here you go. - You guys voting today? - No. There's a polling place right around the corner. So, you have no excuses. Sure we do: We don't care. Wow, that was weird. I've never voted for myself before. That was That was really weird. But not bad-weird, good-weird. Actually, that was kind of great-weird. All right, let's go. Uh, I haven't voted yet. - What have you been doing? - I'm still signing in. I'm almost done. Booth number two. - What? - It's small, huh? Yeah. I know it is. I really appreciate this, Mr. Monk. I can't do it. I just can't. Mr. Monk, come on. You know what this election means to me. Now, you can do this. Here we go. Here we go. Democracy in action. Okay. I got it. Oh. Shh. Hello? No, sir, he can't. He's voting. All right, bye. Ah, I can't I can't breathe in here. There's no There's no air in here. No, there's air. You can breathe. - Lots of air. - Oh. - How did it go? - I'm not notnot quite finished. Just just gonna take a little bit of a break. So many choices, huh? Column two. Teeger. Third name down: Teeger. Okay, all right, I'm I'm going, now. No wonder turnout is so low. Natalie, where did you get that box? I don't know. The The campaign office. That was Jack Whitman's box, remember? He brought it with food in it from home. Oh, my God, I know what Jack Whitman was after. Have you heard if he's in custody yet? The Captain just called. They said they can't find him. Well, I know where he is going. We got to call the Captain back, and tell him to meet us at the campaign headquarters. - What's going on? - Tazarr copier. Sound familiar? The copy machine at your campaign office used to belong to Jack Whitman. That's what this whole thing has been about. The copy machine? Sir! Sir, we need my car. We're in a hurry! It's right there! Here you go! Here you go! $10. I don't have any cash. I was going to stop at the ATM. Do you have any money? Do you ever have any money? Listen, this is very important. It's a police emergency, I need my car. Here, take my purse as collateral. - I can't do that. - Oh, come on! - Hey! You can't do that! - It's an emergency. - Shawn! Shawn! - Oh, come on, give me the keys! You got to be kidding me. - Key. Whoa. - Whoa. It's keep-away. Natalie! Natalie, stop! You You're just embarrassing yourself. No offense, okay, but I'm comin' in. Come on, get out of there. Bring it. Mr. Monk, come on, let's just walk. No. There's not enough time. Whitman is already on his way to your campaign office because the cops that were stationed there have all been sent home. That's why Whitman was waitin' around. Here's what happened. Six months ago, Whitman was in his office, minding his own business, which, in his case, was buying and selling illegal weapons. ATF! Open up! The ATF raided the office. Whitman managed to burn all the incriminating papers he had, - except for one. - The one in the copy machine! Exactly. There was something jammed inside that machine. A document, a receipt. Whatever it was, it must be pretty important. After he was arrested, The Feds confiscated all of his equipment, including the copy machine. Last week, when he got out of jail, he learned that the copier had been sold at the police auction. What the hell is he talkin' about? Who cares? The auction was open to the public, so it wasn't hard for Whitman to track you down. He knew the document inside that copier could send him to jail for life. Somehow, Whitman had to stop the repairman from opening it up. He grabbed one of his guns, ran up to the roof across the street, and tried to take out the copier. He figured if he shot it to hell, you'd just throw it out. But you never did. That's why he volunteered. He was waiting for a chance to break into it. But the cops were there around the clock. Oh, shoot, almost had it. And when I got suspicious, he tried to kill me with that grenade. Damn! Ah! Okay, I give up. Damn, you are good! Let's go! I'll be back with your money! - Whitman, touch that gun and you're dead! - Hands on your head! Hands on your head! Captain. Captain, what is it? Looks like a client list. It's a half a dozen names. Delivery dates. Stinger missiles. Rocket-propelled grenades. This is big. I've got a friend at the Bureau who's been looking for this. Let's go. - When did you put this together? - In the voting booth. Thank you again for doing that, Mr. Monk. Every vote counts. You did vote for me, didn't you? I think so. I don't know, it's all, you know, kind of a blur, really. What if I lose by one vote? You didn't quit. And for the record, it wasn't me. I mean, you didn't lose by just one vote. Yeah, I know. You lost by a lot more than one vote. - It was close to a landslide. - Yes, I know. Thank you, Mr. Monk. Are you, okay? Yeah, I feel pretty great. We're fighters, right? - We'll be back, right? - Right. Oh, my goodness. Oh, hey, everyone. It's It's Harold's victory speech. Boo! There are so many people that I I want to thank.

What have you got there, big guy? Oh my God. Where did you get this? MONK Season 3 Epi. 16 Mr. Monk and the Kid - Is there any word from the hospitals? - Not yet, we're still checking. All right. We need to talk to anybody who was in the park or near the park. - We're going to lock it down. - Sir, it's three and a half acres. Lock it down and keep it locked down. If there's a body here we're gonna find it if it takes all night. Hey, Monk, Natalie, thanks for comin'. Hey, we just got your call. I didn't quite understand it. - You found a body? - Uh, not quite. But there's a two-year-old boy named Tommy Grazer Uh, not two years, twenty-two months. Not quite two. Whatever. Anyway, um, he was, um, separated from his mother His, uh, guardian. She's not actually his mother. She, uh, runs a foster home. For the record. For the record, stand over there. Anyway, he was in the playground, and he disappeared for like ten minutes Uh, 14 minutes. When we found him the little guy had a severed human finger. - A finger? - A pinkie. It was still bleeding, freshly severed. - Probably about four hours ago. - Yeah, about four hours ago. I just said that, Randy. Just a finger? Yeah. So far. Now, we're not telling the press anything. All we're telling them is that somebody found a body part. We're not giving them any details. Where did he find it? The boy's not talking. Maybe he hates cops. Maybe he's two years old. Tommy? This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. And this is Mrs. Novak, the boy's legal guardian. Hey, you can't keep us here. We haven't done anything. Mrs. Novak, I promise you we'll get you out of here just as soon as we can. Hi. Hi, sweetie. My name is Natalie. Give me five. Yeah. Hey, this is my friend. His name is Mr. Monk. - He's gonna talk to you for a minute, okay? - Monk. He's a very nice man. - You're pretty good with kids. - Oh. It's sort of my job. Hello, my my name is Adrian Monk. - Monk. - That's right. I'm working with the police department. Technically, I'm here as a consultant. Do you understand consultant? Mr. Monk, he's not gonna get that. Um, an advisor, sort of an adjunct. Monk, I don't know what an adjunct is. Monk. Monk. Look, I'dI'd like to take him for a little walk, see where he goes. Maybe he'll retrace his steps. - Is that okay? - Yeah. Okay. Um, would you like to go for a walk? Oh. Monk. Monk. Monk. He won't stop saying ""Monk"". Where did you find that finger? Was it over there? Was it over here? - This way. - This way? - Yeah. Are you sure? Looks like Monk finally found a friend. Her name was Trudy, and she was 34 years old. We never found the killer. We had a lead in New York last year, but so far it's pretty much a dead end. Ooh. Careful. Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tommy, don't don't put that in your mouth. No. See? That is nature. See. We never put that in our mouth. Nature is dirty. See? Nature dirty. Nature dirty. Here, look. Here. Okay. Now look, I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna give you an extra wipe, you keep it in your pocket for later. You-You'll need that later. Here. Put it Put it right in your pocket and keep it for later. Okay. Let's go. - Nature dirty. - That's what I'm saying. And he wouldn't let go. Did you see him? Yes, Monk. We saw him. We were there. I mean, every time I tried to say goodbye he-he just hugged me tighter, even tighter. He had the most perfect little hands. Did you notice his his perfect hands? - Yes, Mr. Monk. He liked you. - You think so? Yes. He kept on saying your name over and over, didn't he? - ""Monk, Monk, Monk."" - Yeah, he did. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Yes, sir. It is a left pinkie belonging to a male Caucasian about 25 years old. So far there's no match on the fingerprint. The digit was severed earlier today. We figure about 8:00 a. m., with some kind of gardening instrument, like pruning shears. They cut up a whole body with pruning shears? No. Maybe they just cut off the fingers. That way, when they dumped the body later, there'd be no prints. There's a callus. That's true. We think he might have played guitar. No. Not guitar. It's at the wrong angle. He played the violin. There's some residue. It's sticky, like sap. Tree sap, lumberjack. A missing nine-fingered lumberjack. - Who plays the violin. - Should I put a list together? Absolutely. Make sure you don't run out of paper. - Right. - It's not tree sap. We already ran it. The main component is abietic acid. Abietic acid? That's violin rosin. I think that's pretty expensive rosin. It's for professionals. So professional, or at least very serious violinist - Yeah. - 25 years of age, who is missing. You wanna speak with my son? Yes. Ma'am, we've been talking to musicians all day and we understand that Daniel plays violin for the Bay City Quintet. Yes, that's right. In his spare time. According to your son's employer, he called in sick this morning. He got home very late last night, and he was tired. Is he home, Mrs. Carlyle? - Mother? - Daniel. Is something wrong? These people are with the police. They want to talk with you. Can you ask them to come back? I'm rehearsing right now. Daniel Carlyle? That's right. Could I see your other hand? I have a concert tonight, if you don't mind. Sorry to bother you, Mr. Carlyle. Have a nice day, ma'am. Oh, that was number eight. He was the last one on our list. - I wonder if the Captain's doing any better? - No. I'm sure he would've called. Maybe I should talk to that boy again. You mean Tommy? He's two years old. - He won't be able to tell you anything. - I don't know. He found the finger. Maybe if I spend some more time with him. You miss him, don't you? We're going bye-bye now. Here we go. I-It wasn't my fault. The kid walked away for ten minutes. - I mean, it could happen to anybody. - It's not my decision, Janet. When an incident like this happens we always remove the child until the agency can review the situation. The kid found a pinkie. It's no big deal. It might be an indication you and Raymond are overtaxed here. I mean, you already have four foster children. Yeah. But we're doing the very best we can, Mrs. Crane. I know you are, Janet. Why don't you call my office in the morning, and we'll see where we stand. Okay? Say good-bye. Here we go. May I help you? Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger. This is Adrian Monk. And we're working with the police on the investigation. - About the severed - Yeah. Right, Mrs Crane, Theresa Crane. I'm Tommy's case worker. Monk. I see you two have met before. - What happens to him now? - It's a tough one. I've been trying to place him with a family in Livingston. It'd be a perfect match, but they can't take him for two weeks. I'll take him. What? What are you going to do? Adopt him? I'll take him. I'll take him. Monk. Uh, this is the last form. Just sign here. It doesn't have to be perfect. - Maybe it does. - Thank you. Normally I would prefer a longer waiting period. But because you and Tommy have already bonded and it's just a temporary placement, I decided to go with my instincts. There we go. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Now, before I go, do you have any questions for me? Yes. Yes, I have a couple of questions. What does he eat? He eats food. He eats whatever you eat, only smaller portions. So he's like a person? Exactly. And when he wakes up Yes? What do I do? You You take care of him. You play with him. You love him. How? How? How do I love him? Mr. Monk, you don't need me to tell you that. You're off to a great start with Tommy. He likes you already, a lot. You can always call your friend, Natalie. I think she's great. Oh. I'll check in tomorrow and see how you're doin'. Wait. One sec, wait a minute. Wait. You're You're leaving? You're leaving now? Wait. Right now? You'll be fine. Just trust yourself. Bye, Tommy. Have fun. Well, thank you. Thanks. Thanks again. No, no, Tommy, don't cry. I promise I'm going to do the best I can. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry. Everything is okay. Ah. Where'd he go? Where'd that kid go? - Yes, nice and neat. - Nice neat. Nice and neat. You've got to help me. Uh, look, I've just taken in a two-year-old boy. My, uh, assistant isn't home and I can't I can't reach her. Oh. Oh, God. Oh. Sir, what is the nature of your emergency? It's everywhere. BM. It's BM. BM. BM. It's BM. Sir, you have to stop saying BM now. Do you mean your child is soiling his diaper? Yes. Yes, he's soiling his his diaper with, you know, with BM. You mean you've never changed a diaper? - Hurry. - Okay, listen carefully. There should be two Velcro straps on the sides. - Find the two straps. - Okay, I've got the straps. Now rip 'em open. Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh, the humanity. Okay, sir? All right, do you have any wipes? Yes, I've got about 2,000. - That should be fine. - It's not going to be enough! Sir, you're gonna have to wipe your son's bottom. Sir, is the boy all right? He's fine. That was me. Wait a minute. Oh, my God. He's making more. I-Is it number one or number two? It's one and two and and, oh, my God. It's It's three. It's number three. Sir, I'm afraid you're on your own. This line is for emergencies only. That's right, children. That was the piano. And that instrument was the violin. Now let's listen to the piano and the violin. - Are you sure he's okay? - Oh, yeah. He's fine. Mr. Monk, why is he wearing a snow suit? It was Felt a little chilly. That's all. There was a little nip in the air. Oh, my gosh, he's sweating. There we go. - He is? - There you go. Okay. That's better, huh? So what are we doing here? Do you remember the guy we met the other day, Daniel Carlyle? Well, that wasn't the real Daniel Carlyle. That guy wasn't a violinist at all. - He wasn't? - Mmm-mmm. I remembered something. He said that we interrupted his rehearsal, remember? Hmm. But the violin bow in his hand was loose, so he couldn't have been playing. Plus I went to the library this morning and I found this. Look. Bay City Quintet. That's the group that Daniel Carlyle plays with. And he said that he had a concert that night. But there's nothing on the schedule. The bow was loose? I think we met his brother. But why would they be lying? I don't know. Maybe Maybe the real Daniel Carlyle is dead. And the mother and brother killed him. No, I can't believe that. Wouldn't be the first time. - Maybe we should call Stottlemeyer. - Yeah, I will as soon as I'm sure. Oh, my God. What is this? - Why is he wearing a helmet? - It's to protect his head. That must be so uncomfortable. Oh, he'll get used to it. I used to wear one all the time. Your parents made you wear a helmet? No. There they are. There they are. Here we go. It's been 20 minutes. What do you think they're doing? I don't know. They're waiting for somebody. Here you go. - How's everything here? - Perfect, thank you. But can we get some more napkins, please? Mr. Monk, can I ask you something? Why did you take Tommy in? I I I Well, he needed me, and I I I I thought, I thought someday, you know, I thought somehow, maybe he would Love you? Oh, my gosh, look. He's separating his food. Me separating food. Mr. Monk, look, look, look, look. Natalie, I know what's going on. I had it all wrong. They didn't kill Daniel. Daniel's not dead. He's been kidnapped. How did you know? We followed you. We saw you at the pay phone, and then we saw you go to the bank and make a withdrawal. - You must be Daniel's brother? - Jacob. Mrs. Carlyle, when did they kidnap your son? Wednesday. Feels like a year ago. They cut off his finger to prove that they had him and, uh, when we went to retrieve it at the park it was all roped off, and there were police everywhere. Yes, a young boy found his finger before you got there. That's what led us to you. You found us from his finger? - What are their demands? - $500,000. And they said that if we went to the police they would kill Daniel. That's why we couldn't tell you the truth. I'm sorry, I I just can't stop shaking. Huh, I can't I'm sorry. Mr. Monk? You have to promise me one thing. You won't tell the police. If you do they'll kill him. I don't know if I can promise you that. Do you have children? Yes, I have a son. Well, then you know how I feel. Wouldn't you do anything for him? Wouldn't you die for him? Yes, I would. Hello? We have the money. I understand. Yes, my son Jacob will bring it. He'll be alone. Is Danny all right? Is he hurt? Could I just speak to him for one Please, I just They want you to, uh, go to the YMCA on Vinton Street, and you'll find locker 42 there, and inside there'll be a note. I can't do it. I'm I'm gonna mess it up. I'm sorry. I can't do it. It's all right. - I'll do it. - Mrs. Carlyle, you can't go. They're expecting a man. She's right. We'll have to find a man. Or or I could do it. Sorry. - Carlyle, have you got the money? - Yes. Listen carefully. Take the money from the duffel bag put it in the trash bag, then get undressed. - Excuse me? There's a bathrobe. Put it on and go up to the roof. You'll see a man on the next rooftop. Throw him the bag. Do you understand? H-H-Hold on. Did you say get undressed? Well, we have to be sure you're not wearing a tracking device. Okay, here's the thing, what if I promise you I am not wearing a tracking device? What if I give you my word? You think this is funny? Do it, or your kid brother loses another finger. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here's the thing. Uh, here here here's the thing. Uh, I'm just, uh, I'm I'm not comfortable here. Uh, I'm not Even Even in high school I I couldn't change in the locker room. I I got an incomplete almost every semester. I I I almost didn't graduate. Vice Principal Bradley had to call my mother at one point. What are you talking about? Are you trying to screw with us? Oh, no, no. Then get up on the roof in a bathrobe with the money, or Daniel's dead. - Hey, how you doin'? - Hi. - The rowing machine's broken again. - Uh-oh. They don't fix anything around here. They don't clean anything. I mean, what do we pay our dues for? - Am I right? - Right. Right. Yeah. My membership's up next week. If they don't get their act together, I'm not renewin'. I'll go to that new place up the street. - How about you? - I don't know. I Could you Could you do me a favor and go away? - What? - Just for three minutes? Really, it's a matter of life and death. Yeah, right. - Ah. Oh. - Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it. Oh, there you go. Thank you. Yeah. Hello? Hello? Mr. Monk? Is Mom there? Julie, Julie, listen, I I I took her phone. I I had a couple of errands to run. - Is Tommy okay? - He's fine. - He's He's fine? - Don't freak out, okay? I spilt a little grape juice on the rug. Listen very carefully. There are some cleaning supplies in the hall closet. They're arranged alphabetically, then by height, then by date of purchase. Find the rug cleaner, then find a scouring pad, then find some distilled water, Julie. Distilled water. Hold on a second. There's another call. I'm waiting. Where the hell are you? Some grape juice spilled. Well, you got three minutes, or Daniel's dead. Julie, I'll call you back. - Hello? - Mr. Monk? Everything is okay. The stain is almost out. Thanks, Julie. I I appreciate that. Mr. Monk, you should see Tommy. He's so cute. He's cleaning the stain all by himself. I can tell, when he grows up, he's gonna be just like you. - Just like me? - I'll see you when you get home. Hey. Hey! Carlyle. Behind you. Hey! Hey! I'm throwing you the money, okay? Okay? Oh, yeah! Hey! Hey, what the hell are you doin'? All right, so what, you you you threw the ransom money to the wrong man? That's right. - Does that happen a lot? - Oh yeah, more than you'd think. Really? No, okay? Okay, no. It's It's unprecedented. All right, so so, what what happens now? Mrs. Carlyle gave me permission to call the Captain in. He recovered the ransom money. The kidnappers called back two hours later, thank God, And they're gonna set up another drop. A-A-Adrian, what what happened on that roof? A mistake like that, that's not like you. I was distracted. Natalie's daughter called. She was babysitting Tommy. - Wh-What What did she say? - I don't remember. Oh. I think you do. All right. She spilled some juice, and Tommy was helping to clean it up. It's funny. She said that Tommy was just like me. And that And that upset you? No. No, I was flattered. Actually, I've been thinking about calling the case worker and making it permanent. Well, that's a That's a pretty big commitment, Adrian. I mean, that's probably the biggest commitment there is. Well, I figure he could do a lot worse for a father than me. Am I right? - Absolutely. - For example, what if he were adopted by uh, well, you know, wolves? Wolves would probably eat him alive. - Which is something I would never do. - Right. No, of course not. Adrian, I know you don't want to hear this. I'm not giving him up. I'm proud of you for taking Tommy. I'm glad you did it. But in your heart of hearts, I think you know - you're not ready for this. - I'm not giving him up. - Hello? - Julie? Mom? Mr. Monk? You have to see this. Come here. Hey. So what? What? So he's just like me. I I think that's I I I think that's I think that's okay. I'm tired of apologizing for him. I'm I'm What, because he he he cares about putting things away and and how he looks? That's a good thing. - But Mr. Monk, he's not even two years old. Well, then he's in the vanguard, isn't he? He's a new breed. He's a new breed. Oh, my God. What if it's true? Mr. Monk, what what did Dr. Kroger say? Dr. Kroger? Dr. Kroger is not perfect. Dr. Kroger makes mistakes all the time. Last year, he told me to start dating. Dating. Okay, you know what, just stop Honey, we've got to go. It's a school night. You know what? Wait. I I I Mr. Monk, I've just got to say something, and I hope you don't think I'm out of line. But I'm a single parent, and I can tell you it's hard. I mean, it's wonderful It's just I hope you think about what you're doing. Mmmuah. See you tomorrow. Just think about it. Book. Book. - You want me to read you a story? - Yeah. Okay, here we go. Okay. Okay, what do we have here? Which one shall we read? This one? Okay. Here we go. The Princess and the Pea. ""Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom What? What is that? Tommy, what what is that? - Lipstick. - Lipstick. Where did you Did you You got that from Natalie's purse? You took that out of Natalie's purse? Um, no. Capt. Stottlemeyer, please. What? Could you Could you have him call Adrian Monk as soon as possible? Tell him it's very important. Yes. Tell him I think I know who kidnapped Daniel Carlyle. Thank you. Okay. Shall we read another story? - Um, yeah. - Okay, here we go. ""Once upon a time in a kingdom called San Francisco,"" ""there lived a brave little prince."" ""And his name was Tommy Grazer."" ""Tommy lived with a wicked king and queen."" ""The queen was very greedy."" ""She loved gold, and she wanted more and more."" ""The queen had a plan."" ""She would find a young fiddler from a wealthy family"" ""and kidnap him and hold him for ransom. ""They locked the fiddler in a dungeon."" ""The fiddler's family was very sad."" ""They would do anything to get him back."" ""The wicked king and queen needed to prove that they were serious,"" ""so they chopped off the fiddler's finger"" ""and planned to leave it in the park."" ""But Prince Tommy was very brave and very smart"" ""He liked to reach into ladies' purses."" ""He reached into the queen's purse and he grabbed the finger."" That's where you found it, isn't it? Yeah. ""Then Tommy made a new friend named Mr. Monk."" ""Mr. Monk remembered something that the wicked queen said:"" ""The kid found a pinkie. It's no big deal."" ""How did she know the missing finger was a pinkie?"" ""The police never released that information."" And then, the most wonderful and surprising thing of all happened. Mr. Monk discovered that he loved that little prince. But he also realized that the little prince could never live happily ever after if he stayed at Mr. Monk's house, because Mr. Monk can barely take care of himself. And so, they're gonna have to say good-bye. The end. Surveillance says there are four kids in the back, watching TV. Where's Mom and Dad? In the kitchen havin' a drink. Hit it. Police. On the floor.

Praying for the sweet release that only death can bring. So, Monk, what do you think? Who are we looking for? Ah, I'd say it's a terrier, a Yorkie, maybe a chihuahua. Probably miles away by now. We'll never catch him. - He can't concentrate because of the - 'Cause of the what? [Whispers.] The dog poo. Lieutenant. Clean that up for me, would you? Thanks. Sergeant. Yes, sir. Clean that up. No, don't. Sir, you can't park there. It's all right. It's okay. I'm a detective. I'm a detective. One second. Here we go. [Mutters.] Hold that? I got it. I usually keep it right Um Oh! I got it. Here we go. Marty Eels. Private Investigator. I'm here to save your butts. Captain! Captain Stottlemeyer! Oh, hell. Who's that? Marty Eels. He's a private investigator. Nickel-and-dime stuff. Divorces, insurance fraud. He's a professional pain in the ass. Hey, Captain. Captain, you're lookin' great. You're losin' weight or your shirts are getting bigger. Marty. I heard the D.A. Pulled your license. No, no, no. That was just a temporary suspension. No, no, no. That was just a little misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? That's all ancient history anyway. So I was just riding around in the neighborhood, and I heard a call go out on the police scanner Look, Marty. I'm busy. Yeah, that's why I thought I'd come down here and lend a hand. So what do we got? The jewelry store was robbed, huh? Well, that's obvious. We got a a dead rent-a-cop and a missing store manager, so let me guess. You're thinking the store manager doing it Yeah. Something like that. Yeah, so let me look around, huh? An extra pair of eyes can't hurt. And who knows, I could see something you guys are missing. We're not missing anything, Mr. Eels. We've got a C.S.I. Team here. And, uh, see that man over there? It's Adrian Monk. I think we're in pretty good hands. Captain. Monk says I can't just throw this away. I gotta take it like a mile away and bury it. Could I see that? Yeah. You can't throw this away. This This is evidence. [Sniffs.] [Clears Throat.] This is fresh. Mmm! I'd say this is less than 90 minutes old. Marty But isn't that when you said all this was probably going down? The dog could've belonged to the victim or to one of the perps. I think this is important. Monk was gonna throw this away. Um You know, he might be right. Let's, uh, book that into evidence. Yes, sir. Captain. Look. Did that store manager live in Oakland? Yeah. How'd you know that? That's his dog. That's from Oakland. You can see the blue license on its collar. What, you can see that from here? [Chuckles.] Little something I call attention to detail, but [Laughs.] Go get the dog. Adrian Monk, Natalie Teeger. This is Marty Eels. He's a private investigator. Hey, how you doing? How you doing? I hear good things. Good things. [Snaps Fingers.] Don't worry. I'm not competition. I'm just here to help. Can I have one of those? So, what do we got? Captain, I don't think the manager did this. For one thing, he didn't lock the door behind him. Plus, I noticed some more blood by the curb. I think there was a second shooting. Yeah, he could be right. Very good. Nicely done. Nicely done. Captain! He's right. Peggy belongs to the store manager, Harold Gumbal, Geary Street, Oakland. Hmm. You know, if the manager was robbing his own store, he wouldn't bring his dog along. Or leave him behind. No, the manager is not the guy. No, that's right. The manager is not the guy. Here's what Here's what happened! Here's what happened! This dog was a hostage. The manager was being forced to rob his store. Something went wrong, and they shot the guard. Excuse me. What the hell is he doing? Captain Well, he did spot the dog's license from a block away. Okay. They drove off in Gumbal's car. They headed south. They're gonna dump it as soon as they can. We're already checking the airport. That's a waste of time. They would never go there. There's too much security. - Try the train station. - Train station. Yeah. Try, um, San Bruno or Millbrae. They probably panicked when they shot the guard. Maybe they dropped the gun or some bloody clothes somewhere nearby. [Sniffs.] What are you doing there? What [Sniffing.] This dog has been sniffing around a sewer recently. See these sewer grates around here? The perps might have stuffed something down in there, and maybe this dog saw them do it. You gotta be kidding. He's kidding, right? He's joking. The man is joking. Just take two minutes to check it. [Stottlemeyer.] Officer, take a look in that sewer grate. Captain. From smelling a dog, that's impossible. Captain! There was stuff down the drain just like he said. [Whimpering.] No. No, Mom. I wasn't on the news. Because there were no reporters there yet. [Buzzer.] Mm-hmm. I found a lot of clues. I found three or four big clues. Cap Captain was very impressed with me. He He just walked in. He'll tell ya. One second. Captain, it's my mother. Tell her Tell her how good I was on the crime scene. Uh, Mrs. Eels? Hi. Uh, yeah. Marty did great. You'd be very proud of him. He's a first-rate detective. I look forward to meeting you, too, ma'am. Okay. Bye-bye. Uh, what were those beeps? Oh, she was at work. She works for Pacific Global Airlines. She's a She's a quality control operator. Come in. Come Come on in. Sit down. Sit down. Here, Natalie. Come sit down. Come sit down. Make yourself at home. - Monk, sit. Sit anywhere. - That's okay. I'm not fine. Did he just say he's not fine? Yeah. So, Captain, am I on the case, or what? - First I have to ask you a couple of questions. - Yeah. Yeah. Where were you yesterday morning at 8:00? You mean when the robbery was happening? Yeah. You guys think I had something to do with that? Why, because you can't keep up with me on a crime scene? [Stottlemeyer.] Where were you, Marty? I was at the hospital. St. Andrews. - They thought I had a concussion. - What happened? Well [Chuckles.] That's kind of embarrassing. I, um I got hit very hard by a client. Hit me very hard. Yeah. Um I was, um, supposed to follow his wife and take pictures. Whoa. She was cheating on him. No. No. That That's him. That's my client. You burst in to take a picture of a man in bed with his own wife? Yes, I did. I made a mistake. I'm human. So, the bottom line is I was at the hospital when the jewelry thing was happening. - You can call them. - We will. Why is it so hard for you guys to believe that I'm just this good? Because, Marty, you were never this good before. In fact, you sort of sucked. Well, I was I been teaching myself. I been I learned how to focus. And that's really the secret, focus. Am I right about the focus thing? Bay Area Center Continuing Education. Is that a correspondence school? It's fully accredited. What school did you go to? Berkeley. That's a good school. I believe they're fully accredited too. Yeah. Yeah, they're fully accredited. So, Captain, am I on the case or what? I mean, put put me in, Coach! I found I found the ski masks, didn't I? Look, Marty, even if I wanted to, I just don't have the budget to hire two consultants. [Stammering.] I tell you what. I tell you what. You don't have to pay me dime one unless I get some results. So this costs you nothing. Captain, could l You can't hire this guy. He did find the ski masks. By smelling a dog. It's not possible. Look, Monk, sometimes when you're picking up clues, it seems like magic to me. I don't know how you do it. [Cell Phone Rings.] Maybe he's doing something that you don't understand. I think he's cheating. He's a cheater. - Disher. - This isn't the fourth grade, Monk. He's cheating! How? How? I don't know. We just found the store manager's car. Guess where it was. - Your train station? - In San Bruno. Outstanding. You called it, Marty. [Stottlemeyer.] Let's check it out. Marty, come here. You ride with me. [Chattering.] He's cheating. 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me. Uh, go ahead. No, no. After you. Please. It's pretty weird, huh? Maybe we should send one of them home. Yeah, but which one? Marty Eels. E- E-L-S, like the fish. He's always wanted to be a detective. He used to stay up late reading Hardy Boys stories under the cover. So your son is helping Adrian Monk? Who's helping who? That's the question. I love that. Love the thing you do with your hands. It's very old-school. Thank you. [Sighs.] [Sniffs.] Wha What are you doing? Mud. You can tell where the car has been. From tasting it? He's tasting the mud. Does that work? No! It's just nuts! Captain, how tall was the store manager? Uh Uh, 5'10"", according to his driver's licence. Hmm. Somebody else was driving this car, because that chair's been adjusted for somebody 5'11 "". Excuse me. Excuse me. It's impossible to know that. Seat adjustments are not that exact. Should I write down 5'11 ""? Uh I don't know. Yes. In pencil. Ah. [Clears Throat.] Here we go. This map was used recently. That means that the driver was not familiar with this particular area. L l I had that one. You didn't say anything. I was waiting my turn. I had that one. Captain He's cheating. He's a cheater. He saw me looking. And this car was driven on Highway 47. And how do you happen to know that? It's all in the details, Captain. See the, um the dead bugs on the windshield? This is a gray bantam-wing mosquito, which are most common where? Anybody? Walter Creek reservoir. In Livingston. Highway [Laughing.] Bantam-wing mosquito. Gentlemen, let's pop the trunk. Monk. This blood is still fresh. Yes, it is. Good for you. Write that down. One for Monk. [Chuckles.] All right. Gumbal was dragged out of the car and into these woods. Okeydoke. Here we go. [Chattering.] These leaves were recently crushed. I'm 1/16th Cherokee. Cool. Thought he might be. Now what's he doing? I can't look. Oh, he's using a divining rod. The Indians used to use them. He's 1/16th Cherokee. Oh, that's my boy. Can everybody see okay? Take lots of pictures. Film is cheap. [Grunts.] [Murmuring.] Think I found the store manager. - [Clamoring.] - [Stottlemeyer.] Stay back! Get outta here! [Disher.] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back off. Back off. [Stottlemeyer.] He was shot in the chest. Call the coroner's office. Get the crime scene guys up here. And get me a 20-foot perimeter now! Let's go! You heard the man. Take 10 steps back! Let's go! Get out of here! Baker, come on! Move these guys down. That's interesting. What? You don't see that? Look at his arms. That is an unnatural position. Unnatural? I think he was trying to tell us something. With his dying breath, he was trying to send us a message. [Monk.] With his dying breath. He was trying to tell us the name of the man who killed him. Look. See, he's pointing to his watch. No, he's not. Captain, are there any perps who'd do a job like this by the name of Casio? Casio? Lefty. Captain. - Dial. - Eddie Dial. Hejust did seven years in Folsom for kidnapping and bank robbery. He just made parole. Well, let's check him out. Yes, sir. Baker! Johnson! Mom, have you seen my camera? Mm-mmm. Did you check your jacket? What about your pockets? Yes, I looked everywhere. I haven't seen it, honey. Why don't you ask Mr. Monk to help you? Please, Mr. Monk. It has all my pictures in it from my school trip. I was the official photographer and if I lose it, I'm going to get an incomplete. When did you see it last? I saw it yesterday in the living room. That plant has been moved recently. That's right. How did you know? Well, normally, they lean toward the sun. This one is leaning the other way. Hello. Mr. Monk, thank you so much. You're the best. Isn't he the best? There's no one better. You really are amazing. [Monk.] Oh. Wait. When did you water this? Oh, uh, this morning. Well, the camera could not have been back there this morning. It would have gotten wet. Thanks for trying, Julie. My mom put me up to this. Mr. Monk, you really are amazing. You're probably the best in the world. [Cell Phone Rings.] And you're right about this Marty character. He's cheating. I don't know. He is. Hello? Yes, sir. Really? Okay, okay. We're on our way. They just caught one of the killers. They're questioning him now. Julie, we'll be back soon, honey. Natalie. It's not Eddie Dial, is it? Yeah. [Stottlemeyer.] We found the manager's wallet in your motel room, Eddie. It's over. We own you. Look, man, I didn't hurt anybody, okay? I didn't even have a gun. Well, two people are dead, Edward. Who did the shooting? I'm willing to bet you it was that guy. Blanchard, Victor P. The two of you were seen together last weekend. Where is he, Eddie? I don't know! Captain. May I? Where's your Where's your partner, Eddie? I don't know. Hmm. He's telling the truth. He He doesn't know. - Do you have a map? - He's like a human lie detector. I can't believe it. I can't believe it either. Well, he's doing it. Well, I still don't believe it. What you see happening in the next room, it's impossible. It's just What What's this? Stuff we found in Eddie's motel room, including a pair of tickets to Costa Rica. [Natalie.] Did you guys find thejewels? No, not yet. Marty'll find them. All righty. Now then, Eddie, where did you hide the jewels? Was it Was it here? No. Um Was it here? No. Uh, how about here? Ah. Getting warmer. Did you hide them here, Eddie? Ah. Yes. They're, uh They're in the state park. Get outta here. I know this area. There's a water tower right here. Oh. Oh. Did you, uh Did you hide them near the water tower, Eddie? Hmm! Bingo! Yes! [Marty Chuckles.] Call Dunlop in the Parks Department. Tell him to meet us there. And tell him to bring some shovels. Sir. I don't know how the hell I'm gonna write this up. Marty. Oh, Mr. Monk. Why don't you guys go ahead. I'll meet you there. This is District. Give me two black-and-whites down at the state park right now. He's cheating! What, Monk? How is he cheating? We've got a suspect who just confessed. He found the car. He found the body. He is solving this case single-handedly. By cheating! Natalie, what do you think? I believe my boss. [Exhales.] Anyway, we'd better go. Should we take one car or two? Monk, why don't you stay here? We're gonna let Marty take this one. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You're firing him? No! No. Um, it's just that Marty seems to be in a zone. He's got a handle on this one. You get the next one, okay? I'll call you. I gotta go. [Dr. Kroger.] So they found thejewels. Right where Marty said they'd be. Of course. And what, then they They asked you to step aside? They said Marty was on a roll. Guess they didn't want me to cramp his style. Well, A-Adrian, l-I'm sure that this is all just temporary. Maybe he really is better than me. Yeah, well, would that be so terrible? I mean, if you weren't number one. An ex-cop I know teaches criminal justice at Fulton College. He offered me a job last year. Maybe I'll give him a call. All right. So you're just giving up. Okay. No, Adrian, I'm not suggesting that you just give up. I'm saying to you that there is always someone ahead of you. This is the human condition. For instance, there's a new psychiatrist here in town, name of Lowenstern. Now, I know that there is no way that I will ever be as-as well, as good as he is. I know this. I accept it. He's better than you? He's brilliant. Nominated for a Nobel Prize. But the point is you think that you might enjoy teaching. I don't know. Tell-Tell me more about this Lowenstern. Lowenstern. I could introduce you. Office is right across the street. He charges $400 an hour. So wh-where were we? Mmm. Okay. Oh. Good morning, boss. They were out of the round sponges. Don't panic. I'll pick some up on the way home. Don't worry about the groceries. You're driving me to Fulton College. I have an appointment. You mean now? 11:00. I'm meeting the dean. You're just gonna quit, just like that? I think I would make a very good teacher. Oh, Mr. Monk, you'd make a terrible teacher! It would take you four weeks to correct one paper. You're a detective. You're a great detective. - Are you gonna drive me or not? - No. No, I'm not. Your feelings are hurt, and you're just not thinking straight. Fine. Fine. I'll take a taxi. [Chuckles.] You're gonna take a taxi. Do you know what people do in taxis? Fine! Fine. I will drive myself. I'll rent a car. See? I am dialing the number. [Beeping.] I'm not bluffing. Do you even have a driver's license? Yes, I have a license. Okay, this is it. This is the last digit. I have dialed the number. It is ringing. [Recording.] Thank you for calling Cannon Rent-a-Car. This call may be monitored for quality purposes. - I am on hold. - Mr. Monk Fulton College is 100 miles away. It is up the interstate. It's over a bridge. You know, I have a blindfold for going over bridges. But you'll be driving. Good point. I think I can make it. I'll just sort of peek underneath. I'm not gonna let you drive. You've never driven over a bridge in your life. What choice do I have? [Woman On Phone.] Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. Yes? My daughter goes to Fulton College. You don't have to take the bridge. You can take the causeway all the way up. You could hear us? Yes, sir. I'm a quality control operator. I'm monitoring the call. L I was on hold. Yes, sir. We start listening as soon as you're connected. You wouldn't believe the things I hear. [Laughs.] People fooling around. People arguing. I could write a book about it. You could hear me while I was on hold? That's right. ~~ [Pop.] [Camera Shutter Clicking.] Hey! Monk! What a nice surprise. This guy's from San Francisco magazine. I'm one of the 10 most eligible bachelors in the city. Can you believe it? - Marty, we need to talk. - Not a good time, Nat. Did you just call me Nat? Hey, hey, get one with me and Monk. No. No, no, this is good. It's like a summit of great minds. Philip Marlowe meets Sherlock Holmes. It's about your mother, a little something she might have overheard while at work. ~~ [Continues.] Can't The music's too loud. I can't hear. Take a five. Take a five. ~~ [Stops.] [Natalie.] We know how you did it, Marty. - We figured it out. - How I did what? Didn't your mother ever tell you that cheaters never win? Actually, it was your mother's idea. She works for Pacific Global Airlines, doesn't she, in the quality control department? Yeah, so? [Woman On Phone.] This call may be monitored for quality purposes. [Monk.] Here's what happened. After the murders, Blanchard and Dial went back to their motel room, counted theirjewels, and then they called the airlines to buy plane tickets to Costa Rica. They were put on hold. What they didn't know was that your mother was already on the line monitoring their call. They must have been on hold for quite a while, because they talked about everything who they killed, where they dumped the car, even where they hid the masks. [Natalie.] But she didn't call the police. She called you and told you everything you needed to know to solve the case. Or at least pretend to solve it. You're a very smart man. Yeah. He's the real thing. Yep. Course, you realize you have no proof for any of this. Don't airlines record phone conversations? Yes, Nat. I believe they do. Yes, they certainly do. But those conversations have a way of being accidentally erased. So it's really your word against mine. And who do you think everyone's gonna believe? The amazing Marty Eels or, uh yesterday's news? - [Telephone Ringing.] - [Slurps.] [Scoffs.] Phone's been ringin' off the hook. Cases, cases, cases. [Chuckles.] - Would you mind? - [Ringing Continues.] Ah [Ringing Continues.] Hey. Eels Investigations. [Man.] Hey, Marty. I got a proposition for you. Who's this? My name's Vic. We never met. I think you know my partner, though, Eddie Dial. In fact, you and your friends arrested him yesterday. How did you get this number? This is my private line. It's the first number on your mother's speed dial. My mother? Did you really think you could screw with me and get away with it? Where is she? I just left her. She's fine. For now. If you want to see her again, listen carefully. - The jewels belong to me. I want them back. - The jewels? Bring them to the Dunn Street bus terminal by 8:00. Put them in locker 240 on the upper level. I got a spare key. Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait! I can't get to the jewels. They're locked up. They're in evidence. You can do it, Marty. I been reading all about you. You're the flavor of the month. Just tell them you want to examine the evidence. Tell them you want to use it to set a trap. I don't care what you tell them. Just get 'em back. Oh, and Marty. What? No cops. Come alone. Remember, if anything happens to me, your mother's dead by 8:20. - Wait! - [Dial Tone.] Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk, wait! Wait, Mr. Monk! [Car Horn Honks.] Mr. Monk, wait! Wait, wait. It's Vic Blanchard. - He just called. He's got my mother. - I gotta call the captain. No, no! No! No cops! He said no cops, or he'd kill her. Mr. Monk, please. You gotta help me. You were right. I don't know what I'm doing! I don't. Let's go. Let's just go over this one more time. Can you think of anything else he might have said on the phone? [Stammering.] No cops! [Groans.] He said ifhe even smells a cop, she's dead. My gosh. Marty, for the 10th time, no one's calling the cops! She's right. Marty, look. We know where he's gonna be at 8:00. If we can find your mother before that time, the cops can pick him up then. - I know. I know. L - Ah! Natalie. I got it. I'm on it! It's all over the top. Marty, can you just please sit on the couch, all right? You're making Mr. Monk very nervous. All right, one more time. The kidnapper said he'd just left her, right? So she can't be too far from where he made that phone call. Do you remember anything else about the phone call? - Like what? - Like wh Like anything. Noises in the background. - I don't know! - He doesn't know. This wasn't even my idea. My mother made me do this. She forced me into it. She said it was the only way a loser like me was ever gonna be able to solve a real crime. She sounds delightful. That's my mother. Where do you get off talking about somebody's mother? Okay, Marty What's wrong with you? Marty, Marty, Marty. Concentrate. Can you please just try to think? You must have heard something. Yeah. Uh An ocean. He - I think he was near an ocean. - There you go. And there was, um a ringing like like a clang. Clang. With a sound before it. Um It was like a thud clang. Thud! Clang! Okay. Give me a minute. Thud, clang! Yeah, Marty. I got it. Thud, clang. Let me think. [Thud.] [Bell Rings.] Thud, clang. [Monk.] Okay. Oh, my God, she's here! She's here, she's here! Mom. Mom! No, Marty, don't Don't get separated! Mom! Stay with the group! Marty, I want you to focus. Can you focus? All right, the caller said that she would be dead by 8:20, was it? Why 8:20? Why not 8:00 or 8:30? - 8:20. - Think! I'm thinking. Well, think harder! Why don't you think? Hey, I'm not the great big famous detective. Well, you were two hours ago! Natalie! What? - 8:20. - What's 8:20? High tide. Mom! Mom! That's gotta be it. - Go, Marty. Go! - Come on. Run. Move! I'll wait out here. I got your back! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Hang on, Mrs. Eels! [Natalie.] Marty, hurry! Hurry, Marty! Hurry! [Marty Shouting, Indistinct.] - [Mrs. Eels Grunting.] - [Overlapping Shouts.] Marty, hurry! Marty, you gotta hurry. [Natalie.] Hurry, Marty! [Coughing.] - Blanchard, hands up! - Police officer! Blanchard, you're under arrest for the murder of Harold Gumbal. - Come on! Come on. - Go. [Thud.] [Bell Rings.] Great. Thank you. They got him. It's over. That's good. Mrs. Eels, you're probably going to have to testify about that phone call you overheard. You told him? I didn't tell him. He figured it out. He's a real detective. Actually, he found you. We had no idea where you were. He put all the clues together. [Thud.] [Bell Rings.] He, um It really was some of the most unique detective work I've ever seen. [Natalie.] Just an incredible detective. His detecting is like What? He doesn't need anyone's help, Mrs. Eels. No. No one's help. Really? W-When the kidnapper called, they both panicked. L-l-I'm prone to panicking. A-And I had to say, ""Let's get focused, because my mother's in trouble."" And And that got everybody focused. But then I had to concentrate on the sounds from the background. I could hear the ocean. And I heard a clang and a thud. Thud and a clang. A thud and a clang. And And 8:20. Why not 8:00? Why not 8:30? And then I remembered high tide is at 8:20. Once I had that piece, then it all fell together. Oh. Oh, Marty. Marty, you're wonderful. I'd like to thank the police department, particularly Captain Stottlemeyer and, uh, Adrian Monk. This was a very difficult case for me. Uh, last night I made a decision. It's the toughest decision of my career. But I'm going to resign my practice and take a teaching position at Fulton Community College where I'll be teaching modern criminal investigative techniques. [Applause.] You were right about him, weren't you? [Shutters Clicking.] He was cheating. [Reporter.] Over here, Mr. Eels. Dropped the key. [Chuckles.] He was cheating."
"[Man.] No, we didn't forget about you. Yeah, it's all here. I'm looking at it now. Two cans tomato paste, one one box of Glad ForceFlex trash bags, one, two, three, four candy bars and a bunch of bananas. Yeah, he'll be there in 10 minutes. You know the address, right? You going out tonight? Trick-or-treating? I think I'm a little old. [Chuckles.] Hell, I went trick-or-treating all through high school. Uh, that'll be [Cash Register Beeping.] Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. - You have a good night. - You, too. Hi. Hello. Hello. Excuse me. Excuse me. Um, do you have a light? [Gunshot.] [Screaming.] [Man.] Get back! Get back! - Stay there! - [Gunshots.] ~~ [Up-tempo Folk.] ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Disorder and confusion everywhere ~ ~ No one seems to care ~ ~ Well, I do Hey, who's in charge here ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Poison in the very air we breathe ~ ~ Do you know what's in the water that you drink, well, I do ~ ~ And it's amazing ~ ~ People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time ~ ~ If you paid attention you'd be worried too ~ ~ You better pay attention or this world we love so much ~ ~ Mightjust kill you ~ ~ I could be wrong now ~ ~ But I don't think so ~ ~'Cause it's a jungle out there ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~~ [Stottlemeyer.] Get some good shots of the gun? Good. Um, shoot this crowd, too. You never know. Halloween. Am I right? Something nasty always goes down on Halloween. Really? What went down last Halloween? Nothing. The one before that? It's a new tradition. Halloween. Oh! I know this store used to be called ""McCabe's."" I grew up four blocks away. After school, all the kids would hang out right here in the parking lot drinking sodas and listening to music. That sounds like fun. Oh, yeah. It was a lot of fun. I used to stand over there across the street. L-I had a perfect view. Good times. Good times. Hey, Monk. Thanks for coming. Uh, it's kind of ugly. The driver stopped around 1:15 for lunch. He's on his way back to the truck when the shooter came up, grabbed his gun, shoots him four, maybe five times, point-blank range, but he keeps shooting him even after the guy went down. Oh, my God. Was he married? I don't know. Any kids? I don't know, Natalie. I just got here myself. With his own gun? There must have been witnesses. Yeah, a few people from the store. Caucasian. Dark hair. Maybe a blue sweater or a jacket. We're gonna question them again. How much did he get? The truck is empty. That's all I know. [Cooing.] Hey, get out of there. Go. Ho, ho, ho. Get! I hate pigeons like rats with wings. There's no defensive wounds. Was there a struggle? How did How did this guy get the gun? That's a good question. The M.E.'s gonna be here in a minute. We can ask him. What's this? Uh, this hasn't been here long. It's clean. That's a clove cigarette. They make 'em in Indonesia. People use them to try to quit smoking. They don't work. Driver's? The driver has his own. [Cell Phone Ringing.] I'm thinking it's the shooter's. [Stottlemeyer.] Well, run that down. Hello? Every store that sells those. No, Sharona's not here anymore. Uh, about a year ago. Well, l-l-I don't know what happened. She moved to New Jersey. Sir, I don't know what happened. You'd have to ask her. Who is this? Mr. Monk, it's your brother. Ambrose. I can't. L-l Tell him I'll call him back. Tell him I'm busy. - Your father called. - My father? He's coming home. [Giggling.] See? You can trick-or-treat here. I'll go with you. Oh, fun. Trick-or-treating with your mom. She's at that impossible age, between 11 and 25. What? You okay? [Sighs.] What do I say to him after all these years? You say, "" Hello, Dad. I missed you."" No. No, I can't say that. Why did he leave just like that? It was my fault. I drove him crazy. He said that? No. Then how do you know? L-l-I know. L-I just know. Mr. Monk, you can't blame yourself. You wanna bet? Julie, okay? Be nice, okay? Remember what we talked about? Mr. Monk's brother's ill. He's agoraphobic. I know. He never leaves his house. He left once Once in 34 years. At least he left. The house was on fire. I had to drag him out. [Knocking.] Adrian? You talked to him? I told you he'd be back. He's in town on a business trip. He said he'd be here at 8:00 sharp. You gave up, but I never gave up. I never gave up. Nev Are you trick-or-treating? No. No. This is Natalie, my new assistant. You spoke on the phone. [Speaking French.] I'm Ambrose Monk, Adrian's brother. Ambrose Monk. Yes, I know. Very nice to meet you, Ambrose. Yes. Uh, this is my daughter, Julie. L-I like your costume. You're a cardiologist. I'm a doctor. No. You're a cardiologist. You see, that stethoscope has a built-in concave amplifier. It's called a ""stethron."" Cardiologists use it to listen for heart murmurs. Guess I'm a cardiologist. It's all right. I made a mistake once. Uh, c-come in. Wow, this is spooky. Do you do this every year for Halloween? Do what? Um, nothing. All these instruction manuals. [Monk.] Yes. Ambrose wrote them. That's what he does. Wow! Ambrose, you must be pretty handy around the house. You should've been there when we were putting together my Malibu Jenny bungalow. - It took my mom five hours. - I'm not surprised. Mike Gordon wrote that one. He's a hack. The man can't tell the difference between a three-quarter inch retaining screw and a half-inch lag bolt. I'm not kidding. He actually made that mistake. Still can't believe he won the ""Niz-M-U"" award. ""Niz-M"" W-What? National Society of Instruction Manual Writers. Oh, right. I've won five of them. - Can we see one? - No. They're not here. They won't mail them. Well, at least you won them. That's the important thing. [Knocking.] It's the door. Ambrose? [Knocking Continues.] The door. Excuse me. Trick-or-treat! Trick-or-treat! Wait! Wait! Not yet. Trick-or-treat I've accepted your terms which means we now have an implied contract. By accepting this treat, you are, in effect, promising to refrain from committing any tricks against me or this property now or in the future. Are there any questions? Yeah. Do you have any Peanut Chews? There's only what's in the bowl. Now, one per customer. All right? [Vacuuming.] Better? Oh, yeah. It was cluttered before. What are you doing? Y - You can't go in there. You cannot go in there. [Vacuum Cleaner Stops.] L-I'm sorry. L-I didn't know. What's going on? That is That-That's Dad's study. We're not allowed in there. Not allowed? Yes. They caught me in there once when I was 12. Well, what happened, Ambrose? He grounded me. For 30 years? It's all right, Julie. Ambrose, what's the big deal? We'll just take a look around. We're adults, right? You go in there, I will tell! You better not. I will! L-l-I'm telling! Then I'll tell him about the shaving kit. Don't! Adrian, don't go in there! It has to be exactly the way he left it. It's Daddy's study. Okay. Okay. I'm not going in. [Doorbell Rings.] Excuse me, Natalie, uh, Julie. L I have trick-or-treaters. Uh, I'm sorry. [Growling.] How old are you? [Growls.] 'Cause I have a rule, no one older than 14. All right. Only one per customer. What are you doing? Only one per customer. Did you hear what I said? No. Only one per customer! - [Groans.] - [Natalie.] Get out ofhere! - [Growling.] - Hey! - Get out of here! [Growling.] [Monk.] Hey! Hey! Ambrose, are you okay? Ambrose, can you move? Did he get more than one piece? [Groans.] Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. The man who attacked you was five feet tall? That's right. And he wore a green mask with a bolt through the neck. Did he say anything? He said [Growls.] No, no, no, no. It was [Higher-pitched Growl.] Write down ""Frankenstein"". No, it wasn't Frankenstein. It was Frankenstein's monster. Frankenstein was the name of the scientist who created the monster. - Well, it doesn't really matter. - Captain, you can't just say, ""Frankenstein""! - It'll confuse everybody! - [No Audible Dialogue.] Okay, write down ""Frankenstein's Monster."" Well, uh, I saw the guy running south towards the park. Maybe he's there. Look, it's probably just some high school kid with the munchies. I don't think so. He was wearing dress shoes. They were Italian. Forzieri's. You noticed that, right? I'm not familiar They're imported. They cost about $420 a pair. It's not exactly something a high school kid with munchies would be wearing. Okay. It was a rich high school kid with the munchies. Look, I'm really sorry that your candy got spilled, but this isn't a priority for us right now. You might have heard that there was an armored car driver shot just down the street. - Right. Right. How is that going? - Uh, nothing yet. But get this. The driver was off duty. The truck was empty from the start. It was empty? Yeah, I guess the shooter didn't do his homework. Anyway, we're off to question the cashier at the grocery store. Do you wanna come? I could use the help. I can't. My father. Oh, yeah. I understand. I hope that goes well for you. I'll call you tomorrow. Come on, Lieutenant. What are you doing, Lieutenant? Oh, I'm just Sorry. You can't take that. I don't have any extra. It's just candy. I know how much I need. Every year I have it down to a science based on current weather conditions, recent census data, and the demand from previous Halloweens. Last year I ended up with just one extra candy bar. Well, Ambrose, that's, um That's very I don't know what the hell that is. Come on, Lieutenant. I'll buy you a Snickers bar. [Door Closes.] Adrian, could l Could I talk to you? Yeah. One second. It's important. [Sighs.] What? Uh [Whispers.] Not here. [Banging.] Stop it. I mean it. Stop. Okay. What? [Groans.] [Ambrose.] This way. [Monk.] Oh, no. Let's So nobody can hear what we're doing. Oh, great. [Coughs.] It's a little dusty. All right. Come on. Come on. [Groans.] [Sighs.] Oh, God. Okay. Shh. Okay. Okay. Are you and Natalie What? Involved? What? No. No. No. No. Wh-Why would you even ask me that? Well, it's been eight years since Trudy. Exactly. It's only been eight years. You're a widower. She's a widow. And I know how you are with the ladies. I remember, in high school, those girls calling you on the phone, talking to you on the phone, complimenting you, huh? Ambrose, those were my teachers. So? What about Mrs. Fagan? [Scoffs.] Yeah? Natalie works for me. Strictly professional. Okay? Is she seeing anybody else? Wh W-W-Why? Why? No reason. [Doorbell Rings.] - [All.] Trick-or-treat! - Oh, you guys look amazing! I love it. Here you go. Yes. [Natalie Chuckles.] Hey, Julie. Hey, Frankie. Frankie's in my homeroom. - Ah. - So, have you gone trick-or-treating yet? If not you can come with us. Please, Mom? Okay. Be back by 8:00. Stick together. You guys stay on this side of the freeway, all right? Oh, wait. Here's my cell phone. And don't eat anything until I inspect it. Bye, Mom. [Chuckles.] [Stottlemeyer.] Goodjob. Thank you. And you'd never seen this guy before? In the store? Hanging around the parking lot? I don't think so But I see a lot of faces. Sure. It looks like Kiefer Sutherland. Yeah, I guess it does. Um It wasn't Kiefer Sutherland, was it? Uh, no, sir. Here's a receipt. This is from your cash register. This is him, right? Mm-hmm. Eight items at 89 cents. Yes, sir. Eight candy bars. - Eight candy bars? - It really looks like Kiefer Sutherland. You know, maybe we should before we distribute it, write across the bottom, ""Not Kiefer Sutherland"" just so that we don't disturb Mr. Sutherland. That's a really good idea. You think so? No. Let's do this again. So, he pays you and then he walks out. A minute later you hear shots. You run to the window and see this guy shooting the driver. Yeah. And then he looks in the back of the truck, sees it's empty, and he takes off. Uh, no, sir. - He never looked in the back of the truck. - Really? [Chattering.] [Shouting, Indistinct.] [Growling.] [Screaming.] What's he doing? You'll see. Shh. Is he drunk? No. He's thinking. Okay. Now, he must have been following you all for quite a while. Can anybody tell me which way he ran off? He went that way. I saw him turn left on Hamilton Street. Uh-huh. You sure you weren't hallucinating? Mr. Monk, he's 11 years old. He's not a real hippie. I got mine stolen too, about twenty minutes ago. Mine, too. Okay, I want all of you who had your candy stolen by Frankenstein to stand over here, and the others stand over here. Okay. Come on. Let's go. Here. Right here. You here. And you others Good. So, why you, but not you? And why you, but not you? Maybe he's afraid of karate. Or maybe he's afraid of pirates. No, that's just stupid. How many of you stopped by my brother's house, the big gray house near the end of Oakview? You mean where the special man lives who never comes out? Yeah. That's right. Where the special man lives. How many? He's only taking candy from kids who went to Ambrose's house? What's going on? I don't know. I don't know. Wait a minute. What? No. What? No. [Sniffs.] It's a clove cigarette. Like the one at the murder scene. [Sighs.] Who was it this time? Dracula? The werewolf? No, no. It was Frankenstein. [Both.] Frankenstein's monster. Hey, well, there's just no stopping that crazy creature. He wants candy And not just any candy. He wants your candy. That's right. He's only interested in candy from this house. You know, I can't help but wonder why. The answer is here. It is right in front of us. And you're saying that this is somehow connected to the armored car thing? Well, l-I bought all this candy at Beachs Market. They deliver. And that's where the driver was killed, right? Plus, I found this where the kids were attacked. It's a clove cigarette. Yeah, actually, I researched these. They're common. 150 stores in this area sell them. Okay, you're saying that there is a connection. I'm here. Convince me. Why would a killer who every cop in this city is looking for hang around to steal candy from children? [Whispering.] [Whispering Continues.] We don't know. You don't know. Can I go trick-or-treating or not? No, not tonight, sweetie. - You promised! I only got to go a little bit. - [Cell Phone Beeps.] Honey, there is a nut out there. The only way you can go now is with a police escort. - Lt. Disher! - Hmm? - Come trick-or-treating with me. - Oh, l-I don't, uh Can I? - No. - Adrian, why don't you go with her? What? Natalie can stay here with me and help me get ready. That is such a good idea. Right? It's not much of a costume, is it? Sure, it is. I'm a safety patrol officer. Hey! Hey! Wait. Cross at the green, not in between. It's amazing it still fits you. When was the last time you wore it? Third grade? College. [Chuckles.] Oh, I found some pictures. I hope you don't mind. Oh. No. [Sighs.] Is that your father? Oh, that's him and Ambrose. [Chuckles.] He named the turtle after you? He named me after the turtle. Oh, Ambrose. [Laughs.] Oh, I like this one. You look so happy. Mom was worried about us because we never laughed. So she made us practice. That's us practicing. So, now I can laugh [Forced Chuckle.] If I have to. - What about this one? - Uh, that was taken the day before he left. He left because of me. I was driving him crazy, clinging to him. I was too needy. Mr, Monk says it was because of him. Nah, he's just saying that to make me feel better. It was me. It was me. - Gilstrap. That's a funny name. - Yeah. What time is it? Um, 10 to 8:00. We gotta get home after this. No. Just a couple more houses. Trick-or-treat. Trick-or-treat. Well, hello. We have a doctor in the house. I'm a cardiologist. And you're a safety boy. I'm a safety patrol officer. Well, I think you both look wonderful. Uh, no, thanks. I'm allergic. To chocolate? No, ma'am. I'm allergic to food that's been sitting in a bowl all night that other people have been touching. Oh, well, I love chocolate. I have to have a Neptune bar every night before I go to bed or I can't sleep. Well, I guess we all have our little quirks, don't we? I suppose we do. Mmm. Well, thank you very much. Be careful crossing the street. I guess I don't have to tell you that. Maybe it's fast. It's one of the most accurate clocks in the world. I wrote the manual for it. He'll be here. [Sighs.] Natalie, uh, could I ask you something? Hmm? Would you ever, uh, consider, uh, going out with someone like me, or to be more specific, me? Of course, we can't actually go out. I mean, we can't go outside, but we could go anywhere else. Thank you, Ambrose. Thank you. But it's It's complicated. Okay, I understand. Withdrawn. I never said it. It never happened. I'll I'll get the ice. My father likes a lot of ice. I remember he used to like to clink it. Ambrose, sit down. Please. [Sighs.] I can't go out with you because I work for your brother. Mm-hmm. You know, it would just get messy. Mmm. You can understand that. Well, yeah. But if I ever have another job someday, I hope you'll ask me again. Really? Mm-hmm. So you're not saying ""no""? That's like a maybe. Y-Y-You're saying ""maybe."" I'm saying ""maybe."" Can I tell my father? That w-w-w-we might have a date someday? [Chuckles.] Sure. I think he'd like that. Oh, my What is it? Did you bring your mom's cell phone? Hey, Monk. I hope that's your costume. I'm a safety patrol officer. Good for you. So, what's so important? [Disher.] What'd they get this time Three Musketeers? Milky Way? It's a pigeon. Well? Does he look familiar? Does he look familiar? Take a closer look. At the murder scene, you kept shooing it away. This is that same pigeon. [Laughs.] Monk, you've had a tough night Captain, this is the same pigeon. I remember it had five little brown spots on its back because I remember thinking that it reminded me of the constellation Cassiopeia. Look. You see it? Look. See? Okay. Okay. Okay. It's the same pigeon. So what? Remember, it was eating something from right near the victim's hand. And now, five hours later, it's dead. I think it's been poisoned. You want me to do an autopsy on the pigeon? Yeah. Why? What would that mean? I don't know. But it would mean something. It would be another piece of the puzzle. [Sighs.] Okeydokey. Give me the pigeon. Lieutenant, get that to the lab. [Engine Starts.] Thanks. Happy Halloween. He's not coming. He'll be here. Why would Why would he call and not show up? Because that's what he does. We're better off. Don't say that. Don't say that! We're better off. Don't you say that. Don't you dare say that! I thought you said you didn't have any extra. I don't care. It's my candy! You know what your problem is? You have never learned to wait! Never! Mr, Monk, what is going on? What are you doing? Cleaning out his study. Oh, God, it's so dusty. Is it? Mr. Monk [Cell Phone Ringing.] Hello? Yes, sir. Mr. Monk. It's-It's the captain. Hello! You were right about the pigeon. The bird was poisoned. I had them go back and do a tox scan on the armored car driver. Turns out he had been poisoned too before he was shot. The poison was called tet Tetrachlorodrine. Tetrachlorodrine. Very deadly. Stronger than arsenic. It's stronger than arsenic. Uh, it came straight from the lab. It hadn't even been diluted yet. And get this. We just talked to the plant manager here. Turns out some of this stuff had been stolen. They didn't realize it until today 'cause they caught the guy trying to put it back. Wait, wait. He was putting it back? Yeah. They had to let him go. He denied everything, and they didn't have any evidence. Uh, the guy's name is Gilstrap. Gilstrap. He worked here part-time fixing computers. Gilstrap? Paul Gilstrap? Ambrose! - Ambrose! Don't eat the candy! - I paid for it. No. Spit it out! Spit it out! It could be poisoned. What? That's what this whole thing has been about. It's been spiked with tetrachlorodrine. Is there a Neptune bar in here? Not anymore there isn't. Oh, my God! Natalie, call 9-1-1. My God. I thought it tasted funny. Tetrachlorodrine? The guy down the street was trying to kill his wife. It's too late. D-Don't say that. Don't say that. Just get up! Get up, now! Natalie, help me! Adrian. Adrian. Tetrachlorodrine is a synthetic insecticide. Natalie, help me! There is no antidote. I'll be dead in five minutes. [Siren Blaring.] Adrian? I'm right here. [Sobbing.] I'm right here. Tell me who did this. Shh. It doesn't matter. It matters to me. I don't wanna die without knowing. Shh. Tell me, Adrian. Okay, here's what happened. His name is Paul Gilstrap. He wanted to kill his wife. He worked in a laboratory where they made tetrachlorodrine. Oh. A few days ago he snuck in there, and he stole some of it. Ambrose, I met his wife when I went trick-or-treating with Julie. And she said that she ate a Neptune bar - every night before bed. - Oh. Gilstrap poisoned her candy. But he couldn't poison just one. He wanted to make it look like there was a serial killer on the loose, so he had to poison a lot of other candy bars. He put them back into circulation. So his wife would just be another victim. That's right. It's a good plan. [Monk.] But he made a mistake. He got caught trying to put the poison back. [Ambrose.] Ruined everything. That's right. It ruined everything because now, ifhis wife or anyone else died from tetrachlorodrine, they'd know it was him. So he was desperate. He had to get all of the poisoned candy bars out of circulation. He found them all except for two. Right. The armored car driver had one. He had already taken a bite. If the driver hadjust dropped dead, Gilstrap knew there'd be an autopsy. So he had to think fast. He grabbed the driver's gun and shot him repeatedly. Who would bother looking for poison in a guy who had been shot five times? Which left just one candy bar. The one I ate. That's right. He's been [Sobs.] Trying to get it back all night. [Siren Blaring.] How much further? Adrian, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What are you talking about? - Dad. - Oh, no. - I drove him away. No. No. He couldn't stand me. He couldn't stand me, Adrian. It was my fault. No, I'm sorry. It was me. You're a good brother, Adrian. [Sobbing.] I love you. I love you. Don't cry, Adrian. Be strong now. Is that another Neptune bar? Where's the wrapper from the one he ate? It's right here. What? What? This one expired eleven months ago. That must be the candy bar left over from last year. From last Halloween? That's why it tasted funny. That's why it tasted funny. So this This is the This is the poison. That's why it tasted funny. [All Laughing.] That's why it tasted funny! This is the This is the The one with poison. [Laughs.] I have a stomachache. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Everyone got so upset. [Siren Blaring.] Paul Gilstrap? Boo. You missed one. Ambrose, about our date. Is Friday okay? No, Natalie, that's okay. You You don't have to. You thought I was dying. I'll be here Friday. Hey, look! There's a note. ""Stopped by. Nobody home. ""Can't blame you. I wouldn't wait for me either. ""Dad. ""P.S. Ambrose, I'm proud of you for getting out of the house."" He said he was proud of me? You think he'll be back? I don't know. I think he'll be back. Maybe we should, uh, go inside. Let's go inside. It's better inside. Excuse me."
"Mom, I'm starving. Your pizza's gonna be here in a minute. Maybe we should call them again. It's not straight. Ha! The bubble's right in the middle. The level's broken. The level is not broken, Mr. Monk. It can't be broken. It's a bubble on a stick. You have two levels? I use this level to check the other levels. It's my level-checking level. How do you know that one's not broken? That's a good question. I take my level-checking level to the hardware store twice a year to have it recalibrated. [Doorbell Rings.] Hey, we were getting worried. Sorry. It's a busy night. That's 12.50. All right. There you go. Thank you. Thanks. All right, come and get it. Don't make a mess.

That's the worst part, you know. Getting used to it. It's something you never really get used to. His name was Julio Alvarez. 25 years old. He was bludgeoned to death with a pipe, a cylinder, maybe a baseball bat. Whatever it was, the killer took it with him. Where was he headed? He had one more delivery on Vinton Street. How did the killer get him to stop? There are no houses here, no storefronts here. Yeah. I was wondering the same thing. Maybe he waved him down? Or maybe he hid out in the vehicle. Like, do you remember, there was, uh, the carjacking in Mende What? What? [Sneezes.] Wipe. Wipe, wipe. Gee, I'm fresh out. Wipe. Monk, I don't have a wipe. I don't work for you. Oh, God.

Well, as a matter of fact, I am. This is what we call a homicide investigation. Well, something important just came up. A superior court judge is missing. She was supposed to be at a fund-raiser at 6:30. She never showed up. [Sinuses Squeaking.] not missing. That's late for dinner. We're mobilizing the whole department. We're pulling you and every senior officer. Well, wait. What am I supposed to do with him throw him under a bridge? Hand him off. I don't really care. Natalie! The mayor wants you at city hall in 20 minutes. Wait. The mayor The mayor asked for me? He's asking for everybody. This judge, Jillian Garr, is a close personal friend. Are we taking your car? Excuse me, Doctor. Can I talk to you? Can it wait? - I just found an eyelash. It might belong to the killer. - Please. It's very important. - I'll be right with you. - Sir, it really can't wait. - What is it? - Do I feel warm to you? [Monk Groaning.] Uh, how am I? 99.9. Oh, no. Oh, no. There you go an even 100.

I will be right back. What are you doing? Where are you going? I'm just gonna run up to police headquarters. I want to talk to the captain about the man that was killed. Natalie Natalie. - That wasn't your fault. - I know, Mr. Monk. But I was the last person to see him alive. I never really thought about what that means, you know, but it means something. It's weird. I feel kind of responsible. Oh, no, no, no. You can't just leave me here. You're gonna be okay. Julie will be here. What if I have to blow my nose again? I showed her how to do the bags. I have my phone. I will be right back. Good luck, guys. ~~ [Continues.] [Door Opens.] That's, uh [Door Closes.] Julie, there's a pad in that second drawer. Could you get that pad and a pen? Write down everything I say. - Is it a letter? - No, it's not exactly a letter. It's what we grown-ups call a living will. Was she dating? Does she have a boyfriend? No, not that we know of. Well, find out for sure. Check her phone records, credit card receipts. Go back at least 12 months on everything. I want everybody's best game here. Yes, sir. What's that? A guy with a grudge. John DeLancy. He's going through a messy divorce. Judge Garr ruled against him three weeks ago. He started screaming at her in court. They had to restrain him. Well, he hit her car. Maybe. There was an incident as she was leaving the courthouse. Their cars collided. Like, a little fender bender. He rammed her car. Was it an accident? We've got three witnesses, but nobody's sure. All we know is, she didn't report it or press charges. Well, you find this guy. Find him. Captain? Natalie, look, it's kind of crazy right now. Say, how's our patient? He has the flu. What's he doing about it? Complaining. Driving me nuts. Any news on theJulio Alvarez case? Uh, ask Disher about that. Lieutenant, the captain said you could fill me in. Yeah, well, we don't know much. She owns a beach house. We're sending another forensics team down there now. Not the judge. The other case Alvarez. Who? Julio Alvarez. You didn't let me finish. Who lio Alvarez. The delivery guy. Yeah, right. Jenkins, who caught the pizza thing? ""The pizza thing""? He had a name, Randy. He might not have been a judge, but he had a name. Hey, I resent that. I really do. Every case is important here. We don't play favorites. Okay. I've got the file right here. Sorry. Somewhere. Sergeant, have you seen the Alvarez file? Yeah, I just saw it. Who's this? That's the victim, Julio Alvarez. No. No, this isn't the guy. Natalie, that's the guy. There's his employee I.D. He's dead. He's in the morgue. That's not the man that came to the door. You said you only got a glimpse of him last night. That's the guy. Is that from the judge's house? Captain's office. I gotta go. That's not the guy. Look, I already talked to the cops. I barely knew the kid. He started, like, two or three weeks ago. You didn't put his picture up, or flowers? The boss wanted us to downplay the whole thing. Said it was bad for business. Well, Mr. Gorman, I'm not sure the man who came to my house last night was Julio Alvarez. Sure it was. Who else could it be? ""Natalie 'T eejer""' Teeger. ""Pepperoni, extra cheese."" Is that you? Yeah. I put it in the car, the kid drove away. Was he alone? Sure, he was alone. - Hey, Tommy, not too much garlic on the calzone! - Okay, okay. Hey, could I see those? Why? I'd like to see where he went before he got to my house. Are you a cop? No. 'Cause I got work to do. Well, I'm not a cop, but I work for a detective, Adrian Monk. Who? Adrian Monk. He's a great detective. He's, like, a genius. You can ask anybody. [Cell Phone Ringing.] Hold on. This is him now. Stay here. I want him to talk to you. Hello? Natalie.

I have the fever and the headache and the massive internal bleeding. You have massive internal bleeding? [Clears Throat.] I believe I do. That is my opinion. No, Mr. Monk, you have the flu. But I'm glad you called. I'm talking to Mr. Gorman. He's the manager. Hold on. Hello. I don't know. I think they're in Atlanta. What's he talking about? He's asking about the Center for Disease Control. [Sighs.] Hey, Julio was a good guy. Good luck. Thank you. DeLancy. John DeLancy. We know he's in there. We just talked to his assistant. You understand this is a private club. Unless you have a warrant How about this? We wait here and you go in there and get him. I can't do that. Can't or won't? A little of each. [Beeping.] DeLancy.

Well, I'm sure he'll understand. Everybody makes mistakes, sir. [Exhales.] Hello, again. Um This is a little embarrassing, but I'm gonna have to ask for my tie back. You gave it to me. Well, look, if you're gonna wear such a nice tie, you gotta wear it straight. You don't wear a nice tie like that crooked. Okay, now where were we? Yeah, we were talking aboutJillian Garr. [Gasps.] She cost me two and half million dollars. I admit it I lost my temper. You rammed her car. I wasn't trying to hurt anybody. I was pissed off. You know, you boys are asking the wrong question here. You should be asking, why she didn't press charges? Okay. Why she didn't press charges? Because she wasn't alone. There was a man with her in the car. I saw them kissing. When I hit her, he got out and ran. - He didn't want to be seen. - He was married. She was seeing a married guy. Good guess. Now, could you find my waiter? I'm going to need another plate. [Groans Loudly.] Eat your soup. [Whimpers.] I see letters. It's alphabet soup. Oh. ""A"" You don't have to eat it in order. [Groaning Continues.] - Where's Julie's card? - I put it in the recycle bin. They just collected it. Julie is so proud of that card. What am I supposed to tell her? Tell her that recycling is important and that, together, we're saving the planet. ""B."" Can I just talk about the case for one minute, please? I've been thinking about this. The man at the door was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses. Sunglasses at night. It was like he was trying to hide his face from me. - Do you think it means something? - Uh, I don't know. Ah Oh! False alarm. That's a broken ""Q."" Mr. Monk, this is important to me. All right, so he left the pizzeria at 7:05. He didn't get here until 7:40, and the pizza was cold. Remember? - Cold. - Yeah, that's right. What do you think it means? - Cold. - Do you think it's important? - I'm so cold. - [Sighs.] All right, he had two other stops before he got here. I've got the addresses. I'm gonna retrace his steps. No, no, no. No, Natalie. Just let the police handle it. They don't care about this kid. They can't even remember his name. And they sure as hell don't care about what I think. All they care about is this missing judge. Mr. Monk, I need you to come with me. - I can't. - Yes, you can. You can rally. Hey, Mitch was a football player. Players got injured all the time. He always said, ""The great ones play hurt."" Mr. Monk, I can't do this without you. Just sit in the car. It'll just take an hour. - I can't. - [Sighs.] Well, I'm going. A man was killed and he was here. I have to do something. No. No, Natalie. Natalie, you can't go. You can't just leave. Vaporizer one is empty. I'm almost out of ice. Y-You have to do your job. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. I can't. I'm too busy doing your job. They were having a sleepover. We ordered three pizzas. One Hawaiian, one pepperoni And one Veggie Master. Is this him? Are you sure? Yeah, the police were here. They had the same picture. That's definitely him. We felt terrible about it. Was he wearing a hat or sunglasses? No. [Buzzer Buzzes.] Hello. Hi. Can I help you? Sorry to bother you. I hope this isn't a bad time. Uh, as a matter of fact, I'm sort of in the middle of something. Why? What is all this about? Really sorry to bother you. I live a few blocks away. Yeah, I've seen you around. Yeah. It's about my cat, Snowflake. She's run away. Your cat? Do you have a picture? No. See, that's the thing. She's new. So, thanks anyway. Sorry to bother you. Hold on. You know what? I did find a cat this morning. She was scratching on my front door. She's down in the basement. Come on in. No, it's probably not her. What color is it? White. See, it can't be her. Snowflake's black. Snowflake is black? Thanks anyway. You really should put some ice on that thumb. He had a what? A bruise on his thumb. I remember the guy that delivered Julie's pizza had the same bruise. Uh-huh. He tried to get me in his house! Maybe he likes you. Maybe he finds you attractive. Stranger things have happened. No, he wanted to kill me. I can tell. Can't you get a search warrant? No, not based on this. I mean, the guy's got a nice house, right? He's got some money? - Why would he kill a pizza delivery guy? - I don't know. Even if he did kill him, why would he drive across town and deliverJulie's pizza to her? - Doesn't make sense. - Well, can't you at least come down here and talk to him? Uh, yeah. I can be there in two hours. No, no! He could be gone by then. Where's the captain? He's working on the case. Not your case, the other case. The big case. She left the courthouse at 4:45. She was last seen driving north on the She was alone in the car. It's not centered. That one. Good. Good. [Inhaling.] Now, her car was found in a parking lot here. It was unlocked. It had been wiped clean. There were no prints, no fibers. I got some photographs here. [Groans.] Oh, no, l I can't see. I can't focus. I can't see. Okay. You can look at the pictures later. Could you turn this? Thank you. Oh, that's good. What is this thing? It's a humidifier. What's that one? De-humidifier. Well, don't they cancel each other out? Exactly. Um, we know that she was seeing somebody. He might be married. We can tell by her credit card records that they went on a trip together in February. They went to Oakley, Idaho, February 10, for two weeks. [Groans.] He's not married. He's not married? No. Well, how do you know that? [Blowing.] Monk, how do you know he's not married? [Groans.] They were there on Valentine's Day. If he was married, he would have stayed home. Yeah, you're right. I need a Baggie. They're in the drawer. Hey, Monk, can you focus here, please? Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, Monk, focus here, would you? Zip it You gotta zip it. Why Why keep it a secret? All right, I'm gonna need another Baggie. You put this Baggie into another Baggie. This big Baggie? That's the one. Okay, Monk. Stay with me here, okay? She's a judge, so maybe he was someone that, uh, she was not allowed To see socially. Yes. Like a lawyer or someone who might be involved in one of her cases. A conflict of interest. Make sure it's ain'tight. Gotta zip it. Natalie usually folds it twice. First you zip it. Then you fold it twice. First you gotta get the air out. You gotta let the air out first. Let the air out first. [Pop.] Monk, you know, you probably can't tell, because I'm hiding it so well, but I really don't like this. [Alarm Chirps.] [Trunk Opens.] [Phone Ringing.] [Groans.] Yeah, hello. Mr. Monk, I found the guy who delivered Julie's pizza. It's definitely him. His name is Reggie Dennison. Oh, Natalie, uh, I've been I've been calling you. I know. I didn't answer. I knew you'd try to talk me out of this. Out of what? I'm in his house. Uh You're in his house? He put something in his car. I couldn't make it out. And then he drove off. You're in his house? I didn't know what else to do. No one was listening to me. [Groans.] Oh, Natalie. You're in his house? Listen, get out of there. And [Coughing.] Can you pick up some cough drops on your way back? But get out of there! But don't forget the cough drops. I'm not leaving here until I find it. Find what? I don't know. I don't know. I just I need proof. Mr. Monk, please help me. I don't know what I'm looking for. [Natalie.] The fireplace. Ah! Ah! Yes. He was burning something. Hold on. Hold on. There's one. It's him. He's with a woman, but I can't make it out. They're at a hotel the Oakley Inn. Whoa. O-Oakley Inn? Oakley Inn. [Groans.] Natalie, is is this guy a lawyer? Uh Okay, now how did you know that? I smell something. It's like bleach. Whew! Okay, I'm in the bathroom. He must have just cleaned it. It smells like It smells like your bathroom. Is Is there blood? God. Uh No. That's weird. There's no shower curtain. Well, is there a light switch on the wall? Yes. Is it on or off? It's off. Well, switch it on. Be careful. Use a wipe or something. [Coughs.] - It's blood. - Oh, yeah. They always forget the light switch. [Inhales.] [Hacking Cough.] [Car Trunk Closes.] [Alarm Chirps.] [Monk On Phone: Coughing Continues.] [Coughing Continues.] [Coughing Continues.] Natalie. Natalie, here's what happened. This lawyer, Dennison, was having an affair with Judge Garr. She came to his house last night, and at some point they decided to order a pizza. Somehow things turned ugly. Maybe they had a fight. We'll probably never know what it was about, but he killed her. He killed her in that bathroom. [Coughing.] But the delivery guy, Julio, must have seen the attack or heard something and he tried to help her. - [Groans.] - He died trying to save her. [Coughing.] Natalie, I'm gonna need those cough drops. Not the menthol. Y-Y-You know the kind. [Groaning.] Anyway, Dennison had a problem. The pizzeria knew Julio's route, and Dennison knew that ifJulio just disappeared the cops would focus on him. They'd poke around, they'd ask a lot of questions. So he needed somebody else to be the last person who saw Julio alive. He decided to deliver one more pizza, as Julio, to divert attention from himself. You were right, Natalie. Julio didn't deliver that pizza. The man who killed him did. He was smart, but he made two mistakes. Big mistakes. One, that blood you found on the bathroom light switch. If that's the judge's blood, and I think it is, he's going to jail for life. But even without that blood, we could still convict him. Mistake number two his fingerprints are all over that pizza box he delivered. It's at the recycling dump. [Coughing.] I'm sure they could find it if they had to. They just collected it this morning. [Beeping.] Oh, that's my other line. Hold on. [Beeps.] - [Whispering.] Mr. Monk - Yeah, Natalie, I'll call you back. I'm on the other line. [Stammers.] Where was I? [Groans.] Natalie? Natalie? [Gasps.] Are you okay? Say one word to anybody, she's dead. [Dennison.] Understand? Please. I have a daughter. Help me find it. Maybe you'll see her again. Find what? The box! The box! The pizza box with my prints on it! What was it in, a carton, a bag, or what? My boss recycled it. He separates everything into piles exactly 20 inches high. Then he puts each pile into a green, 10-gallon, reinforced, double-ply trash bag which he double-tapes shut. Then he puts that bag into another bag, which he wraps with twine four times counter-clockwise and ties each end twice. Once he's completed that Are you screwing with me? No, I swear! He's very persnickety! All right. He said that it was picked up this morning. We'll start there. Look down here. - I don't see it. - You're stalling. I'm not. I swear to God. I'm gonna give you one more chance to help me find the damn box! [Yells.] [Screams.] [Siren Blares.] [Man.] We'll take the back! [Grunting.] [Motor Whirring.] [Screams.] [Groaning.] Where's Monk? Where is he? Where is he? [Sneezes.] Okay, get him out of here! [Monk Coughing.] Is it all off? I think so. Yep. Good as new. Is he talking? He's a lawyer, so, yeah. - He says that you brought him here at knifepoint. - What? - He says that you've been stalking him and that you're crazy. - You were in his house. Well, you can't let him go. As of this moment, we have no physical evidence to connect that man to either of the murders. - What about the pizza box? - Well, if we could find the pizza box, and it came from Monk's house and it has his fingerprints on it, well, then, it's a slam dunk. We're not gonna find it. Forget it. I talked to the manager. I mean, they don't keep any records. They could have dumped it anywhere. I mean, look at this place. There's two more warehouses and there's more outside. Shh. What? Shh, everybody. Listen. ~~ [""Polly Wolly Doodle,""Faint.] ""Polly Wolly Doodle."" ~~ [Continues, Faint.] Oh, my God, it's Julie's card. It has a musical chip. ~~ [Continues, Louder.] ""Polly Wolly Doodle."" ~~ [Continues.] ~~ [Continues.] Wait, wait, wait! Don't open it. Wait for Forensics. You got out of bed. You took a taxi? In your bathrobe. [Laughing.] Mitch was right the great ones play hurt. Good morning. What are you doing outside your building? I'm just sittin'. Outside? It's a beautiful day. I feel fine. Much better. Okay. So, I just talked to the captain. They found the judge's body. Reggie Dennison confessed to everything. He even showed them where the body was. Really, what are you doing out here? You hate outside. Maybe I've changed. Seriously, what are you doing out here? [Sighs.] ~~ [""Polly Wolly Doodle"".] ~~ [Continues.]"
"[Metal Rattles.] [Metal Clanks.] What you doing? Flat tire. You believe it? Uh, no. I can't. It's not your car. - What are you doing? - Let the cops sort this out.

Well, what's seven million bucks between friends? [Laughs.] Hey, I'm losing you. I'm in the garage. All right. I'll call you tonight. - [Car Alarm Chirps.] - Don't turn around. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you hear what I said? Yeah. Yeah T-Take my keys. Stay that way. I don't want your car, Kemp. Give me your hand. My hand? Yeah. Not that hand. The other one.

Those guys were just sleepwalking! Oh! We need a real running back. Barlow's done. He's all washed up. Amen. They're talking about football. I have that one. Give me the cards. No. Mr. Monk, you don't need the cards. Just go talk to them. You are an interesting person. Can't you just be yourself? Give me the cards. [Sighs.] Weather. Politics. Movies. Swear words. Swear words? Don't you look at that one. There it is football. I got it. Hey. Ah. Monk is here. I guess we can all go home now. [Laughs.] You guys talking about last night's game? San Francisco 49ers lost Yes. We know. It was a hell of a fourth quarter though. It was the turnovers. They always come back to haunt you. Yeah. I was just saying Rattay can't handle the pressure. I mean, why didn't they take him out? Excuse me. [Laughs.] What's that all about? I don't know. Anyway [Continues, Indistinct.] That's true about Tim Rattay, the quarterback. But don't forget. He won four out of his last five home games. But they were playing in Houston, Monk. You guys want to hear some swear words? Hey, Monk? - What are you doing? - We're just talking about the local football franchise. Right. The Niners. [Chuckles.] No. The San Francisco Forty - Niners. Come on. Body's over here. Yeah. Sure. I'll catch you guys on the flip side. [Laughing.] [Laughing.] There it is. Hearing them laugh as I walk away, that's the worst part. Mr. Monk, they're not laughing at you. Yeah. Right. Victim ""A""the garage attendant. His name was Ronnie, uh Uh, Ronald Shelton. Shelton. Guy worked here for two years. Shot twice in the chest with a.45. We recovered the shells. Bang-bang, he's dead here. The shooter then drags Shelton's body this way and rolls him under this truck. Then he hangs out here in the garage and waits. For what? For victim ""B."" Warren Kemp. He enters the garage at 7:30, heads for his car. [Meows.] Sweet ride. Yeah. I'm thinking of getting one of these myself. Meanwhile, back on Earth. The killer forces Kemp over to the car at gunpoint, makes him put his hand in the car door, and breaks it. He killed the first guy, then waited around, but then only breaks the second guy's hand? His right hand. Not his left hand. He was very specific about that. And then he takes off. Kemp recognize him? - No. He didn't see his face. - Robbery? Nope. Why his hand? Is he a musician or a surgeon? He's a big-time stock analyst. Works at one of the financial places upstairs. You know Buyouts and mergers. Money for nothing. Is that Monk? Yeah. He's supposed to be some kind of genius, - like Sherlock Holmes. - Who's the girl? Uh, his assistant. Natalie something. What you got? Well, this tire iron is metric. Doesn't fit this car. In fact, all the cars down here are American-made. I think the killer brought this down to pretend to change a tire. - He probably drives an import. Good. What else? - Tweezers. Well, he's insecure. He's always trying to impress people, act tougher than he is. [Disher.] How do you know that? He was chewing on this. [Disher.] Toothpick. [Exhales.] That's not conclusive. [Woman.] Captain? Just a theory. It could could be wrong. Yeah? How's Kemp? I can't release him yet. Gotta get him back to the hospital for some X-rays. But he gave me a message. He said to tell you that he can meet Mr. Monk tomorrow morning at his office, 10:00. He says he hopes to see you too. Who? Me? [People Chattering.] Yes. Mr. Monk. He's all the way to the end and on the left. Hi. Adrian Monk for Mr. Kemp. He's on a conference call. You can have a seat. Okay. I used to work in a place like this. I lasted about two weeks. You do the same thing every day. Same thing. After a while, you begin to feel like a number. A number. You're just like everybody else. Everybody else. You're basically a drone. A drone? [Woman.] He's ready for you. If you'll follow me. Mr. Monk. [Groans.] Warren Kemp. Forgive me for not shaking hands. [Chuckles.] Oh. I don't mind. It's Natalie, right? His gal Friday. [Chuckles.] Something like that. How's the hand? - Nine broken bones. - One more would have been an even 10. You sound disappointed, Mr. Monk. Well, it's too late now. Nice digs. Yeah? So this ""buy low, sell high"" stuff really works, huh? [Chuckles.] Well, apparently. Wow. What's that hooked to the phone? It's a voice scrambler. Some of the transactions I handle are top-secret. Security comes through twice a week sweeping for bugs. I feel likeJames Bond. Please, sit down. Mr. Kemp, I understand that the man that attacked you knew your name. That's right. But you didn't recognize him? No. I never got a good look at him. - Did you recognize his voice? - No. Sorry. Any idea why somebody would want to break your right hand? Are you about to sign an important contract? Well, it wouldn't matter. I can still sign my name. I mean, if I make an ""X,"" it would still be legal. So you've been moving furniture? That's right. I just hired a new decorator some feng shui nut. She says if my desk faces the door, it would open me up to new opportunities. Maybe she was on to something. [Chuckling.] [Chuckling.] [Chuckling Continues.] - How did you know about the furniture? - Oh, impressions in the rug. The desk used to be there. That's pretty good. Who's the detective here? [Chuckles.] [Chuckles.] [Chuckling Continues.] Mr. Kemp, uh Captain said that you wanted to ask me some questions. Mr. Monk, I'll admit it. I'm scared to death. I mean, this creep knew my name. It could be someone close to me. I agree. The police have the building staked out, but I need someone working here, undercover, trying to figure it out. I trust you. I trust your judgment. Can you recommend someone, or I'll do it. - What? - I'll do it. Oh, thank you. L-I feel better already. You can start tomorrow. No, no, no. You don't understand. He can't work in an office. There There are people here. Nah, nah. He'll be fine. I'll say you're, uh, - an investment analyst I'm bringing in from Chicago. - Chicago. Yeah, all you have to do is, you know, look busy. I'll give you some reports to collate. Did you hear that? I'm gonna be collating. [All Chuckle.] So you're from Chicago? It's too cold for me. Not that the weather here is much better. The kitchenette. Some of the food in that machine is still edible. Office humor. I love it. Sales department's down there. This is accounting. We're redecorating the whole office. Do you smoke? If you do, the smoke detector in the break room's usually broken, if you know what I mean. Isn't that kind of a fire hazard? I hope so. If we're lucky, this whole friggin' place will burn down. Here's your parking pass. If you park in the garage, make sure someone walks you downstairs. We had a problem there two nights ago. Ah. I heard about that. Why do you think someone would want to break Kemp's hand? Probably someone who heard him playing piano at last year's Christmas party. [Blows Raspberry.] Ah. More office humor. That's good. This is you. Home sweet home. This is me? It's perfect. Yeah, it's a dream come true. What are you doing? This is Adrian Monk. He's starting here today. Mr. Kemp said I could have that cubicle. What's the difference? It's closer to the emergency exit. Statistically, it's a little safer. Statistically, you're a little nuts! Why don't you double up on your medication and get back to work? Ignore him. He's a little [Whistles.] So, we're all set. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask somebody else. Somebody else. I get it. We're taking up a collection for Chilton Handy. It's his birthday. He's 40. Oh, I, uh I just got here. You work here, right? Most people put in [Rattling.] Okay. Okay then. Here you go. You're Chilton. That's right. I'm turning 40. Well, happy birthday. What do you think about what happened? You mean to Kemp? Well, it's pretty strange, huh? Breaking his hand. Why would somebody do that? Maybe someone didn't like their last employee evaluation. Captain, this just came in. I think you'd better sit down. What is it? I really think you ought to sit down, sir. I don't want to sit down, Randy. What is it? It's pretty big, sir. What is it? Okay. Sir, it's just that when I got the call, I was sitting down, and I'm really glad I was. Did somebody die? Is anybody hurt? [Sighs.] I just got off the phone with the S.E.C. They're investigating Warren Kemp for insider trading. Is that it? There's definitely a leak. And they're pretty sure that it's coming from inside the firm. One theory is that it's Warren Kemp himself. But he was having second thoughts, so our guy breaks his hand as a warning to keep him in line. And that's it? - Yes, sir. - And you had me sit down for that? No. No, it wasn't just that. I mean, you looked a little bit tired. - Is that my phone? - Your phone? Disher. Uh-huh. Yeah. I got to take this, sir. Yeah. No, no, no. I'm on my way. Right. No. Absolutely. Uh, yeah. Adrian, really, you didn't have to reorganize the whole filing room. Uh, actually, I did. And thanks again for cleaning my office. I can see my desk again. You're gonna make somebody a wonderful wife. Oh, Greg, here's that quarterly sales report. I found a few typos and grammatical errors, so I retyped it. Retyped the whole thing? You're my hero. So, where are we eating? Let's just go to the Broadway Grill. It's right across the courtyard. Come on, Adrian. Come on, Annette. [Elevator Bell Dings.] I'll get the next one. - There's plenty of room here. - I'd rather wait. You can fit right here. It's only two floors. Okay, I'm I'm I'm fine. I'm W-We're not contagious. [Laughs.] I know you're not contagious. I'll take the next one. [Elevator Bell Dings.] Mr. Monk. I was worried about you. How's it going? I'm fine. It's going good. Oh, good. All right, I just talked to the captain. The S.E.C.'s investigating this place. They have a bank account in the Cayman Islands. Somebody's making millions based on insider information. Yeah. They even have this crazy theory that Warren Kemp's involved. Isn't that insane? Come on. Let's talk about it at lunch. Oh, I can't. I'm meeting the gang. What gang? I have a gang. I'm in the gang. They're waiting for me. What are you talking about? Natalie, they like me. I brought some cards along. I haven't had to use them. Nobody's laughing at me. I got to go. I'll talk to you later. Oh. Oh. Mr. Monk, how's the case coming? Any leads? Nothing concrete. Uh, can't talk right now. I gotta go. The gang is waiting for me. [Sighs.] - Mr. Kemp. - Warren. Please. So, what are you doing here? I was going to take Mr. Monk to lunch, but he had other plans. So, you're free? Yeah. Hmm. [People Chattering.] Here you go. Dig in. Ah. Thank you, Pamela. [Grunting.] Let me get one. Mmm. Mmm. Those are good. [Chuckles.] Delicious. So, is it hard to work together and and and be in a relationship? What? What? The two of you are having a thing, right? Why do you say that? Well, your shirt There's a hole on the end of your collar. Greg was wearing that same shirt yesterday. Plus you're using the same shampoo and the same deodorant. And today Greg walked in with your umbrella. Oh [Chuckles.] [Laughing.] - All right. - [Laughing.] - You should be a detective. - [Laughing.] No. No. L-I couldn't be a detective. I could never be a detective. They're lonely. They're They're very lonely and sad. They don't have a gang. A gang from the office. [Laughing.] [Laughing Continues.] So this is how millionaires do lunch, huh? Ah. This is how millionaires become millionaires. And divorced and stressed out and dateless. [Chuckles.] [Chuckles.] Oh, I can see my boss from here. He's laughing. I hardly recognize him. Is that yours? Ah, it's beautiful. Is it? I don't remember. I haven't seen it in two years. Warren, we gotta get you out of this office. Gosh. The last time I was in Vermont, I was in jail. What? Yeah. I hit a guy in a bar. He wouldn't leave my friend alone, so I just sort of shoved him through the window. [Chuckles.] If you're trying to turn me on here, it's working. Oh, my God. I can't believe I just told you that. You cannot tell anyone I've been arrested, okay? Mr. Monk Oh, my God. Julie, my daughter, if she knew? Please. You have to promise me. Oh, no. I promise. Okay. Now you have to promise me something. Yes. That you'll keep calling and reminding me how pretty that cabin is until I can take you up there and show it to you myself. Okay. [Chuckles.] [Laughing.] [Laughing Continues.] Hey, Sherlock Holmes! Come here! We're trying to figure out who did this. - This is a human Caucasian buttocks. - Yeah? [Laughing.] Yeah, we know. But whose Caucasian buttocks? Got to be Chilton. Go to hell. Uh, no. This is Ben. Real mature, Ben. Oh [Laughing.] Ow! How'd you know? W-Well, the staples go out, not in. Ben's is the only stapler in the office set to do that. What are you doing? Taking this down. The tournament's over. You guys forfeit. Who said that? We don't forfeit anything. - It's our bowling league. The finals are tonight. - Okay, fine. I'll see you there. But you're just gonna embarrass yourselves even worse than usual. Mr. Kemp was the only bowler you had that didn't suck. Mr. Kemp bowls? Not anymore. Not with a busted hand. The creep is right. We're gonna get slaughtered. Bowling. [Bowling Pins Crash.] [Cheering.] [Man.] Yeah! It's louder than I thought it'd be. [Cheering Continues.] Do you really think that guy killed somebody and broke Warren Kemp's hand just to win a bowling trophy? I know it's crazy, but look at him. He's completely obsessed! And not in a good way like me. Plus, he's a toothpick chewer. Does he have an alibi for Monday night? Good question. Adrian, you're up. - Me? - We need someone to fill in for Mr. Kemp. Why do you think we asked you to come? Because I'm one of the gang. Here's your shirt. Find a ball. [Bowling Pins Crash.] All right. Good eye. Good eye. Find your ball. That's it. Yeah. [Bowling Pins Crash.] A walk's as good as a hit. [Clapping.] [Bowling Pins Crash.] Here. Could you take it? Take it! Take it! [Cheering.] All right! [Woman.] That's good, Adrian. Roll it now. Oh, yeah! That's amazing! Yeah! [Cheering.] One more, it would have been an even 10. Oh, you get another chance. You get two balls. Really? Go get it. Do it. Yeah! Get 'em. [Snaps Fingers.] You're so slow. I'm [Cheering.] [Cheering.] [Bowling Pins Crash.] [Cheering.] [Woman.] Come on. Let's go celebrate. All right [Continues, Indistinct.] - [Shouting, Indistinct.] - [Monk.] I got another one! [Woman Shouting, Indistinct.] Oh, my God! Yes! [Man.] Yeah! Strike! Hey, did you watch that comedy show on TV Monday night? What? It was about this family that argued all the time, and the father was always wrong. You could hear the audience laugh, so that you knew it was funny. I missed it. Where were you? Pardon me? Monday night. Did you go out? Are you a cop? No. Then I don't have to talk to you, do I? So, who's the girl with Adrian? Didn't you get that e-mail? Somebody's been sending messages to the whole office about her. Her name's Natalie something. She's been hitting on Mr. Kemp. You're kidding. And get this. She's done time. She almost killed a guy in Vermont. [Gasps.] Thanks. [Phone Rings.] Hello? [Natalie.] Everybody knows about Vermont, Warren. They're all talking about it. I told you that in confidence. Natalie, I didn't tell anybody. I swear. Well, somebody's e-mailing your whole office, and nobody but you knew about it. - Natalie, you have to believe me. - Like hell I do. Mr. Monk, we need to talk. Natalie, look at this. Chilton has an alibi. He was here Monday night. He bowled a 294. I don't know what to think. Well, I think Warren Kemp's involved. What? Maybe the S.E.C. Was right, that it's an inside job. I do not trust that guy. I thought we liked him. I thought we liked him a lot. Well, we don't. You know what? I'll just meet you outside, all right? I got to get some air. [Whispers.] Adrian! We're only down two pins. If you can roll three, we can win the game. No problem. Foul! That's a foul! He can't wear those. He's wearing street shoes. They're not regulation. But he's been wearing them the whole game. I don't care. He can't bowl if he's not wearing regulation footwear. That's a rule. Fine. We'll just rent him a pair of shoes. What size are you? Uh, here's the thing. When you say ""rent a pair,"" you're talking about footwear that other people have already worn? That's right. On my feet. Here Here's the thing. I don't like to share anything. - Fine. Let's just buy him a new pair. - Pro shop's closed. So what's it gonna be? If he doesn't bowl, you forfeit. [Sighs.] Here. We're about the same size. What the hell are you looking at? They're just shoes. Just put them on. Here's the thing Okay, stop saying ""Here's the thing."" Just put on these shoes for 20 seconds, then you can take them right off. Twenty seconds. I don't know. So you forfeit? Listen. We've been waiting five years to beat these creeps. All you have to do is put on Greg's shoes and roll the frickin' ball. I can't. Yes! We win! Oh, yeah! Yes! That's a forfeit! We win! Forfeit. Forfeit. Forfeit. Forfeit. Losers. [Woman.] Come on, come on. [Chattering.] [Bowling Pins Crash.] Hey, hey. I bought some I bought some bowling shoes. I'll tell you what you can do with those. Put 'em [Whispers, Indistinct.] That's a new one. What do you think? I'm sorry? Which one do you like? I'm doing the windows and all the offices. I'm trying to brighten up everyone's spaces. Which one? This one? I think it's just a tad bit more sunshiny. Don't you think? - Yes, it's very sunshiny. - All right. [Sighs.] [Sewing Machine Whirring.] [Whirring Continues.] [Floor Creaks.] What are you doing? What do you want? Okay, take anything. Take anything you want. Uh You want that pillow? Take that pillow. It's Italian. - [Gun Cocks.] - Oh, my God. [Gasps.] [Chattering.] What does it mean, Lieutenant? I think it means the killer was very intelligent. So it was the same guy as the garage? Yeah. It looks like it. We recovered the bullets .45 caliber. They're comparing it now. Uh Something else too, sir. It's pretty big. Don't worry. You don't have to sit down. I mean, you can sit. I mean, sit or stand. Can I walk away? I'll just tell you. The victim, Angela Dirks She was an interior designer. We found some recent invoices. Guess what? She was working for Pross Financial Services. The same company. Yes, sir. So the guy breaks the boss's hand, and then four days later he kills the interior decorator? What the hell is going on up there? But that's pretty weird about the decorator getting killed. There's gotta be a connection. Don't you think? Mr. Monk? That was our table. We ate nachos. You ate nachos? No. But I pretended to. And then later Ben made a copy of his Caucasian buttocks, which was very funny. Although I don't know exactly why. Mr. Monk, it's their loss. Really, it is. They're all at the Chinese restaurant down the street. I saw them sneaking out so I wouldn't come with them. - Uh-oh. What is that? - What? There's There's something Is that a hair? Where? No. It's okay. It's just celery. [No Audible Dialogue.] [Teeth Clenched.] Natalie, I think I know what happened. What? I solved the case! Why are you talking like that? You see that guy by the window? The guy in the green jacket. When I said there was something in your soup, he reacted. He looked at his soup. His suit? His soup! Soup! Well, maybe he heard you. No, no, no. He couldn't have. He must have read my lips. He can read lips! That explains everything. It does? Yeah. He's been sitting at that same table every time I've been in here. He must have been sitting there about a month ago. At some point, he looked out the window, and he saw something something worth millions of dollars. What? What did he see? He saw Warren Kemp. [Monk.] He's been reading Warren's lips. From that table, he has a perfect view into Warren's office. It's a company called Maine Fiber Optics. Before September 2nd. [Teeth Clenched.] Buyouts, mergers That kind of inside information, it's worth a fortune. Don't look! Don't look. He's staring right at us. I'm sure everyone is, the way you're grinning. That's okay. He'll just think we're in love. You don't look like you're in love. You look like someone who's had some sort of industrial accident. Here. Just I don't get it. Why would he break Warren's hand? Because Warren redecorated his office last week. Remember? You noticed it yourself. Yeah. He turned his desk around so that when he held the phone in his right hand, he was blocking his mouth. - Somehow he had to get Warren to switch hands. - [Warren Screams.] That's what all this is about? So he would hold the phone in the other hand? [No Audible Dialogue.] Why would he kill the decorator? [Muffled.] Because she was planning to put curtains up. Remember? That would have ruined everything. Oh, my God. Here he comes. Mr. Monk, there's a mirror. He could have been reading my lips. Think you've figured something out, huh? What do you say we all take a walk outside and talk about it? I'm gonna grab the gun. I can hear you. I was born deaf, but I'm okay now. Modern science. Now let's go. Okay, okay. We're going, we're going. But you're making a huge mistake. Do you know who this man is? He's [Screams.] [People Murmuring.] All right, don't move! Stay where you are. Don't worry. It's okay. I used to be a cop. - I'm calling the captain. - Wait. Wait. Could you first call Mr. Wok's? - Why? - That's where the gang is eating. I'd really love them to see this. I like the curtains. Well, they're temporary. They're moving me upstairs to the 15th floor You know, away from prying eyes. Makes sense. At least we know who wrote that e-mail. The killer must have been reading our lips when we talked about going to Vermont. Guess he didn't want his golden goose going on vacation with anybody, so he tried to break us up. Look, Natalie, it doesn't matter who wrote the e-mail. I'm a bottom line sort of guy, and the bottom line is, I told you it wasn't me. I swore to you, and you didn't believe me. You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. Can't we just pop this open and pick up where we left off? [Sighs.] [Door Closes.] It's expensive. Don't waste it. How'd it go? Let's get out of here. [Laughs.] [Laughing.] There it is. [Laughing.]"

There you go. [Grunts.] Thank you. Oh, oh, the mail. Pardon me? I forgot to tell Kevin to bring in the mail. That's okay. I talked to him. Maybe we should call him just to just to be sure. Mr. Monk, I took care of it. He's bringing in the mail. What are you doing? What? You don't believe me? Why would I lie about something like that? To shut me up. Mr. Monk, I'm not a liar. I called him. [Beeping.] Just to be sure. Mr. Monk, we are partners now. That means we have to trust each other. That is the rule, okay? I have to trust you, you have to trust me, no matter what we say. You're right. I'm sorry. Yeah. [Door Closes.] [Monk.] Oh, no. Oh, no. [Natalie.] What? Oh, it's so different. It's not at all the way I remember it. Feel better? A little. Adrian! Hello! Welcome back. Uh Uh, welcome home. [Laughs.] Hello, Sylvia. Has it really been a year already? Oh, you must be Natalie. Welcome to wine country. Sylvia Willis. Sylvia to my friends, whom I hope is everybody. [Laughs.] Oh, Adrian, I've got your room all ready. Your special pillows, special towels and your special soap. And I hope you got my letter about the rug. Oh, yes. They had to replace one of the rugs. Oh, thank you for being so understanding. Uh, would you sign in, please? You're going to be in Room 204, at the top of the stairs. Oh, sure. Sylvia, I want to apologize again for last year. Oh, don't mention it. It's ancient history. What happened last year? Well, it's not worth mentioning. We had a mystery weekend, and we hired some actors who were going to act out a little murder. I'm really, really sorry. And, uh, it was supposed to be for three days. And everybody paid in advance for three days. Adrian solved the case in What was it, 12 minutes? L-I knew that the general's daughter was lying about meeting Churchill, because Churchill wasn't knighted till 1953. Which meant that Reginald, the limping chauffeur who supplied her alibi, was also lying. So obviously, they were lovers who were planning to kill the sultan and steal the Arabian emerald. Anyway, uh, we had to refund everybody's money. No big deal. But we learned our lesson. No more mysteries when Adrian Monk is in town. [Laughs.] This time we're having a wine tasting. Uh, do you enjoy wine, Natalie? A little more than I should. Oh, then you must join us. - Uh, Adrian, you don't drink, do you? - Mmm, no. Oh, good. Perfect. Here are your keys. You know the way. Now, if you need anything, you just call me. Okay. Natalie, I'm going to, uh, sit down here for a little while. It's sort of a tradition. You want some company? Uh, no, no. I'll I'll be fine. I won't be alone. Okay. Well, have a good night, Mr. Monk. Get some rest. [Man.] Right, right. [Woman.] I like to start easy. Well, that's how he starts there. Okay, show your hands. All right, fine. I think I have two, uh, pocket aces. [Laughs.] There's the flop. [Chattering.] Not a day goes by when I don't think about you. And l-I never feel as close to you as I do when I'm here. It's all we Oh, no. No. Please l-leave it. Please. It's 1984? Yes, sir. Allacco Cabernet, 1984. It had your name on it. It's my wife's favorite. Mmm. Thank you. [Chattering.] Thank you for marrying me. What were you thinking? [Door Closes.] [Sighs.] [Chips Rattling.] [Man Laughs.] I'm sorry. That's-That's probably me. I was a little enthusiastic with the Aqua Velva. Do you mind if I rest my cheeks? Actually, I do. Oh, well, if someone comes, I'll get up. I hate drinking alone. Um, por favor? Señor? Uh [Speaking Spanish.] [Laughs.] Oh, I'm-I'm bilingual. My mother was Venezuelan. That means I can make an ass of myself in two languages. [Laughs.] [Beeping.] Oh, ooh, ooh. Excuse me. Pardon me. I'm sorry. Ah. For my heart. My old ticker. Larry Zwibell. Adrian Monk. Adrian, nice to know you. So what brings you here? Are you here for the, uh What, the wine tasting? No, I come every year. It's kind of a tradition. Well, that's-that's nice. Ah, please. Mmm. Ah. Yours is even better. Much better. All right, let's do it. Pass it down. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Oh, transcendent. Like a meal in itself. Ah, just think, a week ago I couldn't even afford a bottle of pop. Oh, fabulous. [Chuckles.] Hey, are you all right? Not much of a drinker. Oh. [Laughs.] How many have you had? One bottle? One sip. Oh. Well, if you wake up tomorrow and you're still hammered, you gotta come find me. I'm in Room 202, by the back staircase. I got a great cure for a hangover. It's 100% guaranteed. [Woman.] I'm still in. [Man.] It's the psychiatrist you know so much of. Um So, um, if you'll excuse me, I'm, uh, going to teach these rubes how to play some cards. [Laughs.] Nice knowin' ya. Hello. Hello, everybody. Hi. Hello. So, uh, what are you playing? It's a friendly little game. Oh. I thought you were playing poker. [Laughs.] Hey, is this seat taken? No. Go ahead. Sit down. Ah. Thank you. [Coughing.] I'm sorry. You know what? That's probably the Aqua Velva. Oh, my God. What did you do, take a bath in it? No, I didn't, but that's not a bad idea. I'll try it next time. Hey, Larry Zwibell. Hey. Hi. I brought a couple friends with me. Maybe you'd all like to say hi. Oh. Ah. [Laughs.] - Pierre LaCoste. - Ah, bonjour, Pierre. Bonjour. Cal Gefsky. Hi. How you doing? This is my wife, Heidi. Heidi. Wife? I just can't get used to that. - Oh, we just got married on Saturday. - [Larry.] Congratulations. Oh, I'm Dr. David Sobin. Nice to see you. He's a psychiatrist, you know, so watch out for him. A shrink? No, you're kidding. Wait, hold on. I got a great joke. Okay, have you guys heard this one? A guy goes to a psychiatrist, and he says, "" Doctor, my wife thinks she's a refrigerator."" And-And the psychiatrist says, ""Well, just ignore her."" And the guy says, ""I can't. When she sleeps with her mouth open, the little light keeps me awake all night."" [Laughing.] The little light. Hey, Adrian. What, are you gonna give up? Uh, I think so. Good night. Oh, excuse me. Um, excuse me. Um, before you go, would you take our picture? Uh, sure. Oh. Oh, good idea. Okay. Oh, oh. Hold still. Hold-Hold still. Ready. Smile. Wait. Let-Let's stand oldest to youngest. So that would be you, then you, then you. Mr. Monk. I will take the picture. [Beeps.] [Shutter Clicks.] Oh, Mr. Monk. I was just coming to get you. Shh. It's a beautiful day. They have an amazing breakfast downstairs. Shh. Are you okay? Mmm. Were you drinking? Just a little. Not even a glass. [Groans.] Oh. Oh, I met a guy. He's in 202. He said he had a cure for this. Uh, he said it was He said it was guaranteed. Well, here. 202. 202. Larry? It's-It's Adrian from last night. Hello? Oh, sorry. L-I was looking for Larry. Huh? Ah, did you switch rooms? No, no. Well, he said Well, who-who-who are you talking about? Larry Larry Zwibell, uh, from last night. You played poker with him? Uh, no, no, you're mistaken. You see, I don't know anybody by this name. Excuse me. Pardon me. Oh, good morning. I hope you're hungry. Hi, good morning. Uh, we're looking for a guest a Larry Zwibell? Uh, who? He checked in last night. You remember? Room 202. Adrian, nobody checked in yesterday except for you and Natalie. No. No, no, no. Sylvia, I talked to him. He-He Larry Zwibell. Uh, see for yourself. He was here. I talked to him. You have to believe me. Okay. There are three cars in the parking lot, plus mine. The same three cars that were there last night. Maybe he left. That wouldn't explain why everybody's lying. Then why didn't he check in? He did check in. He said Room 202. Look. We signed in on the bottom of this page. Sylvia could have removed the next page. Why would she do that, Mr. Monk? I don't know. Something happened. Something happened here. Come on. Are you sure you only had one drink? Natalie, I met him. He-He spoke Spanish, and he reeked of Aqua Velva. You believe me, right? You said we have to believe each other. You said that was the rule. That's true. That's true. [Clears Throat.] Excuse me. I'm sorry to bother you all, but we're looking for a guest, Larry Zwibell. He was here last night. Uh, who? [Laughs.] I told you I never heard of him. He played poker with you. He told you that joke about the psychiatrist. The wife who thinks she's a refrigerator. And the psychiatrist says, ""Just ignore it."" But the man says, "" I can't, because when she sleeps with her mouth open, the little light inside her mouth keeps me awake."" [All Laughing.] That's brilliant. Why-Why are you laughing? Because it's funny. B-B-But you already heard it. You heard it last night. They already heard it. Maybe it's your delivery. [Sighs.] Did you notice the French guy did this? That's his tell. I was watching him play poker last night. Whenever he bluffed, he rubbed his nose. I'm telling you. He did it upstairs earlier too. He's lying. They are all lying. It's It's a conspiracy. Mr. Monk, why? They don't even know each other. Ah, Ricardo. Señor? Ricardo, you remember my friend? He He was sitting with me at that table right there. He spoke Spanish to you. He ordered the Degout pinot. I am sorry, señor. There was no one there. You were alone all night. Ricardo. Excuse me. Well, you're gettin' an early start. [Laughs.] The tasting doesn't begin until noon. May I? Oh, they make this here. Mmm. They just released it this morning. How is it? It's good. It's, uh It's sweet. But it has a, um has a weird aftertaste to it. Ahh. Do you taste it? Mmm, no, not really. I'm a little bit worried about your friend. I'm a psychiatrist, and I saw him yesterday talking to an empty chair. Oh, yeah, he does that. His wife died eight years ago. He talks to her. Mrs. Willis said he used to be a detective. He was discharged. May I ask, why is he here? Well, it's his anniversary, and they honeymooned here, so So, this is probably a time of stress for him? Does he handle stress well? No. He handles stress unwell. Lonely, uh, children, uh, will sometimes make up a person in their minds an imaginary friend, if you will. I've seen it a lot in my practice. I've seen adults do it too. Well, you don't know Adrian Monk. He's a great detective. The police don't make a move without talking to him first. Now, I don't know what's going on here, but if he says he met a man named Larry Zwibell, then he met a man named Larry Zwibell. Oh, this is interesting. There's nothing upstairs. What's going on? Uh, excuse me. - [Natalie.] What do you think? - About what? The signature. The painter. He has the same name as As my hallucination? Hey, I didn't say that. But, Mr. Monk, you gotta admit it looks kind of bad. People might think that you saw the name and made up a person. Or the man I met saw the name on that painting and decided to use it for himself. The camera. Natalie, they took a photo last night a-a-a group photo and he was in it. [Door Closes.] And this is our 2002 cabernet sauvignon. I think you'll like it. It's slightly softer and more tannic than the merlot. You've got to get that camera. Okay. All right, but you stay here. Ah. Will you be joining us? Yes. Good. The more the merrier. Thank you. Next we're going to try the Syrah. Now, the Syrah comes from our very own grapes in the east vineyard. What are you drinking? Uh, it's the, uh the Sierra Springs. How is it? It's exquisite. Is this your first wine tasting? I'll explain what they're doing. There are five steps. We call them the ""Five S's"" Mm-hmm. See, swirl, sniff, sip and spit. Now, they're on step one. How does the wine look? Is it rich in color? Does it react with the light? Excuse me. Uh, what was that last one, uh, step five? Spit. So, they're-they're-they're going to be spitting? That's it. Mmm. Here. I can hold your camera for you. Oh, I'm good. - Now they're on step three. - Oh, step three. Sniffing. You smell the wine. Inhale deeply. Do you smell the fruit or the herbs? Uh, so that means, really, there's only two steps left until the spitting. That's right. Uh, all-all at once? All of them spitting on the on the porch here, uh, with me on-on the porch? - Now they're sipping. - Sipping? So spitting is next. Oh, God. [Monk.] Oh, here it comes. [Groans.] [Groaning Continues.] [Laughing.] This is so much fun, isn't it? How about a group shot? A little newlywed group shot. Um I'll take it. No. Maybe later. Oh, my God. It's a kissing fern. A what? Yeah. They're called kissing ferns. It's supposed to be good luck for newlyweds to kiss underneath one. Have you heard that song? ""Kiss Me Under the Kissing Fern, Baby""? Mmm. Yeah, yeah. [Natalie.] Yeah? [Cal.] Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, in that case, uh [Clears Throat.] Yeah. There, all right? Oh, wow. Y-You don't get it. It's so cute. Let me take a picture. Gotta get a great angle here. [Mouthing Words.] You can take the picture. [Laughs.] ~ Kiss me ~ ~ Underneath the kissin' fern ~ ~ Baby ~ ~ The hanging plant ~ - ~ The hanging plant ~ - ~ Ba-boom, boom, boom ~ - ~ Of love ~ - ~ Ba-ba, ba, ba, boo, boom ~ ~ The kissin'~~ [Snapping.] [Sighs.] You'll feel better when you get home. We'll call Dr. Kroger. It's Saturday. We'll call Dr. Kroger. Natalie, I met him. I talked to him. He was so real. How could l How could I be so wrong? I'm never taking another drink as long as I live. Mr. Monk, some people just have no tolerance. I used to work in a bar. I saw it all the time. You had two sips. That's like 10 shots to a normal person. Thank you. Hey, folks. How you doin'? Listen, I'm lookin' for my brother. He's gone missing. Have you seen him? That's him! That's the guy! You know him? L-I met him last night. - Really? - That's him. Wanna tell me about it? I don't know what he told you, you know. His real name is Ben Gruber. Our mother's been worried sick about him. Thank God. I thought I was losing my mind. I knew he was into wine, so I've been checkin' all the vineyards - and the little hotels in the area. - And you're his brother? - Allen. Allen Gruber. Pleasure. - Hi. Natalie Teeger. Natalie. This is Adrian Monk. Let me get this straight. Everybody here is pretending they never met him? Everyone. Aw, poor kid. - He's gotta be scared to death. - Why? He stole some money from a bank that he works for, right? And he took off. I talked to the local D.A., and she said, you know, they'd go easy on him if he turned himself in. That's why I'm here. I figured, you know, if I showed up, maybe I could find him, maybe I could talk him into returning the money. - How much did he take? - $3.1 million. Whew. [Exhales.] Although it sounds like he's spending some of it already. He's been paying people off to say they've never heard of him. Do you think he's still here? I mean, why would he stay? What was he driving? '86 Buick, last I heard. What are the odds? An '86 Buick. Well, it can't be his. This car has been here forever. Mmm, I don't think so. There's a dent here, but no rust. And there's no rust in the wheel wells. This car hasn't been here long. So he's still here somewhere, right? Well, he's not in that house. And we call this the barrel room. These containers are filled with 60 gallons of our world-famous chardonnay. It's gonna age in these containers for exactly 11 months. I like to think of it as a living thing, like a baby growing inside a mother's womb. Mr. Gruber. I thought we'd lost you. Oh, sorry. I just got turned around. If you follow me, we're literally going to be stepping back in time. Wine stomping. It's a tradition that goes back thousands of years to the Greeks. We're one of the last vineyards in California that at least make some of their wine using this method. [Monk.] Oh, my God. Do people actually drink that? Yeah, I think so. Are they insane? Go ask her if they're insane. J-Just ask her. I'm not gonna ask her that, Mr. Monk. And of course, we can't press all of our wine like this. It would take too long. But we do make one label using this method, the Allacco Cabernet. [Yelps.] It can be bought from our store out front. Uh [Gags.] I can't believe that's the Allacco Cabernet. [Natalie.] I know. Just take it easy. I've been drinking that wine for 15 years. It's foot wine. I can taste it. Oh, well, come on. You cannot taste it. L-l-I can. I can taste the feet now. I can taste And the toes What's between the toe And the fungus. It really is barbaric. Okay, I didn't see any fungus. Look, I'm sure they have clean feet. There are probably rules about that stuff. [Squishing.] Okay, I admit it. That's pretty disgusting. I saw a vending machine back there. You want a soda? Excuse me? To wash your mouth out. You want a soda? Uh, that would be great. Thanks. Tome su tiempo. What? It means, ""Take your time."" Right. Natalie. Natalie, he's lying. This guy and the man I met last night are not brothers. He just said ""soda."" And Zwibell Gruber whatever his name is said ""pop."" And he was bilingual. This guy doesn't speak a word of Spanish. They could not have grown up in the same house. Okay, I need to find out who he really is. Listen, can you break into his car? Can I break into his car? Yes, I can. Okay. I'll keep him busy. I'll take him to the bar. I'll try to get him drunk. I'll loosen him up. Maybe he'll make a misstep. W-Wait. You're gonna drink? Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Hi. I'm sitting with my friend over there. He would like a bottle of your house white. Okay. And, uh, do you have any nonalcoholic wine? We have a very nice claret. Zero alcohol. No alcohol at all? That's what I said. I'll have that. Could you put it in a carafe? Uh, you don't have to bring the bottle. You got it. We'll bring it over to you. Table 12 needs a bottle of the house white and a carafe of that claret. You got it. Here you go. Oh, thank you. I do appreciate you taking such an interest, Mr. Monk. Uh, well, I have a brother too. I'd be worried sick if anything happened to him. So, to your brother. Wherever the hell he is. Thirsty boy. Catch me if you can. Do you have a lot of friends? I'll bet you do. [Slurring.] Sometimes I turn on the TV, and I turn the sound way down. Mmm. I pretend that they're talkin' to me. That everybody likes me. ""Adrian, welcome back. Oh, we're so happy to see you. We are so happy to see you."" I'll bet you have a lot of friends. You look like a moose. [Laughing.] You do. I'm gonna call you Mr. Look-Like-a-Moose. Look-Like-a-Moose. [Laughing.] So about your brother. I'm sorry about the moose thing. Hey, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait. First, listen. What song is this? ~~ [Banging.] ~~ [Whistling.] [Clinks.] Al Nicoletto? Captain Stottlemeyer, please. It's important. [Mumbling.] Maybe you've had enough, Mr. Monk. No. No, no, no, no. I'm I'm fine. I'm fine. Mmm. Isn't this great? Just a couple of guys sittin' in a revolving restaurant. Ah, I love that. [Panting.] Hey. Mr. Monk. Can I just talk to you for a second in private? [Laughing.] [Natalie Laughing.] Missed it. [Laughing Continues.] [Muttering.] All right. You're drunk. No way. It's al It's nonalcoholic. [Groans.] [Laughing Continues.] I've got him right where I want him! Look! I'm winking. Okay, Mr. Monk, listen to me. You were right. His name isn't Gruber. It's Al NicolettoJr. He has five arrests. No convictions. He's a contract killer. Al, is this true? Yes or no, is this true? [Monk Mumbling.] [Natalie.] I already called the police. They're on their way, so don't do anything stupid. Don't you do anything stupid. And so it is agreed! And let the word go forth that nobody will do anything stupid. Let's go. Let's go. What are you doing? Oh, you'll thank me later. Forget the bottle! [Groans.] [Grunts.] Mr. Monk, hit him! With what? [Screams.] A bottle! - Which one? - It doesn't matter! [Groans.] [Grunts.] Oh, my God. Oh, God. I almost had a heart attack. [Groans.] Oh, God. Heart attack. [Stottlemeyer.] Yeah, I'd say he's pretty important. The feds are sending a private plane to pick him up. Nine-millimeter. Ben Gruber's partner was found shot to death in his hotel room in New York City five days ago. Now, I'm betting that those bullets match this gun. They got him. Watch the feds take all the credit. Captain? You have got to see this. What? Monk's in there doin' one of his summation things. He's wasted. When I hear When-When I heard N-N-Natalie say she almost had a heart attack, I remember I remembered that Larry Zwibell, a.k.a., also known as Ben Gruber, was taking heart medicine. Cappy! Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Leland ""Sottlemeyer,"" homicide. Show 'em Show 'em your badge. All right. Show it. Show-Show-Show it. Show it. Monk Show I solved the case. Good. Good, good. Let's-Let's, um Okay. Let's let these people go to their rooms, okay? Show it. Wh-Wh-Where's your gun? He's got a gun. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. You don't understand. No, no, no. These are the suspects. Oh, yeah. They're all in on it. Well, what did they do? What did they Look at 'em! I mean, look! Oh, look at 'em. Okay. Okay. They may not look like cold-blooded killers, but they're, uh Oh, they're ""crinimals."" Yeah. They're ""crinimals."" Crin Criminals. - [Gasps.] Mr. Monk. - They're criminals! I'm tellin' ya. Oh, yeah. We're gonna need a big ole paddy wagon. Do they still have paddy wagons? Here you go, Mr. Monk. Please, please drink this coffee. Okay. Now. Cup o'joe. Keep that warm. No, no, no. Here's what happened. I went to bed around 10:00. They were still playin'poker. Gruber must've needed more cash, so he went upstairs to get it. I went to bed around 10:00. They were all still playin' the poker. Monk. We've heard this part already. Cappy! Cappy, you made it. Oh. Oh. How do you do it? L l I love you. I just Oh. [Laughs.] Uh. Uh. I love you too, Monk. You just You just got You Okay. Let's go sleep it off, all right? Thank-Thank-Thanks for the What? Thanks for the Look at that. What's that thing? [Laughs.] All right, come here. Come here. Come here. I'm gonna get me one. Up to bed. Oh, w-wait! See, Gruber never came back. They got worried and decided to go upstairs and check on him. They found Ben Gruber dead. He was dead from a heart attack. And cash $3. 1 million. [No Audible Dialogue.] They must have figured somebody would be comin'around lookin'for it. That's the kind of money people come lookin'for. What to do? What to do? Well, they decided to hide the body and split the money. If anybody asked, they were gonna pretend they never heard ofhim. Hold on. [Sighs, Sniffs.] Here's what happened. If we don't take the money [Continues, Indistinct.] They got rid of Gruber's car. Then they removed the page with his signature from the guest book. And retook the group photo without him. He was gone. It was like he never existed. [Shutter Clicks.] Gone like a ghost. - Did you find the money? - Not yet. He says there was a conspiracy, and we all took the money. I say this character Gruber junked his own car, took the cash, and hitchhiked to Mexico. Can you prove I'm wrong? Nope. He's right. Without a body, we don't have a case. [Snoring.] Monk? Monk. [Snoring Continues.] Okay, um, I guess you're all free to go. Lieutenant, take everybody's address. Make sure it's a valid I.D. Yes, sir. Uh, if everybody could just follow me. We're sorry about the inconvenience. [Sighs.] What is it? What is what? This is their new wine. They bottle it next door. But it has this funky, weird aftertaste, and I cannot put my finger on it. Here. [Sniffs.] It smells like Aqua Velva. Oh, my God. [Snoring Continues.] Oh, my God. It's Aqua Velva. It's Aqua Velva. [Mutters.] It's Aqua Velva. [Chattering.] [LaCoste.] It was the old lady's idea! [Natalie.] What's gonna happen to them? [Stottlemeyer.] They didn't kill anybody, so they'll probably be home soon. Uh, he's a real party animal. [Laughs.] Okay. You drive safely, Natalie. We'll see you around campus. Thank you, Captain. I will. Happy anniversary, Adrian. Sorry I didn't believe you."
"[Ticking Loudly.] [Ticking Continues.] Excuse me. It's 2:00. The doctor's just running a little late. Okay. No problem. How late is he running? Did he say? Just a few minutes. It won't be long. All right. Listen, does he Does he know I'm here? Maybe I could just pop in and tell him Uh, l I don't think that's such a good idea, Mr. Monk. No. Where's Natalie? She's out. She's running some errands. Would you like to call her? Let's call her. [Phone Ringing.] Hello, Mr. Monk. Natalie, it's me. Adrian you know, Monk. - Yes, Mr. Monk. I know. - Doctor Kroger's running late. Then you'll have something to talk about, won't you? Do you need me to come over? I'm five minutes away. Where are you? You know, I don't even know. I'm at some coffee shop. Did you find that toothbrush? Yes, sir. Had to go to about five drugstores, but I found it. The Gertler 4000 [Whispering.] With the extra-soft polyurethane bristles? Yes, and the blue rubber handle. Yes, sir. Thank God. What about Trudy's picture? I just came from the frame shop. I got that too. How does it look? - You know, they did a really good job. You can't even see that scratch. - Excellent. She really was pretty. - Yes, she was. - Are you sure you're okay? Maybe I should just come over. No. No, no. You know what? I'm okay. In fact, I'm gonna be fine. Okay. Well, have a good session. And I'll be there when you get out. Thank you. [Bell On DoorJingling.] Trudy? Tru-Trudy. [No Audible Dialogue.] Hi. How are you, Zach? Nice to see you. Sorry I'm a little late. ~~ [Up-tempo Folk.] ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Disorder and confusion everywhere ~ ~ No one seems to care ~ ~ Well, I do Hey, who's in charge here ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Poison in the very air we breathe ~ ~ Do you know what's in the water that you drink, well, I do ~ ~ And it's amazing ~ ~ People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time ~ ~ If you paid attention you'd be worried too ~ ~ You better pay attention or this world we love so much ~ ~ Mightjust kill you ~ ~ I could be wrong now ~ ~ But I don't think so ~ ~'Cause it's a jungle out there ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~~ Adrian, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. Maggie said that you were getting a little anxious out there? That's true. I'm pretty excited. Hmm. I have some news. Really? As you know, yesterday was Trudy's birthday. I went to the grave. Then I came home, and I reread some of her poems. There was this one passage that really got to me. [Stammering.] L-I just kept rereading it. It goes, ""The snows that burn away ""like tears of God reveal the world anew. ""We are reborn. Nothing is lost forever."" It's beautiful. Yeah. Nothing is lost forever. [Sighs.] It was as if she was speaking to me. Mm-hmm. Like she was saying, I'm here without her for a reason. I think I think she wants me to let go. Wow. I know. Yeah. [Chuckles.] Wow. And then yesterday, the radio was playing a song, but it wasn't the radio. It wasn't the radio? ~ There are chicks ~ ~Just right for some kissin' ~ ~ And I mean ~ ~ To kiss me a few ~~ You know what it was? It was me. You. It was me. I was singing. Right. [Chuckles.] I think I'm happy. [Sighs.] Is that possible? Why not? It's so long overdue. [Chuckles.] Happy! Yes. I'm happy. Yes, yes. And then this morning, I looked up There was a picture on the wall. It was a little crooked. I just kept eating. I didn't get up and fix it. L-I know. Because the glass here on the table? You still haven't put it back on the coaster. What do you think? What do you think? Every time I say ""What do you think?"" You say ""What do you think?"" Well, what do you think? [Chuckling.] I'm almost afraid to say it. I think I might be getting better. Adrian, reading the poem the reaction you had to it it-it's what we call a threshold event. It's a big first step. First steps are the hardest. You okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just been, like, such a long time that I've been waiting. Just so Oh, thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm crying. I'm sorry. Does it make you uncomfortable? Yes, it does. Hmm. But what doesn't? Did you tell anybody about me? Where's our waitress? She just disappeared. Zach Mr. Ellinghouse, this is very important. Did you tell anybody else about me? Who would I tell? Janice is gone. She's all I had. I don't like this cloak-and-dagger stuff, Trudy. Well, believe me. It's for your own good. And remember I asked you not to call me Trudy. Call me Lisa. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Lisa. I still don't understand why you had to fake your own death. I was protecting my family. I was writing an article about an extremist group in the Bay Area, and they were looking for me. They would have killed me and my husband for sure if they'd found me. The only way to stop 'em was to pretend I was dead. Oh. Here we go. Tuna fish sandwich, and a coffee and one cinnamon stick. Cinnamon stick? Yeah, to sweeten it. It's a little trick I picked up in Madrid. Oh, that's right. You and Janice went to Madrid. I have all the letters she wrote. I kept everything. I know you did. That's why I'm here, Zach. Hey, great sandwich. They got little pieces of celery in this. Do you want some? No. I can't. I'm allergic to fish. Oh, that's right. I remember. I remember everything eventually. We need to talk, Zach, about the key the key thatJanice left you. Do you have it? Oh, I still can't believe she's gone. Yeah, I know. I know it hurts. I miss her too. This is This is very important. Do you have the key? Look, I looked for it. I couldn't find it. I'll look for it tonight. I prom I'll find it. I promise. Okay. I'll meet you on Keep Street, in front of the library tomorrow. Do you know where that is? Yeah. 10:00. 10:00. Zach, don't let me down. It's my key. Janice wanted me to have it. [Monk.] ~ There is wine all ready for tastin' ~ A little mayonnaise. ~ And Cadillacs so shiny and new ~ Some lemon juice. A little salt just a pinch. Just a sprinkle. ~ Da, da, da ~~ Oh, Kevin, I really appreciate this. Oh, stop. This is what neighbors are for. [Chuckles.] Is that enough? How many people are coming? I don't know. Well, the captain has this barbecue every year but, uh, I've never felt like going before. Oh, so this is like your coming out party. Like my coming Natalie, are you okay? Yeah. I'm just tired. Yeah. Okay, for the record, this one is a little uneven, but I don't care. I'm gonna use it anyway. Okay. The old me would have obsessed with making it So hold on. All right. Okay. But now I'm gonna let it go. Lettin' it go. I'm lettin' it go. It's gone. It's done. All right. Just one second. One more. Done. Done. Done. Mr. Monk? Yeah. I spoke with Julie's doctor today, and he said she might be allergic to fish. Oh? Oh. Poor kid. Yeah. Do you know anybody else who's allergic to fish? I think the man who lives across the street from my sister is allergic to fish. Not right across the street. Actually, you know what? It's not even really a street. It's more of a cul-de-sac. That's great, Kevin. How about you, Mr. Monk? No. Well, Trudy was. Oh, I didn't tell you the best part. Here's the best part. Hmm. Dr. Kroger is gonna call the department and recommend me for reinstatement. That's That is Great. Congratulations. Hey, I know. Later, let's get my old uniform down and see if it fits. I'll tell you something. It's not gonna fit if you eat too much of this. [Both Laughing.] It's never gonna fit. Hey, I met somebody who said he knew you. Zach Ellinghouse? Ellinghouse? Right. Oh, Trudy used to work with his daughter. How's he doing? He's fine. Good. Mr. Monk? Yeah. There's something I have to tell you. Okay. It's good potato salad. What do you mean you don't have it? I thought we had a deal. Trudy, don't get mad. I'm just talking about some compensation. [Sighs.] I don't know where that key goes. Maybe it's to something really valuable. No, no. It's not valuable, Zach. I told you. It's It's just some research that Janice and I did together, okay? It's just some old papers. - [Shutter Clicks.] - [Ellinghouse.] You're really anxious about it, and [Clears Throat.] L I have expenses, you know? I mean, bills. - [Shutter Clicks.] - Janice isn't here to help me. Who's gonna help me? Okay, you want some money. - So, tell me how much. Give me a number. - A thousand dollars. It's not that much. Fine. I'll have it today. I'll be at your house at 3:00. And, Zach, I am not leaving without that key. [Gasps.] What are you doing? Who are you? Natalie Teeger. I work for your I work for Adrian. I need that camera. Just please tell me what's going on. Have you told Adrian about me? Don't. You can't. If you care about him at all, you can't tell him. We both know this would kill him. I'm dead. I have to stay that way. Understand? ~~ [Rock.] [Chattering.] [Man.] Sweetheart, let your sister have a turn. [Stottlemeyer.] Whoops. [Growls.] Okay. How about that one? That one? Yeah. That one. ~~ [Continues.] Now what was wrong with that one? Oh, that was lopsided. Here, you do the buns. Switch. Hey, guys. Well-done, please. Well-done. Bun. Need a bun. The bun. Thanks. Okay, that That's a little off center. I could I could reposition that for you. Or you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna l I'm gonna let it go. You enjoy it. Life is too short. [Chuckles.] We're Let's let it go. Okay. Thanks. You know, the commissioner asked me what I thought about bringing you back on a contingency basis. I told him I thought we should try it. [Whispering.] Captain No. Don't say anything. Okay. We'll take it one day at a time, okay? Excuse me. [Sighs.] Oh, listen. There's a There's a few things that I should say that I don't. I mean, I've been working on a few things myself. Well, you're not perfect, God knows, but you're still probably the best cop I've ever met. And working with you has been one of the great honors of my life. You're the man. And I mean that. Right back at ya, sir. I love you, man. Yeah, I love you too. Oh, yeah. He said I was the man. He was getting all teary. Really? Wow. [Disher.] Not that it's competition or anything, it's just nice to be number one. Excuse me. Hey, Paulie? It's a red alert. Tell Karen that we're almost out of beer. Captain, do you have a minute? Sure. Uh, gosh, I know this sounds weird, but were you there when Trudy died? Who? Trudy Monk? No, no. I got there an hour later. Why? So, you didn't actually see the body? What are you getting at? I met her this morning. I talked to her. Finally. Here's your money. You can count it if you want. [Clears Throat.] I've changed my mind. What are you talking about? We had a deal. MyJanice gave me this key. She didn't leave it for you. Why do you think she did that? Well, she couldn't leave it to me, could she? Huh? She thought I was dead. I've decided to leave all her papers and her notebooks to the university. Zach Zach Janice and I worked on that story together. Those papers belong to both of us. [Sighs.] L-I don't know. I have to think. This isn't a game! Give me the key! Trudy, what are you doing? Give me the key. Stop it! Trudy! Just give it to me! - [Groaning.] - Zach? [Stottlemeyer.] It's not possible. It's impossible. She said she faked her own death to protect him. She talked to a paramedic before she died. Okay, but maybe he was lying. Or-Or maybe he was in on it. Captain, I've been following her. She's been meeting a man, this older guy named Zach Ellinghouse. Do you know him? Ellinghouse? No. Yeah, they've been arguing about a key. He has some key that belongs to her. How many of those have you had? Captain, I saw Trudy Monk. Did you take her picture? Yeah, but she took the film. [Disher.] Captain! Yeah, okay. We just caught one in Mission Hill. - Now? - Neighbor heard a fight. Door was open. She went in, found a body. Karen's gonna kill me. But, all right, uh, grab Philby and Dietrich. All right, uh, 418 Vinton, Apartment 3-D. - Victim's name was Ellinghouse. - Ellinghouse? Yeah, Zachary Ellinghouse. Why? You know him? Hey, what's going on? Nothing. We're rolling. There's a fresh one in Mission Hill. All right, let's go. I'm in. No. Hey, hey, hey, Monk. Look, we don't need you on this one. I want you to stay here. Look, uh, clean the grill. The grill is really greasy. Yeah. What? Yeah, yeah, come on. It'll be fun. What are you talking about? I'm getting my badge back. I'm back on the team, right? Come on, uh, let's go. I'm in. Let's lock and load. [Coughing.] Oh, it's really dusty in here. Mr. -Mr. Monk, maybe you should wait in the car. No, no, no. I'm fine. You know, Monk, we can't pay you for this. Oh, it's on the house. Least I could do. Yeah, here we go. Body was here? Yeah. Looks like he was on the desk, face down. Uh, he fell onto this thing, rolled over onto the floor. What do you call that thing? Spindle. Spindle. God, that's it. Finish my report. The rug was like this. Yeah. Looks like he tripped. Wasn't premeditated. Oh, there was a struggle with a woman. A woman? How do you know that? Heel marks in the carpet. Oh, she had very small feet. A lot of women have small feet. She wore perfume. Shalimar. Trudy wore Shalimar. Wait. No reading glasses. I think he kept something stashed in this book. - A key. Did they find a key? - No. No, nothing. Maybe they were fighting over that. [Disher.] Look at this. It's her mug lipstick. Oh, yes. [Sniffing.] Cinnamon to sweeten the coffee. Trudy used to do that. Is this the victim? Yeah. His name's Zach Zach Ellinghouse. Oh, no! I knew him. Ellinghouse, Natalie. You were just asking me about him. Captain, his daughter, Janice, used to work with my Trudy. It's weird you keep mentioning Trudy. There was a witness who heard a struggle. L-Lieutenant, let me let me What's this? ""Witness distinctly heard victim say, 'What are you doing, Trudy?""' [Whispers.] Trudy. That was Trudy's name. Mr. Monk, there's something I need to tell you. Yeah. Lf Mitch were somehow still alive, I'd want somebody to tell me. Tell you what? What? What are you talking about? It's Trudy. She's not She's not dead, Mr. Monk. Trudy? I've been following her. I talked to her. [Scoffs.] Well, this is I mean, that This is just Monk. Hey, Monk. Monk, I don't believe it either, okay? But we don't know what's going on. Captain Look, M-Maybe if we just got if we got a sample of her D.N.A. No. No! No, that way we'd know where we stand. Trudy's D.N. A? What are you saying? Maybe we could just exhume the body. Look, we're miles away from exhuming anything. She said she faked her own death to protect you. She's alive, Mr. Monk. [Gasping.] Trudy. Trudy! [Tires Screeching.] Trudy. Monk, was it her? He's not sure. She was too far away. Did you make the car? S-Sedan. Gray sedan. What kind of sedan? Did you see the driver? The license number? He doesn't remember. [Sighs.] Is there anything I can do? Is there anything I can do? [Sighs.] Okay. Excellent. [Disher.] Good. How's he doing? How do you think he's doing? I have never felt more helpless in my life. Well, I just spoke to Hank Merchant at the D.A.'s office. Wait. Did I authorize that? No, sir. I figured you wouldn't mind. I'm the man, remember? [Sighs.] I laid everything out for him, and he thinks we have enough to exhume the body. You just have to say the word. Look, hey, no, no. We're not digging anything up without Monk's okay. Look Let's just give him a day or two, okay? Captain. Doctor, thank God you're here. Oh, Natalie called my service. What's going on? [Stottlemeyer.] There is some evidence to suggest that Monk's wife, Trudy, may still be alive. Excuse me? We think she faked her own death and has been hiding out ever since. And we're pretty sure she killed a guy earlier today. Trudy's our primary suspect. All right. All right. So he's having a psychotic break. He's delusional. No. He's not delusional. We have two eyewitnesses and some physical evidence. This Th-Th-This is big. Excuse me. Dr. Kroger. Mr. Monk, look who's here. It's Dr. Kroger. Natalie, give us a minute, please. Adrian, um Here. You have to drink something. Did you drink something? You got it? You got it? Okay. Adrian. Okay. [Whispers.] Good. Adrian, I'm not going to believe anything until I hear it from you. Is Trudy alive? I don't know. But if it's true, then nothing is true. If this is true, nothing is true. Why didn't she contact me? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe she's in trouble. She's in trouble. A-Adrian, where are you going? [Kroger.] Adrian? Hey, Monk? Monk, where are you going? I have to find her. We'll go with you. No. I have to do this alone. This is between me and my wife. [Sobs.] She's not you. It's not you. [Exhales.] Hi. How you doing? Hi. My wife is buried back there. [Sighs.] She's still dead. [Exhales.] She's right where I left her. Okay. And I am so relieved. I mean, I love her with all my heart, but [Sighs.] Who's this? This is my husband. Ah. I'm sure he's dead too. And he'll stay dead. Don't worry about that. This is an excellent cemetery. They know what they're doing. Everybody here probably dead. Nice talking to you. [Phone Ringing.] That's it, there. Trudy's desk? For five years. She loved this job. I did that. I was leaning in to kiss her, spilled some coffee. [Chuckles.] I bet it was the last time you spilled anything in your life. Oh, I spilled something seven years later January 12, 1999. January 12? You mean during the earthquake? Earthquakes count. I don't make the rules. Mr. Monk, could I ask you something? What happened yesterday in the cemetery? How do you know the woman we've been seeing isn't Trudy? We still have one or two copies in the archives. You can keep that one. I don't understand. Why would anybody want to impersonate Trudy? I don't know. I wish some of these kids would impersonate her a little bit. She was the best reporter I ever knew. Here it is""Peer Pressure"" byJanice Ellinghouse and Trudy Monk. It was the only article they ever wrote together. It's a hell of a piece. It should have won a Pulitzer. Yeah. - It was on the dockworkers' union? - Ed Lindley, the union president, was indicted because of that. He's still in jail. That's right. The guy was untouchable. But Trudy and Janice never stopped digging. That article made history. Lindley's second-in-command, Jack Bollinger, became the union president because of this. He's still there. Seems to be running a pretty clean shop. Whoa, they are really naming names here. Look at all these payoffs. How did they get all this? Hard work and a secret informant. Deep background. Trudy never told me who it was. Well, they never told me either. Where was Janice's desk? Over there. Still haven't cleaned it out yet. It's, uh, hard to say good-bye. Yes, it is. - ""Pay rent."" - Yeah, so? She was already paying a mortgage. What could she be renting? What What What can you rent for a hundred and five dollars? I rent a storage locker. It costs about that much per month. The missing key the one from the book. It could have opened a locker. Mr. Monk, there are hundreds of storage lockers in San Francisco. Where would we even start? Well, Natalie, how about Trans-Cal Moving and Storage, 13025 Third Street? What? Th-This storage place what time does it open? [Trudy.] 8:00. I'm gonna need you to come along with me. Why? You said once I got you the key, I could leave. Change of plans. I don't know what kind of security they're gonna have. If we're stopped, I'm gonna need you to pretend to beJanice. Oh, and bring that along. She was a blonde too. I hate this thing. Why? It looks pretty good on you. Then, you looked pretty good as the redhead in that show. What was it called again? A man is dead. Yeah, I know that. And I am sorry. It was a terrible accident. And that other guy Trudy's husband. I will never forget his face. I mean, he was really hurting. Look, things happen. We're moving on. This is all about self-preservation now. Do you understand? If whatever is in that storage locker ever gets out, I am a dead man. I can't do this. Yes, you can. Look-Look. You're an actress, aren't you? Well, our little show is not over yet. [Chattering.] [Stottlemeyer.] Good morning. What's going on? Organizing a task force. Out of my office? Yes, sir. Well, I figured you wouldn't mind. I'm the man, right? Yeah, that's right. You're the man. Don't worry, sir. I am all over this one. I've reassigned Rudner and Sergeant Hyden. They're already on their way in. The report from the lab. There were no identifiable prints in the apartment. Trudy must have wiped everything down before she left. I'm running off 5,000 of those ""Wanted for Questioning."" I put a photo of her up on the hot board, and I've been trying to contact her parents. W-Wait, are you Wait. You've been trying to contact whose parents? Trudy's. In case she tries to call them. No, Randy. Wait, wait, wait And I'm, uh, releasing that to the press. It's a press release. Oh, uh, I called the deputy commissioner too. Just want Lieutenant! Excuse me, gentlemen. [Groans.] Randall, when I said that about about you being the man, I thought I was talking to Monk. Oh. Okay. Well, that explains it. Randy, it doesn't mean that I don't appreciate No, l-I understand. No problem. Why don't I just get you a cup of coffee? Won't be needing that. [Sighs.] It's number 12. Number I saw the list. The security guard just showed you the list? Not exactly. I caught a glimpse of it as he was bending over. Why was he bending over? To help me look for my earring. [Gasps.] I lost my earring. Oh, my God. It's irreplaceable. It was a gift from my Aunt Lisa on her deathbed. I think it might have fallen over there. Maybe she's already been here. No. There's water in the handle from the rain last night. It would have spilled out if she lifted the door. Listen. Listen. [Monk.] That's the car I saw. It's gotta be her. Come on. It's her. It's her. Mr. Monk, they're gonna see you. What are you doing? Get down. I had her back. [Sighs.] For an hour and a half, I thought she might be alive. Psst. [Exhales.] I had hope. Isn't hope the worst? No, Mr. Monk. Hope is a good thing. You're very young. I know this guy. I've seen him before. Do you have the article that Trudy and Janice wrote? Yeah. [Natalie.] Yeah. That's him. Jack Bollinger. - The union boss. - He was their anonymous source 10 years ago. Now that they're both gone, he must be panicked that all of their research material will be made public. And his old friends will know that he ratted them out. What about the woman? Bollinger must have just found her. It was a con game to trickJanice's father into giving up that key. I don't get it. How did she know so much about Trudy? Bollinger must have coached her. He spent time with Trudy when they were writing this, so he knew a lot about her. I'm calling the captain. [Stottlemeyer.] Lieutenant, we're rolling. That was Natalie. Monk broke the case. They're at a storage locker right up the street. Randy. Randy! Let's go. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you talking to me? [Sighs.] It's just hard to tell sometimes. Randy, you know how fragile Monk is. I have to stroke him all the time. But you're tougher than that. Come on. You're the man. Let's go. Oh, so everybody's the man. No. Just you and Monk. You're my two men. Let's go. If we were both drowning, who would you save? I don't know both of you. No, if you could only save one of us. I'd probably save Monk because he can't swim, and I know you're an excellent swimmer. Suppose I was holding an anchor? You're holding an anchor? Uh-huh. Who would you save then? Well, why don't you let go of the anchor? It's a family heirloom. I'm leaving. Mr. Bollinger, can I go now? Go start the car. No, no. Mr. Monk, it's not Trudy. Let's just wait for the captain. Just Stay here. What the hell are you doing? I found some notebooks and some tapes, but they're not all labeled, and I can't afford to miss anything. So we are going to Plan B. Oh, Mr - Mr. Bollinger, you can't do that! I don't want anyone else getting hurt. - Start the damn car! Trudy? - What the hell is he doing here? - I'm her husband. Son of a bitch, it never ends. H - How did he find us? Who else knows we're here? Hey, I'm talking to you. Your hair hair was more like like [Stammering.] Look, l-I didn't know, okay? L-I thought this was just a job. First row, number You, freak show, get away from her. No, Mr. Bollinger, don't. Trudy, listen. Okay, that is enough! No, no, no! Don't! Don't! They're gonna find a body in the ashes here! I have no choice! He knows too much! - Oh, God. - [Stottlemeyer.] Hey! [Yelps.] [Groaning.] [Panting.] Oh, I'm so sorry. You loved her. I'll tell her. [Natalie.] Well, I think it stinks. What stinks? The department deciding not to reinstate you. They didn't even give you a chance. You can't really blame them. After what happened, I'm kind of back to What? Normal? Well, to to kind of normal. Uh What? Wait a second. Uh, I touched that one twice. I have to You know, Mr. Monk, you never told me. What happened in the cemetery? How did you know that that woman wasn't really Trudy? Well, I went to the grave, and it still hurt. So I knew. Yeah, I know that hurt. It's never wrong. Nope. It isn't. Neither are you. [Chuckles.]"

How could we forget? - My Mom called you, didn't she? - Every day for the past month. - What's that? - [Stottlemeyer.] It's cellophane. Monk's idea. It's to protect the cake. Makes it more fun. For what? Well, when you blow out the candles, there's always a little what I call ""spittle."" Actually a pretty good idea. It's a, uh, ""birthday cake spittle shield."" - You know, that's the first idea you've had that I actually might consider investing in. - Thank you. Make a wish. Blow out the candles, Lieutenant.

It's [Cell Phone Ringing.] I don't need a birthday cake [Ringing Continues.] To feel the love I'm feeling in this room right now from everybody. Hey. It wasn't long ago that I was just thinking about you. I left Temple University in Philadelphia What? No, Roger, you can't. Because you can't. Well, I can't find anybody else. Because the dinner's tonight, Roger. The wedding's tomorrow. Uh-huh. So what did the doctor say? So it didn't technically burst! All right, fine, Roger, you take care of yourself. Bye. What does an appendix do, anyway? I mean, it's an appendix. That means it's extra, right? Is there anything I can do? [Sighs.] That wouldn't inconvenience me? Yes. You can come with me tomorrow to my brother's wedding. - My date just canceled. - A wedding, no. I'm sorry, Natalie. I can't. It's a bad idea for for seven reasons. Wait, eight, actually, now that I think of it. Nine. Nine reasons. L-I'm s I can't nine reasons. I've got the day off. If you can't find anybody else. - Is Greenberg still dating that parole officer? - No. He married her. Actually, I own my own tuxedo. Ooh! What about that B&E suspect you brought in last week? He was kinda cute. - Not cute enough to make bail. - I'd be honored if you met my family. It's not a date. I understand. I just l-l I need a buffer. I can't handle my family alone. I'm a buffer. I mean, I'm very buff. I mean, no pun intended, unless you thought I was being funny. Separate rooms. [Chuckles.] I should think so. All right, thank you. Here is the invitation. It's in Pebble Beach. Cool. Who's Jonathan Davenport? That's my brother. You're always kissably fresh with Davenport, like the toothpaste. Um, actually, not like the toothpaste. We are the toothpaste. [Chuckles.] What? - Get outta here. - Wait a minute. [Natalie.] What? This is you? - Yeah. - Why didn't you ever tell us? Mr. Monk, if you spent three minutes with them, you'd understand. I kept Mitch's name for a reason. I don't want any part of them, or that. So I guess you're kinda loaded, huh? [Scoffs.] They are. They wouldn't offer me a nickel. I wouldn't take it if they did. This doesn't change anything, does it? [Scoffing.] No. Why-Why would it? You're You're still Natalie. You're still you. Yeah. And we're still us. You're loaded. - Davenport! - Karen? Yes, Mrs. Davenport? Where the hell is the photographer? He told me he would meet me here. I don't know. But I will find him for you. [Sighs Deeply.] Thank you. Hey, what are these? They're cocktail napkins. Cocktail napkins are square. L-l I don't know what that is. Okay, I'm gonna fix this right away. Please. Karen. What is he? Uh He's a waiter. No, I mean, is he Native American, is he a hippie? What? Oh, l-I don't know. Well, I just don't think he should serve tomorrow. I mean, he just doesn't quite fit. [Sighs.] Oh, and I've changed my mind about the ratatouille. It'll drip! It'll drip all over everything. Tell the cook. Do you believe I have to do everything? Yes, dear. [Sighs.] Oh! Princess! [Julie.] Grandma! Grandpa! Is that your dad? Robert Davenport. Everybody calls him ""Bobby."" - Grandpa! - Look at you! Oh, God! You're gonna be the prettiest flower girl in the world. [Laughing.] Hello, sweetheart. What does he do? He inherits money. What about your Mom? That's Peggy. She has two hobbies: Tennis, and making me feel like dirt. She's a champion at both. They look nice. Oh, then, you'll fit right in, because looking nice is what matters around here. When I was in high school, all they cared about was whether I was dating the right guy from the right family. And? Did you? I dated all the wrong guys. Some of them were really wrong. Like Mitch. They still refuse to put his picture on the piano. What, that means something? Yeah, it means something to them, and me. [Softly.] Ugh, I'm sweating. I feel like I'm allergic to them. Is that possible? Wait, come here, come here, come here! I need a signal. A signal? Yeah. L-lf I start to panic, just I'll just ask you what time it is. Okay? Just get me out of there, right? Just drag me away. ""What time is it?"" I got it. Don't worry. [Gasping.] [Softly.] Hi, Mom. Umm Hello, sweetheart. Hello, my dear. [Clears Throat.] Oh, this is my friend. This is Randy Disher. Mr. And Mrs. Davenport, it's a pleasure to meet you. Both of you. I've heard great things about you. Like what? Well, uh, not about you, specifically. About your toothpaste. Especially that new kind with the mouthwash built right in? I'll bet you were the inspiration for that. [Chuckles.] Why? What's wrong with my breath? What time is it? What? What time is it? No. [Rattling.] There's something wrong with this Bloody Mary. Oh, honey, you're a bartender. Taste that. Mom, I'm not a bartender anymore. Oh, I'm sorry. You're, you're, uh, a junior detective or something. I'm an assistant to a private Investigator. - It's just so hard to keep straight. I mean, what is this, job number 17? - [Sighs.] Randy, sweetheart, be a dear. Taste this for me. What's wrong with it? - Not enough celery salt. - Oh, that's it. That's exactly what I thought. Okay, so where's Jonathan? I haven't even met Teresa yet. Oh, you're going to love her. She's fantastic. [Chuckles.] Whoa. Hold the presses. You actually approve. Oh, yes, we approve. [Laughing.] We could hardly be standing here if we didn't approve. - So I guess you had her checked out? - Yes, I did. This all happened very quickly. - Yeah, they met about three weeks ago in Hawaii. - She's never been married. Both ofher parents are deceased. - She'd been living off a very healthy trust fund, so this girl is not after the money. - Huge. This is the real thing. Jonathan's very happy. She makes him happy. That's all that matters. - Mitch made me happy, Mother. - Nat Peg. This is never Ah, ah. This is Jonathan's day. - Can we not do this? - Okay. I won't! I'm gonna go find Julie. Well, we haven't checked in yet. Which way is the main office? Back down the steps and across the parking lot. Great! See you later, Peggy. Bobby. Hey, listen, I gotta get going. You're okay, right? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't have to check in on me. Yes, I do. I promised Natalie that I would, and I swore on my mother's eyes. Captain, I'm not a baby. I'll be fine. Here. Alone. All day. Here. You got something to drink? It's in the fridge. There's a chart on the inside of the door. It's color-coded. I don't need the chart, Monk. [Refrigerator Door Closes.] Hey! I wonder how Natalie and Randy are doing? I love weddings. Did you know that I met Karen at a wedding? I love weddings anyway. ~~ [Whistling Tunelessly.] You [Sighs.] You know who had a great wedding? You did. You and Trudy. Now that was a great day. Where's that photo album? [Chuckles.] She was wow! [Stottlemeyer.] Beautiful. I remember, during the service, she was crying so hard, she couldn't even say the words, ""I do."" Have you ever seen anybody cry so much? That was you, Monk. And no, I have not. [Engine Idling.] [Shifting Gears, Revving.] [Grunting.] [Stottlemeyer.] Randy? Randy? Son. Did you see who was driving the car? Did you see? Can you I.D. The driver? See Volvo. Silver Volvo. No, no, Randy, we got We got the car. It's right here. Who was driving? Captain. Yeah? I got a license plate. I don't need the license plate, Randy. I'm looking right at it. Four, Paul, ""C,"" Charles. He's gonna be okay, right? Yeah. Painkillers. How's he doing? Broken arm, broken leg, probably a couple of broken ribs. Suitcase took most of the blow. It could have been a lot worse. Can he identify the driver? He can't identify me. I'll try again later. What do ya got? Condensation. The air conditioner was running, and the humidity is what, about 70%. So that car was idling right here for about 20 minutes. - So what, he was waiting for him? - And the tire tracks here. He must have peeled out at full speed. That's right, he didn't even try to brake. Or make the turn. Son of a bitch! What happened? He was only here for an hour. Did he piss somebody off? No. And, we found this on the floor of the car, near the gas pedal. Some kind of green mud. Well, I'll get that to the lab right away. - Captain, it's not your case. - Like hell it's not! She's right, Captain. It's my backyard. Lieutenant Bristo, Monterey County Police. How you doing? Don't worry, you'll be copied on every statement. Where you staying? Uh, right here, I guess. This is Adrian Monk. - He'll be staying here, too. - L-I don't think so. - You'll be staying here, too. - I guess I'll be staying here, too. The car's registered to a Margaret Davenport. Margaret Davenport? - Aunt Madge! - Okay, Aunt Madge. She said somebody took the keys out of her coat pocket, which was in a cloakroom. She was busy putting up decorations. So it wasn't her, but he knew exactly where to look. And what car was hers. There's no Volvo markings on that key. That could have been anybody. An employee. [Bristo.] I don't think so. I just talked to the manager. There was a staff meeting in progress. Nobody was missing. What? You're saying somebody in my family did this? No. [Stottlemeyer.] Let's get you upstairs. Hotel's comping you a room. Whoa! Okay. - I'll catch up with you guys later. - Okeydoke. Oh, yes. How is he? I hope he's gonna be all right. Oh, now, sweetheart. I'm sorry about your friend, but there isn't anything that you can do. So now, we just have to What? [Sighs.] We soldier on. That's right, we soldier on. Uh, now, rehearsal dinner is in about 20 minutes, so What's that? Oh, I found this outside. But those are Randy's pants. Oh, yes. L-I thought this color would be good to show the wedding planner for the tablecloths. Khaki? No, the blood! Crimson. The one she picked was sort of raspberry. It didn't go with any of the flowers at all. Mom, that's an evidence bag. Yes. You can't just take it from a crime scene. That's a felony. Well, the tablecloths are a felony, darling, and I'm going to give it back. Look, you just can't take it. Uh No! NatalieJane! Thank you, darling. Now, the rehearsal dinner's going to be in about 20 minutes, so you're not going to be wearing that, are you? [Sighs.] Mr. Monk! Natalie, that gift shop does not have my toothbrush. They do not carry the Gertler 4000. What am I supposed to do? We're gonna worry about that later. Come on. We're late. The rehearsal dinner's in 20 minutes. You said ""We""? You said, ""We were late."" I heard you say ""We."" You're my date. Congratulations. Oh, wait. Here's the thing Mr. Monk, someone did this to Randy, maybe somebody in my family. You're a detective, right? This is your chance to look around. Here's the thing Here's the thing: I can't go in there alone. You're my date. - [Glass Ringing.] - [Laughing.] [Clears Throat.] Excuse me. [Laughs.] [Sighs.] Well, I don't normally stand up and give speeches. In a minute, you're gonna find out why. I promise after tomorrow, I'm gonna letJonathan do most of the talking. - Don't bet on it. - [Laughing.] Um, I just wanted to thank you, all of you, for making me feel so at home. I know this all happened very quickly. I still don't know how you planned it all in one week. As some of you know, I lost my own parents in 1995 and I never thought I would ever feel this way again. So Mr. And Mrs. Davenport, when we met yesterday, you asked me to call you ""Mom and Dad."" [Chuckles.] At the time, I didn't really know what to say, but I've been thinking about it and, ""Mom and Dad,"" I would love to. [Tearful Laughing.] Natalie, when I was growing up in Philadelphia, I used to dream about having a big sister. I can't wait to get to know you better. I'm having a little bachelorette party tonight. I really hope you can make it. Oh, yeah. Stop it! He keeps touching my food. No, I wasn't. I was just helping the lad. He seems kinda confused about It's mushing all together here. He's, uh He's fine. He's gonna be all right. [Camera Shutter Clicking.] [Stottlemeyer.] You got a nice background here. [Clicks.] Very good. Thank you very much. [Clears Throat.] Captain. What are you doing? Taking pictures. I overheard your mother say that the wedding photographer didn't show up, so I volunteered. I borrowed this from one of the, uh, crime-tech guys. Why? Why? Because Randy says that he thinks he might be able to identify the driver. Did he get a good look at him? Yep. Male Caucasian, medium build, red baseball cap, sunglasses. I figured I'd take some pictures, get 'em developed tonight and maybe we'll get lucky. [Chuckles.] Wait. You're undercover at my brother's wedding? Yeah. Look, I'm doing you a favor. It's either this, or we take everybody upstairs one at a time. Smile. Very nice. Hey, Sis! Hey, Mr. Monk. Hey, bro! Oh! That looks good on you. Oh, the suit? No, the smile. He never smiles. Oh! [Laughing.] Never had anything to smile about. [Chuckling.] You want my advice? Get out now, save yourself. No! No, thanks. I'm not going anywhere. Till death do us part. [Chuckling.] Hey, how's your friend, Sergeant Disher? Oh, it's Lieutenant Disher. He got pretty banged up, but he's gonna be okay. I can't believe that happened right outside. Yeah, we wanted to send him some flowers. - Which hospital is he in? - No, he's back here. He's upstairs, just resting. Oh, good. Well, we can deliver the flowers ourselves. Yeah. - Do you think he'll be able to make it to the wedding tomorrow? - Oh, gosh. - Probably not. - That's too bad. Oh, you know what? I think I'm going to bring my new father-in-law a drink. Wait, don't forget. Room 304. Party. [Whoops.] [Whoops.] [Laughs.] Aw. So? I can't believe I'm about to say this, but Mom was right. She's great. You don't deserve her. [Laughing.] I don't. We have 87 things in common. [Chuckles.] Last night, we actually made a list. Okay, stop this. That's crazy. And she doesn't have any family at all? Brothers, sisters? No, she had an uncle, but he was on that Pan Am flight to Madrid with her parents. It was a Pan Am flight? Yeah. God. She's been through so much. But it's made her stronger. And it's rubbing off. I feel stronger, too. Soon I'll be strong, like you. Oh, right. [Laughs.] She's probably looking for me, so I'm gonna go but I'll see you tomorrow. Gulp! [Laughs.] What? Nothing. What is it? She-She said her parents died in 1995. Pan Am went out of business in '91. So? She got a little mixed up. Yeah. [Sighing Deeply.] [Screaming.] [All Screaming.] Oh. No. That ""M"" is a disaster. [Chuckles.] How about this guy? That's, uh That's Uncle Ferdy from Memphis. [Sighs.] No. No? No. That's Natalie's cousin. No. No pictures ofTeresa? The bride, sure. Uh Uh That's the back of her head. That's weird. I don't have a good shot of her. Hey. Could it have been a woman? Yeah, I guess so. You think maybe she's the guy? I don't know. She did lie about her parents. Well, we'll check her out. [Phone Ringing.] I'll get it. Oh! [Screams In Pain.] [Sighs.] I'm gonna need a bigger bottle. Uh, Randy Disher's room. This is Stottlemeyer. What? Yeah, I understand. Uh, we'll be down there in a minute. They found a body. Where? In the spa. Who is it? No idea. Okay, let's go. You're not going anywhere. Look, meet me downstairs. Find Natalie. [Giggling.] We had a few complaints about you ladies! ~~ [Dance.] [Women Squealing.] Good thing I brought my handcuffs! [Whooping.] Officer, I've been a bad girl. Yeah! [Laughing.] [All Squealing.] Hello? Hello? Excuse me. [Laughing, Whooping.] Hello? Natalie. Natalie. ~~ [Continues.] Natalie. Natalie. Mr. Monk, what's going on? Is Randy okay? - Is anything wrong? - Oh, uh, yeah. I just need to go talk to my Mom. Uh, I'll be back. Party on! - Bye! - Oh, hey! You better come, too. Me? There's a body downstairs. Looks like a 187. A 187? Yeah. Lieutenant Bristo's down there, and I think he wants you down there, too. Let's go. - Okay. - This way. I'm coming. ~~ [Clicks Off.] [Women.] Ohh! Wait. What's that? My boom box. Your boom box? Okay, fine. Let's just go. You look like you work out a little bit. I try. I'm looking into Pilates. - [Shutter Clicking.] - Hey, Monk. Who is he? So far, he's John Doe. We figure his wallet's still in the mud bath. I'm willing to bet that that mud is the same mud that you found outside in the car. Was he the driver? No, not likely. According to the coroner, this guy died at least 36 hours ago. Captain, he's the wedding photographer, the one that's been missing. - How do you know that? - The discoloration on his fingertips. It's caused by developer fluid. I've seen it on other photographers. [Chuckling.] I'm glad he's on our team. Well, if you're right and he's local, he'll probably have a studio in town. We'll get a search warrant. ~~ [Boom Box.] ~~ [Stops.] What's he doing here? Oh, that's Hondo. He's with me. I figured we might need a little crowd control. [Chuckling.] Can I talk to you for a sec? Mr. Monk, he's not a real cop. He's a stripper. I don't think so! [Chuckles.] Didn't you see his badge? It said, ""Officer Feelgood""? So Monk, the guy has got dollar bills sticking out of his belt. I thought he lost his wallet. Hold on a second. Now, wait a minute. [Mumbling.] Oh! Oh, it's on my on my shoe. Natalie. Oh Oh! [Yelling Incoherently.] God! Wipe! Ah, wipe! Hey! No! Towel Now I need something bigger! You may be right about him. Sorry. Judge Allen was upstate, duck hunting. You got it? Search warrant. We are duly authorized. ~~ [String Quartet: ""The Wedding March"".] You look so pretty. Your Daddy would be so proud of you. ~~ [Chorus.] [Chuckling.] [Minister.] Beloved friends, we're gathered here today to celebrate the union of Teresa and Jonathan, who metjust three weeks ago No. But true love has found its way. Guy's name was Frank Ruttle. I got a peek at his bank account. He was broke. Living paycheck to paycheck. Huh. Get this: According to his sister, he'd been talking to real estate agents, looking at houses. Thought he was gonna come into some money. Hello! [Laughs.] Hah! I got it! I got it! And do you, Teresa Scott, takeJonathan Davenport to love, honor and cherish, for better or worse, richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part? I do. By the power vested in me by the state of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife. [Sighs.] You may kiss the bride. May I present to you Mr. And Mrs. Jonathan Davenport. Oh, my God. It's her. It's Teresa! She's a black widow. [Peggy.] It's not her. The hair is different. [Natalie.] Mom, she dyed her hair blonde and cut it. It's not her. This is the happiest day of his life. Why are you doing this to your brother? I'm doing this forJonathan. Mom, this explains everything. Why she has no family, why she has no friends. [Peggy.] Her best friend is sick and her parents happen to be dead. Did you read this article? She killed her first husband for his money. She might be planning to do it again. No, no. No, no, no. Cancel, cancel. I don't believe it. Mrs. Davenport, Randy Disher was the investigating officer six years ago. He could identify Teresa. That's why she tried to run him down when he first got here. I'm sorry, but that is simply preposterous. [Clapping, Cheering.] [Screams.] Yea! Yesterday, she called him ""Sergeant Disher."" He was a sergeant when she knew him six years ago. Excuse me, young man. Could you just go? Thank you. We both know what this is about. This is not about Teresa and some stupid photograph that somebody found. This is about you and me. Oh, Mom, please stop Yes! You and me and Mitch, and the fact that you think I treated him badly. Oh, this is ridic And I never put his picture on the piano As if that meant anything. - [Cheering.] - God! I really don't see how you can work for that man, or how you could take anything he says seriously. ~~ [Orchestra.] - May I? - Yes, of course. Should I be insulted? About what? The napkins. Are you afraid to touch me, Mr. Monk? Why would I be afraid of you? I'm not marrying you. [Gasps, Laughs.] It's a beautiful dress. Well, thank you. And it still fits. What do you mean? You wore the same dress in Philadelphia six years ago. At the time, you were using the name Darlene Coolidge. I saw the wedding pictures, the ones that Frank Ruttle took. - Who? - Frank Ruttle. The wedding photographer who made the fatal mistake of recognizing you. Mr. Monk, I'm not who or what you think I am. I am denying it unequivocally. However, if you were right, and I was such a woman, the last thing you'd want to do is get in my way. Are you threatening me? [Chuckling.] Mmm. ~~ [Ends.] - Hi! - How do you plan to do it? ~~ [Swing.] How are you going to kill him? This song's over, Mr. Monk. Excuse me, Mrs. Davenport? They're playing our song. [Laughing.] Come here. [Chuckling.] [Whispering.] I missed you. [No Audible Dialogue.] You broke into her room? Is that legal? You don't need a search warrant to go into a hotel room if it's after checkout. - [Monk.] Is that true? - I don't know. [Monk.] What you got? Red baseball cap. - Ta-da! - Green mud. All right, let's arrest her. No, no, no! Natalie! Natalie. - We can't get her on this. - We have to do something. They're honeymooning in Mexico. They're gonna leave any minute. If Randy can I.D.

Teresa. - [Ringing Continues.] - Just wanted to say a few words. L Well, the truth is, I don't really know either of you very well. But I do know a couple of things about marriage. My wife Trudy used to say that marriage is 90% love and She was married to me, so she was sort of an expert on forgiveness. [Chuckling.] [Laughs.] That was a true story. [Grunting.] Son of a bitch! Forget it! Is there a latch? Forget it, I'm good. You're good? I'm good. Go! Okay. Go, let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! Okay.

No, more of a young fella. An adolescent. - A teenager, really. - Okay. [Stottlemeyer.] Hang on! [Gasping.] Hey, Darlene. Long time, no see. Is this her? Darlene Coolidge! [Panting.] We lost track of you back in Seattle in 2001, but by then, her name was Phyllis Gaffney, and she was already on husband number three. He lasted five and a half weeks. You really must have loved him. - What's he talking about - Okay, don't do anything stupid! I told you we should have eloped. - Hey, ""Dad,"" you have a private jet. - It's a company jet.

We'll wash that again. [Doorbell Rings.] Are you gonna get that? [Chuckles.] Natalie? [Doorbell Rings.] Hello. Mr. Monk There's someone here to see you. She says she's an old friend. SherryJudd? [Can Clatters.] Sherry? Sh She's here? What does she want? I don't know. Who is she? Someone I knew in the eighth grade. Is she here to apologize? I don't know. Well, tell her it's too little too late. No, wait! Uh Tell her about Trudy. Tell her I married Trudy. Tell her Trudy loved me. Tell her how pretty Trudy was. Uh, wait. Tell her Trudy and I went all the way. Mr. Monk, I think she needs your help. With her homework? No. With a case. We're all grown-up now. Oh, yeah. Right. Uh, Sherry? Hello. It's I'm Adrian Monk. Adrian. Oh. You You look great. Um, y-you probably don't even remember me. Is that Trudy? She was beautiful. Um, Natalie told me what happened. I'm I'm so sorry. Thank you. We went all the way. Please. Won't you have a seat? Can I offer you anything? Um, we have bottled water and, uh Pushin' the bottled water. I'm fine, thanks. Um, where to begin? Uh, I've been living in Seattle. Um, we just moved back three years ago. We? My husband and I. - Ah. - Michael. Um, we're recently divorced. Oh! I'm so sorry. No, no, it's it's It's for the best, believe me. So, it's, uh, just been me and my housekeeper, Gladys. That's why I'm here. Sunday night, someone broke in. I guess Gladys woke up. Um, there must have been a fight. And, um, they killed her. Oh Oh, my God. Are you okay? No I wasn't home. Adrian, I'm the only family Gladys had. I just want justice, for her. L I wanna make sure that the best people are working on this. And l-I've been asking around, and everyone says you're a genius. But, of course, I already knew that. Adrian, um, helped me out of a jam when we were kids. - Oh. - About, uh, what? Thirty years ago? April 12, 1972. You remember? I only remember the date. And what everybody wore. And what everybody said, and what everybody did. Here it is. WestoverJunior High, 1972. Natalie, don't don't open that! Natalie, put that back. I command you. [Gasps.] Sherry, you were so cute. Okay, now where is Mr. Monk? Natalie! Just close the book! I mean it. Natalie. Natalie. Okay, that's it. You're fired. [Gasps.] She's fired. No, that couldn't be me. It says ""Adrian Monk."" [Laughs.] Oh! Oh. Oh Adrian! Mom, everyone's watching. Here's your lunch. It's cut into 10 little squares, just the way we like it. And your first aid kit. And your toiletry bag. Mom You'll thank me later. Remember, don't share your food with anyone. Sit near the fire doors. I'll pick you up at 3:04. I'll be wearing an orange blouse. Mom, I know what you look like. I'll be fine. I love you, Mom. What are you doing? Right, sorry. Here he comes. He's like the real-life Eddie Munster. He can hear you. He won't even know what it means. I heard they don't even have a TV. I heard his brother never comes out of the house. I heard they have to memorize the dictionary, one letter per month. I heard that they take four showers a day. [Bell Rings.] [Softly.] Excuse me. Oh. Hi, Sherry. I, uh, wanted to thank you for recommending that rock-and-roll record. It was very groovy. I didn't recommend anything. Yes, you did. You were wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt yesterday, which is the same thing as recommending them. [Clears Throat.] So, uh, I went out, and I bought their record. The, uh, ""Stairway Up To Heaven""? What did you think? Well, you know, I haven't actually listened to it yet. We don't have a record player. I assume it's excellent. I mean, uh, groovy. Yes, you can tell from the cover. They look so groovy. Well, I gotta go. You always turn your lock back to zero. I noticed that. I do that too. So later it's easier to open. Uh-huh. Actually, there are a lot of things we have in common. ""Things Adrian Monk and SherryJudd have in common."" You made a list? ""One, our lockers are right next to each other. Two, we both like The Patty Duke Show."" Even though she has to be lying, because they're supposed to be identical cousins, which is biologically impossible. ""Three, perfect attendance records."" And, uh, four [Exhales.] ""Neither of us has a date to the Spring Fling."" How do you know that? I happened to catch a glimpse of your weekly planner, and I noticed that you have a babysitting job lined up for that evening. Unless I'm wrong, which, you know, I'm not. Hey, Sher. Hey, Jimmy. Hey, I'm goin' to art class. You wanna be my model? Yeah. Cool. Good-bye, Adrian. Bye. Yes, I will help you. What was he like as a kid? Uh, pretty much the same. Careful. Smart. Sad. L I don't think people change really. At least, I've never seen it. I waited 10 years for my husband to change. Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk. Let's Let's come over here. Strange. Fingerprints but no palm prints. There were two of them. Housekeeper surprised them. There was a struggle. She pushes the alarm, she hits her head and falls here. This painting Is it valuable? Not really, except to me. It's my great-grandmother. Why would someone do something like that? Did you have spray paint in the house? No. So they must've brought it with them. Thank you. This is the housekeeper's blood. So, they defaced the painting after they killed her, after the alarm sounded. They risked everything, they risked life in prison to deface your great-grandmother? I think that's why they were here to do this. To draw glasses and a mustache? And a little goatee. She was your great-grandmother? Tell me about her. Well, I never met her. She was a famous suffragette. Went to jail for the right to vote. Maybe they were making a statement. You know, like a political thing. You mean, they broke into the house, and they beat a woman to death, then defaced the painting because they had trouble with the 19th Amendment? Yes. I mean, no. It's a mystery. Okay. It's my house. Sherry. Michael? How did How did you get in? It's still my house, Sherry. At least, uh, technically. That is not true. You can't just come over, Michael. It's It's in the agreement. It was on the news. I had to come! I'm sorry about Gladys. L l I really am. Are you okay? Were you here? I was in San Diego, visiting my sister. Ah, that's right. I knew that. Um, Captain Stottlemeyer, this is my ex-husband, Michael Norfleet. Yes. We've already spoken to Mr. Norfleet. Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. Monk? From junior high? That's right. Sherry told me all about you. About how you never took a single gym class. I had a note. [Chuckles.] Oh, my God! They did that too? Animals. Did Did they take anything? Michael, please, just leave. Sir, she asked you to leave. Yes, okay, I'm going. But before I do Figured I'd save myself a stamp. Here ya go. Your monthly pound of flesh. Mail it next time. I'll pay for the stamp. Yeah, well, good luck on this. See ya around. Thank you. How much do we have? [Coins Rattling.] $18.25. [Chuckles.] How do you do that? I don't know. [Chuckles.] It's kind of funny raising money for a dance that neither of us is going to. Uh, Leo, here's the thing You gotta pay for that. Mmm. Pay for what? Where's your evidence, Columbo? Leo, I'm telling Principal Thicket. I'm not kidding. You don't wanna do that, Sherry. You'll be sorry. I mean it. Are you gonna pay us or not? Hmm. [Gasps.] [Laughing.] Leo, I'm telling. I'm serious. Here. It's okay. It's only chocolate. Here. Thanks. You should carry these with you. Now, that's a list of people that have worked at her house over the past year. Do you recognize anybody? No. Neither do we. Monk, Natalie and Sherry are downstairs waitin' for ya. Oh, yeah. They're taking the painting to the museum. A guy named James Duffy works there as a restoration expert. What, you're going with? Yeah. Well, keep your eyes open. What? What do you mean? It's just that your friend SherryJudd just got a homeowner's policy worth a million dollars two weeks ago. That's pretty convenient, isn't it? Well, that's ridiculous. Y-You think she did it herself for the insurance? No, no. She was in San Diego like she said, but she could've hired somebody. No! No? Well, she doesn't need the money. I got a look at that alimony check. She's getting 20 grand a month. That's a lot of dough. Thank you. But, Monk, you and I have put enough rich people in jail to know that a lot of dough is never enough. They always want more. Not Sherry. You don't know her. What? It's just that I haven't heard you talk about a woman like this for a long time. [Sherry.] How did you get all that chocolate out? My mom makes me keep a backup shirt in my locker. [Exhales.] Listen, Sherry. [Clears Throat.] I, uh I really like you Hey, Judd. Here. Let me help. What are you doing? Mr. Thicket said I have to act more like a gentleman. He said that just before he gave me two weeks' detention. Thanks for ratting me out. Well, you know, Leo, you were stealing from the decorating committee. Man. Which means that you were really stealing from everybody. Relax, Charlie Brown. I learned a lesson. I'll never steal again. For example, I'll never do this. Uh, hey, Leo, that's mine. Would you please give it back? And I would never, ever dip this into the toilet. Please, not the toilet. Not the toilet. Come on, Leo. Be cool, man. This is none of your business, Jimmy. I'm just sayin' there's already enough bad vibes in the world. We don't have to add to it. Come on. Give it back. What would MickJagger do? He'd give it back, wouldn't he? Here. This isn't over. So, what's the name of that dance? The Spring Fling. It sounds stupid, but if you wanna go, I'll go. Yeah. That'd be cool. [Bell Rings.] Are you okay? Oh, I'm fine. Are you sure? Because I could get Natalie to carry it. Hello. We have an appointment with, um, James Duffy, Art Restoration? Sure. He'll meet you in the main gallery. Thank you. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, can I give you some advice? Yeah. And I'm only saying this to you as a friend. As someone who's dated. A lot. What? Some wine spilled. Where? Over there. It's a painting. It's driving me a little crazy. Then don't look at it. Okay, it's about Sherry. I've been watching you, and l I can't not look. Maybe they could fix it. This guy we're seeing restores art, right? Mr. Monk Maybe he could just paint over it. - Turn that a little - Forget about the painting! I think you should ask her out. Take her to dinner. Sherry? No. No, I can't. Yes, you can. I know you want to. I do? Yes, you want to. Trust me on this. What about Trudy? I'm a married man. Oh, Mr. Monk, it's not really a date. You're old friends, right? You're just catching up. Mr. Monk, she likes you. No. There's no way. Why not? She knows me. Just think about this for one second. There are over 200 private detectives in this city. But she came to you, didn't she? She likes you. I'm not gonna ask you again, Miss Judd. I want you to open that locker. This is crazy! Principal Thicket, I didn't take anything. Open the locker. - What's going on? - Somebody stole the bake sale money. Mr. Thicket got an anonymous note. Whoever wrote it said they saw the money in Sherry's locker. That's impossible. [Murmuring.] L That's not mine. That's not mine. How did that get in there? Where's the money, Sherry? I don't know. I swear. I didn't take it. Well, how did this get in there? Does anyone else know your combination? No. Let's go. To my office. I think we need to talk to your parents. Back to class. Everybody, back to class! I love this one. Look at their faces. I wonder what they're thinking. She's planning to murder him. What? She's about to feed him amanita mushrooms. You can tell by the little white spots. It's a deadly poison. Well, maybe she doesn't know. Oh, she knows. He's been hitting her. She's swollen. See the bruises on her arms and her left eye? She knows what she's doing. Must be hard to be you, to see everything. It's awful. [Mouths Words.] Sherry Mm-hmm? I was wondering Later, uh, when we're done here, if you're not too busy, maybe, um, we could You know Hello. James Duffy. Hi. My assistant, uh, told me you have a canvas that you need me to Sherry? Yes? [Chuckles.] It's Jimmy Wagner. Jimmy? Yeah. Oh, my God! I don't believe this. Adrian, can you believe it? It's Jimmy Wagner! You still wear a flower in your hair. You look great. Oh, no, you look great. You look great. They both look great. Oh. Oh, do you remember Adrian Monk? Yes, of course, Adrian. Supersleuth. I read about you all the time. Jimmy! Yeah. Oh, and Natalie Teeger. They're, uh Hi. They're helping me out. I've just had a terrible week. Somebody broke into my house, my housekeeper was killed. I heard about that. I am so sorry. - I didn't realize that was you. - Oh, well, it's confusing. Sometimes I'm Sherry Norfleet. I was divorced in April. Oh. Well, how about you? Divorced. You know, a lot of that goin' around. Oh, and you changed your name? My mother remarried when I was 15. Oh! You You really look great. So, I guess I should take a look at the patient? Oh. It's over here. Oh. You've come a long way from tie-dyeing T-shirts. Oh, I still do that on the weekends too. Don't tell anybody. I remember this painting. It was in your parents' dining room. - Yeah, that's right. - Excuse me, Jimmy. Jim. Jim. Uh, is there anything peculiar about that spray paint? Uh, I'll have to run some tests. But it feels like an oil-based spray enamel. You can get it at any hardware store. So, uh, what do you think, Doc? Is she gonna make it? She'll be fine. I'll take good care of her. Sherry, are you busy? Yeah, I would I would love to show you my studio. It's just around the corner. L I'd love that. [Laughs.] That sounds like fun. You look great. ~~ [Slow Rock.] Sherry was here. Cash box was here. Leo comes in. ""Put that cupcake down."" [Girl Laughing.] ~~ [Man Singing.] Adrian Monk, is that you? [Exhales.] You're not allowed in here until after the dance. Oh, I'm not here for the dance. I'm trying to figure out who stole the money from the bake sale. They said it was that girl. The honor student, SherryJudd. Oh. I made these for the after-party. Here. Tell me what ya think. [Groans.] Here. Here, take this one. It has 10 chocolate chips. Exactly You're an excellent cook, Mrs. Ledskey. It's a gift and a curse. Here, I'll send some more of these home with you. For you and your brother. I've got some boxes left over from the bake sale. Blue icing. What is it? It's a clue. Oh. I'm so sorry, Mr. Monk. No. I'm happy for her. They seem like a great couple. Well, they're not a couple yet. They will be. She's gonna go out with him. How do you know? Oh, I noticed little things. Like the way she said, ""Yes, I will go out with you,"" as she wrote her phone number on his hand and didn't let go of his hand for 27 seconds. [Motorcycle Starts.] Natalie. Look at his gloves. - Yeah, so? - No fingers. You remember the handprint on Sherry's wall? They were bikers? They were bikers. Captain. You know that list of all the people who worked at SherryJudd's house in the last year? Yeah. Cross-checked it against registered motorcycle owners. We got two hits. Well, good. Let's take one, give one to Monk. Yes, sir, which one? Doesn't matter. Oh. Just pick one. One potato, two potato, three potato, four. Five potato, six potato, seven potato, more. Randy. A woman is dead. Yes, sir. My mother told me to pick the ~~ [Jukebox: Rock.] Hey. [Whistles.] You okay? You look uncomfortable. Why don't we leave? No, Mr. Monk. I'm fine. Okay. But, uh, if you get uncomfortable, you let me know, and we just leave. Okay. But w-w-wait. Or if you feel like you're about to get uncomfortable Mr. Monk, why don't we call the captain? Just let him handle this. No. No, no. We can do this. Who are you trying to impress? Nobody. Sherry. No. Natalie, I'm a private detective. This is what I do. I don't care what SherryJudd thinks of me. She's just a girl who sat behind me in homeroom. Hey. You alone? No. I'm with him. So you're alone. You know what, buddy? You don't wanna do this. Just back off. [Chuckles.] [Chuckles.] Hey. How ya doin'? We're lookin' for Travis and George Baptiste. Never heard of'em. Okay, let's go. That's funny. 'Cause we heard they're in here all the time. [Coughs.] [Coughing.] Waiter, he's He's Excuse me. Sir, there's no smoking. It's okay. He can smoke. [Coughs.] [Coughing.] New rule. No spazzes in the bathroom. Okay, if I see any spazzes, I'll tell them. You're a regular Flip Wilson, ya know that? Where's the money, Leo? What are you talkin' about, Monk? Monk the punk? [Chuckles.] You took the money from the bake sale. You put it in a cake box so nobody would see you leaving with it. Hey. They found the empty cash box, remember? It was in your girlfriend's locker. Which was locked. - You framed her. - How? Tell me. She's the only one who knows the combination. I don't know how, but you did it. - You're the guy. - I'm the guy. I'm the guy who's about to stuff you in your own locker and lock the door. [Clears Throat.] You, uh, lookin' for us? Travis Baptiste? Yeah, I'm Travis. This is George. Your neighbors said we might find you here. You guys did some roofing work for Michael Norfleet last year? Yeah, that's right. I wonder why you're asking. I wonder if you wonder. Where were you Sunday night, Travis? - You a cop? - Are you the killer? Whoa, whoa. [Crowd Murmuring.] [Man.] Hit him! - Damn it! - Time out. Time out. Let me get that. - Mr. Monk, get back! - Broken glass. Get back! Get back! Get down. Get down. [Siren Wailing.] [Man.] Guys, guys, guys! It's the cops. [Man #2.] Come on! Let's go! Drop it! Everyone on the floor now! Officer. Officer. Officer, I'm Adrian Monk. I want you to put out an A.P. B on two homicide suspects thatjust ran outta here. Names are Travis Baptiste and his brother George. Got it? Yeah. Mr. Monk, look. He left his wallet. That's Sherry's house. Enter here. Somebody must've hired them. What? Why are you making that face? Why are you smiling? Stop it! [Children Gasp.] Kid, you all right? Huh? Adrian, are you okay? He'll be scarred for life, psychologically. Nah, he'll get over it. What did he say? He said he solved the case. He knows how Leo did it. Mike Norfleet. Captain Stottlemeyer wants to see me. [Chuckles.] Yeah, I know. I gotta go. Whatever it is, I didn't do it. Sherry? Captain? What's going on? Oh, good! Ah, you fixed it. It's as good as new. Sir, sir. Please don't touch that. That's evidence. W Evidence of what? Mr. Norfleet, you're under arrest for the murder of Gladys Aquino, your wife's housekeeper. Son, this'll be a lot easier on everyone if you just confess. I know you took the money. That's crazy. It was in her locker. Nobody else could've opened it. The cash box was in her locker because you put it there. And I know how you did it. Here's what happened. You hired two men, Travis Baptiste and his brother, to break in to Sherry's house. - Ridiculous. - We found this in Travis's wallet. Anyone could've written that. It's true. The letters are printed. There's nothing special about them. But look at the house number. Look at the zero. There's a little line through it. I noticed something yesterday when you were stuffing me into my locker, which, by the way, wasn't very cool. My lock was set to zero. I remembered that Sherry always set her lock to zero as well. But the day before, when Principal Thicket found the cash box, her lock was not set to zero. This was all about the zeros. You don't see a zero written like this very often, but I saw four of them. The day before, when you were writing Sherry's alimony check. I've seen other people write zeros like that. True, but how many of them also know the floor plan to your wife's house? Here's what happened. When you pretended to help her with her books, you pocketed her lock and replaced it with yours. It was a perfect plan. You took out the money. Then, when nobody was watching, you came back and planted the cash box. Then you put her lock back on the locker. Why would I hire somebody to break into her house? - There's nothing in there that I want. - [Monk.] Ah, yes. The motive. I knew it had something to do with this painting, but I just couldn't figure out what. Then, I remembered how you resented paying all that alimony. I believe you called it ""your monthly pound of flesh."" Her alimony? You'd be paying her alimony forever, unless she got remarried. This wasn't about stealing anything, or hurting anybody. This was about them. You were fixing them up. He knew aboutJimmy. I talked about him all the time. You tracked him down. And you got lucky. He was single and still living right here in the city. [Monk.] But you had a problem. How were you gonna get them together? You couldn't just call her. You and Sherry were barely speaking. And she would have resented any suggestion you made. So you played Cupid. You hired Travis and his brother to break in to her house and to deface the painting, a painting she loved one you knew she would want restored. You were betting that eventually she'd bring it toJames. He is the best art restorer in the city. They would discover that they still had feelings for each other. And you were right. Nice story. You can't prove any of it. You can't prove any of this! Are you gonna believe Adrian Monk? He's a freak. Ask anybody. Let's empty out all your pockets. Come on. That's my money. Travis and George werejust picked up this morning in Las Vegas. They will be here tomorrow. And these boys are gonna talk. I could promise you that. Their fingerprints were all over that room. This money's from the bake sale. That's my handwriting. I wrote ""good luck"" next to ""Honest Abe"" Lincoln. Why don't you and I have a little talk in my office? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Nobody was supposed to get hurt. What was Gladys doing there? It was supposed to be her day off. Lieutenant Disher, book him. The crazy thing is, it worked. Congratulations, darling. Thank you. You're amazing. You're still amazing. Adrian. Bye."

You looking forward to our little party? Uh, I guess so. How late do these things usually go? Last year, Karen and I left at about 2:30 a.m., and Terry Detective Chasen was still standing on a table in his boxer shorts singing ""Help Me, Rhonda"" in Spanish. - That's a lie. I don't speak Spanish. - Oh, yes, you do. Oh, and, uh, this came for you. Someone dropped it off at the front desk. ""Captain Leland Stottlemeyer."" ""Captain Stottlemeyer, thank you for your business. Eastwood Auto Supply."" You know what this is, Alice? This is a bribe. Somebody is trying to influence public policy, and I think it might work. ~~ [Guitar.] ~~ [Continues.] Hey, uh, I was just, uh, tuning it up for you. Nice guitar. It's Karen's. You, uh, gonna play tonight? We'll see how it goes. You know, I could run home and grab my Gibson, and we could jam. I used to have a rock band back in high school. The Randy Disher Project. That's a good name. How'd you come up with that? Oh, well, my name's Randy Disher, and then Project. You know, Randy, I don't really jam. I'm more of an old folkie kind of guy. That's cool. That's cool too. I mean, I can just sing harmony. Good. Ooh, hey, what'd you get? Oh, this is, uh, from the body shop down the street. Oh, hell, it's port. I hate port. I love port. Uh, you know, I think I'll bring it home for Karen. Oh, does she like port? It's kind of an acquired taste. I like port. A lot of people don't. Randy, I'm taking it home. [Natalie.] Mr. Monk, it's - How is your side looking? - So far, my side is perfect. - What's wrong? - Is it beautiful? Is what beautiful? Snow. You've never seen snow? Oh, it's very beautiful. No two flakes are the same. But somehow, it's still beautiful. Mr. Monk, come on! We gotta go! Where's your present? It's in the, uh, hallway. Sweetie, are you sure you're okay with Mr. Monk being here? Yeah, it's okay, Mom. That's what Christmas is all about, right? Helping people. Yes. Who's that for? Oh, this one is from Trudy. It's for me. From Trudy? Yeah. After she died, I found it. Every Christmas, I put it under the tree. You never open it? Nope. What's that one? This is for Captain Stottlemeyer. I picked his name. Everybody picked a name out of a hat. Whoever you got, you're their Secret Santa, and you have to buy them a present. - What'd you get him? - All I can tell you is that he's gonna love it. It's gonna be a great party. I'm not completely dreading it. That's the spirit! Okay, lock up. [Kisses.] Have a good night. Don't wait up. [Door Closes.] [Chattering.] ~~ [Instrumental Christmas Carol.] Hey! Hey. Oh, nice sweater. Thanks. It's a gift from my Aunt Kay in Boston. She knitted it herself. Wow. Mm-hmm. Yeah, she said it took her months. I'm her favorite nephew. I'm sure you are. I'll be right back, okay? Hey! Merry Christmas. You two cousins? Where'd you get that? Wal-Mart. Fifteen bucks. Aunt Kay probably went to Wal-Mart and saw that sweater and went home and knitted me the same one. That sweater inspired this one. You can still see where she tore the tag off. It's the thought that counts. ~~ [Continues.] Alice. Hello, Adrian. Merry Christmas. I haven't seen you around lately. L-l-I don't go out much during the holidays. It's so depressing, because I'm alone. I don't have to tell you. I mean, you're not married, right? You don't have anyone. That's true. It's tough, especially for people our age. ~~ [Guitar.] ~ O holy night The stars are brightly shining ~ ~ It is the night of our dear savior's birth ~ ~ Long lay the world in sin and sorrow pining ~ ~ Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth ~ ~ The thrill ofhope the weary world rejoices ~ ~ For lon yonder breaks A new and glorious morn ~ [Both.] ~ Fall on your knees ~ ~ O hear the angel voices ~ ~ O night divine ~ ~ O night when Christ was born ~ ~ O night, O ni-i-ight ~ ~ O holy night ~~ That was good. Thank you. [Cheering.] Thank you. Okay, excuse me, everybody. It's almost midnight. So it's time for all you Secret Santas to go get your presents. Captain. Hey. Well, merry Christmas. Oh, you got me. It's a It's an air purifier. For your house. Are you saying my house smells? Not your house. But houses like yours sometimes get a, um, odor that's, uh, you know, sour or-or-or very unpleasant kind of stench of Not your house. Thank you. Thank you, Monk. All right? [Mutters, Chuckles.] Merry Christmas. Thank you. Merry Christmas to you. Do you, um, know what eBay is? EBay? No. Good. I'm your Secret Santa. Oh. Alice, thank you. Oh. Merry Christmas. Uh Oh, it's a funny card. Yes, it is. You can tell because of the exclamation points. - Well - What'd you get? Oh. Oh, my God. Alice [Laughing.] This I love. Good. [Mutters.] Geez! Are you okay? The present that I bought for Terry, do you know what happened to it? No. What was it? A little, uh, hair-trimmer thing. It was this big. I wrapped it myself. Did you check your briefcase? Well, yeah. Why don't you give him one of these toys from your desk? No, he's been in this office a million times. He'll know I recycled it. But what about Does he like port? I think so. [Chattering Continues.] Merry Christmas, my friend. You like port? Oh, I love it. Excellent! All right. Hey! Thanks, Captain. Good deal. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. [Man.] Merry Christmas. [Groaning.] Terry? Terry! [Gasping.] Oh! Terry! Terry! Hey. Hey, hey! Buddy! Terry! Terry! Hey! Hey, call an ambulance! John! John, call it in! - [People Chattering.] - What happened? What'd he say? It's still preliminary. What did he say, Randy? Poison. Some kind of strychnine. Simple and effective. - Anybody could have made it. - Couldn't he have tasted it? - Port's a pretty heavy drink, isn't it? - It's really strong. He wouldn't taste it in that. Captain, they need the body. Yeah. This was meant for me. There but for the grace of God. This was meant for me. ""The grace of God."" Captain, I'm really so sorry. He was only 38 years old, right? Was he married? No, I think they were separated. No. They're back together. I just talked toJenny. They got two little girls. Twins. Is this the card that came with the bottle? Yeah. Nobody saw who delivered it? It was sitting at the front desk. Anybody could have dropped it off there. I'm so sorry. It was my idea for the gift exchange, the Secret Santa. - Alice, you can't blame yourself. He owns the body shop. He says they never send gifts or liquor. He offered to come down and take a poly, but it feels like a dead end. Whoever sent it knew you did business with them. That narrows it down, right? Mmm. Exclusive parts supplier for the S.F.P.D. It's on all their ads. Anybody could have seen it. Okay, let's get to it. I've, uh, narrowed it down to five possible suspects. People who may have had a grudge, people you arrested - It was Frank Prager. - Yes, sir. Frank's on the list. He's number one. Who's Prager? Ayear ago, the captain shot and killed a bank robber named Mike Prager. Frank's his brother. A few months ago, he tried to settle the score. He came at me in a parking lot. He got off five rounds, and he missed. - He got away. - Disappeared. And it looks like he missed again. - All right. Why don't we each take a name? - Lieutenant, you're wasting your time. I'm telling you, it's Frank Prager. All right. How about this? How about we split up into two teams? Your team gets Prager. My team will take the rest of the list. Okay. Hmm. Let's see. What are you doing? I'm picking my team. I'll take, uh I'll take Monk. No, I'll take Monk. Okay, uh, I'll take Natalie. Oh, I can't. Julie's waiting for me at home. Fine. Um, I'll take, uh You'll take Robbins. Meet us back here at noon. I'll take Robbins. Let's go. Four months ago It was a Tuesday night. I came out of the bar, 2:00 a.m. They took my keys, so I'm walking home. I was alone. I was pretty toasted. And that streetlight was on, 'cause I could still see. And he was waiting. He was by There was a big, black van here. He was waiting behind it. Uh, must have been here all night. He steps out. I'm standing right about where you are now. I knew who it was right away. It was Frank Prager, and he wanted me dead. I could see it in his eyes. He aims a Glock 17 at my head, caps off five rounds, and then Then he disappeared. Until last night. He was only 12 feet away with a streetlight behind him. It's not a hard shot. You said he was a veteran, special ops? Yeah. Maybe he was as toasted as me. Or maybe it was a miracle. Maybe it was. And they just left the bullet holes there. Well, it's probably good for business at this place. It adds to the mystique. But this pattern does not look random. Two, one, two. He had a Glock 17. He could have fired 20 rounds. He only squeezed off five? Two, one, two. Monk, it doesn't matter. He's given up on guns. The guy's graduated to strychnine. It's a different M.O. He's special ops, remember? Those guys know a hundred different ways to kill somebody. Look, Prager wants me dead. I'm the guy that shot his brother. He's married, right, with a daughter? Yeah. Cute kid, seven years old. Is he in touch with them? Well, we staked out the house for a couple of weeks, but he never called or showed his face. Well, let's check it out. Maybe he's home for Christmas. Monk, l-l-I can't go near the place. The, uh, wife filed a complaint against me, said that I had been harassing her. Why would she say that? Uh, probably because I've been harassing her. What? She's never seen you. [Sighs.] God, how much longer? Natalie, this is a stakeout. You never know how long. That's what makes a stakeout so much fun. Oh, you wanna play 20 questions? Sure. Okay. All right. You can go first. You have to think of somebody, anybody, living or dead. Okay, I've got it. Uh Is it Trudy? Trudy who? Trudy Monk. Your wife! Yes. Thank you. That was fun. So, Mr. Monk, what do you want for Christmas? A miracle. Yeah? I could use one of those. Julie hates it here because it never snows. She's been praying for this white Christmas. It hasn't snowed in San Francisco in nine years. The last time it snowed was the day Trudy died. Hmm. Oh, my God! I can't stand it. Let's just go up there and knock on the door. And say what? [Both.] ~ Silent night, holy night ~ ~ All is calm, all is bright ~ ~ Round yon virgin mother and child ~ It's dripping. It's supposed to drip. ~ Holy infant so tender and mild ~ ~ Sleep in heavenly peace ~ ~ Sleep in heavenly~~ Ow! [Sighs.] Merry Christmas. We get carolers all the time. Usually there's a whole group.

They just Yeah, they just left. - What What happened? - Creative differences. They really weren't comfortable with religious material. Just wanted to do a whole, whole different thing. Like a Vegas style. Just glittery We were not Not into it. But we wish them well. Yeah. Can I use your bathroom? Show business is a Yeah. Sure. Come on in. - Are you Dori? - How did you know? Um, well, your daddy told me. - Do you know my daddy? - In a way. Yeah, I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is? - Shh. It's a secret. - It's a secret? Okay, I won't tell anybody. [Mother.] What are you doing? Um, I was Are you a cop? - Okay, look, here's the thing - Go to your room. I want you out. Just get out of my house. Haven't you people done enough to this family? That went well. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Do we have a plan? Well, no. I need to talk to the little girl again, just for a minute. She knows something. I'm telling you. Who are all these people? These folks have forgotten the true meaning of Christmas. Yeah, which is what? Which is leaving me alone. Well, I love it. I love everything about it. The crowds, the shopping, the decorations. And the fact that it's horrible doesn't bother you? Oh, my gosh! I can't believe he's still here. Who's here? Mr. Preston. I used to work here. Wait a minute. How many jobs have you had? It was just after high school. It was a summer thing. I worked at the information booth, but only lasted for three weeks. What happened? Oh, Mr. Preston liked me a lot. A little too much. Well, I've never had that problem. Ooh. [Laughs.] I'll be right back. Where are you going? - I'm gonna go find Mr. Preston. He owes me a favor. - What kind of favor? Who's waiting to see Santa Claus? [Children Cheering.] Well, you're in luck, because guess who just landed straight from the North Pole? [Together.] Santa Claus! [Children Cheering, Applauding.] [Cheering Continues.] [Children.] Santa! [Boy.] Hi, Santa. How are you today? [Camera Shutters Clicking.] - Ho, ho, ho. - [Children Cheering.] [Cheering Continues.] Shh! Okay, everybody, listen up, okay? We have some new rules here in Santa's workshop. Before anybody can sit on Santa's lap, you have to use these magic wipes and wipe your hands. Yeah! Wiping is fun! And no touching Santa's face. And try not to breathe on Santa. Remember, Santa isn't always jolly. Sometimes Santa's a little bit sad. Okay? Who's first? No, no, no. Just stand stand over there. Have you been a good boy? Have you? He's got to sit on your lap. You're Santa Claus. I don't think so. He has to sit on your lap. Here, jump up. No, no, no. Okay, th-th-that's too close. Yep! Get up! All right. On the knee then. The knee there. A little further. Just a little further there. That's good. Now he's squirming. Santa doesn't like the squirmers. He's a kid. I love you, Santa. What is she What's she doing? - She wants a kiss. - Uh, no. No, no, sorry. No good. No, that's You're done. [Coughing.] Okay, that's it. You're done. Wait. But I made a list. Yeah, good. Mail it to me, okay? You're done. All I want for Christmas is a rock-polishing kit. A rock-polishing kit? You're Santa's favorite. What's your name? Trudy. Are you okay? [Sobs.] It's just that my wife's name was Trudy. She was killed by a car bomb. It was under the passenger's seat. The The whole car exploded, and [Sobbing, Muttering.] Okay, you're done. You're done. Ho, ho, ho. Just go. And what's your name? Dori. Dori. That's a pretty name. I bet I know what you want for Christmas. You want your daddy to come home. And I wanna help you, but I have a problem. I just can't find him. Do you know where he is? In a church. He lives in a church? With the three ladies out front. Three ladies. Daddy! That's him. It's Prager. - Natalie! - Frank, they're cops! Oh! Whoa! Clear. Monk was right. He's in there. Three ladies out front. That's all we needed. Yes, sir. He's been living in there since September in a room in the basement. He's going by the name Brad Elliot. I don't give a rat's ass what he calls himself. Let's go get him. Cover the back. Tell the snipers we're going in on my signal. Wait, wait, wait, wait. There's a nun in there. She won't leave. A nun? Sounded nice. I mean, she had a a""nunny"" quality. [Stammers.] What does she want, Randy? She just wants to talk to you. She's afraid you're gonna rough him up. Aw S-Stand down. All right. Stand down. No, no. Stay put. Hold your positions. Stand down. Hold your positions. Captain Stottlemeyer? I'm Sister Heather. Yeah? Hi, Sister. Uh, you know why I'm here, right? Yes. He's here. He's in the sanctuary. He's very frightened. You think he tried to murder you? Yes, ma'am, I do. You obviously have very strong feelings about this. You're god Yes, I do. I just wanna make sure that Brad isn't mistreated. Brad's not his name. You're right. I don't know his real name, but I know the man. He's been working in our outreach program. He's been feeding the hungry and the homeless every night. When they're too tired to come here, he brings the food to them. Maybe he has a guilty conscience. Well, any conscience at all is a rare thing these days. What do you want, Captain? I want justice. Well, he's afraid that you want something else. He's afraid you and the other policemen want Revenge. My father once taught me an important lesson. There is no revenge so complete as forgiveness. Your father. He's your father too. Okay, look, I promise you that I will not hurt him. Okay. Frank, there is a clinic next to the church. They have drugs. They have chemicals. Did you have access to the storage room? Um, I mean, I didn't have a key or anything, but it would have been easy enough to break in. I didn't poison anybody. I'm not a killer. Oh, right. What about our last date in the parking lot four months ago? I wasn't trying to kill you. You can't be serious. All right. I thought about it. When I got there, I couldn't. I didn't wanna become my brother. At the last minute, I decided to send you a message. A message. Oh, my God. Captain, the pattern was an ""M."" ""M""for Michael. Yeah, it was an ""M."" How could you miss it? Oh, well, how was I supposed to know that was the letter ""M""? This guy's the best detective in the free world. He didn't know that was an ""M."" What, you couldn't use a spray can like everybody else? Oh, for God's sake. A message. I just wanted you to think about what you did! Michael was a good kid who got screwed up. Wait. You think I don't think about your brother? I think about your brother every damn day of my life. It was him or me, and it still eats me up. I don't need an ""M"" on a wall to remember something like that. No cop does. Get him outta here. [Man.] Let's go. [Sighs.] God, Captain, you gotta read this. This is from the journal he kept while he was in that church. He feels terrible about what he did. Look at this one part. It made me cry. He can't see it. Yeah No, I know, Natalie. He's not the guy, all right? Okay, moving on. Lieutenant, you said there were four other suspects who might have had a motive. Actually, we struck out. One's deceased, one's in the hospital, and, uh, two are back in prison. Okay, so it wasn't Frank Prager. It's nobody on your list. - Who sent me that bottle of wine? - And will they try again? - To kill you, I mean. - I know what you mean, Lieutenant. Mmm. Mom. What? [Laughing.] No, look. See? It looks good. [Laughing.] Okay. And you need one too. Oh, okay. I'll set it right there. Okay, okay. And this [Laughs.] Is from Mr. Monk. You didn't have to get me anything. But thanks. Don't tear Mmm. [Mutters.] - A first-aid kit. - That is the hot gift this year. It's the Cadillac of first-aid kits. I'm talking about 100 feet of gauze, five different ointments and a tourniquet. Now, that tourniquet That's great. We're gonna look at that later. Because this is from both of us. Careful, though. It's fragile. Oh. Oh, no. Oh. It's alive. It's a living thing. Is it gonna die? Well, not for a long, long, long time. - But it will die eventually. - It's a friend! A friend who'll die. It's a little friend to keep you company. A dying friend. Look. Look at it. It's just twitching. It's turning left, then it swims right. It's zigzagging! Can't we train it? Yeah, we can train it to swim clockwise. - And I can show you how to feed this. Oh. - Oh. Okay, wait. Stay there. It's okay. I'll get it. With my new broom. Just wait. [Laughing.] Okay, let's see it. [Chattering.] Oh! That's adorable. [Chattering Continues.] Think it'll fit you? I think it will. [Knocking.] Captain. [Stottlemeyer.] Merry Christmas, Alice. May we come in? [Alice.] So what's going on? Uh, Monk thinks that he knows who tried to kill me, uh, during the Christmas party. I thought it was Frank Prager. No, it wasn't Prager. - In fact, it wasn't anybody. - Nobody tried to kill the captain. That was a trick to throw us off track. Terry Chasen was the target from the beginning. Alice, we know you and Terry were involved. We've got phone records, credit cards. You were together for about six months. Seven. - Seven months. - Was it because he went back to his wife? That's why you killed him? Alice, we know how you did it. The Christmas gift exchange was your idea. It was easy to make sure that the captain picked Terry's name. [Stottlemeyer.] Yeah, I remember. I was the last one to choose, and there was one name left. [Monk.] The day of the party, you brought a poisoned bottle into the office. You dropped it off at the front desk. It was addressed to Captain Stottlemeyer. [Stottlemeyer.] And you know I don't drink port. [Monk.] And at some point, probably during the party, you snuck into the captain's office, and you stole the gift that he had brought in for Terry. [Natalie.] When the captain couldn't find it, you suggested replacing it with the bottle. The poisoned bottle. [Monk.] It was like a magician doing a sleight ofhand. You had everybody looking the wrong way. It was brilliant. [Timer Ringing.] Excuse me. Alice. Alice, where is the poison? You know, if you threw it away, we'll find traces of it. You know that. It's in the basement. How did you know? Natalie. This is the card and the envelope that came with the whisk broom. Which, by the way, I've been using. It really is fantastic. But the card is a little too big. See? You had to fold it over. This card came with the poisoned bottle. It's too small. - Alice, you mixed them up. - I mixed them up. And I'm usually so organized. I couldn't. I just couldn't live without him. [Sighs.] I got him. Thanks. I talked to the D.A. She's gonna offer you a deal. Eight months, plus time served on the assault. Think about it. And you can decide when you get back. Where am I going? You are released on your own recognizance for two days. Now, I am responsible for you, so don't make me regret it. Go home. ~~ [Man Singing Christmas Carol.] Aren't you curious? No. I love not knowing. Oh, my God! Come on! [Laughing.] Julie, sweetie, what is it? [Screams, Laughs.] It's a white Christmas! It's your white Christmas! Yeah! I'm gonna go get my camera. [Yells.] I'm gonna get my coat! You okay? Merry Christmas, Mr. Monk. [Chuckling.] ~~ [Continues.] ~~ [Ends.]"
"How are you today? Do you see anything you like? Uh, is Dennis here? He usually takes care of me. Oh, no, I'm afraid Dennis quit. He quit? Yeah, apparently he had one regular customer that was driving him crazy. Now we're gonna be up all night wondering who that was. Can I help you? [Inhales.] Dennis quit. Yes, we are looking for another shirt just like this. Y-You want the same shirt? Identical, yeah. Same color, same pattern. Okay, but you already have one of those, so, um, maybe it's time to try a little variety [Natalie Clears Throat.] Because Or maybe not. Okay, um, uh, yeah. Here you go. [Sighs.] No, yeah, this, uh, this was inspected by Number 6. I'm not a big fan of Number 6. Do you have any that are inspected by Number 8? [Chuckles.] You're kidding, right? You're You're not kidding. Okay, um, the customer's always right. [Whispering.] At least until today. Um, Number 5, Number Inspected by Number Is Is there really a difference? Are you kidding?

There's a tear, right there. [Sighs.] And look at this. This sleeve is all wrong. It's completely crooked. Well, maybe she had a bad day. No, that's not possible. I know Inspector Number 8. She never lets anything get past her. Mr. Monk, are you okay? Natalie, something's wrong. What? Something is very wrong with Inspector Number 8. Dennis? Dennis!

Now, you came home and you found your husband on the floor about an hour ago. Yes. And he'd been stabbed. - Yes. - It's not funny. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's not funny. Inspector Number 8 was very important to me because no matter how bad things got, I knew I could always count on her. Mr. Monk, you understand you're talking about someone you have never even met who works in a factory somewhere who inspects shirts! She's my soul mate. You don't even know if it's a man or a woman. I love her. I think she's in trouble. Okay, maybe she's retired. Maybe there's a new Number 8. No, it's not possible. She would never retire. She loves her work. Look at this shirt. Now, Inspector Number 5, I can see him retiring because he stopped caring years ago. Monk. What? They're about to take the body away. Wanna come have a look? I'll be right there! I've only got five shirts left. Wh-Wh-What if I spill something? What if one rips? What's up? [Monk.] It's like an endangered species now. He's obsessing over shirts. Look, put two shirts in the dryer. Yeah? Close the door. See if they mate. Hey, Monk? What? What do you think? About what? About the dead guy in the kitchen. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I was thinking about something else. He's worried about the woman who inspects his shirts. I've been to three different stores. Captain, the stitching, i-i-it's all It's all wrong. The collars are crooked Okay, Captain, just please fill us in. Okay, they're both classical musicians. They got married about six months ago. It's just not like her. The wife was down at the rehearsal studio practicing her cello. She comes home 3:30, she finds her husband dead on the kitchen floor, room temperature, stabbed three times. Well, she's lying. She wasn't practicing. You can't play the cello wearing a long skirt like that. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna find Inspector Shirt factory's in Rockaway. That's two hours from here. I think he's right. Yeah. Take her downtown. [Chuckles.] Hey, Monk. Thank you. For what? - You solved the case. - Oh, yeah, sure. If she is in trouble, maybe I can help her. That's Number He makes Inspector Number 10 look like Inspector Number 6. [Man On P.A..] Maria, line one. Maria. Hi. [Aside.] 6. There she is. There she is. That's her. That's Number 8.

The same? [Monk.] Oh, you saved it! That's the only fan letter I ever wrote. I am Maria Ortiz. Maria, it's an honor and a pleasure. It's so nice when you can put a face with the-the little tag in the pocket. Uh-oh. Are you approving this? Th-Th-This has a little little stain there. I knew it. I knew it. [Sobs.] You are upset about something. Maria, Mr. Monk has been really worried about you. It's not me. It's my son, Pablo. Oh, I remember this case. The model, Clea Vance. The papers are wrong. Everyone is wrong. Pablo is a good boy. He's innocent. Oh! I know it's hard. You might feel better if you focused on your work, you know, and started inspecting these shirts again. [Sighs.] Here's the thing, Maria. Um I've, uh I've only got five shirts left. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. You can help her. Yes. Uh, Maria, Mr. Monk is a detective. He's-He's a great detective. He's famous. And you came here to help my boy? Um, well, no, actually. My, uh My first priority really is, uh, to get you to focus again, you know, because, um, the shirts, Maria Mr. Monk, I have been praying for such a one as you to help me Great. Pablo is innocent. When you talk to him, you will see. Whoa, when I talk to him? Uh, no. L-l-l-l-l-I never agreed. [Sobbing.] Oh, my gosh. Oh, Maria, I'm so sorry, sweetie. Stop it. How did this happen? How do you talk me into these things? Because it's the right thing to do. Have you read this? Look at There are witnesses. There's D.N.A. Evidence. Natalie, he did it. There's no doubt about it. Well, it doesn't hurt to meet him. [Buzzer Buzzes.] If I go back to Maria and tell her that her son is guilty, she'll completely fall apart, which would be worse because I am down to five shirts. - Mr. Monk. Miss Teeger? - Yes. L-I talked to my mother. She told me you were coming. How do you know my mother? From her work at the factory. I'm a big fan. - A fan? - Pablo, your mother asked that we look into your case. - We'd like to hear your side. - I did not kill Clea Vance. That is my side. I never met her. I never see her. There was a fashion show at a big hotel. I was a delivery boy. I delivered some clothes there, then I go home. The next day, I'm arrested. [Sighs, Speaks Spanish.] ""It is a nightmare."" Pablo, your D.N.A. Was all over the victim. Your blood. Your hair. How do you explain that? [Sighs.] I don't know. It's a mistake. Uh, a misunderstanding? Clea Vance had a roommate who testified that Clea was afraid of you. She says that you were stalking her. Look. It says right here, ""Pablo Ortiz was obsessed with her."" You see that, right there? I see it. You're lying, Pablo. It doesn't say that. You can't read English, can you? No, sir. I was raised in Mexico with my father. I have been here and I can speak English, but I cannot read. [Sighs.] What is it? - That's an emergency exit. - Yeah? Well, the killer didn't use it. According to this floor plan, he would have had to go all the way around back through the kitchen. It was crowded. It was risky. Somebody could have seen him. Yeah, but he wouldn't use it. The alarm would sound. Exactly. Whoever killed this woman read that sign. And Pablo can't read. Do you think he's innocent? You do, don't you? The dead model, right? I remember this case. I did the work on this one myself. - Is there any new evidence? - No. Monk met the killer's mother. - She's a shirt inspector. - She swears he's innocent. Oh, I know. That's the hardest part of the job, the mother's crying and pleading. - That's one thing I'm not gonna miss. - Where are you going? Didn't you hear? I'm retiring. There's a party for me on Friday if you wanna come. Cool. Absolutely. I'm there. You're retiring? How old are you? win the lottery? No, I've been investing, real estate. - What have you been doing with your savings? - Uh, eating. You know, I need to talk to my accountant. Wait, you have an accountant? Nope, gonna have to get an accountant. - Then I'm gonna talk to him. - There's something wrong with this picture. - What? - I don't know. Something. So these are her shoes? That's right. Yeah, you see this blood and this hair and these fibers? They all belong to Pablo Ortiz. It's a slam dunk. Yeah, I don't see any wiggle room here, do you? No, we got the right man. People lie. People lie all the time, but D.N. A? It never lies. I'm thinking I'm thinking maybe he's not the guy. - Yeah, see, there's this exit door - Look, I heard about the exit door. - It's right there. - Look, Monk, I'd follow you anywhere but I've got 4 cases on my plate right now. But you have fun. Knock yourself out. Thanks, Gordo. See you at the party. Here's the statement from that Natasia Zorelle. She was the victim's roommate. Let's start with her. Did you just say you were, uh, gonna go and talk with Natasia Zorelle? - The supermodel? - Is that her? Yeah, actually, I've got the rest of the day off. - I should probably go with you guys. - You know, I think I'll come along too, in the interest of, uh Justice? Yeah, justice. [Camera Shutters Clicking.] Get a close up. Come on, Michael. They all look so unhappy. How can you be that attractive and be so sad? Well, maybe it's because we're never really sure if people like us for ourselves. No, what's this? No! No, no, no! That's not what I asked for! Look! Look, the collar has to flare like this. - Huh? Do you see? - Julian, they just painted that. Hmm? She's an animal. She's in heat. Huh? Good. You, what do you think? - Uh, I like it. - You like it. What's that supposed to mean? Say you love it or say you hate it! Anything in between is pointless. Wet One, Wet One, Wet One. Come on. Thank you. You, blue shirt! Are you here to audition? Me? No. Well, you may want to consider it. I like your attitude. Hello. If you're gonna rob me, you should bring a gun. Pardon me? The blouse. It's a knockoff of one of my designs. Oh, it is? I didn't know. Of course. That's not the real crime. The real crime is how you look in it. [Woman.] Julian, you're booked in Milan the day after the show. Okay. Okay. The girls are here. You said you wanted fresh faces. - Good. Good. No, darling. - He did it. Natalie, he's not even a suspect. Damn! No. Turn around. Not this time. Next time. Oh! Mmm! Yes, yes. You're perfect. What's your name? Sarah. Sarah. Heaven must be missing one of its angels. Excuse me. Sorry, um What? Well, it's nothing. It's just, uh, those eyebrows aren't gonna look so good - Which one? - Well, the left one's higher than the right one, isn't it? Oh. This eyebrow is a little bit lower than that one. Oh, maybe next time, Sarah. Yeah. Thanks for coming in. Who are you? I'm Adrian Monk. I'm with the San Francisco Police. Yeah, we're, uh we're looking for Natasia Zorelle. Well, she's working. Oh, and do me a favor. Don't arrest her until after the show. She hasn't done anything. We're actually looking into the murder of Clea Vance. Well, why? Isn't that old news? I thought the killer was in jail somewhere. I mean, don't you people read the newspapers? Did you know her? I know every model in California and every wannabe. Clea was a should-not-have-been. You know, she showed up wasted to my last show. Almost ruined me. Now, let that be a lesson to you girls. She ruined my last show and two hours later, the delivery boy killed her. - And I kid you not. - We'd still like to talk to Natasia. She's at the beach. We are shooting our new catalog. Listen, I've gotta be there very soon, so you can follow me if you like. All right, girls. Good. All right. I'll meet you there. I gotta go pick upJulie and change. Okay, that's it. That's what I need. Keep it going. Sell it. Sell it. There we go. Again. Good. Sell it. Sell it. Good. Sell it. Sweetie, just stay right here, okay? I'll be back. What are you doing? What? I'm standing. This is how I stand. What are you wearing? Clothes. This is how I dress. This is how I stand. This is how I dress. Excuse me, would you put that out? It's bothering me. But you're smoking. My smoke isn't bothering me. Hmm? Thank you. All right. She'll talk to you, but make it quick. I'm not paying her a thousand dollars an hour just to chat. Uh, thank you. Can you give us a minute? Sure. All right, everybody. Take ten. Let's get her in the other dress, please. Sweetheart, oh, you look ravishing. These gentlemen are from the police department. They want to talk to you about Clea Vance. Why? We're not sure. Probably just tilting at windmills. Windmills? Mm. It's a literary reference from a book. Um, I guess I can talk while I change. Meet me over there? Only one of you. Okay. I guess the only fair way is, uh, alphabetically. Oh, Adrian. Last names. So ""A"" is no. Uh, ""B"", no, ""C"", no. ""D"", Disher, that's Monk, you go. It's your case. Disher comes before Monk. It's the first last name. What are you, in mourning for your life? Yeah, I got it. We're comin' in. You were Clea's roommate? Yeah, and best friend. I see. I see. I see. Uh! Oh! Oh! Whoa, whoa, oh, whoa. Oh, whoa. That's okay. I'm not shy. - You have, uh you have something on your shoulder. - Oh, it's a mole. It's my trademark. Yeah, did-did-did you know Pablo, uh, Ortiz? I didn't know him, except that Clea was terrified of him. He was stalking her. Yes, there there's no evidence of that. No phone calls. No other moles I mean, witnesses. No other witnesses. Are you saying I made it all up? Um Why would I do that? I don't know. Look, I saw what I saw. He brought her flowers. He hit on her. I already testified about all this a year ago. I read your statement. Then read it again. Okay. What are you doing? If you put one on this side, you know, y-you'd be perfect. Y-Your career would [Makes Flying Sound.] Do you have any more questions? No. Good. 'Cause I got to get back to work. Hey. Hi, there. How'd it go? She's hot. Uh, she's mildly irritated. [Monk Sighs.] Give her a minute. She'll calm down. [Man.] All right, great. You look beautiful. Keep going. Great. Hi. Mom, I got bored. Sweetie. Please, can I stay? I won't say anything. Shh, shh, shh. Watch. Mom, that man's looking at me. [Camera Shutter Clicks.] What's he doing? I don't know. Mr. Hodge? Who is she? Who are you? This is my daughter, Julie. This is Mr. Hodge. Let me see you walk. Why? Because lighting may be striking. Your life may be changing. Now, just walk over there. Come on. That's it, good. Turn around. [Camera Shutter Clicking.] - Hold your head up. Smile. Come back. - [Camera Shutter Clicking.] Good. I want you to model for me. You can be in the show on Thursday night. Hmm? You know, you could be a big star. Great and wonderful things. Oh, my God! No, she's 13 years old. I've had models younger than that. Thirteen? She's practically middle-aged. Thank you. I don't think so. Anyway, it's not up to you. This is between Julie and her biological mother. I am her biological mother. Oh. [Camera Shutter Clicks.] [Sighs.] Mom. No. Sweetie, come on. It's gonna get cold. Are you wearing makeup? I told you, not until you're 18. Mom, when I'm 18, I'll be too late. I really wanna do this. You know, a lot of these girls have serious problems, okay? Drugs and eating disorders. It's just one show, and if you're right and I hate it, I'll quit. But at least I'll have tried. You always tell me to try to new things. Forget modeling. You should be a lawyer. Is that a ""yes""? I'm gonna be with you the whole time. Wow! I'm modeling forJulian Hodge. Isn't he wonderful? That's not exactly the word I would have used. [Knocking.] Oh. Julian. Hi. [Kisses.] Hey. You surprised? Not after today. I figured you might be freaking out. Do they know anything? I don't think so. You're not smoking. No. No, uh, you know, cigarettes, they tend to leave a nasty odor. I wouldn't want them to know I was here. Who? The police. Oh, I didn't tell them anything. But you will eventually. But Shh, shh, shh! It's not your fault, my darling. You're just too pretty. And beauty like yours, a face like this Shh. You just wouldn't be able to take the pressure. [No Audible Dialogue.] How's it look, Gordo? Well, it looks like suicide, smells like suicide. Smart money's on suicide. She drained two of those bottles and maybe 30 sleeping pills. Were those prescription? Probably not. We'll check with her doctor. Make a note. I'll remember. Where's your notebook? I didn't bring it. It's an Italian suit. It was ruining the lines. Don't worry. [Clicks Tongue.] I got it. Am I in your way? She probably got depressed after you spoke to her. - All those memories about the murder bubbling up. - I don't think so. One set of fingerprints on the glass. Yeah, they're hers. But, look, she's wearing lipstick. There's no lipstick on the glass. Somebody wiped down the glass and then put it back in her hand. Okay, this is now a homicide investigation! Lock this joint down. Nobody touches anything. Fabio, go and borrow a notebook and borrow a pencil and start talking to neighbors. [Natalie.] Captain, what do you think it means? It means that your boss scared somebody. Rest in peace. [Man On P.A..] Ladies and gentlemen, rehearsals up in ten minutes. Please take your places. Final touches. Oh, she looks beautiful, doesn't she? [Sighs.] Too beautiful. Sometimes I wish she had a big old fat hairy wart right here. Or maybe maybe here. Everyone, um, could you just come around here for a moment please? Thank you. Yes, put that down. That's okay. Do that later. Thank you. I just want to say a few quick words. This has been a terrible day for us today. As you know, last night we lost a dear, dear friend. And I know all of you here, everyone, how much we loved Natasia, except, of course, when she was driving us nuts. [Laughs.] But I can feel her here. L- l-I can feel her spirit, her soul. Can you feel that? And I know she's going to be with us tomorrow night at the show. So let's not let her down. Huh? Good. [Kisses.] This one's for you, baby. [Women Sigh.] Great. Thank you. ~~ [House.] You may want to change the earrings. ~~ [Continues.] Look, look, look, look. [Julian.] I knew you'd say that. Make a note. Just change those earrings. Cut! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! Cut, cut, cut. Julie, Julie, Julie. Have you forgot something? Huh? What? Have you forgot that when it comes to my art, I'm a total monster? I mean, just look at yourself. Look. You're a mess. I mean, look here. Look at this. Look at the collar. Look, it's all twisted. And-And-And all these wrinkles on the dress. I mean, look, sweetheart. Natalie, do you have the case file? What? The case file. Give it to me. I'd rather put you in a burlap bag than have you seen wearing my clothes like this. I knew something was wrong. Look at this. Her body is all contorted. But the collar and her buttons are perfectly straight. After he killed her, he straightened them out. He couldn't help himself. He's the guy. Who's the guy? Julie, we have to go right now. Why? I can't tell you now. Not here. [Indistinct.] But, Mom. Do not argue with me! G-Get your stuff now. Hey! What? [Sighs.] Look, what's going on? She's taking Julie home. Well, why on earth would she do that? Because I told her that you killed Clea Vance a year ago. And I'm betting that you killed Natasia Zorelle last night. Who else would have straightened the clothes on Clea Vance's body? Oh, and why would I do something like that? I would have. Is that it? I straightened out the clothes? [Scoffs.] I mean, that's not evidence. That That's a hunch. That's all it is so far. You trust your instincts, don't you? Oh, yes. And would it be the same infallible instinct that you used when you picked out that jacket? Or when you did those buttons right up to the top on your shirt, eh? [Scoffs.] What about the evidence, Mr. Monk? What about You've heard of D.N.A., right? I mean, does that ring a bell here? Hmm? D.N.A., yes. The fibers, the hair and the blood. They all belonged to that boy, Pablo Ortiz, who's in jail. It couldn't have been me. Just not possible. You're right. It's not possible. But you did it. Gordo, thanks for getting here so fast. Sure, what's going on? Get a load of this. Okay, there was a fashion show upstairs in the ballroom. I remember, last year. And one of the models, as you know, showed up drunk. Clea Vance. Exactly. So drunk, according toJulian Hodge, that she almost ruined his show. He was furious. I think he followed her down here. They argued. He lost control. He killed her. He beat her to death right here. Julian Hodge? What about the evidence? He planted it. He framed Pablo Ortiz. Is that possible? How could he plant all that evidence and clean up every trace of himself? Actually he didn't. He missed something. Check this out. There was a health inspection the day before. They hung that flypaper in the corner. - How'd we miss it? - We just found it this morning behind that radiator. It must have fallen back there during the fight. And, look, there's three or four hairs stuck to it. And they can't be from Clea Vance because she had long hair. They must belong toJulian Hodge, the real killer. This is the proof we need. How soon can you do a test on those? I'll get right on it. Good work. Thanks. [Cooking Timer Buzzing.] Honey, I think they're done! Ooh, maybe a little overdone. Julie? Honey? [Cable Car Bell Ringing.] [Man.] I don't have a John Carlo, okay? How many times do I have to tell you? You're not on the list, all right? Good night. Thank you. Good night! - Hello. I'm on the list. - Name. Puff Daddy. Plus one. This is my girlfriend. Hi. Puff Daddy, the rapper? Oh, no. Not that Puff Daddy. This happens to me all the time, doesn't it? All the time. Yeah, let me explain. Where to begin? All right, there are two Puff Daddys. Why don't you change your name? Why doesn't he change his name is what I'm saying. I'm older than him. I had it first. One time a lawyer told me I could sue if l - Look, my daughter's in there. I'm going in. - We gotta go in there. Hey! Hey! Hey! ~~ [Alternative.] ~~ [Man Singing.] ~~ [Continues.] Have you seen my daughter? Have you seen my daughter, Julie? She's 13, long blonde hair. [Julian.] Beautiful. And there's littleJulie. Good. She looks very good. ~~ [Continues.] [Gasps.] Julie! Natalie, don't eat the food. I just saw four models back there throwing up. Julie! Miss, you can't go out there. That's not my design. Make an announcement. [Crowd Murmuring.] You cannot just run away from me like that. You scared me to death. Mom, come on. Mom! If we have a problem, we need to talk about it, all right? I thought we were partners. Wait. You're embarrassing me. Get off. You said I couldn't do this, but you don't tell me why. What type of partner are you? Okay, I had my reasons, all right? There are grown-up things happening here. There are dangerous things. You have to trust me, honey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Oh, God. All right? You're so grounded. Listen, let's make sure that the critics get lots to drink. [Laughs.] Well, look, here's to our next show in Milan. Cincin. All the best. And congratulations. Well done. You look stunning in that dress. Fabulous. It was a great show tonight. Really fabulous. Except for that one little incident with that midget. [Laughs.] That was ridiculous. Mmm. That's delicious, isn't it? Delicious! [Laughs.] I want to get you new earrings. I want them to be drops. Oh, look what the cat dragged in. You know, you nearly ruined my show. You nearly ruined my daughter. Hmm. - Mr. Hodge, hello. - Oh, hello. Great party. Thank you. There's somebody here I'd really love for you to meet. There he is. Oh? Now? [Stottlemeyer.] Come on. Oh, yeah. Can't it wait? No, no, no. He's very important. Julian Hodge, I'd like you to meet Howard Gordon. Howard is one of our forensic experts. Oh. How do you do? He's been examining some evidence that we just uncovered in the Clea Vance case. What, new evidence? That's right. Four strands of human hair found at the scene of the crime. For the record, Gordo, is this your report? For the record, yes, it is. Uh-huh. - And you examined these hair samples that we found earlier today? - I did. - And were you able to match these hairs to any individual? - Yes, sir. - And for the record, who do these hairs belong to? - Pablo Ortiz. Ortiz? Isn't that the boy who's already in jail for the murder? [Laughs.] Well, I think, gentlemen, we're finished here. Don't mind if I get back to my party? Hang on. Hang on. Gordo, I'm sorry, but you're under arrest. Accessory to murder and falsifying evidence. What? Here's what I couldn't figure out. If you were guilty, how could all the evidence point somewhere else? There could be only one possible answer. There was something wrong with the evidence. We did some digging, Gordo. You did make a lot of money this year, but it wasn't in real estate. Here's what happened. When you did the forensic work on the Clea Vance murder, you realized all the evidence pointed toJulian Hodge. You decided to cash in. You made Hodge an offer he was in no position to refuse. For a price, you'd bury the evidence against him. There was only one problem. You had to close the case. You needed a fall guy. Hodge remembered a young delivery boy named Pablo Ortiz, a poor kid, barely spoke any English. He was a perfect patsy. Hodge got Natasia to help him. She called the police and accused Ortiz of stalking her roommate. The police arrested Pablo. They took hair and blood samples and sent them to you And the rest was easy. All you had to do was re-label them. - Pablo never had a chance. - You can't prove any of this. We don't have to. You proved it for us five minutes ago when you swore that these hair samples belonged to Pablo Ortiz. So you planted that hair to test him? Well, yeah. Whose hair was it? It was mine. Natalie pulled it out with a tweezer. She just yanked it out. What was I supposed to do? You could have cut them like I told you to. We needed the follicles. No, we didn't need the follicles because we knew he wasn't going to test anything. That was the whole point. It's embarrassing. Okay, don't be such a baby. Hang on. Hang on! I forgot what we were doing. Oh, yeah, we're arresting you two. You know the drill, Gordo. So, it's true what they say, huh? You can never judge a person by how they dress. Well, you know what? Let me tell you what you're gonna be wearing. I hope you like orange. It's a little jumpsuit thing. It has a number right here. You can wear it anywhere, really Indoors, walking around the yard [Sobbing.] [Speaking Spanish.] [Gate Buzzer Buzzes.] Mama. Thank you, Mr, Monk. How can I repay you, Mr. Monk? I have no money. Now that you mention it, it is only 2:30. If we left now, you could be back at work at 3:15, put in a couple of hours, inspect, what, 90, maybe a hundred shirts. But I took the day off. No, no, no, no. You don't wanna do that. No. You're Inspector Number 8. You have a lot of people depending on you. Mr. Monk, I'm sure they would like to visit. You know? Catch up. Yeah, there's plenty of time for that. They got the whole weekend for that. Unless you wanna work on Saturday. [Speaking Spanish.] Saturday? [Speaks Spanish.] Shh. Overtime? You like overtime?"
"You sure this is it? This is it. What time is it? I don't see him. He'll be here. Mr. Monk, do you think he really has information about Trudy? Mm-hmm. What if he's lying just to get the reward money? What if he's not? What if he's the real thing? Do you have the cash? I just don't want you getting your hopes up. Natalie, I don't have an abundance of hope. Let me enjoy the little I have. Please, give it to me. Okay. Okay. You wait over there by the facility thing. You mean the bathroom? I believe they're called facility things. I'm not leaving you. Natalie, he said to come alone. If he sees you here, he won't stop. Mr. Monk, my job is to help you, not to wait for you in the facility thing. This is about Trudy. I have got to do this. Please. All right. But just promise me you won't pay him unless you're sure. And if you need anything, yell. Good luck. [Door Closes.] Psst. Psst! Are you Monk? That for me? You said you had a picture. You've been lookin' for a six-fingered man? Yeah. Where did you get this? Took it myself. I met him in Vancouver, Canada. He was drunk. He was talking about killing your wife with a car bomb. What's his name? The picture's free, Mr. Monk. The name's gonna cost you. Wait, wait, wait, wait Wait a minute. - This sixth finger - Yeah, what about it? There's no hair on the knuckle. This photograph has been doctored. And the license plate is not Canadian. You can't help me at all, can you? Give me the You can't - Give me the money! - Natalie! Natalie! [Pipe Clatters.] Damn it. [Engine Starts.] Mr. Monk?

Sure, it's possible. What's his name? [Monk Clears Throat.] Oh. Good morning. Can you feed me? We can try. - Breakfast, lunch or dinner? - Um Doesn't matter. It's the same menu anyway. Well, you can sit anywhere you like. Oh Here. How about right over here? You can watch the world go by. Or not go by. Here you go. Sir? Excuse me? Are you okay? Did you get in a fight or something? Uh Can I get you something to drink? Do you have any bottled water? We can do that. Wait. I have a favorite brand. It's the only brand I drink. It's called, um It's called, um I can't remember. I'll just bring you ours. Talk to those guys. Get a list of the regulars. I want a list of all the truckers that park here overnight. Yes, sir. This is my fault. I should never have left him. You're supposed to say, ""No, Natalie, it's not your fault. Stop blaming yourself."" Sorry. Say it! It's not your fault. Stop blaming yourself. [Sighs.] It's all my fault. Captain! - What do you got? - Found his wallet. I.D.'s still in there. Money's gone. Robbery. Well, believe it or not, that's good news. Why? If it was a kidnapper, he'd have other things on his mind. Captain, Mr. Monk gets all his money from the bank. They're brand-new bills. Maybe they keep track of the serial numbers. That's good. We'll check it out. Maybe this guy really did have a clue about Trudy's murder, and Monk solved the case. I mean, he found the guy who killed Trudy and killed him. And then he moved someplace else, changed his name and started a new life. Without telling us? Happens all the time. It does? It happens occasionally. It's not unprecedented. I never said it. Good. How was everything? How's that water? I like it! See? You have a new favorite brand. It's a big day for you. Yeah. Now, I'm just curious. Why do you have everything on different plates? Is it like a religious thing? I guess so. Is that why you wash your hands every two minutes? - Probably. - Well, to each his own. All right. Here you go. Whenever you are ready. Oh. 12.50. Is there a problem? Um, I only have five dollars. You're having a rough time, aren't you? You know what? I'll pay the rest. Pay me back when you can. Debbie, what are you doing? I can tell he's an honest guy. - I am? - Mm-hmm. I think you're right. I am. Thank you. I will pay you back. I promise. There's no rush. We're both gonna die here. Yeah. Oh, excuse me. How far am I from police headquarters? - [Laughs.] - Headquarters? Excuse me. You caught me cheating. Don't tell anybody. I won't. What can we do for you? I'm a little confused. Oh, that happens all the time. Let me guess. You got off the interstate, and you were looking for a gas station. No. No. No, no, no. I'm not I'm not lost. Well, I am. I don't know who I am. You can't remember? Like, amnesia? Have a seat. That's a hell of a speed bump you got there. [Groans.] I've got an ice pack somewhere. - Has a doctor seen that? - I don't know. - How'd that happen? - I can tell you how it happened. - Cora? - A paint can dropped on his head, and he about fell overboard. Overboard? How do you know this, Cora? Because I was there. It was in Naples, Italy. He was on my cruise. - So you know this man? - Yeah, I know the man. Of course I know the man. He's my husband. [Thunder Rumbling.] Feel better? You should. You slept for 15 hours. I had the strangest dream. L-I dreamt that you were a blond A blond? And you And you looked pretty. Different. Pretty different. - What are you doing? - Well, I'm, uh It's just a religious thing. - Don't play with your food. Just eat it. - Okay. The roof again. This place is a dump! Yeah, I'm sorry. Aw! [Baby Talk.] [Meows.] We have a cat. You love cats. I love cats. Jinxy, this is my new husband Jerry. My name is Jerry? Jerry Little. Jerry. Short forJeremiah, which is my favorite name. That's certainly a coincidence. Isn't it? Oh Are these clothes new? I bought 'em yesterday. They look good. Ooh, that is a good look on you. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Well, where-where-where where are my clothes? You lost 'em. You lost everything gambling. I gamble? Mm-hmm. Darling, you have a serious addiction. Can't stop yourself. Bet all your luggage and bet everything you own on red. I was in the casino. I was watchin' ya. That's where we met. Now what? The milk, um I feel I feel frightened. You're afraid of milk? How is that possible? What-What is wrong with me? It probably happened when you banged your head. Just give it a few days. You'll be okay. Maybe I should see a doctor. Oh, you saw a doctor. Don't you remember? Oh, right. He told you to trust me and to do everything that I say. Yes, dear. Oh, oh. Um, I'm gonna need some money. I owe that waitress seven dollars. What do you care? I just wanna do the right thing. Maybe later. Right now, you got some chores to do. You love doing chores. Oh. Here's your list. Fix-Fix the roof? No. Mm-hmm. No, l-I can't. Sure you can. You're a roofer. I'm a roofer? That's your job. I'll tell you what, tiger. You fix the roof, and then later on tonight [Sputters.] I'll show you how much I appreciate it. [Panting.] Here's your toolbox. Up you go. Now what? Uh, I'm-I'm afraid. You're up two feet, Jerry. You can do this. That's why you became a roofer to get over your fear of heights. And it worked. You're world-famous. Jerry, you're the king of all the roofers. Now, up you go. Yes, dear. Oh! Ooh! I'm a roofer? What the hell? [Yells.] Help! Help! Somebody get 'em off me! You recognize him? No. His name is Teddy Mulligan. You were right about Monk's money. The serial numbers led us right to him. He's confessed to everything. He tried to con Monk out of the reward money. Then where's Mr. Monk? Mulligan says there was a fight. Oh, my God. And Mulligan hit him on the head. Oh, my God. And then he threw him on the back of a truck, and the truck drove away. That's all he knows. Is he Is he dead? I don't think so. There's been no report of a body. Hey, he's out there. If somebody's seen him, we'll find him. I promise. [Bell Jingles.] Hey, welcome back. Good afternoon. Hey. Are you two, uh, together? Yeah, we're married. We're married. This is my husband Jerry. Uh, my name is Jerry, and we're married. Um No kidding? Well, congratulations. Thank you, Gail. Yeah, just like in the movies. We met on that cruise I took. Saw each other in the casino, and boom. [Imitates Explosion.] We knew, didn't we? We knew. Love at first sight. That's how it happened, evidently. Is Debbie here? Uh, I owe her some money. No, uh, she quit this morning. She quit? Just like that. Found this note on the door. Said that her boyfriend's moving to Denver, and she's going with him and she doesn't know when she'll be back. I was her best friend. She didn't say a word to me. There's something wrong with this. Look Look at that smudge. This note was written by a left-handed person. But Debbie is right-handed. That's right. She is. I don't think Debbie wrote this note. Where does she live? Right next door. - I have the key. - What do you care about this girl? I just wanna check it out, dear. Well, make it fast, 'cause gotta get home. We got chores to do and lovin' to make and [Cash Register Dings.] What if she comes back and finds us? You ever think about that? [Chirps.] What are you doin'? I think I'm thinking. - That's the way you think? - [Chirps.] If you wanna look around, look around like a normal person. You're embarrassin'me. I gotta live in this town. I'm sorry, dear. But something is wrong here. It looks like she's had this bird her whole life. She wouldn't just leave it behind, would she? How are you noticing this stuff? I don't know. I'm just seeing things. Can I be honest with you? I wish you would concentrate like this on your roofing work. Yes, my beloved. Pregnancy test. Looks like she had a bun in the oven. How do you know? Those two little lines there, that means positive. See, you pee on that end. [Groans.] Wipe! Wipe, wipe! Wipe! Give me I need a wipe. All right. Relax. Ew. Broken glass. Broken glass. This table has been moved. I think somebody was fighting in here. You see this tape? There was a rug right here. It's still sticky. Okay, why would she leave all of her clothes behind, but take the rug? Cora. L-I think this poor girl has been murdered. [Laughing.] [Beeping.] Sheriff, are you sure it's safe? I hate bees. Don't worry about the bees, Larry. Ned's got 'em all rounded up. They're fast asleep, I hope. Sheriff? Sheriff, what do you think about the waitress? Well, I think, uh What do I think? I think she went to Denver to, uh, be with her boyfriend. I told you! No, no, no. Sheriff. Sheriff. What about the parakeet? And the And the missing rug? And, look. Look. Wait. Look. What about the note? I don't think she wrote this note herself. See that, Sheriff? Mister I'm sorry. I forgot your name. So have I. Jerry. Jerry. Jerry, it's not like it is on TV. In real life, things are pretty much the way they seem. For example, this looks like a drunk-driving accident. Right? Well, that's exactly what it is. He-He was drunk? Oh, yeah, drunk as a skunk. Zisk, local hotshot, plowed through that fence into these bees and got stung about a hundred times. Idiot. Okay, Sheriff, here's my list. He knocked over five of my honeycombs worth $400 apiece, plus 20 feet of my fence. Who's gonna pay for all of that? I'm sure he's insured, Ned. He better be. That boy's a brat. A drunken, spoiled brat. He always has been. I'm glad he got all stung and swollen. Ned, uh, why don't you head up to Lookout Point and see what you can do about those hornets' nests? We got kids gettin'stung up there every day. I'm goin'. I'm goin'. But that punk owes me money. - The windows are up. - So what? Why didn't he stay in the car? He was surrounded by bees. I would havejust stayed put. Yakkity-yak-yak. What are you talkin' about? He probably panicked. Like I said, he was really wasted. L-I don't think so. I saw him just a few minutes before 8:00. He drove right past our house. There was a branch in the road. He swerved to avoid it. His reflexes were perfect. - He couldn't have been drunk. - He wasn't drunk? He deliberately drove his car into this bee farm? - Why would anybody do that? - I don't know. And Debbie Barnett isn't in Denver. She's been murdered. Have you seen a doctor about that bump? It's not the bump. It's some kind of midlife crisis. All of the sudden, he's not happy fixing roofs. He's gotta be Captain America. What is wrong with you? Well, he got beaned pretty hard on the head. Huh. We're printing up 4,000 of these. I'm gonna have 'em put up. We're gonna post them in post offices, truck stops and drugstores. Wait, wait. Why the drugstores? I figure he's gonna have to buy wipes sooner or later. You know, Captain, the amnesia that you're describing to me is actually quite rare. Maybe, but it's all we got. I have no body. He hasn't contacted us. - He hasn't contacted Natalie. - Yeah, and we've notified every hospital in the country. There's no sign of him. Doctor, if I'm right and Monk is out there and he doesn't know who he is, what can we expect? From a psychological standpoint, we'd be in uncharted territory. Adrian would be in a complete dissociative state. He would be like a pilot who's flying in the fog without any instruments. He's gotta be scared to death. But in a weird way, if he's not seriously hurt, this could actually help him. See, Adrian has always had a problem detaching Yeah. Iooking at himself objectively. So if you're right, he could be out there right now meeting himself for the very first time. - He's meeting himself? - Mm-hmm. That can't be good. Hey, Jerry? Jerry? Hey, Jerry! Could I, uh, talk to you a minute? I've been thinking about what you said this morning about Roger pretending to be drunk. Now, we found some blood in his car. It wasn't fresh. It was from the night before. He hurt himself before the crash someplace else. Well, could be. In the meantime, nobody's heard from Debbie Barnett. Do you really think there's a connection? Well, what do you think, Sheriff? Hmm. I'm gonna go over and talk to Roger, see what he has to say. You wanna join me? Yeah. Okay. It's the biggest feed store in the county. Roger's father-in-law owns it. He lets Roger run it. [Coughing.] Uh, I don't wanna tell you what those bags smell like. Well, that's exactly what they are. That's fertilizer. My God! My God, this is worse than drug trafficking. You gotta nail this guy. - Sheriff. - Roger. How you feeling? Ah, you know, I'll be all right. People always said I had a swelled head. I guess they're finally right. - What's he doing here? - You two met? - Yeah, you could say that. - Well, this is Jerry, Cora's new husband. He's been helping me out today. Yeah, well, listen. I know I did some damage out there, but tell Ned I'm gonna take care of it. You know I'm good for it. I was out there this morning. From the tire tracks, it looked like you stopped, then turned around, and then then drove into that bee farm. You mean on purpose? Are you kiddin'? You ever been stung 140 times? Because it's-it's no picnic. Roger, you know Debbie Barnett, right? Yeah, sure. Well, evidently, she left town without telling anybody. I just talked to her parents. They're mighty worried. You haven't been seeing her, have you, Roger? [Scoffs.] Sheriff Bates, you're talking to a married man. Did you know she was pregnant? How would I know that? You like Willie Nelson, Mr. Zisk? Yeah, he's all right. You are left-handed, isn't that right? Carl, who is this guy? Look, I got work to do. Just educate this man, all right? You tell him who he's talkin'to. He's the guy. Let's call the captain. What captain? I don't know. Jerry, I like your style. As a matter of fact, I've been looking for a deputy. A deputy? The sheriff said I would make a great detective. He said I was a natural. He said he would sponsor me, help me with the application. Well, forget that. Cora Darling, I think he's right. Listen. [Cat Screeches.] The truth is, I don't like myself very much. I have all these strange habits. I'm nervous all the time. But when I was there today at the scene of the crime, suddenly it all made sense. Things were clicking in my head. Click, click. I'm not livin' with a cop. I hate cops. You're a roofer, understand? - Conversation's over. - Yes, darling. - I told you to stop dreaming. - Yes. Now, sit down here. You trust me, don't you? I love you. And You love me. Say it. I love you. I'll meet you in the bedroom. [Knocks.] I've been waiting a long time for this. What about our honeymoon? Oh, yeah. I forgot about that. That was magical. Sit down right here. And put your hands like this. Now, lean in. Trudy. Trudy. The name's Cora. I'm sorry. I'm remembering something. Uh, there's a woman. I think I'm having an affair with a woman named Trudy. I forgive you. Yeah. I think I love her. I don't care. The truth is, I'm-I'm not so attracted to you. Whatever. The truth is, um, you sort of terrify me. Hey. There's no such thing as a perfect marriage. Right. All right, look. This is my fault. It's too much pressure. Let's-Let's get out of here. We'll be spontaneous, huh? Hey, I know. Let's go to Lookout Point. That's where all the kids go. Oh, no, no. We can't. No. Remember? The sheriff said, uh, they were having a problem up there with the bees and the hornets. Everybody's getting stung. Cora. Should I lie down? I think I just solved the case. Great. Thank you. Natalie! Natalie, hey. We found him. Is he okay? We're not sure. A trucker saw one of the flyers, called in, said he dropped him off in Wyoming sometime yesterday. Wyoming? Yeah, it's a little town called Purnell. It's in the middle of nowhere. The F.B.I.'s loaning us a jet, and we can be there in two hours. Okay. Okay. Wait. Is he sure? Was it really Mr. Monk? The trucker gave the guy a five-dollar bill, and the guy kept smoothing it out. Oh, he's alive! Ooh! [Man On Radio, Indistinct.] [Buzzing Loudly.] [Yells.] There's a There's a bee in-in the car. Well, there's about 20,000 of them out here, and they don't like visitors. Here. Put this on. There you go. One size fits all. How's that feel? [Yells.] Try to relax. That's the most important thing. Bees and hornets can smell fear. The more nervous you get, the sweeter you are to them. Oh, yeah. Yeah. There you go. Jump in there. Easy does it. There you go. Don't panic, now. Don't move fast. Get your arm in there. Good. Yeah. I got it. I got it. Sweet as candy. Put your arm in there. That's good. It's all good. Sheriff, we got something. [Monk Gasping, Grunting.] We found her. County coroner's on his way. Poor kid. How did you know where she was? Uh, it just seemed obvious. Obvious to you. Yeah. Here's what I think, uh Happened? Yeah. Yeah. See, you were right about Debbie and Roger Zisk. They were having an affair. [Chirping.] On Friday night, she must have told him she was pregnant. She probably threatened to tell his wife. And that was something Roger just couldn't allow. He brought the body up here to dump it. But he forgot about the bees. Ow! They probably stung him a hundred times. And now, Roger had a problem. Eventually, somebody was gonna find Debbie's body here surrounded by bees, and when they did, they might remember that Roger showed up the next day covered with bee stings. How would he explain that? He had to get stung again, this time in public [Engine Revving.] So that he could explain the bee stings. Ow! Help! Help! Somebody get 'em off me! He had guts. I'll give him that. Mm-hmm. You figured all that out? What department are you with? Actually, I'm a roofer. I'm just glad to h-help out. Excuse me, uh, is your gun loaded? Yeah. Could you do me a favor? Could you kill me, please? Why didn't you just stay in the car? There's a bee in the car! There's a bee in the car. I'm gonna wake up the judge. Then I'm gonna wake up Mr. Zisk. L I work with you. I work with all of you. You're a detective. You're a great detective from San Francisco. - You were married to a woman named Trudy. - Yes, I know about Trudy. - Natalie. - That's right. - I bet you have a million questions. - Yes, I do. What's-What's my name? Adrian. No, really. What-What's my name? Adrian. Really? Yeah. Okay. - Mr. Monk? - Sheriff. If you're looking for a job, my offer's still good. I appreciate it, but I have to get back to San Francisco. I have a life, more or less. Well, don't be a stranger. I mean, to yourself. That's good advice. Here. I missed you. I missed you. Cora. [Sighs.] Roof's leaking again. You're a terrible roofer. That's true. I knew it wouldn't last. You probably hate me. No. No, I don't hate you, Cora. I'm not pressing charges. You don't like me, though. I don't know. We haven't really met, have we? Monk? We gotta go. [Baby Talk.]"
"[Squeaking.] What's your problem? It's your favorite Almonds and raisins. - [Squeaking.] - Fine. Don't eat. But I'm warning you, that's it for the rest of the day. Don't be complaining later. [Man.] Hey, come on. You're crazy, you know that? You're nuts. Shh. Quiet. [Man #2.] You wearing a wire? Be as quiet as a you-know-what. This is so bogus. I'm not wearing a wire. Turn around. Turn around. Great. You know, I should be friskin'you, man. Yeah? Yeah? Why were you talking to the D. A? Yeah. Hey, they came to me. What was I supposed to do? Did you roll over? No! I didn't tell 'em anything. Did you roll over? No! I swear to God, I didn't tell 'em anything. You know me. Yeah, I know you, and you're making me nervous. Not just me. You're making everybody nervous. - [Electricity Crackling.] - [Grunts.] - [Crackling.] - [Groans.] [Crackling.] [Groans.] [Crackling.] [Yelps.] - [Groans.] - [Blows Landing.] [Clatters.] [Panting, Whimpering.] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

Natalie. Thanks for getting here so fast. This is not an appliance store. Uh, yeah. I know. You said it was an appliance store. I'm sorry. I lied. But if I'd have told you it was a junkyard, it would have taken me five hours to get you down here. This is a junkyard. Wait. So you lied to us? I'm sorry. This is a big case. It just went down about 20 minutes ago. We've got a fresh crime scene for once. I wanted him here right away. I can't believe you lied to us. I said I'm sorry I think twice. How many times do I need to apologize? Six. Six. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Can we do this? The victim was a small-time drug dealer Jimmy Botsdale. They called him Chicklet. - He used to work for Michael Karpov. - Karpov? I was just reading about that guy. Karpov is going on trial next month for criminal conspiracy and money laundering. I helped make the case. Chicklet was supposed to testify against him. Look at all this junk. They should get rid of it Put it somewhere. They did, Mr. Monk. They put it here. It's a junkyard. You can say that again. I'm gonna keep talking. Somebody lured Chicklet here this morning and killed him. There was a witness, however A homeless man. He saw the whole thing. Where is he? We lost him. He flagged down a patrol car and then he disappeared. But we got his name. We'll find him. Uh-oh. What's up? Oh, that car One headlight's not broken. It's the only one not broken. - Oh! - Thank you. [Cell Phone Ringing.] Oh It's Karen. Yeah, Karen. I gotta take this. Hey, Randy? Hey, could you fill them in? [Phone Beeps.] Hey. Did you get my note? - Oh, my God. - Don't touch the body. C.S.I. Isn't here yet. Okay, I won't touch the body. He was bludgeoned. Yeah. It looks like with the barrel of a gun. See these impressions? If they had a gun, why didn't they shoot him? Yeah, that is a good question. Wait. Look at this. Victim's cell phone Empty. No memory, no address book. Like it's been erased. Could a stun gun do that? Erase everything? Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I'll have the coroner look for burn marks. Stun gun. That's good. You're good. [Stottlemeyer.] Because I'm your husband, and that makes it my business. No, Karen, you don't want to talk about it? You've gotta talk about it. Karen? No, I'm not yelling. I'm trying to Karen? [Phone Beeps.] That's not cool, man. You should treat her better. - What did you say? - Oh, I just I don't really think you appreciate her, you know? She's a hell of a woman. - Do I know you? - No. No, you don't know me. The question is, do you know your wife? - What's your name? - Sharkey, sir. Well, Sergeant Sharkey, you're obviously trying to tell me something. Are you trying to tell me that you know my wife? Maybe I do. You'd better wipe that smile off your face. Well, I don't know if I can do that. Karen put it there. - Okay. Okay, hold on. - What's up? Hey, guys. You can't fight here. This is a crime scene. You wanna take it down the street? Let's go. Oh, sure. Yeah, that's how you solve everything, isn't it? Do you ever wonder what Karen's doing on Tuesday nights? You know, when you're at your staff meetings? Shut up. That's an order. [Chuckling.] Take it from me, pal. She ain't missing you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. Okay. I'm all right. It's okay. All right. Okay. I'm okay. Just walk away from this. Captain. Captain! Captain! [Sharkey.] You maniac. Are you kidding? Come on! You knocked my tooth out. God! What the hell's going on? You heard what the son of a bitch said to me. - You maniac. - Just call the paramedics. - Don't move. Nobody move. - [Spits.] - I'm going home. - Captain, you're in charge. Randy, get out of my way. [Disher.] What the hell happened? Monk, what happened? I'm gonna need statements from everybody. Leland, what are you doing here? Did something happen? Now, that's a good question. What did you do? Did you turn the heat up? It's like a sauna in here. It's supposed too be 99 degrees exactly. It's called the Gidamer method. It's very therapeutic. I can't breathe. [Groans.] What happened to your hand? I punched a cop. You punched a cop? Yeah. A sergeant. - Ryan Sharkey. - Why? You don't know? He said you and he were having an affair. And you believed him? Leland, he is lying. Why would he lie, Karen? Why would anybody lie about something like that? Well, I don't know. Maybe it was a joke. You know, cop humor. ""I slept with your old lady. Ha, ha, ha."" - So you're denying it? - No, I'm not denying it. It's so crazy I won't even respond to it. I can't believe we're even talking about this. Well, it sure would explain a lot. Like what? You know. Like you sleeping in the guest room. Because you've been snoring. I didn't just start snoring, Karen. And you forgetting our anniversary. And you not wanting to touch me anymore. Leland, we have problems. I'm not saying we don't, but that isn't one of them Or at least, it wasn't. You used to tie my neckties. If he's convicted, Michael Karpov is looking at 25 years to life, which gives us motive with a capital ""M."" - That makes him suspect number one. - What about physical evidence? Unfortunately, there's not much. Crime scene was contaminated by two of our own. But that's the bad news. The good news is, there's a witness A homeless man, a transient. A homeless transient. He's known as, uh, Jerry or Gerald, 35, maybe 40 years old. If we can find him, we can bring Karpov in for a lineup. Thank you, Lieutenant. I'll take it from here. Actually, sir, I'm in charge. Says who? Deputy chief. [Murmuring.] I'm really sorry, sir. Oh. Uh Carry on. I'll be in my office. Wait a minute. Why don't you keep the pointer? I don't want the pointer, Randy. You're doing a great job. Carry on. Oh, no. It's okay. I can use my finger. See? Look. Works just as well. Even better. It bends. Take the pointer, Randy. [Door Closes.] All right. Let's get to work. [Children Chattering, Laughing.] [Monk.] Careful. Both hands. That's too high. Oh, those things are death traps. That's not just my opinion. It's a fact. Belgium, 1952, a kid almost died on one of those. There he is. Where? Where? That guy? Yeah. Doesn't look like a drug dealer. He's indicted for dealing. He's guilty of a whole lot worse. Mr. Karpov, good morning. Ah. Got a minute? Captain Stottlemeyer, for you, any time. Teddy, these men are policemen. What do we do when we see a policeman? Aha. Very good. See? I'm teaching him respect for the law. Chicklet has passed on. Yes, I heard. Heartbreaking. Hello. You have a little You have a smudge there. I bet I can read your mind, Captain. I'll get it. You want to know where I was yesterday morning? That's right, about 6:00 a.m. in bed with my beautiful wife, where I belong. Can you prove that? That's not the question. The question is, can you prove I wasn't? Do you own a stun gun, Mr. Karpov? What would I do with a gun? I'm a businessman. I import furniture. Sure you do. And you are a very pretty lady. Perhaps I could sell you an end table, hand-carved, from Estonia? Then you would believe me. Look. You're watching me. The press is watching me. I would be a fool to sneak away and do this thing. And I am not a fool. Either you did it, or you hired somebody to do it. You see that, Teddy? That is what they call ""speculation."" Something that the policemen do when they're trying to scare you. Why don't you go play with your friends? There was a witness, Michael a witness at the junkyard who saw everything. Oh. What did he say? ""He""? How did you know it was a man? He just said it was a witness. He, she Doesn't hardly matter because you are bluffing. If you had any witnesses, then I would be down at your station house in one of your ridiculous lineups. There's gonna be a lineup. Very soon. Enjoy these moments with your son, Michael. Take lots of pictures. Because you're not gonna be seeing him for a very long time. Oh, finally. I got it. I think I'm sick. Save yourselves. She's gonna blow! It's gonna get ugly. Listen, uh, I need a favor. Karen's going out this afternoon. She says she's going to the movies. I want you to follow her. Oh, Captain, no. You said she denied everything. She did. That sergeant was just joking around. He was just trying to impress his idiot friends. I don't think so. Karen and me We don't even fight anymore. Last week she said she was at her friend's house. I called there. She wasn't there. Week before that it was the same thing. Leland, don't ask me to do this. Monk, I really need to know. I'd do it myself, but the chief says I need to go to this anger management class, which really pisses me off. I knocked out a tooth. One tooth. It's not like I killed the guy. Who was that clown? I've never seen him before. Ryan Sharkey, Jr. He was a motorcycle cop. He just transferred in from Mendocino. - Wait. You pulled his file? - You bet I did. He's a real hotshot. Has a couple of big arrests. He's been cited for bravery twice. And I hear he's a real ladies' man. You want some advice? Forget what he said. Just forget it. Go home and hug your wife. I don't want any more advice. I wanna know where Karen is going this afternoon. What if she sees us? She's gonna know that you asked us to follow her. - Wouldn't that be worse? - Worse than not knowing? Isn't it killing you, not knowing what happened to Trudy? How many times have I asked you for a favor? How many times have I said ""please""? [Sighs.] Okay. [Monk.] Okay, here's how you follow someone. Stay at least Not more than 60. And, whenever possible, try to use reflective surfaces. ""Reflective surfaces""? Yeah. See? Very discreet. Reflective surfaces. What Wait a minute. I lost her. Where'd she go? Okay, would this be considered a reflective surface? Yeah. Mirrors Mirrors are good too. [Stammering.] [Monk.] Oh, this isn't good. What is that? Come on, come on, come on. She's going. She's going. Wait a second. What is that on my collar? Come on! [Whispering.] Okay, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. I hate this. Yeah. I do too. How long have they been married? Forever. Karen and Leland And they've never had one thing in common. I remember, this one weekend he went hunting and she stayed home and organized a rally for stronger gun control. It's hard when people get married that young, you know? They get older. They change. Yeah, not me. I know not you, but people. Come on. Go, go, go, go, go. What is Sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay, Mr. Monk. Come on. She's getting away. But you can't just leave her like this. It's a mannequin. Why do you say things like that? Oh Oh, no. So we're at her favorite restaurant, okay? And I'm spending, like, a whole week's paycheck on this one dinner. And then this jerk at the table next to me keeps yappin' on his cell phone. I hate those cell phones. You can't have a decent conversation anymore. Did you say your affirmations? Yes. Yes, I did. - Uh-huh. - Okay, I tried. I really did. I said, "" Please. We're trying to enjoy our dinner."" And then his cell phone rang again, and I guess I lost it. I threw a plate. A couple of plates. [Cell Phone Ringing.] [Ringing Continues.] [Ringing Continues.] Excuse me. [Beeps.] Yeah? Uh-huh? Well, look, I can't talk right now, okay? I'll call you later. Leland, would you mind turning that off? I can't. I'm on duty. - So what are you, a cop? - That's right. You think you're better than me because you're a cop? No, Peter, I think I'm better than you on general principle. Well, at least I have some rough idea of where my wife is. Leland. Leland, look at me. Look. Look at me. Say your affirmation. I want to hear it. These things happen. Say it again. These things happen. Sit down. These things happen. Mm-hmm. Leland is angry, which is what? [Students.] A feeling. That's right. Anger is just a feeling. [Sighs.] Leland, you don't have to act on your feelings. You're an adult. You can choose how you wanna respond. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna give you something. It's a backup plan in case you're out in the world and you're in a situation, and your affirmation is not working. It's a fact You can't stay mad at anybody when you're playing with a yo-yo. I want you to take this with you. I don't think so. You understand If I don't sign your certificate of completion, you're gonna be with us for another six weeks. [Students Murmuring.] Thank you. [Mouthing Words.] [Sniffs.] How's that feel? It feels great. Good. Thank you. [Stammering.] Leland Leland, you don't have to do it that fast. Yes, I do. All right. Well, I checked everywhere. There's no movie theater in this mall, so she lied about that. Uh-huh. Oh, there she goes. Mr. Monk, we gotta go. Uh-huh. Look Yeah. - Ten dollars and three cents That's how much is in there. - Okay. Thank you. Now we know. Yeah. I think we should make it even. What are you talking about? The fountain. If we take out three cents, then it'll be $10. It's a nice round number, $10. Then everyone'll be happier. You always say that. Who is ""everyone""? Me Me. You want me to reach in here and take out three pennies? Would you mind? Yes, I would. Look, look. She's moving again. We gotta go. Mr. Monk, if we walk now, we won't even think about the fountain. I'll think about it. It would haunt me. The three extra pennies It would haunt you? It would haunt me. [Groans.] There! Okay? Okay. [Natalie.] My God. She really is seeing somebody. No, the poor captain. Is it Ryan Sharkey? I don't know. I can't see his face. I'll try to get closer. Excuse me. Did you just take money from that fountain? No. Ma'am? Well, yeah, I mean We were making it even. Come with me, please. I just need to get a shot. I don't want any trouble. Just come with me. You too. [Shutter Clicks.] [Natalie.] Get the shot. ""A thousand seemingly unrelated facts ""were coming together in Mark's mind ""to form an undeniable truth, ""a picture of absolute clarity, ""where before there had been confusion. ""'W hat do you know? 'Jesse asked him. ""'I know how Winston Brant was killed,' Mark said, 'and I know who did it.""' Can you believe it? What kind of degenerate tears out the last two pages of a Diagnosis Murder mystery book? What are you doing? [Crackling.] What are you doing? [Stammering.] I'm not gonna say anything. I promise. Sorry, Gerald. [Yells.] [Screams.] [Thud.] [Phone Ringing.] It's the captain calling again. Don't answer it. We can't avoid him forever. We've got to try. Gerald Vengal? Hi. I'm Lieutenant Disher, San Francisco Police. This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. [Natalie.] Hi. [Disher.] How you feelin'? Like I got dropped out of a three-story window. Luckily I fell on a triple-corrugated G.E. Refrigerator box. That's a excellent box. If you gotta fall on a box, try and make it a G.E. Triple-corrugated. Well, I'll keep that in mind. Monk, questions. Yes. Yes. Mr. Vengal Gerald do you have any idea, approximately, when you'll be finished chewing on that piece of meat? Sorry. It's been a long time since I had a real meal. Listen, you guys gotta help me get out of here. It's okay. You're perfectly safe. There's two policemen stationed right outside the door. No, it's not me. I'm worried about Devo. Who's Devo? [Squeaking.] Oh. Mouse. Mouse! Mouse! I fell on the box and Devo fell on me. If the doctors find him, I don't know what they're gonna do. Hospitals hate rodents. They're like fanatics about it. - We'll take care of Devo for you, I promise. - He's actually kind of cute. Natalie, don't touch him. Later on, if we have time, I'll tell you a little story about the Black Plague. He's not an ordinary mouse. He's a genius. He does impressions. Watch. Devo, look at me. Do a gerbil. Uh, be a gerbil. He's shy, but he'll do it. Come on, boy, you can do it. Yeah, go on. You can do it. Do the gerbil. [Clicking Tongue.] There it is. Did you see that? Yeah. It's uncanny. He's like Robert De Niro. Mr. Vengal, uh, those two burn marks on your neck - Did he attack you with a stun gun? - Yes, sir. - And you got a good look at him? - Oh, I sure did. I'll never forget that face if I live to be 40. And you're sure it was the same guy that you saw before in the junkyard? - Definitely. The same guy. - Mr. Vengal, we think we know who did this. His name is Michael Karpov. I'd like to bring you down to the station house later today So you can take a good look at him. We'll set up a lineup. Mr. Vengal, how we feeling today? - You finished with this? - Mm-hmm. All right, I'm gonna take your pulse. [Mouse Squeaking.] I'm sorry, folks, but visiting hours are over. He needs his rest. [Groans.] Thank you. - Are you okay? - Fine. My shoulder's a little sore. Mr. Vengal, good to see you. [Squeaking.] [Woman On P.A., Indistinct.] [Exhales.] [Knocking.] Captain? Hey. I've been calling you guys all day. Have you been avoiding me? Yes, we have. We were waiting till we could print this for you. She's seeing somebody. I knew it. Who is it? We never saw his face. Well, is this the only photograph you got? Well, we sort of got arrested. It's a funny story. - I don't want to hear it. - No, it's really funny. I really don't want to hear it. - That's Sharkey, isn't it? - I don't think so. You look at the shape of his left ear I don't want to hear about the shape of the man's ear, Monk! It's him. I can tell. These things happen. These things happen. These things happen. Screw it. [Murmuring.] Guys, I've got a lineup downstairs in five minutes. I need to fill it out. Volunteers? - Fine. Prichert, how tall are you? - 5'10"". Good. You just volunteered. You're one. Mr. Karpov, you're two. I don't need your court order. You're just wasting everybody's time. Yeah, we'll see. Landau, you're three. - What's wrong with me? - Sorry, Harry. You're too short. [Laughs.] That's funny. That's funny. Nolte, you're four. I need one more. Sharkey, you're in the lineup. You're five. Not me, Lieutenant. I just finished a double shift. I'm not asking you. All right, let's go. Let's do this. Come on. [Squeaking.] Gerald, this is Mr. Hoffman from the District Attorney's office. Now just relax. That's one-way glass. They won't even know you're here. You ready? Yeah. Okay, send 'em in. That That's him. That's the guy. You recognize him, don't you, Devo? H-He Wait. Whoa. Don't say anything. We have to do this by the book. We have to wait till they all step forward. Hey, you know where Ryan Sharkey's at? He's downstairs in a lineup. Number two, step forward. Turn to your left. Thank you. Number three, step forward. Is that you? [Scoffs.] You're pathetic. Thank you. Number four, step forward. Number three, please put the yo-yo away. Number four, turn to your right. Thank you. [Groans.] What's your problem, bud? You're my problem! Number four, please let go of number three. Number five, stop kicking. Number two, step forward. Ouch. Number three, please let go of number four and step forward. Ow. How's it going? Please stop. Stop. Stop, please. [Squeaking.] Please let go of number three. Whoa, Sergeant. W-Wait. He's in there. The killer's in there. I'm sure he is, Mr. Vengal, but it doesn't matter. The lineup is busted. [Shouting Continues.] [Monk.] That might have been the worse lineup in the history of law enforcement. Yeah, it wasn't exactly textbook, was it? Captain, what should I do? You do your job, Randy. You write it up exactly as it happened. Don't worry about me. Hey, where's Karpov? We had to let him go. Sergeant, sit down. I'm gonna need a statement from you too. Leland. Natalie called to tell me that you've been fighting again. - Are you okay? - Uh, yeah, I'm okay. Why don't you ask about your boyfriend? - Hi, Karen. - Leland, I've never seen that man before in my life. Karen, you can stop pretending. Now you're just insulting me. Karen, would you just tell him? Leland I know you want to kill me. I'd probably feel the same way, all right? But you gotta understand, whatever happened between Karen and I didn't mean anything. All right? It was a mistake. I'm sorry. I'm apologizing to you. Who are you? Leland, he must be crazy. [Sharkey.] Karen, it was fun. You gotta face the music. It's over between us, okay? - Okay, I don't know him. You've got to believe me. - Do I? Yes, you do. You have to believe me. Why would he Why would he lie, Karen? Why would he say these things? Excuse me. Excuse me, Sergeant. Are you chewing that apple on your left side? Yeah. So? Why? Why? Because your friend knocked my tooth out two days ago, remember? Yes, I remember. But he didn't hit you on this side. The captain is right-handed. He hit you on the other side. Your left side. - The side The side you're chewing on. - Okay. - The captain didn't knock your tooth out, did he? - What, are you crazy? I'm remembering a few other things. You You used to work in Mendocino, right? When we saw Michael Karpov in the park, his son was wearing a shirt It said ""Mendocino Day School."" Michael Karpov lives in Mendocino. Yeah, a lot of people live in Mendocino. - I don't know Michael Karpov. - I think you do. Ten minutes ago downstairs you were wearing those clothes, and Karpov called you Sergeant. That's right. I heard that too. How did he know you were a sergeant, Sergeant? This is Disher. Is Gerald Vengal still in the building? You work for Michael Karpov. We always suspected there was a cop on his payroll. You killed Chicklet, didn't you? That's why you didn't shoot him Because you knew the bullet could be traced back to your weapon. Here's what happened. You lured Chicklet to thejunkyard, but he fought back. He must have hit you. You were bleeding. You lost a tooth, and you had a big problem. Your DNA was all over that crime scene. [Sirens Approaching.] The cops were on their way. You didn't have time to clean it up. You put your uniform on, you returned to the scene, but you knew Forensics would be there any minute. What to do? What to do? Then you had an idea. I'm your husband. That makes it my business, okay? If you picked a fight with someone if you could provoke them and get them to hit you, you'd be home free. They could find your tooth, your DNA, your blood - You knocked my tooth out. God. - And nobody would ever question it. You told my husband we were sleeping together so that he would hit you? Oh, come Would you You can't prove any of this. I think we can. We can connect you to Karpov. We'll pull your phone bills, your e-mails, your bank accounts Yeah, I think you might need a little more than that. That's the guy. I've been telling you guys all day. I saw him at the junkyard. That's the guy. Oh. Uh, hey, are you done with that? It's not for me. - It's for Devo. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. He's had a pretty rough day. That mouse was in my pocket. He was in my pocket. Let's go, Sharkey. Are you okay? [Laughing.] Heck of a thing, huh? Actually, it's kind of flattering, if you think about it. He picked me because he knew that I would react 'cause he could tell how much I love you. It's not flattering, Leland. Look, Karen, I know that I've got a temper, but I've been working on it. I've got a yo-yo. Actually, the yo-yo broke when I threw it at the guy. Why didn't you believe me? I had Monk follow you yesterday afternoon. He saw you meeting a man. You had me followed? You wanna tell me about him? His name is Max Tepperton. He's a divorce lawyer. You've been sleeping with a divorce lawyer? You know what? It doesn't matter. Because I forgive you, Karen. Hell, I'm no saint. We'll get past this. No, Leland. He's representing me. ""Stottlemeyer versus Stottlemeyer."" Why? Because you have to ask why, Leland. That's why. So is that it? Yeah. Twenty years, two suitcases. Where are the boys? They're with Karen at her sister's. How they doing? Not good. Listen, Captain, if you need somebody to talk to Here. Just call any time, about anything, even in the middle of the night. Monk, I know your number. No, it's not me. This is Natalie's home phone. She's really good. He's right. Any time. Thanks. Well, you know the old saying. ""When God closes a door"" Yeah, "" When God closes a door, sometimes he breaks your heart."" That's not the old saying. It is today."
"[Man.] Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll follow me, I think you're going to find this next room very interesting. You're going to want to get your cameras ready. This is the world-famous Cromwell family exhibit. I still get goose bumps every time I walk into this room. It is the largest private collection in Europe. The Cromwell family has collected everything from furniture and paintings to medieval weaponry. This, of course, is the crown jewel of the exhibit no pun intended the Alexander diamond. It was worn by Queen Elizabeth at her coronation. - Experts have called it the most perfect diamond in the world. - It's beautiful. You're probably wondering what it's worth. Actually, no one knows. But I can tell you this: That little rock has been insured by Lloyd's of London for $20 million.

You gotta talk to the captain. We can't go on like this. I'm not good at this, asking for more money Okay, then let me do the talking. I'm not good at that either. Okay, Mr. Monk, you deserve a raise. You've solved a lot of big cases for them, single-handedly. Maybe I helped a little. No, no, no, no, no! You can't think like that. You gotta brag about yourself. You gotta toot your own horn. I'm not much of a tooter. [Natalie.] You better learn how to toot. Toot's a funny word. Hilarious. Yeah. Oh, hello, Gladys. - Natalie Teeger, this is Gladys. - Hey, Gladys. Gladys is great. Gladys has been cleaning up around here for years. I used to help her out in my spare time. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Remember? Yeah, until I got that restraining order, remember? Good times, good times. You have to get underneath, right? Gladys? Under? Why? Nobody ever looks under there. But you'll know it's clean. Isn't that its own reward? You'll know. The captain says I don't have to talk to you. I know, I know. But under, okay? Under the table. I wanna help you guys, okay? I really do. But they already questioned me four times. [Disher.] It's notjust you, Mr. Landis. We're talkin'to all the guards, the cleaning staff, curators anybody who was at the museum. Yeah, but I haven't even been home yet. And I appreciate that. We need your official statement, then you're free to go. So, for the record, where were you during the robbery? For the fifth time, okay? I was at my station on the main floor. I never left. I didn't even go to the bathroom. And you didn't hear anything unusual? No sir. L-I was three floors away. Okay.

His fingertips are stained. Looks like red phosphorous. You get that from making crystal meth. He's gotta have a lab somewhere. Okay. I'll check out. Excuse me, uh, Mr. Landis? Could you come here, please? Lf, uh, the captain needs me, I'll be in Interrogation Room ""B."" Uh, right this way. What? You know what. You just solved that case for free. Wh-What was I supposed to do? Well, if you were selling ice cream, would you hand out free scoops? Wh-What was I supposed to say? ""Hey Lieutenant, there's a drug dealer somewhere in this room. I'll tell you who it is for $20""? At least we'd have $20. [Groans.] All right, there's the captain. Remember, you deserve a raise. You deserve it! Okay. When you're right, you're right. Okay. Captain? Uh - Hey, Monk. What are you doing here? - Captain, I have to talk to you about something. Can it wait? Okay, well, we'll come back. Okay, we're back. And Natalie? - Captain - If this is about money, forget about it. We're broke. The department is strapped. We just, uh, got another hiring freeze. - Captain, we haven't had a new case in three weeks. - You know, you're right. There hasn't been a major homicide in a long time. - But you gotta keep your hopes up, stay optimistic. - Okay. Well, thank you very much. Okay, Captain, come on. We can't just sit around waitin' for the phone to ring. It's not fair to us. We have no security. - What do you want me to do? - We wanna be put on retainer. - What? - You know retainer, like a lawyer. We want a guaranteed income. Look, it doesn't have to be much. We just need a little security. Yeah, just Okay, I'll see what I can do, but don't get your hopes up, okay? Anything else? Um - It's It's about Gladys. - Have you been talking to Gladys? Captain I told you not to talk to Gladys. She's not cleaning under the tables again. I think you should talk to her. I will about her aim. [Mouths Words.] [Disher.] Get him downstairs. You were right. I get this guy in the room. He's denying everything. He's twitching. He's nervous. Threatened to get a search warrant and tear his house apart. I pick up the phone. I start to dial. He collapses. He gave it all up. Crystal meth lab in his basement. Narcotics is on their way over. I owe you one. Okay. [Clears Throat.] What? You know what. Oh. Oh, the thing about the ice cream and the free scoops? That's right. Mr. Monk? We're rich. We hit the jackpot. Oh, good. Look. It's about the Alexander diamond. Lloyd's of London is offering a one million dollar reward to anybody that finds it. No questions asked. So? Mr. Monk, you can find that diamond. Nah, I don't think so. What? You're a great detective. You solve crimes all the time without even trying. It's annoying how many crimes you solve. Come on. Let's go for it. Let's cash in! Natalie, I don't do what I do for money. Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars. You'll never have to worry for the rest of your life. Well, of course you'll worry, but not about money. I don't know. Mr. Monk, you have to do this. I mean, I love this job, but I have to get paid. Just Just please! Just say yes. Say you'll do it. Just say yes. Could you get off my counter? Okay, fine.

Um, since we're all after the same thing, why don't we just pool our talents? - What are you talkin' about? - Well, work together and split the reward. Look, why don't we begin by introducing ourselves, right? My name's St. Clare, retired Scotland Yard inspector. I moved to San Francisco Whoa, I'm interruptin' ya. No friggin' way. I'm findin' that rock myself, and I'm keepin' all the money. Well, may the best man win. I intend to. He said ""man."" This entire wing was locked. I mean, it was completely locked down.

I thought he worked homicide. - [Man.] Oh, what are you two afraid of? Something's off here. What is it? Glass shards on the inside. When that case was shattered, this case was open. I think they took this weapon, used it, then put it back and relocked the case. Wha What does that tell us? A lot. It means it was an inside job, and they didn't want us to know it was an inside job. [Giggles.] Ka-ching! What does that mean? [Natalie On Headphones.] It means we're gonna be rich. Ka-ching! This guy's good. What's he saying? [Feedback.] Put that thing away. What's wrong with you? Excuse me, sir. Did anything unusual happen Tuesday, before the break-in? Anything at all out of the ordinary? No. Well, now that you mention it, Tuesday afternoon I heard or I thought I heard somebody whispering. Whispering. It wasn't in this room. It was, uh, down the hallway. It was about 2:30. I was standing about there, and I thought I heard someone saying ""my womb."" My room? ""My womb."" It was a man's voice, and he was saying it over and over. My womb. - I thought it was coming from that vent, but it's impossible. - [Cell Phone Ringing.] I think I'm going senile. I'm sorry. I've got to take this. [Beeps.] Hello? My womb. My womb. It sounds like a mantra, like a meditation. My womb. My womb. My womb. [Monk.] My [Door Rolls Up.] Look at this. [Natalie.] What? It's a footprint. Somebody was hiding in here. Wait. In there? That's how they opened the connecting door. Let's grab the detectives. We need an evidence kit. Wait. Not yet. What do you mean, not yet? Let's find the diamond, then we'll tell 'em how we did it. Natalie, this is not a game show. This this is a felony. Investi It's a broken necklace. That's an unusual design. Oh, good. We'll try and I.D. It. Come on. Let's get outta here. - [Monk.] Oh. - Sorry. You okay? Oh, I don't know. Something's Something's wrong. L What? I'm a littlea little [Sighs.] I'm not balanced. [Chuckles.] Um, excuse me. Yeah, um, I'm gonna be needing that back because I only have two of them, and the other one doesn't work. Are you following us? What? Ah, Mr. Monk, what an honor. My name's St. Clare Inspector St. Clare. I've been following your cases assiduously from across the pond, you know. Hey, Shakespeare, nobody cares. - Wait. I can't believe you're following us. - Is that a lead? Maybe. Uh Look. Mr. St. Clare Inspector, I'm sure a gentleman like yourself can appreciate the fact that these two leads belong to us. - Two leads? - Well, yes, the necklace and the initials carved in the desk. Mr. Monk. I'm sorry. [Whispers.] Go. Go. Go. Go. Excuse me. My name is Jennie Mandeville, and, uh [Whispers.] I did something I'd like to confess. Well, what did ya do, Jennie? [Whispers.] I robbed a bank. It was about three weeks ago the Community Savings Trust in Sausalito. Sausalito? I don't remember anything about that. I'll take it. Hi, I'm Lieutenant Disher. Uh, Jennie? Uh, Miss Mandeville. Just, uh, have a seat. [Clears Throat.] - Uh, is there a problem? - I'm claustrophobic. Is this the only room that you have? All the rooms are the same size, miss. Please, just have a seat. [Switches Clicking.] This is Lieutenant Disher. I'm in Interrogation Room ""A"" with Jennie Mandeville. So, you say you robbed a bank? That's right. I went inside, and I saw one of those pens you know chained to the desk? And I really needed a pen, so I snapped it off, and I put it in my purse. You stole a pen? One pen? [Sniffling.] Oh, God. Do you think God will forgive me? I don't know, ma'am [Switch Clicks.] But we do. You're free to go. God, what is up with those three detectives? Do you think we lost them? Ah, Natalie, they are not detectives. They're rent-a-cops. They're hired guns. They are mercenaries. In other words, they're us. This whole thing is about greed. Okay, you know how you always say you'll thank me later? You'll thank me later. Ooh, that's gotta be him. Hello, are you Mr. Kwan? [Monk.] I think he nodded. Was that Was that a Was that a nod? Sir? Sir, could If that was a nod, nod. Sir, we found this at the scene of a crime a robbery. We've been doing some research. This is your design, isn't it? You give these to your students? Natalie, please. Sir, you you, uh you have a thread hanging, uh, right in the middle, there. I'll just I'll get it. Just one lone Um If you just Okay. Okay. Mr. Kwan, you look like a very busy man, so I'm just gonna get right to the point. Do you have a student that could fit inside of a rolltop desk? He can't be more than five feet tall. Does that ring a bell or a gong? Mr. Monk, you're distracting him. No. He's distracting me. Is there anyone here who is that small and limber who could scrunch up inside of a desk? A scruncher a little scruncher? - Mr. Kwan, there's a lot of money at stake here. - Got it. [St. Clare.] Well, well, well. Mr. Monk. We meet again. Surprised? - Why don't you get your own clues? - Well, normally I do, but you two are so easy to follow, especially when you're kind enough to keep your emergency blinker on all day long. I told you. It's the safest way to drive. Wait! Don't question anybody yet. - I have a voice stress analyzer. I'll be able to tell if he's lying or not. - He hasn't said anything. - You are a pathetic little frog, aren't you? - You thought you could lose me, huh? Well, you can all just relax. Dirk'll take it from here. Hey, hippie, you in charge? My name is Dirk. I'm a professional bounty hunter. I was wondering if I could have a word with you? - Maybe this'll change your mind. I got $200 here. - Two hundred dollars? - They do use money on you planet, don't they? - I don't have any money on me at the moment, um [All Chattering.] [Chattering Continues.] - Cabin 14! - It doesn't say that. [Grunts.] You're good. Haven't worked out a day in my life. You know why? Security cameras. 225. His name is Chasen. He's over at Cabin 14. [Dirk.] Come on. There he is. Let's go! [Delivery Boy.] Hey, slow down! [Dirk.] Come on! Mr. Monk, what are you doing? [St. Clare.] I say, Mr. Monk! [Delivery Boy.] Don't let him get away! [Dirk.] We got him! [St. Clare.] Mr. Monk! [Dirk.] Get back here! [Delivery Boy.] Gotta go to the gym. [Monk.] Excuse me. [Natalie Whimpers.] Excuse me. Get outta my way! Hello, Mr. Chasen! [Panting.] Hi. Is this your necklace? We found it in a museum. Okay! Where's the diamond? Hey! Hey, I'm talkin' to you! Wow, that's a really deep trance. Couldn't be deeper. This man's dead. Welcome back, Miss Mandeville. Have a seat. [Clears Throat.] You know the drill. I don't like this room. Please, Miss Mandeville. You said you had something important to tell me something about a dead body. And you said you didn't wanna talk in my office. I told you I'm claustrophobic. What about another room? All our interrogation rooms are the same size, unfortunately: No wet bars, noJacuzzis Please, just have a seat. Now, you said you found a body your roommate's body. This, um This is a real thing, right? Not like, uh, stealin' the pen from the bank? Okay, good. Tell me about it. [Switch Clicks.] This is, uh, Lieutenant Disher. I'm in Interrogation Room ""D"" talking with Jennie Mandeville again. So, let's start from the beginning. What was your roommate's name? Tony. Tony? Tony what? I don't know. You don't know. Male or female? I think male. You're not sure? To tell you the truth, I just brought him home the day before. Okay, um, let's move on. So, um, you came home. You found Tony, and you what, disposed of the body yourself? You realize that's a federal offense? I couldn't take it, okay? I couldn't just stand there looking at it. Jennie, what did you do with the body? I flushed it down the toilet. - Was Tony a goldfish? - A hamster. A hamster. Okay. [Stottlemeyer.] Here's the coroner's report. Victim's name: Danny Chasen. It's probably an alias. Victim was poisoned. Somebody spiked his all-natural barley tea with ammonia. Was he part of the heist? Looks like it. They found some hair samples in that rolltop desk at the museum. They match the body. Okay, what about the diamond? Still missing in action. It wasn't on him or in the cabin. We know he had a partner somebody who works at the museum. It's probably still with him. Uh, w-wait, wait. So, the reward's still good, right? I mean no one's claimed it. Yes. As far as I know, the offer is still good. Ka-ching. [Groans.] Can you make her stop saying that? This is no longer a parlor game. A man is dead. This is a homicide investigation now, which means nobody is to withhold any information from anybody. What? You're lookin' at me? Yes, I am, Miss Teeger. [Scoffs.] Did you write these? Don't deny it. I know it was you! ""How are things down under? Hint, hint."" ""Monk was right. You should clean under the table."" You don't fool me for a second. ""It goes without saying don't forget to throw away these little Post-its too."" Captain, she never cleans under the table. You are not the boss of me! I think I am. What makes you think you're the boss of me? If I was the boss of you, you'd be fired! Why do you think Whoa! Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! No! Hey, separate, both of you. Monk, over there. Gladys, can I have a word with you, please? Look. Gladys, he's Monk. Try to ignore him. Can you ignore him? No, I can't. Just do the best you can. [Jennie.] So you're not gonna arrest me? No, not this time, miss. But next time you feel like confessing something, you might wanna call a priest. Will you, uh, escort Miss Mandeville out? No problem. [Whistles.] Who's she? Loony tune of the month. Her name's, uh, Jennie Mandeville. She keeps coming in here and confessing to stuff. What was it this time? She comes in, same as yesterday she says she accidentally killed her roommate. So I take her into the back room, and I turned on the tape recorder. Turns out her roommate was a hamster. [Chuckles.] She didn't look unstable. They never do. Okay, can we get back to work now? The missing diamond, remember? Ka-ching! ""Ka-ching""? She is putting so much pressure on me. She's obsessed with this million dollar reward obsessed. All right. Well, Adrian, she's worried about money. Now, I know a lot of people are. Not me. When I was on the force, I used to hate cashing my paycheck. I still do. To me, police work is it's like a higher calling, like the priesthood. But you know, Adrian, even priests have to get paid. But i-it brings up an interesting question, something I would like to explore with you. What would you do if you had a million dollars? Oh. Well, uh, I guess I'd I'd hire you full-time and keep you on retainer, 24-7. Maybe I'd buy you a house right next to mine, so I could just drop in anytime. Heh. This is fun. What would you do with a million dollars? Buy an island a desert island in the middle of nowhere. So, w-we would do our sessions o-over the phone? [Chuckles.] Well, you see see, this island, in my mind no phone service. I guess I'd have to buy a boat. Well, see, that's funny, because the island in-in my fantasy no dock. Well, may the best man win. Excuse me! What are you doing? Did you see that? There There was someone out there. I'm going to have to report this. It's It's okay. It's okay. It's just another detective trying to find the diamond. There's a whole bunch of them. Yesterday they followed us down the coast to that big meditation center in Monterey. Oh, I've been there. It-It's just beautiful. But this was years ago, when Jennie Mandeville was still alive. Jennie Mandeville. Jennie Mandeville. Yeah, she owned the property. There's this big plaque there with her name on it. That's right. I remember. I saw it. What? I just solved the case. I think I know where that diamond is. Ugh! I have to go. We'll add 20 minutes on to my next session. Ah, A-Adrian. Adrian, I'm sorry. I have a policy. L-lf If you leave early, I have to charge you for the whole session. [Groans.] Yeah. Mmm. It's Uh Okay. [Chuckles.] O-kay. O-kay? Okay. [Bell Clanging.] Natalie! Natalie, I did it. I solved the case! I know where the diamond is! What? So where is it? It's at the police station. It's been there the whole time! It's been right under our nose. Oh, my God. Who would do that to my car? [Whispers.] Oh, my God. Natalie, they're listening. What? [No Audible Dialogue.] [Loudly.] What I meant was, I didn't solve the case. I wish I had. I'm completely stumped. What are you talking about? No. Wait. What I really meant was, I did solve the case. The diamond is in the Philippines. We gotta go to the airport, fly to the Philippines. Well, if we're gonna run, just run. Run! [St. Clare.] Monk! Mr. Monk! Come on! [Muttering.] Hey! I'm watchin' you! Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk! [Dirk.] Move, you little runt! Here! Here! Here! They ran down that alley. Get outta the way. [St. Clare.] I say, Mr. Monk! [Delivery Boy.] Slow down! [Dirk.] Hey, stop! [Monk.] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, Counting, Panting.] [Delivery Boy.] I can't believe this guy. I say, Mr. Monk. Get outta the way! [Tires Screech.] [St. Clare.] Can you see him? We lost him. Wait. [Panting.] We've been following Monk. We've been watching Monk. Why don't we try thinking like Monk? Think like Monk. Think like Monk. Think like Monk. Think like Monk. Think like Monk. Think like Monk. [Dirk.] Gee! - [Delivery Boy.] What are you doin'? - He went that way. [Laughs.] I think we lost 'em. You keep saying that, but we never do. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Taxi! Taxi! Police headquarters, Vinton Street. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin', chief? I'm with her. You got to ride in the back. That's the rule. Ah, l-l-I'd prefer to sit up front. It's one of my things. It's true. It's one of his things. - Well, here's one of my things: Nobody rides in the front. - I'm afraid it's not negotiable. - Who's negotiatin'? That's it. I'm outta here. - No. W-W-W-Wait, wait, wait. - I'll give you, uh, 50 bucks if you let him ride up front. - Why? What's he gonna do? Nothing. Nothing. He's got a cluster of, uh, compulsions and phobias that manifest themselves in a variety of you know? It's one of those things! He has things! - A hundred dollars. - [Groans.] - All right. Seventy-two. That's all I have. - Welcome aboard. Whoa. Whoa, uh, wait. This inspection sticker expired yesterday. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm takin' care of that tomorrow. - It expired. It's expired. [Sighs, Quietly.] Mr. Monk, it's a million dollars. Please get in the cab for me. - It's expired. - Well, forget about it. Forget about it. Give me back my money. - No refunds. Its one of my things. - [Groans.] [Delivery Boy.] Monk! Oh, Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk! [St. Clare.] Now couldn't we, uh Couldn't we sort something out here? [Dirk.] Monk! Where's Where's Where's [Both Panting Heavily.] - [Monk.] Di - [Natalie.] Di Oh, Disher. Yeah, yeah. - L-I think he's in the observation room. - [Monk.] Come on. Oh, all right, Gladys. We're bein' followed. Don't tell anybody you saw us! They locked the doors! It says ""Push""! Get outta the way! That way. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, remember the security guard that you arrested? [Disher.] Yeah. Where did you interrogate him? Right there Room ""B."" Ah! And the girl that kept confessing, Jennie Mandeville - Where did you take her? - Uh, Room ""A"" then Room ""D."" - So she was never in there? It's gotta still be in there. It's in that room. - What's in there? Monk, what's going on? - Tell you later. - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You cannot come in here. My two friends are American citizens. They have a right to be here. Myself, I am on a temporary visa which I hope to extend. - Are they with you? - Only in the strictest, most terrible sense of the word. - I heard you tell your shrink you solved the case. - [Natalie.] Excuse me. Nobody's going anywhere not until we know what he knows. [Key Clatters.] All right, you just made a big mistake my friend. I happen to be a police captain, and this is an unlawful imprisonment. Book him. You're under arrest. Turn around. [Disher.] Fine. Give me your hands. - Do you have your cuffs? - In my office. It's in there, isn't it? The diamond it's in that very room. What? It is? Uh, no, uh Get the door! [All Clamoring.] Shut up! Everybody, shut up. Everybody but Monk. Monk, what's goin' on? [Sighs.] Okay, here's what happened. The woman who founded the meditation center was named Jennie Mandeville. - Who, the confessor? - No. No, no, no. The girl you met was not the realJennie Mandeville. She got the name from a plaque she saw up at the retreat. She needed a fake name. Maybe she liked the sound of it. - What was she doing up there? - She went there to kill Danny Chasen, the guy in the rolltop desk. It was probably her boyfriend's idea. Jewel thieves are like children. They hate to share. This is a very crowded room. This is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very Monk, Monk, Monk, Monk, it's okay. It's okay. Who was her boyfriend? He was the security guard that Randy arrested. He was thejewel thief. He was the inside man. The diamond was still in his pocket when you were talking to him. [Disher.] That's right. We brought him here right from the museum. [Monk.] I remember before the interrogation he was chewing a big piece of gum. But when I saw him after the interrogation, the gum was gone. He must have panicked in that room. You had him on the drug charges. He knew he was about to be arrested which of course meant he'd be searched so he hid the rock right there under the table. [Stottlemeyer.] With his chewing gum! [Monk.] People do it in restaurants all the time. I've written letters to my congressman and to the editor. What can I do? He telephoned his girlfriend from jail to tell her where he stashed the diamond. And that's why she was coming in here confessing to everything. And why she was always asking to switch rooms. She was trying to get in there. Oh oh, okay. I changed my mind. There's seven of us, and we're all adults. - We'll just divide the money seven ways. - No way. We were here first. It's only fair we divide the proceeds. We have been working in tandem. We've not been working in tandem. You've been chasing us. That's not tandem. Excuse me, could I say one thing? You and you and you uh, you're breathing my air. What about them? They're breathing your air, you're breathing his It's complicated. Uh, but if these two dropped back, um Monk. Monk, it's okay. I'll call for help. Okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Gladys. N-N-N-No. Gladys! Gladys! [Dirk.] No! Come on, lady! No! [All Clamoring, Muffled.] Monk? Is that you? [Natalie.] Go home! [Dirk.] No, no, no! Come on. Take the day off. I told you to leave me alone. Somebody barfed in the bathroom! [Clamoring.] Hey! Hey! [Clamoring Continues, Muffled.] [Natalie.] There it is. No! No! [Clamoring.] Okay. Fine. Look. - I'm gonna clean under the table just like you want, okay? - No! No! - Over! Clean over the table! - [Mouthing Words.] [Quietly.] I can't look. Ka-ching. Oh, God. [Laughs.] [Sighs.] She came in again late last night, said she has something to confess to. This time we got a real confession out of her. Okay, listen to this: ""Gladys Menchen, who was employed by a local cleaning service for the last 22 years, will be flown to London on a private jet to pick up her reward."" [Laughs.] ""Miss Menchen found the stolen gem while cleaning under a table in an interrogation room."" What? You're blaming me? Under a table. Why would they even want it back? There's gum all over it. I've got some good news sort of a consolation prize. I talked to the commissioner. He's gonna put you under contract. Really? Put you on a retainer. He has guaranteed you 16 homicides a year for the next two years. [Monk.] Sixteen a year? Well, what hap What about after that? Well, we'll have to take it one year at a time. We'll see."
"The countdown is under way here at Edwards Air Force Base. The new experimental rocket plane, which was developed by Altman Aerodynamics, is scheduled to launch tomorrow morning at 7:30 Pacific Time. The four-man crew will be led by a familiar face, astronaut and civilian test pilot, Steven Wagner. Wagner became a national hero four years ago, when he made a courageous emergency landing in the space shuttle during reentry. A national hero in my very own living room. - But I'll never be a hero to you, will I? - You were once. [Steven.] Is this it? Uh-huh. Between the Sheets: TheJoanne Raphelson Story. You wanna read it? You're Chapter Five. How many chapters are there? Fifteen. Wow. You've been a busy girl, Joanne. [Laughs.] And that's only Volume One. You really went into detail? My editor insisted on it. The juicier, the better. That's why I called you, Steve. I didn't want you to be surprised. I appreciate that, Joanne. I really do. So, has anyone seen this new version yet? Not yet. When do you hand it in? Next week. I'm still proofreading it. Cheers. Oh. [Laughs.] An olive, a cherry and an onion? What do you call this? A Spacewalk. It's my own recipe. It's a good name. I feel like I'm flying. Oh. So, do you wanna read it? I plan to. That's why I'm here. But I've changed my mind. Oh. Hell, I've been a test pilot for 15 years. I once landed a space shuttle in the ocean. I think I can handle whatever's in Chapter Five. So hand it in. Hit me with your best shot. Thank you, Steve. Mmm. Sir, there's a rumor you might be considering a run for Senate. - I don't know. I've been to Washington. - Look at you. - I think I'm a lot safer in outer space. - Damn, you're cute. After this mission, I'm going to sit down and review my options. But I will say this: If I choose to run for public office, I'll treat it like any other mission. I will fully commit, and I will win. Failure is not an option. ~~ [Up-tempo Folk.] ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Disorder and confusion everywhere ~ ~ No one seems to care ~ ~ Well, I do Hey, who's in charge here ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~ ~ Poison in the very air we breathe ~ ~ Do you know what's in the water that you drink, well, I do ~ ~ And it's amazing ~ ~ People think I'm crazy 'cause I worry all the time ~ ~ If you paid attention you'd be worried too ~ ~ You better pay attention or this world we love so much ~ ~ Mightjust kill you ~ ~ I could be wrong now ~ ~ But I don't think so ~ ~'Cause it's a jungle out there ~ ~ It's a jungle out there ~~ Hello?

Come on, Mr. Monk. It would mean so much toJulie. Yeah. L-I can't do it. I'm sorry. L-I can't speak in public. [Stammers.] See, that's not true. Remember when I first started working for you, and you made that list of all your fears and phobias? There were 103 things. Public speaking wasn't one of them. There were a couple of things that I didn't mention. I didn't want you to think I was weird. Why don't you ask the captain? Oh Whatever it is, thank you for asking, but I can't do it. [Chattering.] [Monk Coughing.] The housekeeper has her own key. She comes in every other week. She found the body right here couple hours ago. Her name is, uh, Joanne Raphelson, 36. Former Vegas showgirl. The coroner just took the body. Said she's been dead for five days. So that makes it, uh Two days Wednesday morning. Wednesday? Excuse me. Why are we here? She killed herself, right? Uh, maybe. I'm not sure. I noticed a few things. I wanted to run 'em by you. I found a letter from a publisher in New York. She was about to have a book published. A memoir called Between the Sheets: TheJoanne Raphelson Story. ""Between the"" Oh, yeah, yeah. I get it. I got it. And a check for 50 grand, which she has not deposited. Pretty weird time to hang yourself, huh? Good work, sir. You don't have to sound so surprised, Randy. Oh. I'm not surprised. I'm awestruck. Awestruck. Well, don't be. And that's an order. You're ordering me not to be awestruck? That's right. Stand over there, and don't be awestruck. Yes, sir. Anything else? Uh, yeah. Looks like her computer's missing. There's a power strip with a surge protector, a printer and no computer. Excuse me, sir. Sorry. I've never disobeyed an order in my life. It's really good work. It's awesome. Randy, why don't you go outside and talk to the neighbors? Yes, sir. It's awesome. So, am I right? Something's not kosher. It's her driver's license. How tall you think that stool is? Mmm, about 18 inches? The rope's 7'6"". But according to her license, she's only 5'5"". I'm 5'5"". Step up. You're right. It doesn't add up. So, how long have you lived here? Fifteen years. Maybe 14. You know what? My old lady'd know that. You can ask her when she gets back. If she's sober. Mmm. Hey, you want one of these? Nectarines? They're the perfect fruit. There you go. Oh. Okay. Now, why is the garage door open again? - Benny, what did I tell you about this? - I didn't open it. - Really? Well, then, who did? - Maybe Donna did it. You ever think of that? Your sister couldn't open up a box of crayons. She's six years old, for cryin' out loud. Mr. Cain, I just have a few more questions. How well did you know Miss Raphelson? Not as well as I wanted to, if you get my drift. Hey, she was hot. What a waste. Did she have any visitors last week? Uh, say, Tuesday or Wednesday? Mm-mmm. No. Nobody. Nobody. Not as far as I recall anyway. Oh, for crying Now the Hector's out! - Benny, could you go get your dog, please? - Why should I? Because you opened up the garage. Hey, smart guy, this is a police officer, right? I could have him lock you up. You think about that. How's it going? Captain, this is, uh, Darrell Cain. Darrell Cain, Captain, uh, Leland Stottlemeyer, Natalie Teeger, Adrian Monk. - Hi. - [Disher.] Mr. Cain says he was home last week, but he didn't see Excuse me. That box is addressed toJoanne Raphelson. Yeah. It was on her porch. Well, I'd heard she died. I figured it was up for grabs. You can't just take mail from somebody's porch. Yeah, you can if it's fruit. The law doesn't apply to fruit because it's perishable. Actually, sir, the law does apply to fruit. Are you eating one? No. - I was just putting that back. - Captain, you wanted to see her phone records. Yeah. No calls at all on Tuesday or Monday? The last call she made was Saturday morning at 2:05 a.m. [Line Ringing.] ~~ [Whistling.] Hello. This is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, San Francisco Police. Who's this? ~~ [Instrumental.] [Chattering.] Captain Stottlemeyer? Yeah. Hey. Uh, is this a bad time? Oh, no, no. Some friends are throwing me a little party. It's sort of a tradition. Well, congratulations on your flight. Oh, hey, and, uh, congratulations on that crash landing four years ago. Oh, and, uh, marrying a figure skater. Yeah. Congratulations on your whole damn life. [Chuckling.] Uh, this is Lieutenant Disher, Natalie Teeger and Adrian Monk. Hey. Monk. I know that name. You're the detective, the one who quit. No, l-I didn't quit, uh, exactly. It was a It was a kind of a leave of absence. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Mr. Monk. Some people just can't handle the pressure. L-l-l-I didn't quit. Mr. Wagner, I'm sorry. My daughter just wrote a school paper about you. Good. I need all the P.R. I can get. She's not gonna believe that I met you. Do you mind if I take a picture? Not at all. Thank you. I'm-I'm not a quitter. I didn't quit. There were extenuating circumstances. There always are. The trick is not to let them stop us. - Captain, you said it was important. - Oh, yeah. Um Do you know a woman named Joanne Raphelson? She's dead, isn't she? She finally did it. - You're not surprised. - [Sighs.] Joanne's been depressed for months. For years, really. Was about to have a book published, but somehow that made it worse. Like I was saying to Mr. Monk, some people just can't handle the pressure. It was a psychological discharge, for God's sake. It's only temporary. I plan on being reinstated. He's so much better. How well did you know her? Intimately. - When was the last time you saw her? - Five years ago. No, wait. Uh, she called you on the phone last week. That's true. She calls me once or twice a year when she's lonely, depressed or drunk, and sometimes all three. Steven? Honey, we're cutting the cake. Look, uh, we can talk about this tomorrow, okay? That's all right, Captain. I have no secrets from my wife. Honey, these gentlemen are detectives. Joanne Raphelson is dead. Oh, no. Poor girl. I made a mistake, Captain. Five years ago. Nicole knows all about it. I don't deserve this woman. Excuse me, ma'am. What is that you're drinking? It's called a Spacewalk. My husband invented it. Is-Is-Is that an olive? And an onion and a cherry. It's my claim to fame. Would you like one? No, thank you. Mr. Wagner, I was reading about your flight. They said they almost had to cancel the liftoff. You were running late? That's true. I got lost on my way to Edwards. Can you believe it? You You got lost? I tried a different shortcut. L-l-I guess I'm a better navigator in the sky than I am on the highways. Congressman, glad you could make it. Steve! Hey, when are we gonna have that talk about your future? The sooner, the better. Will you excuse us? Uh, my friends are waiting. We can talk about this some other time? Absolutely. Great. It was nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. He's the guy. Who's the guy? The astronaut. He killed her. Somebody made that exact same drink atJoanne Raphelson's house before she died. Monk, it's not possible. He was in space. He did it. Outer space, Monk. He was on TV. He was orbiting the Earth. You gotta admit it's a pretty good alibi. He He's the guy. Monk, 99 times out of a hundred, I am in your corner. But I just can't see it. Steve Wagner is a national hero. It's true, Mr. Monk. He was on the cover of Time magazine. Actually, it was Newsweek. Actually, it was both. Now, look, we need to tread carefully here. First off, there's no motive. The wife knew about the affair. A lot of people did. But it wasn't just the affair. We just talked toJoanne Raphelson's editor in New York. She was about to hand in her next draft, which contained a couple of real bombshells. - Like? - Like, which of her ex-boyfriends beat her up five years ago. Somebody put her in the hospital. She had a concussion, right? Mm-hmm. And you think Steve Wagner's involved? I just don't believe it. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. Look, Wagner wants to run for office. A story like that would bury him. Okay. Maybe you found a motive. Maybe. But it doesn't matter, and I'll tell you why. Because your suspect, Monk, was in outer space. He wasn't on this planet. It's true. Julie and I watched it on television. The whole world was watching. He took off on Monday, and he landed on Friday. Here's the case file. Now, the coroner is 100% sure. He is certain thatJoanne Raphelson died of ligature strangulation on Wednesday morning while your man was in space. Now, maybe we should take a minute and see if we can think of a better alibi. It's a pretty good alibi. Yep. She had drugs in her system? Barbiturates. Yeah. Coroner said she took some pills. They didn't work, she went to Plan ""B"" and dangled herself. It happens all the time. But you said yourself, the crime scene didn't look kosher. Yeah, Monk, what I'm saying is it might be murder, but it wasn't him. Captain, I think Monk's right. Thank you! Reinforcements. I think I know how Wagner did it. Okay, this is the ship. And let's pretend this globe represents the Earth. That's a globe. It does represent the Earth. Right. Okay. Here's what happened. The first part was easy. He takes off. [Mimicking Engines Firing.] As he passes over San Francisco, he activates the escape pod. Well, wait. Uh, wait. Was there an escape pod on the ship? No, not officially. But I think he smuggled one on. Mm-hmm. And where did he get it the escape pod? He built it. Yeah, out of a kit. In his basement. He's resourceful. Anyway, splashdown. Climbs out of the pod, makes his way to her house, kills her, climbs back onto the pod, fires up the engines, back in space. - Thank you, Randy. That's - It's just a theory. I don't think so. No. I've heard theories before, and, uh, they don't sound like that. [Cell Phone Ringing.] It's him. It's Steve Wagner. Hello? Yes. [Laughs.] Really? Oh, that's wonderful! Uh, tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. Oh, the kids are gonna be so thrilled. Okay, great. I'll see you then. Steve Wagner is speaking atJulie's school for Career Day. Wait. You invited him? Yeah, I met his P.R. Person last night as we were leaving. Natalie, he killed his ex-girlfriend! Monk, maybe you should go too. You think the guy's involved? It'll give you a chance to feel him out. Fine. Okay. I'll do it. You're both coming? I'm gonna be class mom of the year! When I was your age, I was a Boy Scout. Who here knows the Boy Scout motto? [All.] Be prepared! That's right. And that motto saved my life. Because when the landing gear didn't come down, I was prepared. I knew what I had to do. I went around Florida good-bye, Florida over Louisiana and landed the space shuttle here in the Gulf of Mexico with a great big belly flop! [Laughing.] And you weren't even scared? No, I wasn't scared. I was terrified! - [Chuckling.] - People called me a hero. But anybody anybody could have done that. You or you or you or you or you or you. Being brave is being afraid of something, but doing it anyway. What are you gonna do next? Tomorrow, I'm testing a brand-new jet for the air force called the F/ A-22 Raptor. It's the most advanced fighter in the world. She's faster than the speed of sound, so if you hear a big boom in the sky tomorrow, that's me saying, ""Hello, kids."" [Chuckling.] Before I go, I brought some official Steve Wagner laser pointers for all you kids. There you go. Take one, pass them back. Well, I had a great time. And remember, what does Steve Wagner want you to do? [All.] Aim high! Right there. Thank you so much, Mr. Wagner. Wasn't he great? Let's give him a hand. Thank you. Okay, soJulie's next guest is Mr. Adrian Monk, who's also my boss, so everybody be extra nice. He's going to talk about what it's like to be a police detective. [Muttering.] Hi. Hi. I'm I'm, uh I'm [Clears Throat.] Leave it. [Chuckling.] I'm, uh I'm Adrian Monk. Who wants to be a detective when they grow up? What about you? No. No? Everybody in your row has their hand up, so If you put your hand up, um, it would be a perfect row. Put your hand up! - Where's your gun? - Um, I, uh - I don't I don't have one. - You can't carry one 'cause you had a breakdown. [Chuckling.] Oh, well, uh - Julie said you're afraid of milk. - [Chuckling.] Well, everybody's, uh everybody's afraid of something, right? - Julie said you're afraid of everything. - Mr. Monk, l I really Have you ever caught a real killer? Oh, yes. Oh. Yes, I've caught a lot of killers. Some killers are very smart, and some are very powerful. Some are even famous. They don't think they will ever be caught. But in the end, they they are always caught. And I'll tell you why. Because the police can make mistakes. I make mistakes all the time. But, uh But [Chuckling.] See, a-a killer has to be, uh has to [Chuckling.] A killer has to be perfect, and, uh, nobody's perfect. The first police officers appeared in, an in ancient Rome in 200 B.C. They were called centurions. In many ways, they were like our modern police force. It was their job to to [Chuckling.] To enforce laws and to and to maintain order. Uh, they were, uh, chosen for their [Chuckling Continues.] For their loyalty and courage! [Yelling.] Here, Mr. Monk. Drink that. Are you okay? Oh. That was a good, good speech. I think the kids learned a lot. Yeah. They're They're still laughing. Well, they'll have to stop soon. Period's almost over. Oh, I am such a What do you call it? Wuss. No, Mr. Monk, you are not a wuss. Well, I'm not a man. I know that. I'm a mutant. I'm half man, half wuss. I'm a ""muss."" Here you are, our brave centurion. I liked your speech, especially the little dance number at the end. Those laser pointers can be very dangerous. Yeah, they're a real menace. I hear you've been checking up on me calling Joanne's family, her publisher, turning over rocks. If you want to talk to me, let's talk right now, man to ""muss."" Did you hit her? Hit who? Joanne. Did you hit her so hard that she woke up in the hospital? I wouldn't repeat that, Mr. Monk. That's slander. Besides, who would believe it? But that's why you killed her, isn't it? Because she was about to go public. She was about to tell the truth about you. You're a sad little man. I can't believe you and I breathe the same air. I was on a spaceship, Mr. Monk, circling the Earth with my crew. Why doesn't that satisfy you? Am I making you nervous? Never. You know why? [Snaps Fingers.] See? You flinched. See, you're a flincher. You'll never stop me, because when the chips are down, when it really counts, you are always going to flinch. [Chattering.] Sir, sorry to interrupt. We have to go. Would you excuse us? The governor's waiting. [Door Closes.] Oh, my God. You were right. He killed her. That was almost a confession. But how? How did he do it? I mean, they were just toys little red flashlights but I was terrified. I wanted to scream. What What did you do? I screamed. Least, I heard screaming. I'm pretty sure it was me. Adrian, you were giving a speech in front of a group of people. That's real progress. No, really, I'm very proud of you. Yeah. You're never going to be completely free of fear. You can't expect that. But real courage is being afraid of something and doing it anyway. No. What? Steve Wagner said the exact same thing. Really? The The astronaut. Doctor Killed his girlfriend. Wh-Wh-Which I do not condone. It's indefensible, of course. See, now I'm afraid all the time. I'm so tired of being afraid. Adrian, I'm anxious to talk about your phobias. We talked about aversion therapy. [Mutters.] Okay. Let's Let's Let's do it. Let's do it right now. Okay, okay, all right. Here we go. Which of your fears would you like to work on first? Glaciers. Glaciers. No. Rodeos. Ah, glaciers. Glaciers. W-W-Wait. Why don't we just start with a basic one fear of heights? Ah, okay. Heights. Heights. Let's do it. Okay, good. Let's get up on the roof right now. Okay, wait, wait. All right. Wait. Sit. I'll sit. Sit down. Okay, I'm down. I'm sitting down. I'm not I'm not ready for that. Uh, let's Let's just build up to it gradually. Here's what Why don't we sit here and, uh, name really tall things? I'll go first. The Sears Tower. Mmm. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Mmm. No. That That's too tall. Uh, not not the Sears Tower. Just a regular Sears, maybe. Just a regular Sears. Mm-hmm. Department store. Adrian, why don't we work on your phobias another time, okay? Okay. [Sighs.] When l When I look at a man a real man like Steve Wagner I just feel weak. I just feel so inadequate. I know he's guilty, but I'll never be able to prove it. Adrian, Steve Wagner is a human being, and if he's guilty, I know something he's very much afraid of. What's that? You. She's in the house. He is up there in space circling the Earth. Maybe he had an accomplice. No. We have statements from all of the neighbors. There were no visitors, no cars. She was definitely alone. Somehow, he killed her from up there. Well, she collected a lot of dolls. Lot of really ugly dolls. Natalie, holes. How did we miss that? They were drilled recently. So? She wasn't killed out there. She was killed in here. She was found in there, but she could have been killed someplace else. [Clanging.] - Speak of the devil. - Sorry. I didn't know anyone was here. Are you looking for something? I wanted a flower from her garden. She loved this garden. I cared for the girl. I won't deny that. You came a long way to pick a flower. Actually, I was heading up here anyway. I have a test flight at Paxton in a couple of hours. Now it's your turn. What are you doing here? I'm investigating Joanne's murder. Her suicide. It was murder. I think we both know that. Come on, man! Are you deaf? Please, just close the damn garage door! Well, I did, three times! Right! Well, guess what? It's open again! Well, maybe it's broke! It ain't broke! It's brand-new! Holy son of a Look at this! Look at him! He looks just like Hey, you know what? I think that is. Who? The Who? The He's the the guy, the the spaceman from TV. He's famous! Go get the camera, would ya? Stay with your brother! Go get the camera! Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. [Stammering.] Excuse me. Uh, you're You're famous, right? You're that, uh, Steve Walenski? Wagner. Steven Wagner. Wagner! That's I knew that. Wagner! You're the space cowboy, right? Oh, man! You're that dude that landed the space shuttle when it was on fire! That's correct. I lost 10 bucks on that. Sorry to disappoint you. Would you excuse us? We're in the middle of something. Could you excuse us, please? You folks live across the street? Is that right? How Yeah, that's us. Right over here. That's right. How are you, man? Hey, good to meet you. I'm I'm Darrell. This is my daughter Donna here, and, well, this is Benny. Hi. Nice to meet you. What the hell are you doing here? Would you You're curious, aren't you? That's the best thing a boy can have curiosity. I was friends with the lady that lived here. Oh, man. That's a shame. That's That's heartbreaking. Could we get a picture? I can do better than that. I'm flight-testing a brand-new jet in a couple of hours. How'd you like to come and watch? Bring the whole family. Be my guests. Are you you kidding me? They wouldn't mind? You have every right to be there. - You're a taxpayer, right? - Yeah. Sales tax. Could we come too? I'm a big aviation buff fan. [Natalie.] So true. [Monk.] Fan Fan or buff. Such a fanatic. Just I love airplanes. Crazy about the, uh Can't get enough of'em. - The The takeoff. - [Monk.] And the wings and all. [Natalie.] And the landing. [Monk.] What do you call it? The rudder. You wouldn't mind if we come, do you? [Aircraft Passes Overhead.] [Wagner.] We're talking about state-of-the-art technology here. The most advanced warplanes ever built. Some of these planes are prototypes. That means nobody's ever flown 'em. [Darrell.] It sounds dangerous. [Wagner.] It can be dangerous. Then why do you do it? If I didn't do it, Benny, somebody else would. And where's the fun in that? Now, you kids will love this. This is a flight simulator. It's kind of like a Want to check it out? Okay. You grown-ups stay here. We'll be right back. Captain Savo, you're in charge. He is good people. Yeah, he's good people. Hey, how well you know him? Well enough to wonder what he's doing. Let's go in. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's a little dark in there. No, just Let's just wait out here for a while. Paulie, why is this garage door open? Don't know, Sarge. Opened by itself. Maybe we installed it wrong. [Scoffs.] I got the same problem with my garage. It's like an epidemic. Natalie, I know how he did it. I know how he killed her! It's all about the garage doors! It is? Yes! - Dad! - Daddy! [Crying.] - Where's Mr. Wagner? - He left. He said he was late for something. What's wrong, sweetie? The astronaut took her doll. He took her doll? That's it! Natalie, it's all about the doll! You said it was all about the garage door! It's about the doll and the garage doors! It's about both! Mr. Cain, where did you get that doll? L Come on. You stole it, didn't you? It was in a box sitting on Joanne's front porch, and you took it, just like you took the Fruit of the Month box. It was sitting there for three days, all right? I figured she wasn't home. You're a horrible neighbor! Daddy! [Sobbing Continues.] Honey, it's gonna be all right. I wanna go home, Daddy. It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be all right. Sweetie, come on. Huh? This is Captain Savo. I just lost two of my civilians. Notify the law enforcement desk. Okay, thank you. Captain's on his way. We have to find Wagner before he gets rid of that doll. Monk, I don't understand. Here's what happened. Before he left, Wagner must have gone toJoanne's house. He drugged her, but not enough to kill her. Just enough to knock her out for a couple of days. Then he built a machine a murder machine a machine that would hang her on Wednesday, long after he was gone. What kind of machine? A garage door opener. He left her there drugged, probably tied up, and then took off into space with the whole world watching. Mr. Monk, what are you doing? I don't know. They're at Ramp Two. He's handling the missile. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Those are missiles! Th-Th-They could be nuclear weapons! Then stop me, for the love of God. It's all right. [Muttering.] [Alarm Blaring.] I don't understand. She died on Wednesday. How did he activate the machine? It was so simple, it was brilliant. He used a remote control. He taped it or glued it down so it stayed on. Then he put the remote control inside one of those dolls. Then he mailed it to her own house second-day mail. Second-day mail. Wednesday morning! Exactly. It was like a time bomb. - The mailman delivered the remote control, put it on the front porch. - [Beeps.] On the other side of that door, she was being strangled. Oh, my God. But they found her in the living room. After he landed, Wagner went back to her house. He dismantled the machine and moved her body into the other room. It was a perfect plan, except for one thing. The doll was missing! He must have panicked. He went back there again today to find it. He knows that remote can tie him to the murder. His fingerprints are all over it. Excuse me. Hi. Hey, nice ride. Hi. Listen, we're looking for Steve Wagner. He may be on the flight line. I think they just cleared him for takeoff. Great. We'd love to watch. Which way? You can't miss him. He's in a brand-new F/ A-22. Oh. Uh, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hi. Hi. Hello again. Could you settle a bet? My friend and I were wondering if, uh, somebody could drop anything out of the cockpit of an F/ A-22? Of course, uh, I say no way. Of course you can! Like what? Uh, you know, a Japanese doll. - About this big. - Well, there's an air lock, like a chute, to drop flares and emergency transmitters. I owe you one. Go figure. Thank you! [Monk.] That's unbelievable. You win that one. Wait a second. - Hey, where's your escort? - Just go. Just go, go, go! Where you goin'? [Jet Engine Rewing.] No, no, no! Mr. Monk, wait! Wait up! Wagner! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Pull over! Pull over! - Put your hands on your head and get on your knees. - [Rifles Cocking.] Sir, step away from thejet. - [Siren Wailing.] - Please step away from thejet. - San Francisco Police Department! That's my man out there! - [Shouting.] Safe your weapons! Stand down! I say again! Safe your weapons! Stand down! [Engine Whirring Down.] Captain [Indistinct.] The doll, sir. Give me the doll. [Man.] Security team, secure the suspect. Cuff the suspect and secure the aircraft. Control, suspect's secure. Come on. Julie, come on. Mr. Monk, Julie made something for you. What? Well, all my friends at school were talking about what you did and how we were so wrong about Mr. Wagner and how you caught him. Well, um, anyways, I made you this in art class. Oh, Julie. It's a Medal of Valor, 'cause you're the bravest man I've ever known, except for my father. Oh, sweetie. I'm gonna get the camera. Well, l Julie, thank you. L-I mean, thank you. What is that? A pin? Yeah, it's okay. I'll be careful. Yeah, don't Wait, wait, wait. You know, that that can puncture the skin. People get infected. I'll just hold it. How about that? That's just as good. Okay. Okay. Smile. You too, Rambo. Hey, wait. Look. It says ""courage."" Yeah, I see that. I see that. Take take the picture. Okay. ""Cheese!"" No flash. No flash. Retinal scarring."

These side mirrors are pushed in. I don't think this armored car was driven here. It wasn't? No. I think it was carried somehow in the back of a bigger truck. You can see the tire tracks from a larger vehicle. You're right. It was probably an So they brought the armored car here, they unload it. How did they get the drivers out of the cab? With this. Piece of rubber tubing. They drilled the hole here in the Plexiglas. They gassed 'em out. Huh. Randy. Yes, sir. Bag this stuff. [Groans.] He has a toothache. Yeah, I know. He's been bitching about it all week. What, it's a real toothache? Yeah.

Terri, can I have a light, please? Mm-hmm. I want you to open wide and just try to relax. Little wider. Okay, just relax. - [Screams.] - Okay, okay. A little sensitive. Well, I hope you're not in love with that tooth, Lieutenant, because I'm afraid it's gonna have to go. We can either pull it next week, or we can do it today. - The choice is yours. - Let's do it now. Okay, Randy, we're gonna put you under for about 30 minutes. - Not gonna feel a thing. - Uh-huh. As a matter of fact, you're gonna be back here every week for this. And if you're a really good boy, I'm gonna give you a sticker afterwards. What if I'm a bad boy? [Laughs.] [Bloom.] Just breathe.

It should help with the pain. - Don't take more than one every four hours. - Oh, and I almost forgot. Your sticker. [Man.] Captain, there are no reports of any stolen trucks. Well, keep looking. Widen the net. Start at Seattle and work your way south. Captain, here's a copy of the updated manifest. The cash was new, right? Yes, sir. It would have been easily traced. All they took were the negotiable bank certificates. Over $10 million. All right. Let's follow the money. How many fences in the country could handle a haul like this? I'll find out. Captain. Randy. Welcome back. You're working with Patterson on the bank certificates. Get me Frank Davis at the Treasury Department on the line. Put a list together of all the fences. Any fence in the country Captain, do you have a minute? Yeah, what's up? It's about my dentist. Uh, Dr. Bloom? Yeah? I think, um I think he might Did he touch you? Inappropriately? No. Jesus! No! No. - I think he killed a guy. - He what? [Stammers.] It happened. I think that he Dr. Bloom and his assistant Terri I think they murdered someone. You saw it? Yeah, sort of. I was sedated. Uh You were sedated. Randy, one time I was under anesthesia, and I thought my mustache was a chipmunk. I was the Green Lantern once. It was great. I didn't wanna wake up. Look, I was supposed to be out for 30 minutes. Mm-hmm. But I was under for almost two hours. Was there a body? No. Any signs of a struggle? No. Who did they kill? I don't know. It was a guy. Male. Caucasian. - They were arguing about Barry Bonds, and I'm pretty sure that I can I.D. Him. - Baseball player? Yeah! I think that this guy thought that Dr. Bloom kidnapped Barry Bonds. They were arguing about how much Barry Bonds was worth. If your dentist played baseball, you know what team he'd play for. The Yanks. Get it? [Laughs.] It's not funny. It's a little funny, Randy. Look, why don't you, um Take a walk. Clear your head. Here. Drop this off at Monk's. He's waiting for this. Then take the rest of the day off, okay? Go to the movies, go to the beach. Okay? Get out of here. I'll call you later. - Is this everything? The whole file? - Yeah. Monk, can I ask you a question? What do you, uh, normally charge, you know, for someone who wants to hire you? I mean, not the department. A private party. - Like who? - Like me. Is this about the dentist? The captain called us. He said you had a reaction to the anesthesia. - You were probably hallucinating. - No, I wasn't hallucinating. It really happened. I mean, it It was as real as you are right now standing in front of me. Randy. I'm not standing. But if you need my help, you don't have to pay me. All you have to do is ask. I mean, you're one of my oldest friends. I've known you for years. - Thank you. I want you to come back to the dentist's office with me - Let me finish. - Unfortunately, at the moment, I have a lot of things on my plate. - No, you don't. Well, l I have this armored car thing. I have to read this whole file. That's about 120 pages. And I just found a typo, by the way. And I have to replace the lint filter on my dryer. Filters do not replace themselves. Mr. Monk, can I talk to you for a minute? I have to talk to Natalie for a minute. What? Privately? In the kitchen. Now. Okay. Go. Mr. Monk, this is Randy we're talking about. He would do anything for And I would do anything for him except this, Natalie. I can't do it. I have a thing about dentists. You have a thing about everything. That's true. But dentists are in a separate category all together. Okay? I can't even discuss it. I can't even think about discussing it. I can't even talk about thinking about discussing it. Mr. Monk, everybody's afraid of dentists. Not like this. Not like this. Okay, okay, okay. How afraid are you on a scale of one to 10? [Laughs.] Ten? I am so far beyond 10, I laugh at your 10s. I lie awake at night dreaming about 10s. The chair and the probing and the drilling and the rinsing. Okay, Mr. Monk, what do you do when you get a cavity? I don't get a cavity. I don't get cavities. I brush my teeth 12 times a day and I floss every 90 minutes. So you've never been to a dentist. Once. When I was 12. - How'd that go? - Not well. This is ridiculous. We're just gonna go there and look around. You're not a patient. You're not sitting in the chair. There's no probing. There's no drilling. I'll be with you the whole time. But l No. Oh, boy. He's happy to do it. Great. [Natalie Whispering.] I don't see anything. It happened in the other room. Room ""B."" What do you think? Psst. Mr. Monk. Pretty sure this is how the Nazis decorated their bunkers. Don't look at that. Look-Look-Look down. Look at the carpet. What a beautiful carpet. It is a beautiful carpet. Right? Is that better? It is better. [Sighs.] Oh. Highlights for Children. Oh, ""find the hidden picture."" I used to love these. ""Where is the eggbeater?"" It's under the sled. You're right. And the umbrella is in the cloud above the snowman. And the fish is next to the ice skate. Okay, how are you doing that? I read that same issue 35 years ago. It was in the It was in a dentist's office. Natalie, l I can't do this. No, no, no, no, no. You can do this. You can do this. You're doing great. Well Okay, here. Sit down and think about something else, okay? Here. I brought the case file. Concentrate on this. Lieutenant. You back for more?

He can't ever find anything. I'm gonna be right back. I'm gonna be right here. Are you okay? [Groans.] Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. Okay. I was in the chair. Mm-hmm. And They were fighting over there. Okay. Well, I don't see anything. He bought new equipment. He He bought new equipment to replace the stuff that got broken during the fight. Maybe. [Drill Whirring.] - What's that? - It's a drill. [Whirring Continues.] - Don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid. [Whispers.] Don't be afraid. [Whirring Continues.] Don't be afraid. [Natalie.] Mr. Monk, it's okay. We're gonna go home now. You can let go. No, we're not going anywhere. He hasn't seen anything. I think he's seen enough. Is there a problem? Oh. No, no. I just left my cell phone in the other room. Dr. Bloom, this is Adrian Monk. He's a friend of mine. The Adrian Monk? The detective? It's a pleasure to meet you. [Whimpers.] - Apparently, the pleasure's all mine. - He just has a little thing about dentists. You know, it happens to me all the time. I don't take it personally. [Papers Hit Floor.] Let me help you with that. Oh, are you working on the armored car case? I've been reading about it. I'm a bit of a true crime aficionado. I'm sorry. That's classified. Got a couple of hobbies then. True crime and baseball. Baseball? Baseball? Yeah. I'm sure I heard you guys talking about Barry Bonds yesterday. [Cell Phone Ringing.] You know what? People hear a lot of crazy things when they're under sedation. They say a lot of crazy things too. I should write a book, really. Yes, sir. I understand. Okay. We're on our way. We gotta go. That was the captain. Oh! We gotta go. Okay. Take care. [Sniffing.] A couple of fishermen just found him. Well, these two bruises, There's another set of bruises exactly 10 inches apart. Yeah. What caused that? Well, must be something - Thanks a lot. - Well, what do you got? You said it was important. I found this in his trousers. It was in his pants cuff. It's Plexiglas. He's gotta be one of the hijackers. He drilled the hole. So who is he? Turn him over. - I don't recognize him. Do you? - No. Oh, my God. That's the guy. That's the guy from the dentist's office. Randy, I told you to take some time off. No, Captain, that's the guy. I told you I could I.D. Him, and that is definitely the guy. This is the guy that your dentist killed along with his hygienist? - That's right. - This is the guy that they killed in front of you while you were in the chair. That's right. Because Dr. Bloom kidnapped Barry Bonds, and they were arguing about the ransom money. Yeah, what, is that so crazy? [Laughing.] What the hell are you laughin' at, Patterson? I'm not crazy. Nobody said you were crazy, Randy. Out loud. You should have had 'em put some wisdom teeth in. Hey, you can't even spell wisdom teeth, Downey. All right, look, Natalie. What? You and Monk were there, right? Did you notice anything? Mmm. No, l I wasn't really on my game. I have this thing about dentists. Kroger calls it a super-megaphobia. If germs are here and snakes are here, dentists are You see that branch up there, the second one from the top? The one above that one. Captain, are you going to investigate this or not? Randy, you were sedated. You couldn't have seen anything. Fine. I quit. You what? No, I quit. I'm sick and tired of being treated like the village idiot. Here's my gun. Randy, come on. And my badge. I'm not a joke. I'm not here to entertain you. I'm a homicide detective. Randy, don't be ridiculous. Take it. Randy. Randy. Captain, they just I.D.'d the body. Are you ready for this? It's DennyJardeen. Ooh. I know that name. Yeah, he's an ex-cop. Worked the Mission District. He was bad news. [Moans.] He was charged five times. Excessive force, conduct unbecoming. Took an early retirement four years ago. Thanks. What's he doing? Flossing. He's determined never to go back to a dentist again. - [Muffled.] Just pretend I'm not here. - Monk, cut it out. I mean it. This is a floss-free zone. Since when? Since right now. Cut it out. What's this? That's nothing. Background check, Oliver Bloom. You're checking out the dentist? Yeah. I figured it couldn't hurt to check him out. You're doing this for Randy, aren't you? Why don't you just call him? Because he quit. Randy is an adult. He made a decision, and I respect it. You miss him. I can tell. Look, Natalie, it's not like we were going steady, okay? We worked together. He was just another cop. That is not true. You're right. It's not true. He's not just another cop. He was the single most annoying human being to ever wear a badge. [Gargling.] Present company excepted. [Gargling Continues.] Okay, you guys. Let's try this new one. ~~ [Plays Notes.] I printed up some lyric sheets. Why do we need lyric sheets? You're the only one singing. Just so you can follow along so you know what it's about. - We're making a statement. - We are? Okay. Let's do it. From the top. A-five, six, seven, eight. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What was that? - Countin' off. Five, six, seven, eight? That's for dancing. No, it's not. You're supposed to go, ""One, two, three, four."" - Come on. What's the difference? - It's rock and roll, man. Let's do that blues song we used to do. Guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys. Hey, guys, guys! Why don't we just stick to the original material? Okay? That's what the people wanna hear. What people, Randy? We're in my stepfather's garage. Well, Aaron, there might be people one day. I mean, touring. Record deal. Come on, guys. Wasn't that the dream? Maybe 17 years ago in 12th grade. Well, you know what? I still believe in the dream. I believe in the Randy Disher Project. Come on. I quit my job for this. - Big mistake. - All right. Let's just do it, okay? From the top. If you say ""five, six, seven, eight"" again, I quit. I'm just telling you. Do you know what? Do you wanna be the lead singer? 'Scuse me. Uh Can I talk to MickJagger for a second? Yeah. Sure. All right, guys. Take a break, huh? Oh, it's a really good job so far though. Really good. [Snickering.] He quit his job. How's it going? It's good. It's great. I should have done this years ago. Yeah, it's pretty exciting. Um You gotta send me a T-shirt or a hat or something. Or whatever. Uh, listen. I thought you might be interested. We caught a break on the armored car thing. We identified the body. Guy's name is DennyJardeen. He's an ex-cop. He's got a cousin who's done some time who works for a trucking company. So we're gonna go pick him up. I thought you'd like to come along. Why? I mean, I'm not a cop anymore, Leland. Captain. Look. It's my notebook. No more witness statements. Just lyrics and song ideas now. You're writing songs? Yeah, I wrote 17 last night. I'm on fire. I'm sure you are. Uh I also wanted to apologize about the dentist. It's It's just that over the years you've had, uh, s so many unique theories. I wasn't hallucinating. Randy, I checked Dr. Bloom out myself on my own time. The guy is clean. He's got no priors. He's never been in trouble. Just wanted you to know that I took you seriously. The fact is, I miss you. I need you. Well, it's too late. L I'm moved on. I mean, band's my life now. You're more than welcome to come and have a listen if you want. Come on in. Be my guest. Have a seat. Okay. How you doing? [Man.] Hey. I should warn you. You might not like what you hear. It's pretty powerful stuff. You might not be able to handle it. All right, let's rock it out. From the top. A - one, two, three, four.

That was good. That wasn't too bad. That was great. Okay, now before you even knock on the door, I want you to douse this handkerchief with the chloroform, just like this, okay? About 20 c.c.'s. And make sure he really inhales it. I don't know about this. Well, we have to do it. There's no choice. No, no. I know. I mean, I don't know if 20 c.c.'s is enough. How do you know he's gonna talk? Did you see him? He couldn't even shake my hand. He was a mess. Yeah. You get Adrian Monk in here, and I'll make him talk. Neal, your fingerprints were all over the warehouse and on the armored car. You could hire the best lawyer in the city. He's not gonna make those fingerprints disappear. It is all over, and you know it. Okay. I was there, but I did I didn't do the two guards, man. L I tried to stop him. - Stop who? - Denny. DennyJardeen. When the guards fought back, he went postal, man, and started shootin'. - Where's the money, Neal? - Denny's got it. He's keeping it in a shed back behind his place until we all split it up. I got some bad news for ya, Neal. Denny is dead. - Denny? - And there's no money in that little tool shed. - We've already ripped it apart. - Ah, that's impossible. Looks like somebody in your little sewing circle got greedy. You can't trust anybody these days, can you? [Snickers.] [Knocking.] [Knocking.] [Tearfully.] Mr. Monk. I know it's late. Can I come in? Of course. Of course. Thank you. [Sobbing.] W-W-What is it? Lieutenant Disher was right. [Sniffs.] Dr. Bloom killed a man two days ago, and I don't even know who it was. I mean, I've never seen him before or anything. [Sobbing.] I just don't know where else to go. [Crying.] Yeah. A-Are you gonna be crying a lot? Maybe you wanna lean over the sink. No, no. I'm fine. I'm sorry. I'm just scared to death. Yeah. I'll call the captain. No! No. Dr. Bloom would kill me. You can't. Oh, it's okay. The police will protect you. Oh. What is that? What? What, what? I don't know. What is it? It's right It's something on your face, like a smudge. Smudge. Yeah. No. No, you're not getting it. It's right there. Did I get it? No. Here, I'll do it. Hold on. Okay. Did you get it? Uh No? No. It's right there. [Muffled.] Chloroform. You're d You're drugging me. Shh. Just relax. Did you get it? [Slurred.] Did I get it? Did I get it? Did I get it? Natalie. Captain, is Mr. Monk here? What would Monk be doing here? I don't even know what I'm doing here. I called his house to read him tomorrow's weather report like always, but he didn't answer. So I go over there. The door's open. The light's on, but he's not home. The door was open? Thank you for waiting. The doctor will be right with you. There's no rush. ~~ [Humming.] Why are you doing this? Why are you doing this? Please. Please. What are you gonna do? I didn't really have a smudge, did I? Ooh. You should be flattered. The doctor doesn't usually come in this late. Especially for new patients. That tooth. The roots are about aren't they? If you say so. I get it now. I know what happened. The drivers fought back during the hijacking. DennyJardeen got hit in the face. He must have knocked a tooth loose. Jardeen came here to get his tooth fixed. That makes sense. He's an ex-cop, and you're on the medical plan. He must have talked in his sleep. Dr. Bloom said a lot of patients do. He told you everything, about the robbery, where they hid the money. - It must have been like winning the lottery. - If you say so. That night, you went toJardeen's house, found the money, figured it was safe, that he would never remember telling you anything. But you were wrong. He did remember. Or maybe when the money went missing, he just figured it out. He came back here Tuesday night when you were working on Randy. Randy witnessed the whole thing, sort of. He was right about everything. Wasn't he? If you say so. Hello again, Mr. Monk. Is it true that you've only been to the dentist once before? Yeah. I gather it wasn't a good experience. Oh, this will be much worse. I'm I'm a police officer. Oh, I know that. That's precisely why you're here. See, Terri and I, we have some merchandise that we'd like to sell. Open, open, open. Some bank certificates. Now, there's a man in Chicago named Mr. Cronin who would like to buy them, but we're afraid of approaching him because we don't know if he's being watched by the police. Now, my question is is Mr. Cronin under surveillance? I don't know. Have you ever seen the movie Marathon Man, Mr. Monk? No. Is it good? Let's watch. Let's Let's watch it now. I'm not much of a movie guy, but I have some time now. Who's in it? Who's in that? You're not gonna watch it. You're gonna live it. Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance? Yes or no? I don't know. I wish I did. L l I really wish I did. I wish I did. - Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance? - No! [Sobbing.] Is he under surveillance? Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes. We know We know all about him. You You have to be careful. You should be careful. Now I really wish I could believe you, Mr. Monk. [Screams.] [Sobbing.] Your teeth are perfect. I don't see a single cavity. [Whimpers.] Is Mr. Cronin under surveillance? [Whimpers, Mumbles.] He's not saying anything. Pass me the extractor, please. [Pinball Machine Dings.] I still don't see what's wrong with the Randy Disher Project. I never liked that name. Even in high school. [Exhales.] Okay. Okay. What about the Randy Disher Experience? How about Severe Tire Damage? Okay. How about Mellow Knights with a ""K""? I gotta say I'm leaning towards the Randy Disher Experience. How about this? I'm gonna open up a newspaper and the first word I see, that's our name. Baghdad. That's good, actually. I kinda like that. Baghdad. Let me see that. ""13 million in bearer bonds stolen.""

For the love of God, by all that's holy, look into your heart. Look into your heart. I'll wash my damn hands, okay? [Sobs.] Look, the lights are on. No! That's the wrong soap. You gotta use antibacterial soap. Give me the drill. Gotta use the right soap. - This is enough already. Just give me the drill. - Not that soap! - [Whirring.] - [Screams, Moans.] - [Door Opens.] - Drop the drill! Step away from the chair! [Randy.] Don't move, Natalie. Stay there. - Get over there. - Down. Down on your knees now. Both of you. - You okay? - I don't have my cuffs. Here. [Randy.] Your hands. Don't move. Mr. Monk? Oh, God. It's okay. - Oh, God.

I'm a lone wolf. - You're a lone wolf? - Even when I was on the force, I didn't really like having a partner. I can't work with other people. Okay. Well, I think that's kinda sad. I agree. It's very sad. You know, I hope you do get picked. I think it'd be good for you. Don't say that. Yeah. You work with different kinds of people.

I'm here with the attorney general. The attorney general of the United States? He's in here. You want to read it? I don't need to read it. I'm not giving you Escobar. No way, no how. Leland, this case is bigger than San Francisco. Escobar was supplying drugs to seven states. Yeah, but we caught him here. Damn right we did, and we got him on homicide right here in the city of San Francisco. This case represents three years of my life. Well, you have the thanks of a grateful nation. But it's a done deal. A federal indictment's already been filed. [Sighs.] We're gonna try him first. - Sons of bitches. - There's an extradition hearing on Thursday. Here's how it's gonna work You babysit Escobar until then. You bring him to the courthouse. We meet you in the lobby. You drop him off, you go home. What's this, sir? Yeah. I'll tell him. The attorney general says, ""Don't screw it up."" Mr. Daughtry, it says here that you've been excused from jury duty three times before? Yeah. I got a business to run.

So we can all concentrate and not be distracted by uneven venetian blinds. [Blinds Sliding.] Okay, everyone, let's get started. I've done this before, so, um, I would be glad to be our foreman, if there are no objections. [Jurors.] No. [Man.] All right. Great. Well, let's all have a seat. Actually, it'd be best if we all sat in order, if you don't mind. I'm Juror Number Seven, then we'll go this way Number Eight, so forth. Okay. Great. You look happy. This is very exciting for me. I feel like a real American. Excuse me. Do you mind if we tr traded seats? Yeah? Why? Well, I'd rather be number - It's kind of important to me. - Look, the guy is trying to change seats. You know what, pal? Nobody's trading anything with you. Now sit down. Okay? I mean it. Sit. Okay? So I've been on a few juries, and it's customary to start off with a preliminary vote by secret ballot just to see where we all are. Any objections? Great. [Jurors.] No. [Grunts.] [Woman.] Thank you. There you go. Thanks. Anybody mind if I, uh, smoke? [Man.] Oh, please don't smoke. [Jurors Murmuring.] All right, all right, all right. I'm not the one on trial. Okay, folks? Huh? Just pass them down, please. [Juror Number Seven.] All right. Well, let's do this. ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" ""Guilty."" Wow, that was easy. Guess I'll be home for dinner. [Jurors Murmur.] Wait a minute. That was only 11. Who didn't vote? Smudge. You got to be kidding. Oh [Mutters.] [Clears Throat.] [Jurors Clearing Throats.] - Thank you. - It's no problem. - ""Not guilty."" - [Groaning.] That makes it 11 to one. There's always one, isn't there? Always one. - Do you really think he's not guilty? - I don't know. Of course he's guilty. Look at the evidence. They found the knife the knife he used in his knapsack. Plus, the victim identified him. I mean, what more do you want? I don't know. I have a feeling there's more to it. A feeling. I would just like to think about it for a while. What do you need to think about? There's nothing to think about! There's nothing to [Murmuring.] He's guilty. I'm gonna need you all to be quiet. [Man.] Yeah, you'll get quiet right here. Let me concentrate. Shh. I'm gonna walk around now and pace back and forth. Then when I'm ready, I'll tell you the solution. That's how it works. No. No way. You're not alone here. You have to talk to us. Tell us what you're thinking. That's not how I do it. I have a system. It's a gift and a curse. Here's the thing. I don't like working with partners. Well, like it or not, you've got 11 partners now. Pay attention. I'm only gonna say this once. Escobar's hearing is tomorrow at 12:00 noon. We lock this joint down tonight at midnight every exit, every window. for bombs, head to toe. roof and on the roof next door. We arrive at 11:30. At 11:40, we meet Lapides at the elevator and hand him off. After that, he's the bureau's headache. Sir, could you, uh, repeat that, please? Yeah. What part? Uh, everything after ""Pay attention. I'm only gonna say this once."" [Sighs.] [Knocking.] Exhibit 15B. Thank you. What's he doing now? We're not sure. Did you talk to the judge? He says it's too late. He's already sent the alternates home. You're stuck with him. [Chuckles.] [Door Closes.] [Sighs.] [Sneezes.] [Woman.] Bless you. Thank you. [Sniffles, Sighs.] Excuse me. Would you mind trying these on? What for? You're about the same height as the victim, and, uh, I just want to try something. - It'll just take a minute. - What do we got? A fashion show? Huh? [Laughs.] Can you believe this guy? We know that these are the pants that the victim was wearing when he was attacked. Uh, could you step up, please? Of course, you can see where the knife went through the fabric. Well, something doesn't add up. I notice that Mr. Palmer likes to wear his pants low. In the courtroom, we could almost see his bottom part Rear. Posterior. Side - His butt? - Thank you. Look at the wound. He was actually stabbed in the upper thigh. - Doesn't match up. - He's right. Look at that. At least not when he's standing. Could you have a seat, please? Son of a bitch. He was sitting down. - What does that prove? - Mr. Palmer said he was standing up when he was stabbed. He was lying. [Monk.] I think he pulled into that rest stop, saw Robert Perry who was sleeping stabbed himself, pocketed the money, and then blamed everything on Perry. I'm switching my vote to not guilty. [Woman.] Oh, come on. [Woman #2.] What? That is ridiculous. Why would he stab himself? [Man.] We We We should listen to this man. He was a very brave man to stand up against us all. [Dog Barking.] [Barking Continues.] [Man #2.] What about the DNA evidence? You can't just ignore that. They found the victim's blood on Perry's knife. How do we know it was Robert Perry's knife? He denied ever seeing it. Of course he denied it. What the hell do you expect? - Well, his prints weren't on it. - Well, then he wiped 'em off. Huh? Look, it was in his knapsack! Now what the hell kind of a detective are you? I'm the kind of detective who wonders why someone would take the time to wipe down the handle, but not the blade. [Shudders.] Also, the timeline is all wrong. Robert Perry was picked up an hour after the assault less than two miles from there. So what? He wasn't running away. If I had just stabbed somebody - Somebody moved that tarp. - Excuse me? There's a Dumpster down there with a tarp in it. Yesterday the tarp was rolled up and draped over the side. What does this have to do with us or this case? - Or anything. - I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. Okay. What's next? The money. Okay. The money. What happened to the money? - Maybe he buried it. - Lime. Somebody poured lime all over that tarp. I think there's a body down there. Oh, we're never getting out of here. [Bell Rings.] Ah [Sighs.] Hello. I'm Number 11. Yeah, I remember. I know this sounds crazy, but there's a Dumpster downstairs. I saw a police dog sniffing around. I think there's a body under that blue tarp. Judge Rienzo said I should keep an eye on you. He said to report you if you cause any delay or disruption. Is that what you're doing? No. Nah, nah. No. Natalie! Natalie! Mr. Monk, I brought you your dinner! - I'm gonna leave it downstairs! - Dumpster! What? The Dumpster! It's Natalie. There's a body in the Dumpster! You want a hot toddy at Munster? I brought Cobb salad. [Monk.] There's a body in the Dumpster! - I just got the Cobb salad! - What are you talking about? What are you talking about? There is a dead body in the Dumpster! Call Captain Stottlemeyer! Okay, wait. A body? Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. We should not listen to this man. He is ruining America for everybody. Tell me again. I've been called away from the most important case of my career because - 'Cause Mr. Monk said he saw a body. - From up there? From the third floor? While he was deliberating on another case? [Disher.] Captain! We got a body. [Chattering.] [Disher.] Rope everything off. That side too. Yes, sir. Natalie, don't touch anything. Well, he was right about the body. People, whatever happened down there has nothing to do with us. - We still have a job to do. - Maybe we should take another vote. Good idea. Let's just see who stands where, all right? Everybody back. Now, just by a show of hands, - who's still voting guilty? - Guilty. Not guilty? - Six to six. - And we go into extra innings. [Natalie.] Mr. Monk, it's a woman! She's about 60 years old. Who is she? No I.D. No I. D! - No idea? - No I. D! No idea. No I. D! No idea? No""l"" - ""D""! - No idea. No Here, here. ""L"" ""D""! No idea? No I. D! No I. D! No idea? Check her identification. No I. D! No I. D! - Are those orthopedic shoes? - What? Those shoes orthopedic shoes? Yeah, I think so! I remember I saw her in the waiting room! - I think she's a juror! - What? - Juror. Ajuror! - What? What the hell is that? Looks like one of your jurors leaning out of a window talking to a police officer. I want that jury sequestered as of now! [Snoring.] [Snoring Continues.] [Groans.] What are you doing? [Panting.] You were smoking. I'm allowed to smoke. Read the sign. It's keeping me awake. And you're gonna start a fire. Then there's no problem. You're awake. Right? [Coughs.] If there's a fire, you'll see it, and you'll put it out, right? - Hey, right? - Right. [Sighs, Groans.] Ah, don't be such an ass in the jury room. [Groans.] - Good night. - [Coughs.] Good night. [Beeping.] I'd like to confirm a reservation for tomorrow afternoon. My reservation number is X-7-3-2-9-4. Yes. Flight 32 to Bogotá. The two of us me and my husband. Don't worry. We won't be late. [Beeps.] [Sighs.] [Buzzer.] Lieutenant, my nose itches. Forget it. Ah, it doesn't matter. I'll scratch it myself soon enough. [Whispering.] Captain, he just said he was gonna scratch his nose. Okay. [Whispers.] Well, the way he said it It was like a threat. He threatened to scratch his nose? Lieutenant, bring the van around. Let's get this over with. [Chuckles.] Not guilty? - It's still eight to four. - Is that clock right? [Woman.] Number 11,you've made some really good points. I admit that. But everything you said about the timeline, the location of the wound It's all circumstantial. Exactly. What he's doing is he's taking the facts and he's twisting it around like a pretzel. - Now, where's the proof, man? - We don't need any proof. All we need is a reasonable doubt. You know what I say? I say we're at a deadlock, and I say we go back in there right now and tell 'em we got a hung jury. - What is he doing? - I'm afraid to ask. Excuse me. Karl Palmer testified that after he was stabbed, he grabbed this towel off the floor of his car, - and he pressed it against his leg. - So? Now, look at the stains. They're symmetrical. I don't think he just grabbed the towel. I think he folded it - very carefully - [Groans.] Before he used it. [Jurors Grumbling.] [Man.] You know You know, so what? The guy was a neatnik. He was in pain. He'd just been stabbed. Nobody would stop and fold the towel. Yes, that's right. He folded the towel before he stabbed himself. It was definitely self-inflicted. I'm convinced. Me too. Not guilty. - Thank you. - What about you? [Sniffles.] [Laughs.] Not guilty. [Relieved Sighs.] I'd like another vote. Absolutely. All of those voting not guilty. L-I'm switching my vote to guilty. - [Jurors.] What? - What about the towel? It means nothing to me. The vote's 11 to one. - Wow. - Where are you going? To the bathroom. You got a problem with that? [Laughter.] [Chuckles.] Can you believe that? No. I can't. - You're a science teacher, right? - Mm-hmm. Is this what I think it is? It's lime. That's what I thought. I think Number 12 murdered that woman in the Dumpster. - Why? - [Monk.] She needed to get on a jury. I remember her talking to a woman in the assembly room. I think she was looking for someone who lived alone, with no family, who wouldn't be missed. Killing somebody to get on a jury? That's a first. She's been looking at that clock all day. That's right. She's She's waiting for something. She's She's stalling us. She doesn't care what the verdict is. [Whispers.] Look. Whatever way we vote, she'll vote the opposite. But in the first ballot, she voted with us. [Monk.] But she was sitting next to me. She must have seen how I was voting and went the other way. - I don't believe it. - I can prove it I think. But I'm gonna need your help. No. Wait a minute. We can't just Yesterday you said we were partners. I can't do this alone. What'd I miss? [Monk.] Oh, we werejust talking, and Well, we've thought about it, and we've decided that you're right. He's guilty. - Really? - Yeah. We're all changing our vote. In fact, let's make it official. Right. Who's voting guilty? [Sighs.] I'm undecided. L - Just give me a few minutes. - What are you up to? I have every right to change my mind. I think it's time to call the bailiff. - Have a seat, Number 11. - [Jurors Gasp.] We're still deliberating. [Shouting, Indistinct.] [Tape Tearing.] [Woman.] There we go. [Muffled Shouting.] Number 11, I have to thank you. I had to keep everybody here in this room, busy, arguing for a day and a half. I wasn't sure how I was gonna do it, but you made it easy. [Monk.] Don't mention it. Why are you doing this? She's helping her boyfriend escape. She had to have a way to get into this building. How about a little privacy, huh? It's not even. It's not even Shut up. Not even. I've been waiting a long time to do this. It's not even [Muffled Grunting.] - [Bell Rings.] - [Muffled Shouting.] Thanks. [Muffled Shouting.] Listen. Did you check upstairs? There's a drop ceiling Whatever it is, Captain, we got it covered. Okay. - What's that? - It's your receipt. Why don't you keep it as a souvenir. What's going on? [Clattering, Distant.] [Muffled Grunt.] [Muffled Grunting.] [Muffled Clamoring.] [Muffled.] Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-huh. [Muffled.] Thank you. Thank you. [All Shouting, Muffled.] No! No! [Shouting Continues.] [Stomping.] [Shouting Continues.] [Knocking.] - [Natalie.] Mr. Monk? Are you okay? - [Muffled Shouting.] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Mr. Monk, what happened? Here. God. [Muffled.] Oh, God. [Continues, Indistinct.] Wait. Wait, wait. Aah! What? What? I was saying, "" For the love of God, please don't rip off the tape!"" Are you guys okay? [Muffled.] Mm-hmm. Is everyone all right? [Elevator Bell Dings.] [Gunshots Continue.] [Sighs.] You did it, preciosa. [Sighs.] [Cell Phone Ringing.] [Groans.] Hey. Disher. Give me a pack ofJuicy Fruit. Shots fired, third floor. [Panting.] - [Natalie.] Oh, my God! - We need paramedics on three. We're in the north wing. We have two agents down. But they're gonna be okay. They were both wearing vests. They went up. Why would they go upstairs? Can I use that phone? [Man Groans.] Well, he didn't come through here. Get somebody in the basement. Get somebody in the basement. Look down the parking garage. Disher! Calmly! Calmly! Slowly! Slowly! Captain! Captain! It's Monk. Monk? Right here. This way. Slowly. Calm. Outside. [Man.] Look out! Look out! Hello, Miguel. And you must be the fiancée. Aren't you supposed to be upstairs? Some people will do anything to get out of jury duty. Step down, please. Come on. And this is Number Six. She didn't say much, but she was a very important part of the team. Stay cool. I will. I'll stay cool. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Part of the team, huh? Good for you. Yeah. And this is Number Two. Natalie. Hello. You should listen to this man. He is good for America. [Chuckles.] And this is Number Seven. We were kind of co-captains, really. I mean Sort of thing And that's Number Four. He sort of hated my guts in the beginning. You can admit it now. I'll see you at the reunion. Okay? One year from today, Benihana's. You know, that's not gonna happen. [Chuckles.] Think I'll stay and straighten up. No. Are we going? Yeah."
"What was your name again? - Uh, Jack. - Jack. - You live here alone? - Not tonight I don't. Come on. Over here. - What is this stuff? - What stuff? This stuff in your hair. It's glitter. Fairy dust. Why don't you make yourself useful, and open the bed? Bed? Where's the bed? - You're sitting on it. - Right. The bed. Oh, man. Great. I ripped my wife gave me this shirt. Oh, your wife gave you this shirt? / Yeah. Oh, your marriage really is in trouble. Shut up! Shut up. Oh, I'm sorry. No, no, no, no. Uh, don't worry. Is that a camera?

Give it to me! Give it to me! Give me the camera. Give it to me! Michelle? Michelle. MONK Season 5 Epi. 1 Mr. Monk and the Actor Adrian, I just don't know what to say. I'm speechless, and I'm very very proud of you. - No big deal. - No, no, no. I'm very, very proud of you. And it is a big deal. It's just one weekend. I'll be gone for two nights. Two nights alone in a hotel? - I might even leave my room. - Yes. Would you like to come along? I'll treat. / No. - No, I mean it's your vacation. - My treat. But it's your breakthrough. And I think it's the first time since you lost Trudy that you're actually looking forward to something. I am. I'm looking forward. You know, there is a term for this, Adrian. It's called affirmative reflex. And it's a very, very big step. Okay, it's 3:00. I'll see you next - Okay, I'll see you on Wednesday. - Whoa, wait, wait, wait. You know, I was thinking maybe we should eliminate Wednesday. And you can come on Monday and Friday. - Two days a week? - Yeah, how would you feel about that? I don't know what to say. That's only twice as much as a normal person. How many times has Harold Crenshaw come? Adrian, you know I can't talk about another patient. I'll bet he comes three times a week. Loser. Adrian, it's not a contest. The important thing is that you're making real tangible progress. And I couldn't be happier. You know, you've been stuck at square one for a long time. I hate square one. Well then let me be the first to say, welcome to square two. - How many squares are there? - We'll just take it one step at a time. - What square is Harold on? - Doesn't matter. I understand. He's still on square one, isn't he? Blink twice if I'm right. Tangible progress, can you believe it? That's what he said. Tangible progress. - Those were his words. - Good for you. He said that I was on square two. That's a good place to be. What square are you on? Oh, I don't know, Mr. Monk. I never really thought about it. Well, I'd say you were on square five, four or five. That sounds about right. But you're catching up. Oh, I'm so proud of you. Are you proud of yourself? Proud of myself? No, no. That's square-five talk. Work your way up the street. Every door, every neighbor. Report on my desk by the time you go home. - What's going on? - Homicide upstairs. No forced entry. The ME says she's been dead since midnight. Who's that guy? I can't tell you. It's a secret. The captain wants to tell you himself. Okay, when the captain tells you, you gotta act surprised. It's a Hollywood producer. He's making a movie about us. I mean all of us. - What kind of movie? - It's called ""The Killer Astronaut. "" Remember the jet pilot Steve Wagner? Him. It's great. There you are! Hey, are you guys ready for some great news? See that guy over there? He's a television producer. His name is Hoberman. They're making a movie about the astronaut case from last year. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Just surprised. - It gets even better. You know who's sitting in that limousine over there? - David Ruskin. - The actor? He's gonna be playing you. I know him. David Ruskin. I saw him. Trudy Trudy and I saw him in a play. She thought he was handsome. Now he's playing me. Well, I'm glad you're happy, Monk. Because the guy wants to follow you around for a while. - Follow him? - Yeah, to study him. - It's entirely up to you. - Who's playing me? Anybody lined up? Is there any word from casting? I don't know, Randy. I'm thinking Brad Pitt. I mean, if it's in the budget. It's always about the budget. Not enough stuffing here. I think there was something else inside this bear. Could a camera fit in here? Sure. / 'Cause it was facing the pull-out couch. They could have been, you know - Makin' whoopee. - Exactly. - His shirt? - Yeah, she tore it. We found blood and skin under her fingernails. It must have been a heavyweight bout in here. - What's out this way? - It's a balcony. - Hey, Captain. - Hey, David. - How you doing, man? - Good. Welcome. Thanks. - Is she dead? - As a doornail. - Bummer. - Yeah. - So it's cool if I - Absolutely, make yourself comfortable. - Natalie. - How are you? Pleasure. I'm not here, so just ignore me. I'm not here. Is that decaf? Do you think I could get one of those? Where was I? You were headed out to the balcony. Uh, no. No, no, no, no. I have to check over here. Have to look over here. There's not enough stuffing in this bear. I think there was something hidden in here. - You already said that. - Did I? Mr. Monk? We have a visitor. I didn't see you there. - Hey, hey, hey. - Adrian Monk. Hey. Uh, Dave Ruskin. Listen, I am such a big, big fan of yours. And I've been looking forward to this for a long time. Normally I would shake your hand, but people warned me about, you know. No, no, I'm fine. People exaggerate about that stuff. - I can shake hands. - All right, cool. Well, listen, I only got a little while to get inside your head. - So be patient with me. - Well good luck. What's that for? What's the matter with you? - Mr. Ruskin? - Huh? Yeah. Would you mind? You want my no, I'm not I'm just an actor. You want this guy's autograph. He's the real hero. Not me. All right, all right, all right. - What's your name? - Laura. Laura. There you go. Okay. All right, so look, I'm just a fly on the wall. I'm here to watch and learn, all right? You do your magic. - Hi, hey, howdy. - What do you got? Broken glass. Could be a piece of a crystal from a watch. - Bag it. - Bag it! Thank you. You okay? It's just glitter. It was in her hair. It won't come off! What are you doing? No, no. / Just take it! - Black decaf coffee? - Oh, yeah, cool. Hi, Mr. Ruskin. David. Dave Davey Dave. - David Ruskin. - Dave. - Dave's fine. - Dave. Randy Disher. Oh, yeah, Lieutenant Disher. You're in the script. That's right, that's me. Hey, you don't happen to know who's gonna be playing me in the movie, do you? I don't know. The last I heard they were talking to Brad. - Brad Pitt? - Yeah. Really? I swear that's exactly who I thought. Excuse me, I gotta call my mother My girlfriend. - Brad Pitt. - Yep. Thank you. I enjoyed that. My pleasure. My pleasure, Captain. So what do you think? You think this guy's gonna strike again? Oh, no, I doubt it. No, this was a straight-up crime of passion. A one-time deal. This guy will probably go the rest of his life and never cross the line again. Hey! Stay right there. - Stay right there. - I'm just gonna go. - Stay right there. - Relax, I'm just gonna go. You're not going anywhere. I'm calling a cops. I'm just gonna leave. - What's all this? - Yeah, I read about this place. They have artists here who draw the customers. On the walls? What are they, cave dwellers? That's why the place is called Sketches. You know, they sketch people. Natalie, cave dwellers draw on the walls. These people are behaving like cave dwellers. Okay, they're cave dwellers. - Hey, Monk. - God! You gotta see this. David Ruskin's in here. What's he doing? He's doing you. Hey, guys, can I ask you I just wanna ask you a quick just a quick question. I wanna do that thing, you know, that he does with his hands. Oh, yeah, you know No, I can do that. What is that? What is that thing? - He's like as - He floats. It's like he's floating on the sea of - Like that. - All right. Hi. Hey, there he is! There's the man himself. Mr. Monk. - Oh, please, Adrian. - Adrian, okay. - How are you? /- Good. - Or or or Age. Age. Okay. All right, Age. Okay, no problem. Listen, I wanna do that thing, you know, with the hands. The thing you do with the hands. Can you just show me quickly? - Oh, that? - Yeah. - Yeah, that's like - What is it? - You look between your fingers. - Yeah? - You just let your mind go blank. - Well, that won't be hard. - You let the room wash over you. - Yeah, all right. And you can go up, or you can go down. / Okay. And you can lean. Just making connections and just looking for, uh You're looking for inconsistencies. I'm gonna do the same thing with Brad Pitt. - Is this an inconsistency? - Oh, this is a mess. Uh, people, the show's over. We got a job to do here. Lieutenant, why don't you bring the Monk this Monk up to speed? Yes, sir. Okay, the owner's name was Alexis Orlov. He was robbed five times in the last five years. So he slept downstairs in the basement with a gun under his pillow. - What kind of gun? I'm sorry. - No, I'm sorry. No, that was That was a good question. / Oh, good. I just felt instinctually to, uh No, you have to ask what the weapon is. A revolver. Smith and Wesson,.38. With a pearl handle. Orlov ran up the stairs, confronted the doer. There was a struggle, the doer grabbed the gun and got off one shot. Then he ran out the front. Was anything missing? Uh, yeah, the victim's daughter was in here. She did a quick inventory. Said the guy took some cash from the register. Maybe 35 bucks. The Smith and Wesson and a wristwatch. - A wristwatch? - Why would he take only one? Why wouldn't he just take everything in the case? Well, he was probably in a hurry. He was afraid someone heard the shot. No, no, no, no. It's clear from the footprints that he came here first. But he took the cheapest watch in the case. Look, $72. Why would he take the cheapest one and leave all the others? He must have been after that particular watch. - That's like - It's a gift and a curse. I love it! - He says that all the time. - He does? I love that! - It's a gift and a curse. - That's it. - You just nailed it. - That's great. / Really good. No, no, no. No? Do it again for me. Do it again. It's a gift and a curse. See? It's a gift and a curse. No, that's not it. Do it again. Say it again. - It's a gift and a curse. - And a curse. A curse. Do it okay. Gift, gift, gift That, that's almost - Gift, gift, gift - And a curse. Gift and a curse. - No, that's not it. - All right, I'm sorry. Put your mouth in my ear. - Natalie? - Natalie. It's a gift. Natalie. Natalie. - Sounds all right? - Yeah, you sound just like him. It's almost. It's almost You know what I'm gonna do, though. But I'm gonna tape I wear, uh, I wear a wire like you guys do. Oh, there you are. What are you doing? Just getting some air. There's a lot of air inside. Everybody's in there. Breathing away. Yeah, it's a little stuffy for me in there. It's a gift and a curse. It's a gift and a curse. It's a gift and a curse. Mr. Monk, don't you see? It's already happening. What is? / I've been doing a little research on your new pal. Two years ago David Ruskin played an alcoholic in a TV movie. He got so into it, he had to check himself into rehab for three months. A lot of people check themselves into rehab. He doesn't drink! That's the thing. He had all the symptoms of an alcoholic without drinking. He's had at least two other breakdowns. Mr. Monk, I think this man is dangerous. I think he's dangerous to you. Maybe he's just dedicated. Did you ever think of that? Natalie, they're making a movie about me. No, this is something that I might actually come close to almost enjoying. Scratch marks. This was moved recently. Plaster. I think the killer exited this way. I thought he went out the front door. Maybe he started to and then he got scared, came back here. Come on. - It's a gun. - Don't touch it. We should get the captain. We got the preliminary ballistics back. It's the same gun. There's no fingerprints, Monk. No palm prints. Gun's been wiped clean. Wait. What do you got? - Blue glitter. - Glitter? From the other crime scene? Maybe you still had some left on your hands. No, no, no, no. He never touched the gun. I bagged it myself. Anyway, I've washed my hands Really? - Exactly 100? - It's a great number. So the guy that killed the girl in North Beach on Thursday also killed the pawn shop owner last night? That just doesn't track. It would explain that watch he stole. Maybe / He was replacing his own, the one that broke. He's right. - They're both right. - It's worth a shot. If there's a connection, we'd better find it and find it fast. Okay, um, all the overtime you need. Every available man. / Yes, sir. Let's start with victim one, Michelle Cullman. Her file's on my desk. Maybe she knew the pawnshop owner. Maybe she pawned something. Mr. Ruskin, we're in the captain's office. Hello? Mr. Ruskin? David. Sorry. Yeah, where oh, okay. Yeah, sorry, I got a little Where are we, the captain's office? / Yeah. Is that? Yeah, good. Okay, rehearsal's up in 2 minutes. Oh, is that egg salad or tuna fish? Randy. - Captain. - What are you doing here? I was down the street checking out a lead at the pawnshop. Had a couple of minutes to kill. Stopped by. I was curious. - Any luck? - In the case? No, it's a bear. I mean, as far as we can tell, Michelle Cullman was never at the pawnshop. She never pawned anything. There's no connection between them at all. Other than the fact that they were both killed by the same guy. - Keep digging. - Yes, sir. All right, let's do this. - What do you think of the moustache? - Moustache looks great. All right, everybody, we are on. Scene 12, page 15. Captain Stottlemeyer, you enter. You're on the phone! I need a cell phone. Props, cell phone. And, action. Uh, look, I know he's a bit eccentric, but Adrian Monk is the best damn investigator I've ever had. So you tell the mayor, if he goes, I go. That's right. Lieutenant Disher! Lieutenant Disher, you got a minute? Yes, Captain? Uh, what the hell do I say? - The vic - I got it. The victim just received a check for $50,000. Pretty weird time to kill yourself. What do you think? I'll tell you what I think. I think the department doesn't appreciate you enough. Randi, what are you doing? I'm doing what you taught me to do, Captain. Following my instincts. That never happened. Not even once. Am I interrupting something? I was just, uh, looking for evidence. In his mouth? Mr. Monk! We're in here! Something's not Something's wrong here. - How tall was the victim? - 5'7"". Natalie, you're 5'7"". Would you mind I'd do it myself, but I'm afraid of heights. - And needles and germs and milk. - It just doesn't add up. Captain, I am 90 to 95% sure that Steve Wagner killed this woman. The astronaut? Monk, he was in space. Outer space. I don't know how he did it, but he did it. He, um I'm sorry, I gotta stop. Sorry. - Sorry. / David, you all right? - Yeah, no, I'm fine. Just I can't work like this. It's the crew. - What about them? - Well, I mean, look. He has his hat on backwards, right? And he has his hat on frontwards. This guy's hat on backwards/forwards. And then backwards/forwards, backwards/forwards. - I mean everything's like all, you know - So what? How am I supposed to work like that, huh? I mean, how? Can you do that? I can't. I mean, it's not the way I work. So why don't you I'll be in my trailer, all right? And why don't you call me back when everything is less, you know, mixed up! All right? Thanks! Hello? Hey, Adrian. Hey, it's Dave Ruskin. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah. Hey, hey. How are you? What, uh What are you wearing? Oh, this is the costume department gave me this. Is there a problem? Yeah. Yeah, there's a problem. It's my performance. Just today. It was just crap. I don't have it. You don't have what? You. I mean, I don't I don't have you. I mean, I have you. I have your tics and your mannerisms and all that little like You know like little tic, tic, tic, tic, tic. But that doesn't mean anything. You know, that's nothing. That's just all, you know what is that, right? It's not the thing. It's just, like, surface tension. It's like, it's not the thing. Not the The heart the why. I need to know the why. How long have you lived here? Okay. See, here we go. This is it. See, here's the thing. I want you to take me to Monk school. And this is what I need. I need you to teach me. I mean, you have all these compulsions. And these you know, these phobias. But it would cripple most people. You I mean, you keep going. How do you Sit down, relax. How do you do it? Why don't you stop? Why do you do it? I need to know why do you do it? My job. No, that's not it. That's what I thought too, but that is not it. No. - Is this her? - Yeah. Yeah, but please don't - This is Trudy? - Touch. She's beautiful. - Tell me about her. - Um / Tell me. I never deserved her. The world never deserved her. You never deserved her. - Nobody deserved her? - No, not - You never deserved her? - No, I really I mean, the world - No one deserved her? - Not um, nah. See that? That's what I need to feel. I need to feel. I need to feel what you feel. - That's what I need to feel. - You don't wanna do that. It's not a question of whether I want to do it. I have to do it. - It's my job. - All right. Some people don't believe that, but I believe it. Because you have to tell the truth of the story. If you don't tell the truth of the story, then the whole st - Be careful. - It's a lie. And if you lie if you lie, then the audience doesn't care. They don't what's this? Is this the way she was killed? She She said she was going out to run an errand for Ambrose. Who's Ambrose? My brother. We have a brother? She pulled into this parking garage on Giraldi Street. I know Giraldi Street. I still don't know what she was doing there. And the person responsible for this. The man who did this. - He's still out there. - Oh, yes. That must be torture. - Is it torture? - Yes, it's - Is it torture? - It's See, this is it. This is the key. That's why you do this. You can't find Trudy's killer, so you do the next best thing. You track down and you capture other criminals. It's not enough. - No, it's not enough. - It's not. Not really. No, it's not enough. It'll never be enough. Natalie, it's me. - At least I think it's me. - Oh, my God, Mr. Monk, what time is it? You were right about actors. He's completely unstable. Oh, God, what did he do? Oh, he's so selfish. He's immature. Get this, he came barging into my house in the middle of the night. Woke me up because he felt like talking. Can't imagine what that would be like. So we talked for hours. I will say this, he gets me. He really gets me. He understands about Trudy. He was dredging up these feelings. Feelings I haven't had in years. And then he made us food. Fried eggs with the yolk exactly in the center. I mean exactly. He used a ruler just the way I like it. It was confusing, but delicious. Confusing. But delicious. And then he said he was tired. And he asked me to leave. - So you left? - He has to get up at 6:00. Mr. Monk, that's your house. Boy, he's a good actor. All right, all right. Okay. So you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna call that producer tomorrow to see if he has any ideas, all right? So I guess you're staying for the rest of the night? All right, I'll get some sheets. No. What's all this? Oh, some boy wrote Julie a note. - It's all ripped up. - Oh, she didn't want me to read it. So she tore it up. So no one could see it. Make that piece no, no, that piece. Now, that's, uh No, that's not his. That's hers. Now, take that piece. No, yeah, that piece. Uh, yes, raise yours, Natalie. That could go a little to the right. There. Up. It's the hand. Look, the hand. Yeah, that goes to the right. Is that an eyebrow? No, that's a moustache. How you doin'? We were looking at this case all wrong. It wasn't a burglary. It was all about the wall. The whole time. Here's what happened. The killer was in here last Thursday night. This is where he met Michelle Cullman. They have an artist in here a few nights a week sketching the customers. He drew their picture right there on the wall. After the murder, the killer remembered the sketch. That sketch could hang him. It could prove that he was with the victim the night she died. And it would prove what he was wearing. The same shirt we found at the murder scene. He had to destroy that sketch. So he smashed through the wall and pretended it was part of a burglary. He just pretended to be breaking into a pawn shop. It was never about the pawnshop. I know. You know? I was here ten minutes ago when Monk was explaining it to you. Excuse me? - Can I help you? - I wish you could. I'm looking for clues. My wife Trudy was murdered here. Okay, we made him! He paid with a credit card. Can you believe that? / He owns an auto dealership in Livingston. Matty, get the street tac team on the phone. I'm gonna wanna shut down the entire block. Lieutenant, I'm talking to a parking garage attendant. He's calling from Giraldi Street. He says Adrian Monk is there. He's been there for an hour. Acting kind of weird. Talking to himself. He wants to know if we can vouch for him. Giraldi Street is where Trudy was killed. He goes there all the time. - Actually, let me talk to this guy. - Line two. Why would she back in? - Mr. Monk. - It doesn't make sense. I just talked to Lieutenant Disher. He wanted me to let you know that they just ID'd the guy. Who? The man who killed Trudy? I don't know, all he said is his name is Jack Leveret. He owns Leveret Motors on Hamilton. And they're all heading over there now. Finally. After all these years. Where's Hamilton Street? Three blocks east. You can't miss it. / Okay. Thanks! Sergeant, what the hell is going on? Captain, stay down! - We got a suspect in there. - Change of plans. We have a hostage situation. A man walked into the showroom five minutes ago, waving a gun and looking for the owner. He kept saying, ""You killed my wife. You killed Trudy. "" Trudy? It's Monk! It's Monk in there! Put your weapons down! Everybody relax! Stand down! Put it down! What the hell is he doing? Captain? What's it about? That's a little confusing. Do you know why she backed into the parking space? Do you know why? I'll tell you why. Because she was there to meet you. But she didn't trust you. Mister, listen to me. Listen to me! I swear to God I don't know anybody named Trudy! Liar! / No! Shut up! David. David, David. Oh, my God. There's another one? What are you guys from, some cult? Help, somebody! - Shut up! - Quiet! David! David! - Quiet! - David. David, David, come on. Adrian. Adrian, listen. Oh, my God. That's my weapon. You found my lockbox. You guessed the combination. I know my combination. It's Trudy's birthday. And now I'm going to give her the perfect birthday gift. No, no, no, no, no! Adrian, look, look, look. - What? - Look. Look. That tag, that sticker is peeling off. Why don't you fix that? - Why don't you want to fix it? - No. Don't you wanna fix Why don't you want to fix it? - Why don't you? - Okay. No, it's not. It's not really. It's not. It's not really No, it's not. It's not really down. - The left corner's bent. - Well, I know. No, there's a big bubble in the middle. / I know. - Okay, yeah. - That's good. Get it hard, though. I mean, just press it down. - That corner's torn. - I know. - Now there's two bubbles in the back. - More around. I can't believe what I'm seeing. No! No! David! No, no, no! Adrian, he didn't kill Trudy! He didn't kill Trudy. He killed a woman named Michelle. Who? / A woman named Michelle Cullman and a pawnbroker named Orlov. Yes, that's true. I killed a woman, and I killed an old man. I've never even met Trudy. Who the hell is Trudy? She was my life! - She was my life! - Adrian! Okay, listen to me. Trudy wouldn't want you to do this, would she? She wouldn't want you to do this. No. Not Trudy. No, she wouldn't want me - I know, I know. - It's okay. - That's okay. - I know. - It's okay. - I know. I know. That's okay. I know. It's okay. I know. It's all right. It's over now. Sorry, I just I was just That day, she wanted me to go with her. What? She wanted me to go with her that day. - And I - No. - No, no, no, no, no. - Yeah, she did. It's my fault. It's my fault. That's right. I said I was tired. That's right, she That's true. I'm sorry. - I could have saved her. - I'm sorry. - Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. Oh, Trudy. Trudy. Oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't That must have been a traumatic experience for you, Adrian. And what, they cancelled the movie? He said he wanted to play a character that wasn't so dark and depressing. He's in England doing Hamlet. How about the little getaway you were planning? The weekend away? All right, okay. Maybe another time. I guess I'm back to square one. It's nice to be home. Adrian, please don't be hard on yourself. Now, I think maybe we should go back to the three days a week for just a little while. That would be Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. And Tuesdays. Tuesday would be four days a week Adri Okay. No, I can see that. You know, just until you're back on your feet. And Thursdays. Well, now, Thursdays is five days a week, Adrian. Okay, that way, five days a week, that would be easier to remember. And Saturday. Well, Saturday is the weekend, Adrian. And I don't like to see patients on the weekends. - Saturday! - Adrian, I have a family. And I like to keep the weekends free. - Saturday. - Saturday. Okay, fine. We'll try that for a week or two. So that would be Monday, Tuesday And Sunday."

Negotiations between the city and the sanitation workers have completely broken down. So, how are residents coping? Well, so far, the people of San Francisco can be very proud of themselves.

It's a figure of speech. Well, Mr. Monk, you need to be careful what you wish for. Look. Because of his death, the union has stopped all negotiations. Nobody's talking. The strike's gonna go on for years. Good job. Union! Union! Union! Union! I've known Jimmy Cusack I've known Jimmy Cusack my whole life. His old man and my old man came up together. They rode the same truck. Now, Jimmy had a temper. And Jimmy had his problems. But he was not suicidal. No way, no how! Damn straight! Now, Mayor Nicholson and his lap dogs down at the police department They're telling us the case is closed. Here's what we say. Mayor Nicholson, you can go to hell! Union! Union! Union! Union! Hello. My name My name is Adrian Monk. Uh I.. I am not technically a sanitation worker. Although, I have always felt like one. In spirit I recognize a lot of you. Ronnie, Morris. Excuse me, sir? We appreciate your support. But this is a closed meeting. I I won't be long. I just wanted to say You've made your point. Congratulations! We get it now. You can all go back to work. Union! Now, w w wait a minute. What about our contract? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay, I know money is important. - Damn right. But, that's not why you guys became garbage men, is it? You're doing God's work out there. You're keeping the streets clean for the people. Right? You do it Say it with me For the people. Oh, and let me tell you something. The people are suffering. The people People are going a little nuts out there. The people can't wash the stink off their hands. The people are having trouble sleeping. People woke up this morning at 5:00. Couldn't get back to sleep because Smelled like a buffalo had died in the people's closets! Sir, excuse me. Excuse me, sir? Are you Adrian Monk, the detective? Y yeah, that's right. We've heard a lot about you, Mr. Monk. You're a great detective and from what we can tell, you're an honest man. You're on your own, right? You're not working for the cops? - I'm a private consultant. - Well, good. Then, you'll be an objective voice. - We wanna hire you. - Hire me? We want you to look into what happened to Jimmy Cusack. If you say it's a suicide, that'll be good enough for us. We'll go back to the bargaining table. I'm pretty sure it was a suicide. How can you tell? Don't you have to, you know, look around? - Investigate? - Yeah. That's right. - Jimmy Cusack was sitting there. - Yup. Okay. But, there was somebody else here. And they he had his feet up. And he ate all the cashews. What does that mean? He probably liked the cashews best. - Damn - You okay? Yeah, I just I'm just just hard to think. It's the smell. It's the smell. Okay. Give me the timeline. I've got it right here. Now, Cusack was last seen alive in here sitting at his desk at around 9:30. Cleaning crew found him this morning at 7:00. Our coroner said the body had been cold about seven hours. So, midnight Was he upset about something or or depressed? Besides the whole city hating his guts, as a matter of fact, he was. Ron! This is Ron Nealy. He's the chief accountant with the union. Adrian Monk. / I was, uh, going through the books yesterday, getting ready for the next round of talks, and I found a few irregularities. went poof. - 304.2, actually. - Yeah. I called Jimmy about midnight and asked him about it. What what did he say? He kind of groaned. And then he said, - ""What took you so long?"" - Oh That That sounds like suicide. But, you are the independent investigator and you have to decide for yourself. - I'm gonna say suicide. - Suicide it is. Thank you, Mr. Nealy. - That was easy. - W.. w.. w wait. No, no no. You haven't even looked around. - I did. I looked around. - No, no no no. You didn't do the thing. You know. With your hands. With your hands Come on. Come on. He was left-handed? He's holding the gun in his right hand. His left hand was bandaged. So, he He probably sprained his wrist and couldn't hold the gun in his left. What, what? The bullet hole and the blood spatter. He must have been sitting all the way back in this chair. How did he raise his arm? There's no room. These are the bullets from the gun. That's strange. - What? - No fingerprints. They've been wiped clean. So, why would anyone who's about to kill himself wipe the fingerprints off the bullets? Whoa, whoa, wait. What are you saying? It was murder? Yeah. Captain. Captain! Captain. Mr. Monk, who hired you? Well, the sanitation union asked me to look at the evidence. And what do you think? Was the coroner right? Well Uh / Mr. Monk, was this suicide or murder? No, no no no. There was no murder. This is definitely suicide. Well, let's try and get everybody back to the bargaining table and get all this garbage off the street. - Okay, well, thank you. - Thank you. Of course there will be a formal inquest. But, as of this moment, the police department is completely satisfied that union president Jimmy Cusack died by his own hand. Now that conclusion has just been verified by Adrian Monk, a distinguished independent investigator. Captain! captain! So, you're saying the case is closed? It is. As far as I'm concerned, the case is closed. Thank you. - What? - You know what. Mr. Monk, I'm so disappointed in you. What took you so long? Mr. Monk, you lied back there. About a murder case! Oh, great. Okay, look. I'm not 100% sure it was murder. It could have been suicide. Detective Thurber agrees with me. Mr. Monk, I was with you. You showed me all the evidence the the blood on the chair, no fingerprints on the bullets Natalie, I'll see. You don't understand. - Some things are bigger than the truth. - Like what? Like that mountain of garbage out there! The truth is buried alive out there. Look at me. Look at me. Seriously. I don't think that I can work for a dishonest man. It was for the greater good. You've heard of that, right? The greater good? Turn on the news! They resume negotiations. Everybody's talking again. I am the hero here. You are not a hero, Mr. Monk. You are letting a killer go free so you can get your garbage picked up. Okay, Natalie. Let me explain one more time. About the greater good. You think I'm joking, Mr. Monk. I'm not kidding, okay? Now, come on! Okay, now now not a good time. Okay, you know what? This is enough! I know you think that I'm kidding. - I can't just go in there - I'm not gonna show up tomorrow. - Can I help you? - This is it! - Tell him. - Okay. All right. What? - It was a murder. - Louder! It was a murder. You're not talking about the Jimmy Cusack case, are you? Yeah, Mr. Monk here saw some stuff at the crime scene he's failed to mention. - He thinks it's a homicide. - It was for the G.G. Th the greater good! The G.G. Captain, it was The stench out there. The stench! I I can't think straight. A smell like that can kill! People die from smells every day. That's a fact. - That is a beautiful suit. - Monk!. defending your suicide theory. I was on TV! My name was across the screen. I'm gonna look like an idiot. Call call Larry Cutler at the mayor's office. Get him on the phone right now. Dial faster. - I'm dialing. - Dial like the wind! - Are you happy now? - Someone had to do it. - Larry, hey, it's Randy Disher. - Hey, Larry. Uh, yeah, I'm here with Adrian Monk. Listen, he's having second thoughts about the Jimmy Cusack suicide. - Ah, why do I have to be so good? - I know Why can't I be like a regular detective like The deputy mayor wants to see you. This is the main rotunda, the heart of City Hall. The acoustics in this room are a little bit quirky. I need two volunteers. Okay, you two. Go over there. Keep going. Okay, now whisper something to each other. Be very quiet. - This is so boring. - Yeah, I know. I hope they have a gift shop. It's called the whisper spot. Isn't that cool? All right, come with me. Now, I wanna show you the mailroom. Ah, I still smell it. Well, it's the same air. Did you think City Hall was some kind of magical place like the land of Oz where nothing bad ever happens? - Yes, yes. I did. - I did too. - Larry. - Captain Stottlemeyer. - How are you doing? It's the worst week of my life. Thanks for asking. I'm 30 years old. I'm eating antacids like they're M&M's. - Is this Monk? - Yes. Hello. I didn't quite understand about the M and Ms. It was a joke, Mr. Monk. But, here's a real joke., rumor about you changing your mind. Boom, it all hit the fan. The negotiations are kaput. The union walked out. Nobody's talking. It's over! Mr. Mayor, I'm so sorry. There's a man here says he's a former detective. He's out there mumbling something about his wife and car bomb. Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry to interrupt. I know you're very busy. - My name's Adrian Monk. - Wa wait. Detective Monk? Come on in. Dennis, it's fine. Karen, it's okay, Mr. Monk is on our team. I hope. - So, Adrian Monk, we meet at last. - Yeah. You know, my predecessor, Mayor Dunaway, said some really great things about you. - You have an amazing track record. - Well Go ahead. Please, sit down. I, uh I'm okay. I'm I'm I'm fine, sir. Oh, yes. You know, my garbage hasn't been collected either. We're all in this together, Mr. Monk. - Did, uh, you talk to the deputy mayor? - Yes. Yes, yes, I did. - He explained the situation. - Right. Frankly, we're stuck. Nobody's talking. Nobody trusts anybody. We gotta solve this Jimmy Cusack case ASAP. / All right. - What do you think? - Okay, uh, here's the thing, Mr. Mayor. Even if I do find the man who killed Jimmy Cusack, even if the strike ends tomorrow, it's not gonna solve the big problem. - What problem is that? - Your Honor, we have got to, um You've get to face facts. The city is ruined forever. It's a total loss. Even if we clean up all the garbage tomorrow, we'll never get the stink out. It's like the dining room carpet when the cat makes a a B.M. on there. I mean, what do you? You don't have any choice really. You gotta replace the carpet. You gotta You gotta get rid of the cat. And you can never eat in that dining room again, can you? No, you can't. But, I do have a plan. - I have a plan. - Oh, good. Yes sir. It just came to me last night in a vision. One, we evacuate the city. Every man, woman, and child. - Evacuate - Two. We burn it down. We just burn it. - Scorched earth. - Huh. Then, just to be safe, we collect all the ashes. And what do we do? We burn the ashes Three. We bring everybody back and we start over. Think of it. Just think of it. We rebuild San Francisco. From scratch. Start fresh. Everything clean. Everything brand new. Gonna have that new city smell. Fresh off the lot. We can even straighten out Lombard Street while we're at it. - Maybe. - Yeah. Yeah. But, sir, if you don't write it down, you'll you'll forget it. Oh, I don't think I'm gonna forget this. - So you'll think about it. - Oh, yes. Yes, absolutely. I promise. Yeah, but, Mr. Monk. I'm gonna need you to promise me something. / Anything. I want you to promise that you're gonna get some sleep before you start working on this murder case. Yeah. Are you okay? Scuff marks Oh, yeah, yeah. New shoes. Yeah, no big deal. You like cashews? Oh, yeah, my wife says I like them too much. - Here, help yourself. - No, no thanks. I'm gonna go back to Jimmy Cusack's office and have a look around. Oh, yeah. Ever been there? Jimmy Cusack's office? No, never have. Well, you let me know if you find something, now. - Keep me in the loop. - Funny I was talking to somebody. They said they thought they saw you there the night he died. Well, they're mistaken. What would I be doing in Jimmy Cusack's office? He hated my guts. - Everybody knew that. - Right. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to make some calls right now. - So, good luck to you, Mr. Monk. - Yeah. Anything you need, be sure and let me know, okay? / Right. There he is. What took you so long? I was upstairs talking to the mayor. You were in his office? I just broke the Cusack case wide open. - You have a suspect. - Oh, yeah. - I have a suspect. - Well, who is it? Okay But, you can't tell anybody. This is big. This is going to rip the city apart. Reporters. Over here. - Okay - Hang on, hang on. Just a little bit further. Just to make sure. What is it? Okay, but you have to promise me that you won't tell anyone until I am 100% sure. Absolutely. What Cause if I am right, this is gonna be the biggest story of the year. The mayor was in Jimmy Cusack's office the night he was killed. Are you saying the mayor is Mayor Nicholson's the guy? I am saying he was involved. He is definitely hiding something. Wow. I mean, wow. - What do we do? - I don't know. But, Monk is right. We have to be very careful. Nobody says a word. Not a Oh, hell. Captain, Captain! Enough is enough! Enough is enough! Mayor Nicholson! You cannot hide in there forever. We know what you did! You have blood on your hands! - What do we want? - Justice for Jimmy! Enough is enough! Enough is enough! Enough is enough! Ah, I've done it again. Made the situation worse. The union wants the mayor indicted for murder. The mayor's denying everything. And I haven't slept in nine days. It keeps piling up. I always hated garbage. Even when I was a kid. We lived 2.2 miles from the city dump. I used to lie in bed smelling it. Had nightmares all the time. About trash bags. Piling up outside. Higher and higher Until we couldn't leave the house. We were buried alive. And now, it's coming true. Dr. Kroger? Adrian, have you been sending me your trash? No See I've been getting boxes of trash sent to me in the mail. - Really? - Yeah, really. Now, Adrian, don't deny it. It's all sorted according to color and food groups. It's your handwriting on the label. It's upsetting my wife. It's upsetting my children. And I want it to stop. Adrian, do you hear me? I want it to stop! I want it to stop too. Uh! Oh! Mr. Monk, maybe we missed him. No, he always uses this door to avoid the press. He'll be out soon. He has to go home sometime. Yeah, so do I. Uh, it looks like rain. That'll help, right? It'll wash away the stench. Yeah Contaminate the city's water supply. Probably kill half a million people. Yeah, that's the spirit. Oh, Your Honor! Mr. Mayor! That's the guy. Get him outta here! Sir, this will only take a minute. You know, let him through. Let him through. I wanna talk to this guy. Mr. Monk, do you have any idea what you've done to me? I've been accused of a lot of things. Matter of fact, I've been accused of just about everything. But, this? We asked you to look into a man's death. We never expected you to accuse the mayor of homicide! No, no, you have to understand. He's having a really tough week. - Tougher than this? - Here's the thing. It might be months before there's an indictment. Then, there's the trial, which could take forever. The union won't go back to work until there is a verdict. - What do you want me to do? - Well, if it isn't too inconvenient I was thinking, maybe, you could confess and then resign temporarily Sir, you were in Jimmy Cusack's office that night. Why are you lying about that? Sir, don't answer that. The mayor was at home Monday night with his wife all night from 8:00 on. You have any other questions, submit them to the District Attorney's office. - Okay, let's go, sir. - See, it's my umbrella. Where was it? It was in a drugstore downtown on Minton Street. Somebody turned it in. A drugstore? I was never in any drugstore. Here, take this. Nata uh Natalie. Was it raining Monday night? I think so, Mr. Monk. Why? Oh, you mean the plaid umbrella? Yeah, I found it, uh, Tuesday morning. I was punching out. It was right over here. It said ""Property of City Hall,"" so I dropped it off. Is there a reward? Yeah. You did the right thing. That's your reward. Jimmy Cusack was killed right around midnight, just up the street. Do you have any more of these Odor Eaters? How many do you need? Oh, about a trillion. All right, Mr. Decker, back to the umbrella. - Did you notice who left it? - No. Do you happened to have the sales receipts from that night? Maybe. Is there a reward? Here's one from 1:00 am, sir. You wanna tell me what this is all about? - No. - OK. Fair enough. Here it is. Here it is. Bottled water. A pack of Belgium Gold cigarettes. And - A wrist bandage. - Of course! Here's what happened The mayor snuck into Jimmy Cusack's office shot him in the head. He made it look like a suicide. Then, he realized that he had just made the biggest mistake of his life. Because Jimmy Cusack was Left-handed. Nobody would ever believe he would shoot himself with this right hand. But, Jimmy Cusack was already dead. What could the Mayor do? Put a bandage on the other wrist. Exactly! He walked two blocks, came in here, bought the wrist bandage, then he went back to Jimmy Cusack's office and made it look like Jimmy Cusack had a sprained left hand. And it would have worked too, except He forgot his umbrella. Well, it should be easy enough to prove. He's the mayor, for God's sake. - Who rang this up? - Let's see. It says, uh Cashier number one. Oh, that would be me. Well, do you remember who you sold that to? - Maybe I do. - There's no reward. I have no idea. There's so many people that come here. It could have been anybody. We get all kinds in here. Okay. Was it him? The mayor? What would the mayor be doing in my store at 12:30 in the morning? Buying a wrist bandage! No. It it wasn't him. It was him. It wasn't him. It was him! No, it wasn't him. - It was him. - Look, I'm not an idiot. I think I would notice if the mayor of San Francisco was in my store at 12:30 in the morning! It wasn't him. So you were wrong? Cuz usually when you say ""Here's what happened"", It's pretty much what happened. Captain, it's the stench. It's everywhere. I I can't possibly It wasn't the mayor, Monk! Oh, hell! I'm gonna have to go out to the press and retract everything. So? What's the big deal? What, like he's never been wrong before? No, no he hasn't. Thank God you're here. He's having some sort of breakdown. - He won't even talk to me. - What the hell's he doing? He's cleaning up San Francisco single handedly. Hey, Captain! Lieutenant! Where did he get the truck? He told the dispatcher it was a police emergency. He's like a vigilante. A garbage vigilante. You could say that, but don't. Hey, Monk! How you doing? So far so fabulous. I've done seven eight nine houses. Well, good for you. That looks great. / Yeah. You intend to clean up the entire city up by yourself? Well that's the plan, Stan. Street by street. One bag at a time. One bag at a time. One bag at a time. Where are you gonna put the garbage? I got it all figured. When this truck's full, gonna drive it into the bay. Then come back, get another truck. Keep driving them into the bay. One bag at a time. One truck at a time. One bag at a time. One truck at a time. - Well, so long as you got a plan. - Yeah. But, Mr. Monk, the case, remember? Jimmy Cusack. I forgot to tell you. I solved that case about an hour ago. Wa wait. You solved the case? Take a look, take a look, take a little look. This was stapled to a telephone pole that was right in front of us the whole time. He's the guy! - Who's the guy? - Alice Cooper? Monk, are you telling us that Alice Cooper, the rock star, killed Jimmy Cusack? First off. I don't think Alice Cooper is his real name. Take a closer look. He is sitting in an antique wingback chair. The same kind of chair Jimmy Cusack was sitting in when he was killed. - Check this out. - What? Check out the date. April 5th. Monday night. Same night as the murder. Coincidence? - Yeah, coincidence. - Ah! No. No, we were we were looking at this case all wrong. Cause it never was about Cusack. It was never about the garage strike. And it was never about the Sanitation Union. It was about the chair. The antique chair. The antique wingback Cusack chair! Here's what happened It is no secret that rock and roll stars collect antiques. Especially antique chairs. What the hell are you talking about? Alice Cooper must have read about Jimmy Cusack's handcrafted wingback chair. He was consumed with envy. He was consumed with resentment. Alice had to possess the fairest antique wingback chair in all the land. Uh! Should I be writing this down? Nope. It's true. Alice Cooper is a hippie. But he's the bad kind of hippie. He's the kind of hippie that break into people's offices and beats them up and shoots them in the head. Why? To steal their antique chairs. - Why didn't he take the chair? - Hello? It had a bullet hole in it. It had blood on it. - He didn't want it anymore. - He could have washed it. / Randy. I don't think we need to stand here and pick apart the Alice Cooper wants an antique chair theory. If you all excuse me, I have a city to clean. One bag at a time! One bag at a time. One bag at a time. One bag at a time. Oh, oh I got it. I got it. Hold on. It's all up to me! I got it! It's all up to me! It's all up to me! Oh, God! One bag at a time! It might be time to call Dr. Kroger. / Ah! I got an idea. - One bag at a time! - Hey, help me get him to the car. Ah! You can sit over there. Don't touch anything. Thanks Barry. Thank the old man too. Ah Feeling better? Where are we? It's called a fabrication room. This is where they assemble their new circuit boards. I know the guy in charge of their security. He owed me a favor. I can't smell anything. That's right. They have their own oxygen supply. It is 100% germ free. Germ free. Adrian Monk, you are sitting in the cleanest room in the world. It's quiet too. Yeah. Well. We haven't got all day. They're kicking us out at 2:00. So, why don't we just kick back and enjoy ourselves. I can feel my head clearing up. That's good. - It wasn't Alice Cooper. - I Know. Leland. I got it. I just got it. Remember that receipt from the drugstore? The guy that bought that wrist bandage also bought some cigarettes. That's right. Belgium Gold. The union accountant, Ron Nealy, was smoking imported cigarettes. - The box said Belgium Gold. - The accountant. Now you're making me sense. He ran the pension fund. He could have been skimming money for years. And he was about to get caught. He knew they'd be going over the books as part of the negotiation. Here's what happened I mean Here's what really happened Nealy killed Cusack and made it look like a suicide. But he screwed up. Then he had to run out and buy a wrist bandage. That makes sense. But wait. - He grabbed the mayor's umbrella. - Yes, he did. - How did he get it? - The mayor left it there. The mayor was in Cusack's office earlier that night. They were meeting secretly trying to settle the strike. Officially, the two sides were not supposed to be talking. That's why the mayor could never admit he was there. It would have been political suicide. Monk. I have been burned twice this week already. Are you sure about this? I mean, are you absolutely sure? That's good enough for me. The captain looks so happy. Everybody's happy. It's a great day. Listen. Here. Here they come. This is it. Here it comes. Get ready. Gentlemen! Hey, boys! Welcome back! You're a sight for sore eyes! It's a great day! You're a sight for sore eyes, gentlemen! Whoo! We missed you! Ho ho, Mr. Monk, our hero. - Oh, no, you're the hero! - No, you're the hero. No, you're the her We're all heroes! Except for Natalie. One bag at a time, gentlemen, that's the way we do it. Don't forget the bag of water. Thank you, Morris. Thank you, guys. - Thank you so much. - No, we should be thanking you. - You saved our pension fund. - And you got us a brand new contract. Anything you want, Mr. Monk, you let us know. All right. You guys do great work. Great work! Whoa! Whoa whoa. Wait wait, hold it. Excuse me, gentlemen. What about this, the confetti? You just can't leave that there. Right? I mean, uh, you can't leave that. Thank you. I wouldn't have thrown it if I thought it was gonna stay in the street. Um, how about uh, probably start back around There's a little bit around the corner there. Yeah, this is good right here. And then you might want to make sure you get under the get under the paper machine. That's it whoa, no! Natalie, Natalie. Don't don't Don't you do that. Let them do that. It's their job. / Sorry. It's their job. You work for me, remember, not for them."
"Nice, Julie! Keep your hands up. Slide your feet. That's it, Teeger. Emily, you know when they set the screen, that you have to get through it. Which Emily? All the Emilys. - All right, come on, girls, let's try it again. - All right, you can do this. Like that, Coach Hayden? - Coach Hayden! - Yes. That was much better. Okay, girls, let's huddle up. All right, one week to go. This is it. - Do you feel like champions? - Yeah. Well, you are champions. And you're always gonna be champions. No matter who's coaching you. Okay, Monday, 3:30 practice. Anyone's late, we're all doing laps. Oh, my gosh. All right, Cougars on three. One, two, three. Cougars! All right, girls, hit the showers. - How you doing, Julie? - Oh, I'm good. You're looking great out there. You're getting a lot more range on your shots. / Thanks. Coach Hayden, what do you mean, ""no matter who's coaching you""? I just meant that you, the team, the girls, are a lot more important than me. - Go on. Hit the showers. - Bye. - Night, girls. - Good night. - See you Monday. - See you coach. Hello? Hello? MONK Season 5 Epi. 03 Mr. Monk and the Big Game - Julie. - Oh, hi, Mr. Monk. These are my friends, Emily and Emily. We call them Emily C. and Emily J. I don't have any candy. Mr. Monk, it's not Halloween. - We we really need you. - We want to hire you. Is this a bad time? Yes, it is. - Should we come back? - No, it's always a bad time. You iron your shoelaces? Why are there three? Right, left, backup. No, wait a second. This is the backup. So, that's, uh, right, left I it doesn't matter. You're right. It doesn't matter. Left this is the right one. - Um, Mr. Monk? - Yeah? You know, our coach, Miss Hayden, died on Friday. / Oh, yeah. Your mother mentioned that. I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? That's your mother can't do? Well, the police said it was an accident. I understand something was blocking the drain, right? It was a towel. I was supposed to put all the towels away. And and I did, I know I did. I checked everywhere. And it was my hairdryer that did it, that electrocuted her, but I know I put it away. I mean, it was in my locker. Are you sure? Maybe you forgot. / No. Julie. Would you Mr. Monk. Let it go. Let it go. So so so you think somebody did this to your coach on purpose? Yeah, and, like, no one takes us seriously because, you know, we're just kids. / Yeah. - What do you want me to do? - Mr. Monk, just do what you do. Mom says you're the greatest detective in the world. - Maybe that ever lived. - She might be right. - We we'll pay you. - We have $57. And, look, we know it's not what you usually get. But it can count for me as my birthday present. Here's the thing. I wasn't planning to buy you a birthday present. Please. Yeah. Okay. Wait fine. Fine, fine, fine. I'll see what I can do. Oh, thank you so much, Mr. Monk. You are such a nice person. Yeah, okay. - Hey, what are you guys doing? - Oh! Hi, mom. Um, Mr. Monk is gonna help us find out what really happened to Coach Hayden. Oh, girls. I know it's hard, but you gotta remember it's not your fault, it was just an accident. Will you just wait out front and I'll meet you there? / Okay. - Thank you, Mr. Monk! - Thank you so much, Mr. Monk! Yeah, yeah. Stay in school. Don't take dope. Oh, God. Mr. Monk, what are we gonna do? - What do you mean? - Can't you see it? They feel so terrible about what happened they're just in complete denial. Well, they are offering to pay me $57. Okay, first of all, you're not taking their money. So you want me to say no. Well, I don't know. You already said yes. Maybe it's a good thing. You know, maybe maybe it'll give them closure. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna look into it. And then we're gonna sit them down, and we're gonna tell them That it was all their fault. You know what? When it comes time to tell them, maybe you shouldn't. They really loved her. How long was she here? Uh, I think seven years. She was the best coach Julie ever had. Come on. This place makes me uncomfortable. Oh, Mr. Monk. It's just a high school. Yeah, high school wasn't the best year of my life. Oh, but look at theses. Amazing. Look at that one. State champions. Okay, That's very nice. Yeah, yeah, look at this one. Yeah, they're all very nice. Yeah, look at that. Look at this these, these two. I could never believe that they would just leave them sitting in the hallway right next to the exit. I always felt they should be locked away in a vault somewhere. Why? Who's gonna take a bunch of old trophies? I don't know. Maybe somebody who's never won anything in their whole life. Somebody whose mother cleared off a mantel in the living room, just waiting for one of these. Whose mother came to every track meet, even when she was sick. Even when she was dying. Maybe somebody likes that. Natalie, I'm talking about me. I know, Mr. Monk. Let's go. Julie showed me what happened. They found Coach Hayden's body in here, next to the showers. Oh. - You okay? - Girls' bathroom. What are you afraid of? Cooties? Don't laugh. Julie is still out on cooties. If we could only get more federal funding. The valve under this sink was loose. And the water was leaking. And then the hairdryer was plugged into here. I thought these outlets had built-in circuit breakers. Yeah, I thought so too. That's funny. Look at that paint job. You can see the brush marks. Yeah, they don't line up. There's no dust on the top of that. Natalie. Dust on the bottom? You're gonna need a wipe for that. Yeah, I think somebody took off this plate. And put it back on upside down. Get ready. - Yeah, that that's a loose wire. - Huh. Do you think somebody could've unscrewed that on purpose? I don't know. So the towel fell here? - On top of this drain? - Yeah, that's right. Seems like the coach ran into a lot of bad luck in this room all at once. Well, I guess that's how it happens sometimes. Yes, to me, but this happened to somebody else. What? That window's been opened. Which one? / The second one, there's no cobwebs on it. All the other windows are covered with them. Up you go. - What? - Take a look. Check it out. - Up you go. - Up you go. Up you go. / I'm just the assistant, remember? I believe the word ""assist"" is a very large part of the word ""assistant. "" Right? Assist. From the Latin meaning ""Up you go""! Come on over! Higher. Up. - Oh, my God. - What is it? Oh, my God. - God, Natalie, what is it? - They're footprints! Footprints. Down you go. - Okay, down I go. - Down you go. / Down we go. Okay, this is everything. The famous killer hairdryer, the towel, and the rest of the stuff from her locker. What about the footprints? There was a crew in there working six weeks ago on the lights. - It could have been one of them. - What about the outlet? We checked that too. It was defective. There's no dust in the intake. This is practically brand-new. But look. Look at the cord. It's all taped up. Okay, Randy, I really don't think the girls are lying. They hired Mr. Monk. They're giving him all the money they have. - $57. - You're not taking the money. Natalie, they're kids. They're teenagers. They're probably lying to protect themselves. You see how this tape's been cut? It's all jagged. Guys, look. There is zero motive here. Lynn Hayden didn't have an enemy in the world. She lived with her brother. And the kids loved her. Even the other coaches liked her. She's boring. It's like reading about Mother Teresa. - Natalie, here's your chance. - Oh. Captain, um, are you busy? Uh, yes, I am Ronstadt, where is that lab report on the Russian Hill carjacking? I need that yesterday. Um, Julie's doing a science report on DNA. Oh, no, Natalie. I can't. She's supposed to interview somebody, an expert. Can you just talk to her for ten minutes? She's having a terrible week, and the report's due on Tuesday. Natalie, I wish I could, but I can't. We've got three detectives out sick today. Okay, it's just gonna take ten minutes. Look, what I'm juggling here, all right? I got two drive-by shootings, one attempted murder Oh, and that fire two weeks ago in Dratch Valley. They're now saying that might be arson. Now I'm working arson. Plus I just got another load of hooey from my wife's lawyer. This her jacket? See that? It's missing a button. - What's that? - It's a burr from a bush. She must have been outside. Doesn't help much, does it? Even you go outside. I can talk to her next week. How about Saturday? I'll take you guys out for pancakes. Yeah, it's okay. That's not gonna give her enough time. - It's all right. - Okay. Oh, you know what? I forgot to mention My cousin works for a PR firm for the 49ers. No kidding. / Yeah, Joe Montana's gonna be in town on Thursday. He's shooting some commercial. You wanna meet him? - Joe Montana, sure. - Okay. You're not too busy? No, no, I'm sure we could make that work. Oh, great. Because I lied. But it's nice to know you're available on Thursday. Julie will be here after school. Thanks. Ah, this brings back memories. Sitting in the principal's office. You? I can't picture you being sent to the principal's office. I wasn't sent. I used to go there on my own. To report on the troublemakers. I was Mr. Kantman's eyes and ears. That's what he called me. So you spied on other kids? I was keeping the study hall safe for people like you. You're welcome. Oh, Natalie, hi. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. That's okay. We're, um We're organizing a memorial service. Oh, of course. Is there anything I can do? No, but, uh I'll let you know. Thanks. Um, this is my boss. This is Adrian Monk. Principal Franklin. Oh, yes. We met last year at the career day. - How've you been? - The same. Oh, I'm sorry to here that. How's Julie been doing? Um she's a having a hard time. I think everybody is. Um, yeah. Here's that list you asked for. Everyone who had access to the girls' locker room, including outside contractors. / Okay. Mr. Monk, you don't have to raise your hand. Did Coach Hayden seem worried or depressed about anything? Well, now that you mention it, the day before the incident, she was crying in the teacher's lounge. She didn't say why. I didn't think anything about it. Lot of our teachers cry quite a bit. Do you really think somebody did do this deliberately. We don't know. Well, I hope to God not. This has been very hard on the kids. Especially the team. Without a coach, we're gonna have to forfeit the last game. The championship game? No I I I'll coach them. I'll do it. Oh, no, Natalie. I I wasn't trying No, no, no. I played basketball in high school. Varsity. All four years. Plus I know all the girls. Well, it is only one game. Oh, I think the girls really need this. - Okay, we'll try it. - Okay. You're gonna need an assistant. What? What are you looking at? Principal Franklin, Natalie's staring at me. I don't know about this. I don't know much about basketball. Mr. Monk, you don't have to know anything. You're my assistant. My assistant. I like that. - The worm has turned. - Yeah, it certainly has. Plus it'll give you a chance to poke around the school and ask some questions. / Okay. Oh, God, look at them. Poor things. Hey, guys. Will you come over here? Team meeting. Uh, how you guys doing? Yeah, I know. I feel the same way. Uh, I'm Ms. Teeger. I'm sure you already know that I'll be filling in for Coach Hayden. And this is Mr. Monk. He'll be in charge of Excuse me, can I just grab this for a second? Thank you. / I know that this is really hard for you guys. But Coach Hayden never gave up, did she? If she were here, I know she would want you guys to finish what you started. I think she's right. Yeah, you know, I've been watching you guys all year. You guys are great. And if we practice and focus really hard, I think we have a shot at bringing home that trophy. There's there's a trophy? If we win. Does everyone get one? Well, the whole team gets a big trophy. And then everyone gets little statues. Even the, uh Even the Yes, Mr. Monk. Even you would get a little trophy. Would it have my my, um.. Yes, Mr. Monk. It'll have your name on it. All right, great shot. Great shot. Emily J., let the ball roll off your fingers. Yeah, Emily, off the fingers. Okay, girls, keep it moving. Kimberly. Try jumping off the other foot. Kimberly, come on. The other foot. All right, have fun, girls. Yeah, okay. Yeah, have fun. But don't forget to win. Everybody loves a winner. - Mr. Monk. - But have fun. But win. All right, girls. Let's do some ball handling. So circle up. - Where's my whistle? - Mr. Monk, you don't need a whistle. Yeah, I I I I'm gonna have to buy a whistle and one of those clipboards, I guess. So you've never won anything in your whole life? Once, at a birthday party, I won a game of musical chairs. - Well, that's something. - Yeah, then I was disqualified. The mother said I went counterclockwise or something. Well, at least you got invited to the party. It was my party, okay? It was my mother. Kimberly, what did I tell you about that foot? Hey, guys. That was a great rehearsal. Practice. Great practice. - Do you feel better? - Yeah. Mr. Monk, we were wondering how the case is going. Oh, well. We're still working on it. But you were right. It wasn't an accident. - So you mean it wasn't our fault? - No. Oh, I knew it! Told you! Mr. Monk. Thank you for believing us. And And you don't have to pay me. So, Mr. Monk, who did this? - Well, we don't know that yet. - Yeah. Oh, Em. Here is your necklace. Sorry. / Thank you. Well, that's very beautiful. What is it? Oh, it's an arrowhead. - Coach Hayden gave it to me. - Very beautiful. She brought about 15 back from Dratch Valley. Dratch Valley? She went hiking up there. Was she up there maybe two weeks ago? Uh, I think so. Didn't the captain say something about a fire? Well, it's pretty obvious what happened. Um this is the point of origin. Natalie, right here. Point of origin. Please go on. Well, somebody was here camping out unauthorized. Without a permit. And apparently the wind shifted from east to north. East to north. Got it. Continue please. It's his first whistle. Well, the brush around here was bone dry. So those branches probably caught first. And then they spread downwind. And then once it hits the valley, well, there's no stopping it. So the fire was moving Up the hill, that way. Right? Yeah, are you with the arson squad, Mr. Monk? No, no. This is a private investigation. And call me Coach. Coach Monk. I thought you were a detective. I am a detective. I also coach high school basketball. The Ashton Cougars. Are you into b-ball? ""B"" stands for basketball. - Not really. - What are you doing Saturday? - My parents' anniversary. 50 years. - Perfect. Bring them to the game. It's the league championship. - I don't think so. - It'll be great. We're using a zone defense, which is the best kind of defense you can have. We're gonna kick their rumps all over the field. - You mean court. - Natalie. He might come to the game. I didn't say that. Mr. Monk, can you just focus on other questions about the fire? You know, the reason why we came here, why we drove for two and a half-hours. Yeah, yeah. The fire. Let me think. Anybody hurt? No, sir. Just some property damage. - Five or six summer homes. - So the fire spread up that way. They probably ran down there. Let's have a look. I'll wait by the jeep. Okay, if we get lost, I'll blow the whistle. - I'm sure you will. - See you Saturday. Go Cougars. Oh. - Oh!. - What? Oh, burr. Natalie. Oh. That's from Linda Hayden's coat. Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Do you think she could have been involved with the fire? Maybe that's why she was killed. There's gotta be a connection. But I don't see it. What happened here was an accident. Nobody was hurt. Nobody even knew she caused it. - Please don't. - It helps me think. No, no, no, no. Backup. Gotta be a connection. Just gotta be a connection. Aaron, I know this is a terrible time. So you lived here with your sister? Uh, she took me in after my divorce. After both of my divorces, actually. I mean, she could never say no to anybody. This is a nice trophy. Was your sister a golfer? - Actually, that one's mine. - Ah. Looks nice up here on the mantel. My mother had a mantel just like this. Except it was wood. And empty. Just this big, empty mantel. Um, Aaron, we know that your sister set that fire in Dratch Valley. That was an accident. She was camping, and and the wind shifted. We know, we talked to her best friend Christa Barnardin. I know Christa. Christa said that Lynn was going to turn herself in next week. She also said that you tried to talk her out of it. That's true. The fire destroyed six homes. They would've charged her with a felony. They would've taken away her teaching license. I tried to tell her that it wasn't worth it. I mean, nobody got hurt. - But she didn't see it that way? - No. No, not my sister. She always had to do the right thing. She said that's what she taught her kids. And she didn't want to be a hypocrite. - That's a nice photo. - Thanks. The school asked for a picture so they could hang it up in the girls' locker room. It's beautiful. It'll mean a lot to the girls. Except the frame is broken. It's got a crack there. I know. I was gonna fix that. Well, you could buy a new one. Oh, that's okay. I'll just fix it. It's no big deal. But you could just buy a new one, a nice, new frame. Yeah, let's do that. No, no, he said he was gonna fix it. Yeah, well, it's up to you. But you could just buy a new one. A nice, new frame, crack free. In honor of your sister. Your dead, beloved sister. Okay, we're done here. Thank you, Aaron. - Let's go. - Let's go. We're going. Thank you. We're passing a frame shop. I could just pop in. Be my treat. Now. Um, okay, I wrote down a few questions. - I'll go first. - Okay. All right. Bring it on. Question number one. Okay what does DNA stand for? DNA dex Dexocho Das DNA. - You don't know. - It's a chemical. DNA. - Dennis acid. - Deoxyribonucleic acid. / Okay. - Who discovered DNA? - Oh, I got it. I know this one. Um Good. / Whish ah. Wall Will Will Actually, nobody really knows. - Watson and Crick. - Watson and Crick. - Two British scientists. - From England. Well I brought this diagram. Oh, excellent. Actually, this is called a map. - Map, map! - Oh, okay, okay. / Had that one. - Is everyone's DNA different? - Yes. Everyone's DNA is different. It's like a billion little codes. All different. Except for identical twins. / Okay. Well, what about just regular family members? Just a little bit different. But very close. / It - But not identical. - Like, this close. Well, uh like that. If DNA is like a fingerprint, then why can't you solve every single case? First of all, we do not find DNA at every crime scene. And even if we did, you have something to match it against. There was a young woman. She wasn't much older than you. What was her name? Remember, a couple years ago. - Oh, uh, tach - The Irish girl. - McGoohan. / McGoohan. - Paula McGoohan / Paula McGoohan. We found her body in the middle of a golf course. There was a ton of DNA at the scene. And, uh We ran it through the system, but we couldn't get a hit because there wasn't anything to match it against. Do you have any multiple choice, Julie? Actually, I'm all done. My mom's picking me up. I have basketball practice. Oh, excellent. You know, I think it's great that you kids are finishing the season. Your coach would be very proud. You sound like Coach Monk. Coach Monk? Yeah, he's helping my mom out. He's the assistant coach. Thank you. You're welcome. - See ya. - Bye bye. / Bye. Monk is coaching basketball? Matthew, what's happening out in Dratch Valley? Beth, according to my sources, the police are investigating a possible connection between last month's brush fire in Dratch Valley and the death last week of a popular local gym teacher. You may remember that that was originally ruled an accident. However, new evidence is indicating foul play. As many of you know, Ashton High School lost a very dear friend last week. Lynn Hayden was more than a coach. She was a member of our family. Her brother Aaron is sitting in the stands with us tonight. Thank you for coming, Aaron. The Cougars want to let you know that they're dedicating tonight's game in Lynn's memory. Let's all rise, please, and give her a moment of silence. Cougars! Put it up! Put it up! That's all right. It's all right. All right, Cougars. Defense. Defense! Defense! - Defense! - Defense! Defense! So which one's yours? The big one with the whistle. Emily's open! No the other Emily! Hey, cut that out! Continue play. Come on, Julie! Get up, get up, get up! Take that shot now! - Okay!. - Come on, girls! Let's go. Bid D. Big D! Bid D! - Mr. Monk, we're on offense. - No, forget what I said. Big O, Big O! All right, set the screen. Go, go, go, go, go. Time-out, time-out. - 30-second time-out purple. - Okay, come on girls. Bring it in, bring it in. Hustle, hustle, hustle. You're doing great. We're still in there. But you're giving them too many open looks at the basket. - Don't let them look at the basket. - Right. / It's like this. - Okay. This is the basket. - Right. Actually, the rim is It's really orange. - Mr. Monk, we only have 30 seconds. - Yeah, plenty of time. All right, now, you see that circle in the middle there? You know that circle? This some lines missing. Keep your hands up. Keep on in there. - Okay, on the count of three. - Let's go! One, two, three. Cougars! All right! Let's see some hustle. Get inside. Four points, girls. Offensive foul, number 11. What are you talking about? You blind? She was moving her feet. That was a block. - She had no position. - Coach, get back on the bench. Oh, you're a joke. Technical foul, Coach Teeger. - Now who's the joke? - It's still you. That's it, Teeger. You're gone. / Oh! Number 13, you're shooting. Mr. Monk. / All right, I think I've figured this out. I decided to go with black for the net. - I'm out of the game. - What? It's all up to you. I'm out of the game. - Wait, what - Okay, listen carefully. We're only down by four. If we tie it up, go man to man, then at the two minute mark, switch over to a full court press - What the hell are you talking about? - Teeger. All right. I gotta go. Good luck, Coach. Well, this just got very interesting. Don't give up, you guys. We're still in this! - Mr. Monk, we're winning. - That's the spirit! Time out! Mr. Monk, stop. What is the plan? Yeah, all right. Let's just keep it simple. See, each basket we sink counts as two points. Except if you're behind the line. Emily, you're just confusing everyone. - She's not Emily. - She's Emily now. You're all Emily, understand? We're gonna be fine. Everybody just go out there and give 100%. But Coach Hayden said we should give 110%. No, no, no. That's a bad idea. Anyway, it's mathematically impossible. Just give 100 percent. It's a nice, round number. Well, I'm gonna give 110 percent. Fine. Okay, Julie, you give 90 percent. Well, I'm gonna give 115 percent. Oh, for God's sake. Okay, fine. Then, Julie, you're down to 75%. - Mr. Monk, how am I supposed - Just do it! Okay, all right. So that's 110 percent, Okay, guys, come on. Before we go, hands in. One, two, three. Cougars! Go Cougars. - I need a break. - Jen, what's the score? - It's all tied up. - Oh, God! Oh! Julie. Julie, what are you doing? Am I crazy, or is she giving 100 percent? - Not again! - Mr. Monk, it's me! - Natalie? - Look, I found this. Look at the frame. Look at the tape. It's uneven, just like the hairdryer. So it's the brother, right? Captain Stottlemeyer? Hey, he knows your name. Captain / Don't touch me. I've got a gun. It's me, Natalie. - Natalie? - Natalie? What's going on? / Remember that cold case from two years ago? The girl on the golf course. What was the name of that country club? Conrad. Conrad Country Club. I got it. / That's it. I know who killed Lynn Hayden. He's here. Front row. To the right of the scoring table. Blue shirt. - The brother? - He's the guy. Mr. Monk, can't we do this later? It can't wait. I think he knows we're on to him. - What about the girls? - Okay. Ref. Time time out! Time out, purple. Okay, hurry up. / Aaron Hayden belongs to that country club. It was on the trophy on his mantel. Conrad Country Club. Here's what happened. Aaron Hayden killed Paula McGoohan. I remember the case. There was DNA evidence all over the scene but nothing to match it against. - 20 seconds. - Lynn Hayden told her brother she started that brush fire and planned to turn herself in. That's why she was so upset last week. /15 seconds. Aaron tried to talk her out of it. He knew she'd be arrested, which meant - We would take a DNA sample - Routine for a felony arrest. if you ran her DNA through the system, it would lead you to the country club murder, which would lead you to him. It happens with siblings. A near hit. He was trapped. He couldn't let her confess. If she was arrested, he was a dead man. Oh, hell. Hey, hey! Hey! Don't give me an excuse, pal. I've got a message from Adrian Monk. Yeah, what's that? He says you should've bought a new frame. Get it in! Shoot! Shoot it! We won! We won! I won something. - How does it feel, Mr. Monk? - It feels It feels like something's wrong. Clear the court! We still have two seconds on the clock. Let's clear the court. - What's happening? - Well, it's not over yet. Put two seconds back on the clock. Of course. / Don't worry. They have one shot. They'll never make it. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. Of course. I don't believe it! Did you see that? Many times. Don't be sad, Mr. Monk. There's always next year. No, it's never next year. I'm going home. - Keep your eyes closed? - OK. Alright, Mr. Monk, the girls and I got you a gift. - Is it $57? - No. You can open them now. What? Whoa. Trophies. Boxes of little trophies. The Captain let me go through your files. There's a trophy for every murder you've solve since the beginning of your career. ""World's Greatest Detective. "" Actually, you solved 104 cases. But we rounded it down. To make it an even 100. I don't know what to say. Well, you don't have to say anything. You wanna put them on your mantel? On my mantel. Oh, Mr. Monk? This one's for solving our case. It's from the whole team. I'm not gonna have enough room. I need a bigger mantel. Natalie, I need a bigger mantel. Oh, Mr. Monk, your mother would be so proud. Oh, no, she wouldn't. But it was nice of you to say."
"All right, gentlemen here they are. Get 'em while they're warm. Hey, Rusty, what's in these? In case my doctor needs to know. Let me tell you wise guys something. When I was on payroll, we respected our elders. I come in here, I volunteer. Do I get a ""thank you, Rusty""? No, I get jokes. And they aren't even funny jokes. They're old and stale. Come on, Rusty, we all love you. You know that. Look, I'm eating one. Hey, hey, Karl with a K. Oh, hell, he's back. Hey, Chucky, you You missed a spot. Captain can you believe it's been a year already? You know, Mr. Monk, I told you you can test those smoke alarms at home by yourself. Yeah, I know, I know. But I'd rather you guys did it. You're the experts, right? House fire, three alarm. Mr. Monk, I'm afraid you're gonna have to wait. / Captain, I was here first. Sir, there's a house burning down five blocks away. Don't you think that should take priority right now? Don't you? Let's go. People, I don't have all day. - How many rooms do you have? - Five. Thirty smoke detectors for five rooms? Plus two hallways and a vestibule. I used to say you can't be too careful. Never say that again. Excuse me? Hello? Hey, you're not allowed back here. Rusty? Rusty? Hey Russ Hello? Mr. Monk? Oh, my God. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, are you okay? Is Rusty okay? Check on Rusty. I think he's dead. What happened? I don't know. There was a man. I tried to stop him. Mr. Monk, it's okay. It's all over now. You can open your eyes. Oh, my God. Captain Stottlemeyer, please. It's an emergency. Don't say anything. Just sit over there, all right? - There's a chair right there. - Where? Where? Right over there. Natalie I can't see it. MONK Season 5 Epi. 4 Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing - So, how's it look, Doc? - Well, okay. The liquid that hit him was a mixture of detergent and muriatic acid. Both of his corneas have been scarred. And there is nerve damage. - Which means what, exactly? - It's hard to say. Sometimes the tissue grows back by itself. And sometimes it doesn't. It's okay, Mr. Monk. He's afraid of the dark. Well, he might have to get used to it. At least for a while. Excuse me. Monk? It's Randy. I'm speaking to you. I'm standing right in front of you. Now I'm squatting. I'm about eye level. I just want you to know that we're gonna find the man who did this to you. I'm gonna work on this case 24/7. I don't care how long it takes. Except for May 11th. My niece is getting confirmed, and there's a reception the night before. So I'm probably gonna need I'm probably gonna need that whole weekend off. - So, Randy. Randy. - From the 11th to the 13th. I didn't think this was possible, but you're making this situation worse. Mr. Monk, you know this is a top hospital. They're gonna do everything they can. You can't give up. There's always hope. There's never hope. This is something we do at the school for the blind. It's called an empathy exercise. We use it to help families and friends understand what their loved one's going through. - How do you feel right now? - I feel helpless and out of control. - Yeah, I feel disoriented. - Even more than usual. This is how your friend Adrian's feeling 24 hours a day. He has to relearn everything. Even things he's done a thousand times. For example, you've spent a lot of time here in the station. - You both probably know it pretty well. - Sure. I want you to find the water cooler, and pour yourself a cup of water. Piece of cake. Where's the cooler? Sorry, sorry. We're doing an empathy exercise. He's cheating. How does he know I'm cheating unless he's cheating? - I won! - Lieutenant, this isn't a competition. I know, but if it was a competition, I would've been the winner. There's a trick you can teach your friend. If you stick your finger over the edge of the cup, it won't overflow. Ms. Stein, you've never met Adrian Monk. He's not gonna be sticking his fingers in any cups. He'd sooner die of thirst. The thing is, this guy is really fragile to begin with. I just don't see how he's gonna be able to function at all. Then it's up to you to make him function. Get him back to work. That's the best medicine. Back to work? Okay, which one is this? The one with the balloon. Oh, yeah. I love that one. - Is it straight? - It's perfect. I'll never see her face again. Mr. Monk, don't say that. Am I crying? No. Feels like I'm crying. Feels like I'm crying all the time. Natalie, my life is over. Forget about me. You have to move on, get another job. I am not going anywhere. Look at me. Sorry. Your life is not over. You could still do anything. There've been lots of blind people who have done great and amazing things. - Like who? - Like Ray Charles. - And, um you know. - Yeah? You know, uh, I mean, come on. Mr. Magoo. - Who's that? - Mr. Magoo? Oh, gosh, he was a great man. - Um an inventor. - Really? An entrepreneur, if you will. He did lots of amazing, amazing things. And he was blind? I don't want to talk about Mr. Magoo anymore. - Me neither. - Hello? - Door was open. - Cap? Hey, how's it going? Uh, well, gosh, he's doing great. He's just great. I'm so proud of him. Good. Good. Uh, listen, Monk. I'm on my way over to the firehouse. I want you to come along. What for? I gave the lieutenant my statement. Yeah, I know. I just, uh I thought that maybe you might see something. - Somehow I doubt that. - You know what I mean. Look, Monk, even in this condition, you're still the best detective I know. Exactly. I think it's a great idea. You don't mean that. You're just trying to cheer me up. Look, Monk, this isn't only about you. This is a homicide investigation. A fireman was killed. - Rusty. - Rusty. He was a stand-up guy. He'd been on that engine for 35 years, and I'm gonna nail the son of a bitch that killed him. - And you're gonna help me. - Leland, I can't. - I ca I can't - Monk, I'm not asking you. Natalie, get him up. - Come on, you heard the captain. - Okay, I'm coming. But listen, don't expect too much from me. I'm no Mr. Magoo. - Let's go. - Mr. Magoo? You know, Magoo the famous inventor. Magoo. Now the table is here. No, Monk. The table is here. All right. That puts the pole right there. - The pole's there. - I can't do this. You can do this. You can do this. Mr. Monk, just concentrate, okay? All right, just try to picture the room. You can do this. You have an amazing memory. Oh, right. I forgot about my amazing memory. Look, what we can't figure is what the guy was doing here. What was he looking for? - Is anything missing? - I don't think so. There's nothing here worth taking. No money. Nothing. It just doesn't make any sense. Okay, let's do this. Have a seat. You and Rusty were sitting here. You were checking the smoke detectors. Right. Right. And then this man entered from over there. And he walked around the truck slowly, like he was trying not to be noticed. Monk, Lieutenant Randy Disher. I'm speaking to you again. Randy, you don't need to tell the man that you're speaking to him. Yes, sir. Okay, you know who this is, and you know I'm speaking to you. Now, in your statement, you said that you could hear him. - That his shoes were squeaking. - That's right. That he was tall, maybe 6'1"". Heavyset, with sandy hair, wearing a leather jacket. Right. That's right. And then Rusty Rusty walked over to him, around the back of the truck. Then I heard this big noise. Then I walked around the truck. I went around the back of the truck. Where Where's the truck? The truck's been moved, Monk. You're good. And then Then I saw Rusty on the floor. And the guy was holding a shovel in his hands. You said you could smell him. He'd been drinking. Rum. He smelled like rum. We got that, Randy. Is there anything else? Anything new? - Anything you forgot to mention? - No, no. He grabbed the container, and he just threw the solvent in my eyes. That was the last thing I saw. Oh, my God. That was the last thing I saw. Oh, what is that? What is it? - Is it off? - It's off. - Can I go home now? - Yes, you can go home now. Hold on, hold on. Here. Ok, step, step, step. Here, here. Yes, yes. It's okay, I gotcha. I gotcha. You're okay. Wait. Wait a second. What? Wait a minute. What is it? There's a coat missing here. A coat? / There were six coats hanging right here. He's right. There's one missing. He came in to steal a coat? He's willing to kill for it? It doesn't make any sense to me either, but it's something. We find that coat, we find a guy. See, you're amazing. Hey. High-five. All right. Good work. Good, good, good. All right, very Okay, see? There you go. You don't need me at all. Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't see it. - Join the club. - Hey, how's he doing? We just got back from the hospital. They're very optimistic. You mean pessimistic. No, they're very optimistic. Well, then, why are you shaking your head? - So what's so important, Randy? - I think we got him. We just picked up a guy in Rockaway, and he was wearing the fireman's coat. - He's in the bullpen. - Who is he? A guy named Kolbert. Jake Kolbert. He's a drifter. He lives out by the beach. - You think you can I.D. him? - Oh, I don't know how. Maybe you haven't heard. I am blind. But you'll do the best you can. Right? You're not gonna give up just because you've been dealt a bad hand. Have I been dealt a bad hand? I wouldn't know, because I'm blind! Monk. Hey, I like the cane. - You look kind of dapper. - You say you found the guy? We found a guy. He's the right height. He doesn't have an alibi, and he was wearing the missing coat. - Did his shoes squeak? - Don't know. He was barefoot when we picked him up. But that doesn't matter, because we don't need shoes. - Because I've got and eyewitness. - So to speak. Jake Kolbert, this is Adrian Monk. We're here to figure out if you two met at fire company 53 last Sunday. No. I've never seen him before in my life. I told you, man, I found that coat in a dumpster. Behind a restaurant on Vinton Street. He the guy? I can't tell. The guy at the firehouse never said a word. Okay. Well, you know what we have to do. We have to feel the man's face. What? No. No, Leland. Please. I can't. God, I can't. You're the only witness I got. - He's a drifter. - So what? I have lived my whole life without feeling a drifter's face. I've always been very proud of that. Even on my worst day, I could tell myself at least I didn't feel a drifter's face. This could be the man who killed Rusty and blinded you. I am not letting him or you walk out of here until I'm sure. Oh, God. / Come on. God. No. That's a wart. Oh, God. Wipe! - Wipe! Wipe! - Yes. Yes. Wipe! Right here, right here, right here. - He's not the guy. - I've been trying to tell you. I found that coat in a dumpster. I get cold at night. I sleep in a cardboard box at the beach. My life sucks! What are you complaining about? At least you can see. Oh, I got plenty to complain about. Don't get me started. I've got a nine-year-old dog that needs a new kidney. I had a bucket of acid thrown in my face. I think I win. I haven't had a hot meal in three years. My wife is dead. So is mine. - Car bomb? - Pneumonia. - Natalie, car bomb or pneumonia? - Mr. Monk, I don't know. Yeah, I bet your wife didn't suffer. Trudy lived for 20 minutes in pain, alone. Y You're an amateur. Come back when you got something. Who's next? Come on. Anybody. You're looking at the most miserable man on Earth. Oh, hey, you. How 'bout you? How 'bout you? You want a piece of me? I'll take you all on at the same time. I can't lose! I I can't lose. This is Adrian Monk. Thank you for calling my new answering machine. When you hear the beep noise please speak into the telephone receiver, and leave a message which I will play back and listen to later. This is the end of the message. And here is the beep I was talking about. Adrian, it's Dr. Kroger again. Now, I know you're there, so please pick up. Adrian, you missed your 10:30, and your 3:30. Adrian, you can't stay in your house forever. Wanna bet? I know you, Adrian. You're probably lying on your bed feeling sorry for yourself. You can't just give up. There are people out there who really need you. Come on, Adrian. You have to get up. Get out of bed. Come on, you can do it. Here we go. That's right, come on. Come on. Up and at 'em. Okay, go on. Come on, come This must be it. Describe it. Oh, you know, Monk, it's tenderloin. Right in the heart of wino land. We're standing in an alley behind a bar, in front of a standard-issue dumpster. Probably about three cubic yards. It is filled with garbage. Broken bottles, cardboard boxes. Monk, Randy Disher speaking. I'm opening my notebook. Hold on. I can't find my - I can't find my notebook. - Yeah. I'm checking my pockets. Patting my pockets. Oh found the notebook. Opening notebook. Yeah, according to Mr. Kolbert, he was here 5:00 PM last Sunday, collecting bottles. He found the fireman's coat in the dumpster. after Rusty was killed. He also said he found a fireman's helmet, which he gave to a couple of kids. He kills a man for a fireman's coat. He throws it away a couple hours later. That makes no sense. Ooh, God. I'm glad I didn't see that. - Natalie. - What? - Natalie, I'm glad I didn't see that. - Yeah. This is It's an alley, right? It must be pretty filthy. - Yeah, It's disgusting. - I'd probably hate this place. Oh, Mr. Monk, you wouldn't last five minutes here. - There's cockroaches - There's a dead cat right over there. Natalie, it doesn't bother me. Nothing bothers me. It's great. I can't see anything. I don't see any of it. This could really work for me. I hate this neighborhood. I was stuck here for three hours Sunday. The house that burned down was just around the corner. Hold on. Hold on. The fire on Sunday was was was right here in this very neighborhood? Yeah. The woman was killed. She fell asleep smoking a cigarette in front of the TV. I don't think so. No, no. There has to be a connection between that fire and what happened to Rusty. Okay, let's go. Come on, people. Come on. We got a case to solve. Wait. Dead cat on your left. Monk, do you want some gloves? Don't need 'em. Out of sight, out of mind. Excuse me. Blind man walking. Excuse me. - Is this the living room? - That's right. - She was on the couch. - Which is on your right. Easy. Yeah, she was on the couch, she was watching TV. She's smoking. She's drinking. She falls asleep. Cigarette falls on a pile of newspapers, and whoosh. At least, that's the official version. Rum. Rum. Who was she? Disher opening file. ""Stefanie Preston. 27."" She was a temp. ""Last job, Peter Breen Construction. "" Lived here alone. Well, I don't think she lived here alone. At least not every night. There's a bottle of men's cologne in the bathroom. Two toothbrushes. Two different types of toothpaste. She's got a boyfriend. Oh, there was There was something here. Something etched in the glass. The shape of an animal. A donkey or a horse. It looks like a horse. Wh Wh What's this? TV remote. At least it was. Okay, if she was watching TV from over there, why is the remote way over here? I don't know. I think I do. Captain, here's what happened. Somebody killed her. Probably strangled her, then made it look like she fell asleep on the couch. He probably walked away. Then he stopped and realized he forgot something. Something inside the house. - What was it? - I don't know. Probably metal. Something that would survive the fire. Something that could be traced back to him. Whatever it was, he had to get it back. But how? The house was on fire. The trucks were already here. - The place was surrounded. - He needed a fireman's coat. Exactly. That's what he was doing in the firehouse. That That's why he stole the coat. He came back here. He looked like one of the guys. Nobody noticed him. Nobody questioned him. He walked right past them, came inside Grabbed whatever it was he left behind. Not bad for a blind guy. I'm back, baby. Mr. Monk, you're talking to a doorjamb. I'm back! You know, Adrian. I I just don't know what to say. After you got the diagnosis, you were so despondent. - Was I? - Yes. You were catatonic. You were sitting here sobbing, because you thought you'd never be able to look at Trudy's photos again. All I know is I've never been happier. I am at peace. Dig this Dig this? Yesterday the school for the blind sent over a woman to teach me how to get around. She wanted me to count the steps from my front door to the street. I said, ""Sweetheart, ""I've been counting those steps for five years. 44."" So you see, I have been preparing to be blind my whole life. All right, Adrian, wh what about your work? My work? My work's great. I'd say I'm operating at or just below Magoo level. Adrian, I have to tell you I'm a little concerned. Now, there are five stages of grief, and I think you've already leapfrog over at least the first three of them. - And I think any doctor - I'm sorry to interrupt. I was just thinking You could be naked right now, and it wouldn't bother me. - Adrian, I'm not naked. - But you could be. Look it, Adrian. I think that you're using this condition as an excuse to cut yourself off from the real world, even more than usual. And the pendulum will swing back. - I don't think so. - Yes, it will. This is what pendulums do. You could come crashing down. It would be very painful. I I I just refuse to believe that you are happy genuinely happy having lost your eyesight. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Oh, okay, fine. Well, then, why don't we get some ear plugs, and some nose plugs? And then you can just cut yourself off completely from the world. Or maybe we could arrange to have you put into a coma. Well, let's try the ear plug thing first. - Stefanie what? - Preston. She worked in your office until last week? I remember her. Stefanie nice kid. Hey, you mind if we walk while we talk? Time is money, and frankly, I don't have enough of either. Hey, Mr. Monk, you might want to wait in the trailer. It's probably a lot safer for you. Ground's a little rough out here. No, no, don't, uh Don't worry about me. I just want to be treated like everybody else. Make sure the electrical inspector gets a copy, all right? So, what can you tell us about her? Uh, not much. She was a temp. She was here for maybe eight weeks. My regular girl was away on maternity leave. - You said there was fire? - That's right. That's terrible. That's heartbreaking. Mr. Breen, how well did you know her? Well, I didn't really know her at all. Oh, my gosh. - What is wrong with you? - What? There's barbed wire. - You're gonna cut yourself. - I'm not going to cut myself. I have a radar. - A radar? - Yes. I feel it now. It's like a sixth sense. I'm like a bat in a cave. You know, they swoop around, but they never hit the walls. Well, I don't think your radar is working. It It's wor Listen to me. It's working fine, okay? I am a swooping bat. My antennae are tingling all the time. Hey, swooping bat guy. I'm over here. Stay with the group. Have you ever been to Stefanie Preston's house? Why would I go to her house? She was a very attractive woman. Yeah, and so is my wife. Is that your Ferrari out there? - That's one of them. - Do you like it? I was thinking about getting one myself. It's either between that or the Ford Festiva. Where were you Sunday afternoon? Uh, Sunday I was here, on site, meeting with the architect and construction manager. Hey, boss, I got that work order. Oh, and I still have those keys. Uh, Eddie, we're a little busy right now. You know what? We'll take care of that later. Gentlemen? Capt Captain. Captain, listen to that. Sqaky shoes. That's the guy. Come on. Mr. Monk? This way. Definitely this way. Can I help you? It's the guy, Captain. Cap Captain? You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Though I'd prefer it if you didn't. Captain? Captain! Help! Somebody! Elevator out of order My God. Help! Help! Help! Somebody! Help me, here! Help! Help! Heads up! I can't breathe, the air's so thin. - Mr. Monk? - Help me! Mr. Monk, what are you doing? - Natalie. - Yes? Are you flying? Here, I got you. I got you. Just take a step down. - No. - Just a little step. - It's okay, we got you. - You're okay. We got you. / There you go. There you go. You're okay. You're okay. - You're okay. - Okay. Oh, my God, Mr. Monk. What were you doing? Oh, my My God. The guy The guy who killed Rusty The squeaky shoes. He's here. He's here. ""Eddie Murdoch. "" Here, I got you. That's him. It's Eddie Murdoch. Must've been up there lookin' for you, and slipped. Well, I guess that's it. Case closed! I think I have some good news. The optic nerves appear to be healing, and your pupils are starting to dilate. I'm cautiously optimistic. - Is that how he takes good news? - Yeah, it is. If you could just stick around for a bit, I'd like to show these to my colleagues. Be right back. / Thank you, doctor. We'll be here. Isn't that great? She sounded so hopeful. Hope. I hate Hope's guts. Hey, what happened to all your confidence? I don't know, Leland. Maybe I dropped it when I was screaming for help ten inches off the ground. I am so pathetic. I'm half the man I was, which was 3/4 of a man. - And so now I'm - 5/16 of a man. Thank you, Randy. Oh, no, wait Hey, would you quit whining? The bad guy's on a slab downstairs. We get to go home. In my book, that's a good day. Monk, he is definitely the guy. I just came back from his house. We found the clothes he was wearing when he set the fire. They were in a laundry hamper, covered with soot. You guys, I'm sorry. I have to go. I have to go get Julie. You kids take off. I'll stay here with Captain Sunshine. Hey, I can drop you off? - New wheels. - Oh, so you went with the Ford. Yeah, I didn't like the way the Ferrari handled. Or the way they turned down my credit application. Yeah. Cool, huh? I went with the four cylinder, instead of the six. It's quicker. Oh, and white, with tan cloth interior. Leather makes me sweat. - Yeah, I need those. - All right, we gotta go. We gotta go. Okay, bye, Mr. Monk. We'll see you tomorrow. Why did he do it? - Why did who do what? - Why did Eddie Murdoch kill that girl? Since when does a creep need a reason? You remember when we were talking to Peter Breen? Murdoch came walking up. Do you remember what he said? Yeah, he said, ""I still have those keys. "" Peter Breen drives a Ferrari, right? That's right. What do their key chains look like? It's a rearing horse. The impression on the coffee table. Those were Breen's keys. - You said Murdoch's body's on a slab? - Downstairs. Hello? Well, we've got the place to ourselves, so to speak. Do you see him? Do you see Eddie Murdoch? No. Not yet. Wh What do you see? Uh people. Bloated. Laying around, not talking. Kind of like Thanksgiving at my ex-wife's house. So you think the keys were still in his pocket? Oh, it's worth a shot. Eddie Murdoch killed Stefanie Preston. There's no question about that. But it wasn't his idea. His boss paid him to do it. - So Breen was having the affair. - Exactly. He had keys to her house. Loaned 'em to Eddie Murdoch so Murdoch could sneak in and kill her. He went back for the keys. That's what he went back for. Right. And if we find those keys Mr. Breen's gonna have a lot of explaining to do. Got him. Hello, Edward. Don't get up. They usually keep the personal effects in a plastic bag. Bingo! Well? Exhibit A. D.A.'s gonna love this. Can I feel? That's it. Leland, what happened? Leland! Mr. Monk, I'm gonna need that key ring. Help, somebody! The keys, please. Oh, I don't have time for this. Actually, it's pretty convenient you're both already here. That way, they won't have to move the bodies. Don't move. Don't move. Captain. Captain? You okay? You okay? You all right? Monk - You can see me. - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello."
"Look at that skyline. It's the second most beautiful sight in the world. The most beautiful is you. Standing in front of me. Are you okay? You you didn't say five words at dinner. Jay, remember you said we couldn't go out on like this. You said I had to make a decision. You were right. I'm going back to Eric. - I'm going to try and make it work. - What? He's my husband, Jay. I tried to tell you at dinner. I don't know. I didn't want to ruin your birthday. Let's go somewhere. Just the two of us. We can go to Bahia Tortolo for the week. I can get Dr. Eastman to cover my patients. No, Jay, you're not listening. It's over. We can leave on Monday. - The boat's already stocked up. - What is your problem? I'm not going anywhere with you except back to shore. Whatever you say. Please. Just take me home. I suppose you've told Eric everything. Are you kidding? You haven't told anyone? I'm not exactly proud of this. So it's like it never happened. That's one way to look at it. Never happened. MONK Season 5 Epi. 5 Mr. Monk, Private Eye Mr. Monk? Hello? - What's going on? - Making lunch. And what's wrong with those? Uh, those are not quite up to snuff. You know me. It's got to be snuff. What's that? It's a surprise. Did I ever tell you about my grandpa, Neville Davenport? No, is he in the box? He was a great man. You remind me of him, actually. He was an assistant pharmacist in London. And then, when he was about you age, he completely changed his life. Just like that. He quit his job and started a toothpaste company in England. A toothpaste company in England. I mean, talk about optimism. And now, it's the third biggest brand in the world after Colgate and Crest. Ah, I love that story. I guess my favorite part is about the toothpaste company. Mr. Monk, there's a point to this story. I don't think so. I've been listening very carefully. Okay, so I've been thinking about this. And, uh I think you should start your own company. Be a private investigator. I mean, really go for it. Hire a PR person. Be aggressive. Advertise. Get new clients. Um / Mr. Monk, there are other detectives out there with a fraction of your talent who are getting rich. You're Adrian Monk. People will pay a fortune to hire you. Yeah, that's something to think about. I thought you'd say that, so I did what Grandpa Neville did, and I took the initiative. A. Monk Private Investigations. $85? That's 85 cents a card. Mr. Monk, that doesn't matter. You can't be afraid to take risks. I think I can. In fact, I think I already am. Hold on. Germs, heights, snakes, milk, needles, risk. Yeah, it's on there. Number six. You know what Grandpa Neville's favorite expression was? ""Leap and the net will appear. "" Well, he sounds like a very pleasant, very insane person. It's not even at the right address. Yes, it is. No, it isn't. Shunpike Road. That's all the way downtown. - It's the right address. - It isn't. Yes, it is. Can I open my eyes now? Mr. Monk, your eyes are opened. When Grandpa Neville first started out, I swear to you his office looked just like this. Okay, so this is my desk. And yours is in there. So when the clients come in, they sit there. But then they come in here and talk to me. And if I think they're legit, then I send them in to you. - What clients? - Oh, they'll be calling. I took out some ads on the Internet and in the phone book. - Uh, Natalie, you can't afford this. - Actually, you're paying for it. - I can't afford this. - Oh, yes, you can. Remember last month when you got that bonus after solving the Kensington case? No. / That's because I used it for a down payment. Grownups have a word for that. We call it embezzlement. - Don't tell me Grandpa Neville. - That's Grandpa Neville. Well, it's only fitting that we have his picture up. After all, he is our inspiration, right? Leap and a net will appear. Okay, I appreciate what you're trying to do here. I really do, but, uh I have a job. I am a consultant for the police department. Not full time. And, Mr. Monk, they haven't called in weeks. Which is fine with me. I am not an ambitious man. - I am not Grandpa Neville. - You just give it a few months. I'm sorry Months? Okay, a few weeks. You'll see. It's gonna be great. Trust me. You'll see. How about Hamburg? I am into yoga, Pilates, getting in touch with my spirituality Been there, married that. ""My hobbies include bike riding, running, cuddling. "" Captain? You got a second? Uh, yeah, um Hang on, Randy. Uh, just a minute. Hang on. You okay? / Yeah! Yeah. This is, um classified, need-to-know stuff. - What's going on? - Missing schoolteacher. Husband's looking better and better. I talked to a neighbor trouble in paradise. Anna Pollard's been talking to a lawyer four months ago about filing for a separation. No kidding? He told me that it was one long honeymoon. Randy, that man lied to us. I need to talk to him again. Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, my cousin saw your profile on Make-A-Date. net. I didn't know you like bossa nova. Uh, that was, um It was There was an undercover sting operation going on with the Vice. Okay, I admit it. I, um I signed on. I was curious. Tell your cousin that I was just joking around. / That's okay. You can tell her yourself. You've been talking to her all week. - She's Sexy In Sonoma. - Wait, that's your cousin? When did you put in a hot tub? - I didn't put in a hot tub. - She said you put in a hot tub. I had a hot tub when I was at the motel. Oh, that must be it. Adrian Monk Investigations. What is the nature of your problem? Being kept in a room against my will. You were kidnapped? Oh, my God. Hold on, hold on. Do you know who did it? Yes, it was my personal assistant. Her name is Natalie Teeger. Natalie It's been two days. You're human. You made a mistake. - It's not a mistake. - It's a mistake. Okay, it took Grandpa Neville's business a whole year before it took off. You know Not everybody feels the same way you do about Grandpa Neville. For example, I was just thinking how much fun it would be to dig up his body and poke it with a big stick. Who's Grandpa Neville? And why are we poking him with a stick? Adrian Monk? I'm Linda Fusco. Wait, do I know you? - Are you an actress? - Real estate. Oh, oh, oh, Linda Fusco Realty. On bus stops and billboards. Wow, I can't believe Larry finally rented this dump out. How much is he getting, He's having you for lunch. Next time, you come to me. Adrian, I've been asking around. Cops, reporters And they all say that you are the man. Well, I'm a man. Oh, no, no, no. He's just being modest. He is the man. He is the gold standard. He is like Philip Marlow and Sherlock Holmes just rolled into Sweetheart, I'm showing a condo in 20 minutes. So let's get this going. Follow me. Where are we going? It's right out here. - This is it. - That's a nice car. This is a Lucerne 275 North star V8. I get a new Buick every year. It's my trademark. See? There's a scratch. It's a dent. Here and here. Son of a bitch. And he left this on the windshield. ""Go to Nell. "" Who's Nell? Mr. Monk, I think that's an H. - So will you take the case? - What case is that? This is it. This is the case. The dented fender? Yes. It happened at the Marina Wednesday morning. I have a boat there. I got there at ten to six to pick something up, and then I came back Mrs. Fusco Ms. Fusco. / Miss Fusco. Ms. Linda Linda, you must be insured. But why should I pay for something that I didn't do? I love this car. This is my baby. And I want you to find that son of a bitch, Mr. Adrian Monk, and make him pay for it. - Yeah, it's a matter of principle. - Exactly. We'll take the case. I'll draw up the contracts. We get $400 a day. I'll pay you $3000 if you catch the son of a bitch. And if you don't you get zip. I work on commission. Why shouldn't you? Could I talk to you for a second? - Can we go home now? - I think we should do it. Natalie, it's a fender bender. It's not even a real crime. It's a crime. It's a misdemeanor or something. Mr. Monk, we have to start somewhere. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Well, what's it gonna be? Are we in business? Yes, ma'am. We're on the case. So according to this snap shots looks like her Buick was parked over there. So maybe somebody backed up. What do you think? Natalie, what are we doing here? I'm a homicide detective. Mr. Monk, I know it's not the crime of the century, but someone did this to her, and Linda Fusco deserves justice too. Okay, what's next? Getting cats out of trees? Chasing jaywalkers? You know, Grandpa Neville used to always say Grandpa Neville used to say a man's reputation / Okay, okay. Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Anything but another Grandpa Neville story. Thank you. You're right. You're right. He backed out like this. He must've gone this way. He went the wrong way. Why was he going the wrong way? Video camera covering the exit. - He didn't want to be taped. - Oh, oh, oh! That's good. Now we're cooking! Yeah. Now we're cooking. So if he didn't want to be taped, - why would he leave a note? - Maybe there was a witness. Somebody saw the accident, was watching him Maybe the perpetrator thought that if he just drove away, the witness would report it. So he got out - and pretended to leave a note. - Okay. All right. So we have to just find that witness. Ah, where should we start? We might wanna start with Bill Gibbard. Bill Gibbard. That's great. That's great! Oh, it's exciting! Oh, yeah. This is a thrill a minute. Captain Bill Gibbard Deep Sea Fishing Hello, there. Hi. We're looking for Mr. Gibbard. Captain Gibbard, and you're looking at him. What's left of him.

That's some great advice. Thank you. - What kind of dog is that? - He's just a mutt. Oh, yeah. How long do they live? Captain, this is Adrian Monk. - Monk? - Yeah, he's a private investigator. We wanted to talk to you about a car accident that happened in that parking lot on Wednesday morning at 6:00. I wasn't here. Your sign says that you're here at dawn every day. Well, I guess I must've been. But I didn't see nothing. You heard it though, right? It's only a couple hundred feet away. Are you calling me a liar, Mr. Monk? Whoa, what are you doing? I don't like private investigators. Neither do I. It was her idea. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's jut settle down here. Captain, if you happen to remember anything, could you please give us a call? - Here's our card. - What are you doing? - It's 85 cents. - Let go of the card, Mr. Monk. Let go of the card!

All right? At least, I used to. Now I just get bull kelp splashed on me. I really think that's an N. - It's not an N, Mr. Monk. - What if it is? What if there is somebody out there named Nell who's got all the answers? What is this red swirl? I really think that's a brand name or a logo. It looks like a J. Or a T. - Did you see this? - What? - That's wax. - What See? That's a clue. - Isn't this fun? - No. Hello. I'm looking for Sam Spade. Nice place. Looks like a real office. It is a real office.

Confidentiality. - Is this Mitch? - No, that's not Mitch. - Does that look like Mitch? - I don't know. That's my grandfather. That's Neville Davenport. He's our patron saint. Was he a detective? Nah No. He was the famous toothpaste tycoon. Help me. / What? Help me! She's gone mad. Actually, I was hoping that you might be able to help us. We hit a wall on that missing schoolteacher. - You got a minute? - Sure. We might be missing something. Her car We found it in a parking lot at a shopping mall ten miles from the house. Was it locked? Locked, no purse, no third party prints. She told her husband that she was going shopping. Now, either she lied to him, or he's lying to us, or somebody grabbed her in the parking lot. - Where was he? - He says he was at home. He's now admitting that they were on the rocks. But I don't think he's the guy. - Phone records? - We're still checking. - Last seen wearing? - According to the husband, a light colored dress, sweater, and a pair of yellow flip-flops. I think I'm a little jealous. Are you seeing other clients behind my back? Ms. Fusco, no, no, no. These aren't clients. These are former colleagues. This is Randy Disher, and this is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. - Linda Fusco. - I know who you are. I've seen your billboards. Actually, we just saw one yesterday. Captain said that you looked really Nothing. He didn't say anything which is strange, because he's usually pretty talkative. The sign said that you were the number one realtor in Northern California. Tell me something I don't know. The elephant's the only mammal that can't jump. Pardon me? You said tell you something you don't know. And I told you that the only mammal who can't jump is your elephant. Ms. Fusco, can we help you? Yes, I would like to drop this off. Here is an estimate from the body shop. My new bumper's going to cost $900. And when you find this son of a bitch, I want you to make him eat this. Wait a minute. This is your big case? A fender bender. How'd you keep this out of the papers? It is important to me, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. By the way, sorry about the divorce. I've been in real estate for 14 years, and I can smell divorce from Who's couch are you sleeping on? Actually, I'm not sleeping on a couch. It's a futon. Thank you, Randy. Well, when you are ready for your own apartment, why don't you give me a call? - Maybe I will. - Oh, I know you will. As a matter of fact, I could show you a couple of things right now. As a matter of fact, I've got a little time right now. - My car or yours? - No, I always do the driving. I'll bet you do. Let's go. Randy. / Yes, sir. Why don't you stay here? - And? - And not come with us. See you back at the station. Whoo! That was fast. Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. Oh, hey, I've been there. - Where? - Joel's. It's good.

You can see it, right? - You're a private eye. - Yeah, is this Is this from here? Yes, that's one of our doggie bags. Right, we found some wax on it. Blue and pink thought it might be from a candle. Yeah, was there anybody here celebrating a birthday here recently? Maybe Tuesday night? We're thinking he had a birthday cake and then brought it home in one of these bags. Mm-hmm, yeah. There was this guy. He was sitting over there. Can I help you with something, my man? Oh, yes, uh, this man is a private investigator. And we would love Yeah, I wasn't really talking to you, honey. Can I help you with something, my man? Maybe, maybe. We're looking for somebody who was here on Tuesday night. We don't really talk about our customers. People come here, want privacy. We respect that, so You guys should probably just take a hike. Here's the thing. The man I'm looking for may be responsible for a hit and run. Good for him. Now beat it. Here's the thing That's the thing. Get him out of here. Oh, Natalie. Oh, God, Mr. Monk. Don't try to talk. For the love of God, I'm begging you. Let's just go home, please. Okay, okay, okay. I'm sorry. Oh, God, are you okay? I'm so sorry about Hal. He can be such a creep. Listen, listen. This guy you're looking for, okay, Jay Bennett. He's a regular.

Eggy doesn't like you. The feeling's mutual. Let's get this over with. - You wanna count it? - It's not enough. What are you talking about? We have a deal. - That was before. - Before what? Before a private investigator came poking around. Monk? What'd you tell him? It's what I didn't tell him. I didn't tell him that you left here on Tuesday night with a certain young lady and that you came back Wednesday morning, and you were alone. Now, if I'm gonna be talking to private eyes or maybe even the cops, it's gonna be double. Okay. I'll double it. But after that, forget it. Here's the first half. Shut up. Are you sure you're okay? When I was a detective or a consultant, I would point to the bad guy, and the cops would go in. And they would get shot at, or beat up, or hit in the stomach. And it was a wonderful system. See, everybody was happy. Okay, Mr. Monk, we can't just give up now. Oh, good. There it is. Dr. J. Bennett Okay. Please, please, please, please, please? Ah! / What? What do you think? It's been repaired recently. The headlights don't match. That one's new. Left one's dirty. Can I help you? - Dr. Bennett? - That's right. Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger, and this is my boss. This is Adrian Monk. Monk? / Yes, uh I'm working for the San Francis I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm I'm a consultant. I used to be a I don't know what the hell I am. He's a private investigator, Dr. Bennett. Were you in the marina Wednesday morning? / No. You do keep a boat there, right? Uh / All right. Let's get this over with. You know what happened on Wednesday morning and so do we. - You do? - Are you gonna deny it? I, uh I don't think I should talk about this. I think I should call a lawyer. Oh, no, no, no. I don't think we need to drag lawyers into this. They're just gonna, you know Blah, blah, blah. Make a federal case out of it. - It was an accident, right? - That's right. I mean, these things happen every day, right? Uh, well - It's not a big deal. - Not a big deal? What kind of cop are you? Come on, you pay a few bucks. Everybody walks away. It's like it never happened. - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - What's he talking about? We are talking about this. We have a client. You hit her Buick. And you damaged the fender. - Her fender? - Yes, it's going to cost her $900. Plus, I think an apology would be nice. Yeah, what did you think we were talking about? I don't know, but you got the wrong guy. The wrong guy Come on! It's a new headlight. You're so smart? Prove it. Excuse me. Hold on. Wait a minute. - I don't believe this. - What? I'm actually starting to care about this case. This stupid $900 fender bender. How the hell did that happen? There's brand new carpeting. There's a washer and dryer in the basement. And there is a park right down the street for your kids. When they come to visit. The one that we saw yesterday was bigger, right? That's true, but this one has a better view. How do you figure? You see this condo here with the umbrella on the balcony? Yeah. / That's me. You're right. The view is better. How much is it? It's $2250 a month, plus utilities. I don't know. Leland, it's been five months. It's time to do this. Do you think? Unfortunately, I speak from experience. I know you're in pain, but you can't go around it. You gotta go through it. Besides, we'll have something in common. Really? What's that? I'll have a better view too. I think there it is. That's his boat. All right, so his car wasn't in the lot, so, uh - Let's do it. - Wait. Don't. We don't have a warrant. We don't need a warrant. It's a boat. Well, that's completely false, but it sounds good. Let's do it. / Wait. I can't go. The boat is on the water. I don't do water. You can't swim? - To be honest, I don't know. - You don't know. I mean, I know how to swim technically. I've just never actually, you know, done it. All right, I took a correspondence course. You learned to swim by mail? They sent me a little diploma. And this. ""Swimming Fundamentals. Don't panic. Breathe normally. Keep kicking. "" Can I have that back? Why did you even take the course? You never go near the water. - Hello? Tsunamis. - Mr. Monk. You don't have to worry. You're not even gonna get wet. Look, look, look, look. That boat is tied to the dock. The dock is bolted down. It's like part of the land. I'll stay here. If Dr. Bennett shows up, I'll whistle. Leap, and a net will appear. Kelp. Jump. Jump on. Jump. Jump. Go, go. Hey. Hey, fella. Hey, remember me? What's wrong? What's wrong? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It says, uh, personal reference. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me. Stottlemeyer. Captain, it's me. It's Natalie. I'm at the marina. I'm at Pier 24. Natalie, I'm a little busy right now. There's a body. It's in the water. I think it's Bill Gibbard. Mr. Monk and I were just talking to him yesterday. Okay, listen, don't touch anything. I'll call the harbor patrol. - Be there in a minute. - Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no, Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk! Stottlemeyer. / Sir. - How you doing? - Fine.

Tuesday night. Tuesday night, he dumped her body in the bay. And then he came back here He must've hit your car in the parking lot while he was leaving. That's why he didn't leave his name on the note. He could not admit that he'd been here. We need to intercept the boat. How soon can you get a cutter out here? Damn it. I have a boat. This isn't about a dented feder, is it? You figured that out, huh, Mr. Private Eye? Is this where you killed her? Back up. Against the railing. Here's the thing. I I don't really think I can swim.

Is he swimming? / What's that beside him? Is it a life preserver? Ah, looks like a toilet seat. Well, if it's floating, why doesn't he just grab it? - Oh too hard to explain. - Complicated story. - It's just a weird thing. - Monk! / Hey! What? What did he say? He said, ""Leap and a net will appear, my ass. "" Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Here, here, here. S Southeast barrier. Southeast barrier? What about it?

I'd like to thank everyone for coming. We have a lot of great events planned, culminating in a big dinner and slide show tomorrow night. Are there any questions? Yeah, how'd everybody else get so old? Now, come on. I think we all look fantastic. Does everyone here have a lapel pin? Okay, you need these to get into all the events and into the cafeteria. So if you lose one or you need another, there's a box of them in the corner. Help yourself. I guess that's it. Have fun and I'll see you around the campus. - Just some water. - Ice? Ten. Ten what? Cubes. - Wild. It's so wild. - Hi. Hi. Hello. Simon. Juliet. Oh, my God. Dennis, I can't believe it. Hey. Honey, you remember Mr. Amonk. No, um.. No, it's A. Monk. Adrian Monk. Adrian Monk. Right. I was dating Trudy Ellison. Oh, Trudy. Yes, I loved her. - Wasn't she great? - I think about her all the time. - Well take care of yourself. - Yeah. - Ten cubes. - You're welcome. Oh, shoot. Hi, excuse me. Are you going to the reunion? That's right. / Oh, great. Could you give these keys to Adrian Monk? - Who? - Adrian Monk? Um, Captain Cool? Captain Cool? Is he here? - Yeah. - Sure. I'd be glad to. Okay, great. Thank you. Have fun. / Okay. Who's Captain Cool? He was this weird guy. Real nervous. Always worried about everything. He spent every weekend defrosting his refrigerator. So we called him Captain Cool. The last time I saw you was Mischief Night, 1981. You and your friends were throwing toilet paper everywhere, right? - Mischief Night. - That's right. / Right. I don't remember you. I wasn't with you. I was following you. - I was cleaning up. - Was that you? You had a girlfriend with short red hair. - Belinda. / Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. She and I, we got married. But, uh, she passed away. Oh, my wife died too. Trudy Ellison. - Yeah. - It's tough, huh? But you just have to move on. No, we can't move on. We can try, but we'll never get past it. It's unrelenting. All we can do is live out our days alone in hopeless, quite desperation. Would you excuse me? I, um I'm remarried. My family's waiting for me. Thank you. Captain? The lapel pin. I just remembered where I saw it. - Where? - Just now at my desk. No, I mean where Tell me about the pin, Randy. Monk. He's been wearing the same pin all week for his 25th college reunion. I think you're right. - Did the victim to go Berkeley? - No, she worked there. She was a nurse in the university clinic for, like, 20 years. But she didn't graduate, so this isn't her pin. The killer. It fell off the killer. Which means the killer is at the reunion with Monk? This looks delicious. So this is where you ate? - I mean, this was your hangout? - I don't know. Natalie, I think I've seen enough. Let's just go. No, I'm not gonna let you go. - You've been looking so forward to this. - I don't know what I was thinking. These people weren't my friends. Okay? They don't even remember me. The truth is, I was invisible. It was Trudy they loved. I was always just the guy with Trudy. Just like you're the girl with me. Mr. Monk, why is your name on the spit shield? Oh, when I was here, there was nothing protecting the food. So you donated all of these? That is so generous of you. Well, actually, it was more of a lawsuit. Took up a lot of my spare time. Adrian. There you are. We've been looking for you. - Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger. - Hi. - Diane Brooks. - I'm his assistant. Ah. Oh, so you two aren't No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. Not no, no, no. Okay. - Where are you sitting? - I'm not we're not Kyle and I are over here. We saved you a seat. Fair warning, we brought a lot of pictures. See, you have a friend. No, she was Trudy's roommate freshman year. - Well, she saved us a seat. - Out of pity. It's what we call pity seats. It's just pity. So, Kyle, you didn't go to Berkeley? Me? Hell, no. Community college. CC all the way. Never had much of that book learning. Kyle works for my father now. He's one of our top salespeople. Yeah, it's like Monopoly money. Daddy pays me and I give it all to her. Kyle, not now. You promised. So, Adrian, what do you do? I'm a private detective. I do some consulting. Really? Sorry. You don't look like a detective. We don't have any children, so we just show pictures of our house instead. Oh. Well, it's beautiful. We designed it ourselves. And that's Tangerine. Wait Didn't you used to have a dog named Tangerine? What a memory! That's amazing. Trudy was always bragging about his amazing memory. That's right. I had a poodle junior and senior year Tangerine. / That's right. And then Kyle brought home this big ball of love a couple weeks ago. Yeah. He was already named. That's what they were calling him at the shelter; Tangerine. Isn't that funny? What are the odds of that? That's 'One in a million, maybe. One in a trillion. Mr. Monk, forget about the dog. How could the same person have two dogs 25 years apart just happen to be named Tangerine? Tangerine? And this Tangerine is black. Why would anybody lie about a dog's name? I don't know. But there is something weird about that guy. Diane said that he couldn't wait to meet me. But he didn't even know I was a detective. Mr. Monk, come on. Let's have some fun. You said you were gonna show me your dorm room. All right. It's right here. This is it. Old 303. Uh oh. Tie on the doorknob. My roommate and I did the same thing. It's a code. Yeah, I think I might know about that. / Yeah. It means don't come in, I'm reorganizing my closet. Your closet? Yeah, my roommate freshman year, Greg he reorganized his closet four or five times a week. Uh.. huh. And did his girlfriend ever come over to help? Oh, yeah. All the time. They were real neat freaks. I used to tease him about it. ""Neat freak. "" Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't believe it. He's still here. Hello, old friend. Remember me? Oh, I knew we'd meet again. It is our destiny. Natalie, put your hand right there. Do you feel that? No. He's afraid. Step back. Step back. I'm going in. Whoa. I'm gonna need a spatula a pan and a Bible. There you are. Captain, what are you doing here? Looking for you. I was about to give up, then I heard some clowns downstairs talking about a guy up here defrosting a refrigerator. Who's Captain Cool? Captain Cool lives. The return of Captain Cool. The Iceman coming back. Might be me. - Katherine Rutherford. - Ring a bell? She was a nurse here at the school clinic. Found one of these near her body. - A reunion pin? - Yeah. Did you notice anybody missing a pin? - I haven't noticed. - I guess not. Hey, Monk. How's memory lane? Oh, pretty awful. Thanks for asking. Listen, I was at the security office going through some old files. Think we've got a name Henry Kalimarakis. Well, that's a name. / Oh, oh, oh, he was on the swim team. Correct. He was trying out for the Olympics. administered a drug test. Henry came back positive for steroids. She turned him in, he threatened her. Said she ruined his life. Well, that's what the kids call a motive. Then he waited 25 years to do something about it? Who could hold a grudge for that long? I could and have. Let's check him out. Wanna come with? Maybe later. I want to show Natalie the library. I was just there. It's nothing special. It's where he met Trudy. Have fun. Oops, I didn't know he met Trudy there. I used to work here part time. It was here. I was standing right here. It was a Tuesday, 4:30. She was wearing a white blouse. There was a button missing. There was little thread sticking up. You remember it like it was yesterday. It was yesterday. Excuse me. Hello. I can't find a book. This is not the Dewey Decimal System that I know and love. Do you work here? Yes, I Yes, I do. Uh, here's the thing. We're reorganizing. And uh we're we're moving all the stacks upstairs. What are you looking for? This is a long shot. Trevor Rosenthal's biography of Alexander Pope. Volume two. Uh, yeah, I How did you do that? I saw it last week. And you remembered? If I see something once, I never forget it. That sounds pretty awful. My bad memory is my salvation. ""Thus let me live, unseen, unknown. Thus unlamented, let me die "" ""Steal from the world and not a stone tell where I lie. "" You know Alexander Pope. - It's just - So you never forget anything? For example, you're never gonna forget this? Me, us talking right now? Hey, Captain Cool, you work here, right? - Where's the Xerox machine? - Downstairs. Whoa, hey It's Trudy, right? Yeah, I met you at Poor Herbie's two weeks ago. I've been thinking about you. You owe me a few hours of sleep, young lady. Drew, right? / You got it. I wanted to call you. I've been dying to call you, but I lost your phone number. Oh, please. / It's true. It's been driving me crazy. Have a little mercy here and give me another chance? Well, it's a new number. I don't even know it myself. Hey, Captain, do me a favor? What, uh What are you doing? You mean now? Going back to the student center. Me too. I'll walk you. - Are these yours? - Yeah. See, chivalry isn't dead. And that's how I got her number. Wa wait, you mean when he wrote it on your back, you could feel it? - You could do that? - I have very sensitive skin. That's like a superpower. Like a really weird, not very useful superpower. It took me three weeks to call her. It was the bravest thing I ever did. She was already dating that other guy, Drew. Yeah, but she chose you. Never forget that. She chose you. Yeah, but I don't know why. I mean, he was just written up in Time magazine last year. He's a famous heart surgeon. He's rich, he's happy. What was she thinking? Oh, Mr. Monk, she knew exactly what she was doing. I can't believe this kiosk got all cluttered again. Yeah, well, I guess you'll have to just come back for your 50th. Okay, come on, come on, come on. Adrian. Oh, my God. Did you hear about Nurse Rutherford? - Ah, yes we were just talking about it. - Can you believe it? The police are here. They're talking to everybody. They said she was killed. Were you close with her? Well, I haven't talked to her for years. But - But still. - Horrible. It's horrible. Diane. Hey, honey, are you okay? The nurse who died Rutherford. Apparently, Diane used to know her. These things happen, right? I mean, it's a big city. - Hello. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Have you all met? This is Trudy. / Gertrude. But your nickname's Trudy, right? I had I had an aunt that called me Trudy. So it's Trudy. Trudy and I met over at the fountain, and I've invited her to join us for lunch. Okay, all right, where are we eating? How about Rocco's? - Rocco's? - Rocco's. Honey, you've been telling me about Rocco's for years. You said it was your favorite hangout. Honey, I'm not even sure it's still there. It is. I checked. / No, no, no, no. Rocco's, you don't want That that place is terrible. They have this this rotisserie thing in the window, with this one sad, lonely hot dog going around and around and around. That sounds great. Huh? Come on. I'm not taking no for an answer. It'll be my treat. Come on, let's go have lunch. Huh? Honey, are you okay? What's going on? I just want you to have a great reunion, huh? Who's hungry? Actually, I've already eaten. Oh, Trudy, have some coffee. There's always room for coffee, huh? Here we go. - Who is this guy? - I don't know. I can't believe I'm eating at Rocco's again. I used to have nightmares about that hotdog. Hey, it's me. Yeah, I just left her. She's sleeping. The sleep of the innocent. Yeah, we all ate at Rocco's. Took some doing, but I finally got everybody to go. Now all I have to do is get everybody to play touch football tomorrow, and we're home free. Hang tight, baby. Just one more night. She'll be dead. and it'll be just you, me, and a big pile of money. Oh, look. There's a reception ""for all current and past chess club members. "" Weren't you in the chess club? That sounds like fun. You never know. Could be fun. Natalie, have you ever seen a chess club? - What are you doing? - Weeds. Mr. Monk, there are weeds everywhere. What are you gonna do clean up the whole campus? Here it is. Katherine Rutherford's employment file. / Yeah. So, if there were any complaints or any grievances against her, they'd be in here, right? We'd have a copy of it, yeah. But I can't think of anyone who had anything bad to say about her. Katie was an angel. A great nurse. - It's just heartbreaking. - Yeah. Did you did you go to school here? Me? No. You look familiar. - Maybe one of your kids? - No. I was here one time, though, for a no-nukes rally. That was a long time ago. - Yeah, that must be it. - It must be. Captain? I tracked Kalimarakis. I don't think he's our guy. Number one, it turns out he was allowed to join the Olympic swim team as an alternate. - He got a waiver. - So there's no motive. / Right. Number two, he's dead. He died in 1995. And number three, he moved to Europe in the late '80s. So there's no record of him ever returning Randy Randy, excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but could you read number two again? Okeydoke. He's dead. Right. See, I probably would have stopped reading after number two. In fact, I would have read number two first. - You would have switched, them? - Yeah. But that's just me. And probably every other adult on the planet Earth. Anything in her file? No, not a single complaint. Excuse me. Is this the right place? It says, ""In loving memory of Katherine Rutherford. "" Yeah, this is the place. Thank you. That was a lovely wreath. She must've meant a lot to you. Katherine Rutherford saved my life. My senior year was really tough for me. I remember. Your mother passed away. That's right. I was in a really bad place. So I wrote a note a suicide note. I don't even remember what is said. And then I took 53 little white pills. Katherine was worried about me. So she came by the apartment, she broke down the door, and she called 911. I wouldn't be here today. A wreath, you know, a few flowers, it's the least I could do. Hey, who's up for some football, huh? Football? / Yeah, yeah, come on. Four on four. These guys just challenged us to a game. No, we didn't. Your boy here challenged us. Whatever. Come on, we gotta show these guys how it's done, huh? Old school. Come on, it'll cheer us up. Let's play. Everybody's playing. Natalie, Adrian, come on. A little bit of touch football? Here's Here's the thing. I'm not a big football person. And the touching, that doesn't really help matters. Okay, Adrian, help me out, please. Diane has been a little depressed lately. All I'm doing is trying to cheer her up. - Oh, here, I'll hold them. - Oh, thank you. - Yeah, yeah, okay. - All right. I'm in too. Let's go. Let's do it. Uh, let's make the end zones that tree to the walkway. We'll be shirts. Okay, Randy. Randy you stay and play football if you want to. I'm gonna go work on this little homicide investigation. I gotta go. Look at that. Look at that. And you said you don't play, Come on, let's go, you guys. Watch it, fellas. Watch it. That's all I'm gonna say. Let's see a little hustle. Randy. Okay, let's huddle up. Come on, everybody in. All right, Adrian, I want you to go out, and then cut over to the left. So that's one inch up, and three inches to the left? No, Mr. Monk, it it, it's like a map. Like a scale map. - Okay, what's the scale? - I don't know. Uh, one inch is 20 feet. So that's 60 feet. I I, I'm gonna be in the shrubs. You're sending me into the shrubs? Okay, you know what? Let's keep it simple. All right? Everybody just go out. Try and get open. And if you get the ball, don't get touched. Okay, give the ball to Mr. Monk. He hates being touched. All right, break. Here we go. Here we go. Adrian, you hike it to me. And ready, hike. Adrian. Hike. Come on. What's up. Go, go, go, go, go. Yeah, yeah, Mr. Monk! Yeah! Okay, Diane, you're going to be quarterback this time. / What? Me? I don't know what I'm doing. / Sure you do. Listen. Just look for me, okay? I'm gonna get open. And break. - Okay. - Okay. All right, uh Say ""hike. "" Okay, okay, hike. Diane, over here. I'm open. Sorry, that was my bad. It was the sun in my eyes. Oh, my God, that is so weird. I can't believe that happened again. What? I broke a I broke a window in the science building right over there my senior year. I tried to force it open, and it just shattered. Guess the jinx continues, huh? He missed that ball on purpose. He dropped his hands. I think he wanted her to break that glass. But why, Mr. Monk? And the dog. What about the dog with the same name? And how he insisted everybody eat at Rocco's? What was that all about? / I don't know. Maybe the guy is eccentric. No, I'm eccentric. He's up to something. Oh, yeah! That's Trudy Ellison and, um What was his name? Adrian Monk. No, that's not it. Um, Anthony something. Excuse me. - Adrian Monk. - No, no, that's not it. It's um What is his name? Folks! Excuse me. Could you kill the music? Thank you. Sorry to interrupt your dinner. This will just take a minute. My name is Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. I'm with the San Francisco police department. And we're working on a homicide investigation and we could use you help. As you may know, a woman was killed on Friday night. Her name was Katherine Rutherford. She worked as a nurse at the university clinic. Now, we have reason to believe that someone in your class possibly somebody in this room might be involved. We're looking for information. If anyone knows anyone who might have had a grudge against Mrs. Rutherford either now or in the past or someone who might be missing their reunion lapel pin, the alumni reunion All right. Hey, hey, hey. Settle down. Settle down, everybody. This this is completely out of context. You can't tell the whole story from one photograph. You didn't have a permit. Yes, we did. It expired at noon. It was 12:06. Like I said, it expired at noon. Okay, come down. Are you all right? I'm gonna take her back to the hotel. Is she all right? Yes, she's been feeling a little depressed lately. I'm gonna have her lie down and we'll be back for the last dance. Thank you for your, uh, help. Thank you. You forgot to give them the toll free number. You know, I don't think we're gonna get any hot leads from this group, Randy. Shoot. Diane's earrings. I forgot to give them back. Hang on a second. What do you think? Well, it looks like they're from the same set. I mean, they match perfectly. - Whose earrings are these? - Diane Brooks. She and her husband left about a half an hour ago. He said she was depressed. He's been saying that all week. - Were they in town Friday night? - Um yeah, they got in the day before. Oh, my God. Captain, I think Diane is in danger. I think her husband is planning to kill her tonight. - Mr. Monk, what's going on? - Okay, I have a theory. It's completely crazy, but it would explain everything. Kyle and Diane moved recently. At some point, Kyle must have found some of her old papers personal papers including the suicide note she wrote 25 years ago. Her suicide note? He realized that with that note, he could kill his wife with impunity. It was in her handwriting. Nobody would ever question it. ""The depression is overwhelming. Give Tangerine a good home. No relief. Even today I was eating at Rocco's with Adrian and Trudy. Breaking that glass in the quad today felt like the final straw. "" But he had one problem. Because the note was obviously, there were a couple of things in it that were no longer true. - Like the name of her dog. - Exactly, and breaking that glass. And eating at the restaurant ""with Adrian and Trudy. "" That's what he was doing all weekend. He was recreating parts of her life to match that suicide note. So when we found out, we wouldn't be suspicious. - Why did he kill the nurse? - He had no choice. Katherine Rutherford read that note 25 years ago. It would have been made public. She would have recognized it. Oh, my God, Mr. Monk, he could be doing it right now. Registration sheets are all gone. Monk, do you have a cell phone number? / No. - Do you know where they stayed? - Some hotel. There are over 200 hotels in this city, Monk. It'll take us over five hours to check them all. Hold on. What's he doing? I don't know. What are you doing? The hotel where they're staying. It was on the registration form. Yeah, so? When Diane signed in We were standing in line. She wrote She wrote on my back. Can he do that? / That's how he met Trudy. It's his superpower. Oh. There's her name. Home address. Okay, Mr. Monk it was near the bottom. She has terrible penmanship. Why did it have to be cursive? Oh, oh. She ordered the prime rib, medium rare. Keep going. It's just below that. Yeah, there's an L. Uh L, E. - Lexus! Is there a Lexus Hotel? - No, that was the car they drove, Monk. - Keep going. - Oh, oh, oh. Uh, there's a P. P no, P. B, B, B! / B? It's a B, it's a B, it's a B, it's a B. B, B L. L. Bl Bla Bluh - A. The Bla - The Blaza! Pl Pl Plaza. B L A Y The Bla the Bla The Blakemore Hotel. That's right up the street. Don't fight it. No! Let go. Grab her. Grab her. Grab her! It's okay, it's okay. It's all over. Here's the note. I found it on the desk. What? Trudy, I just There's something I love you. Then we're in big trouble. I love you too."
"Why would you say that? You are sick in the cranium. You shouldn't even be here at all. You should be in a hospital. You need shock therapy, you really do. You need a lobotomy. Well, you need someone to pound that stupid face in. So you want to take this outside. - I would love to, I will love to, - I hear a ""but"" coming. But I am going to be meeting Dr. Kroger at 8:00. / No! - So I can't take it outside. - Dr. Kroger, thank God. Haven't I Haven't I always had the 8:00 time slot on Friday? Dr. K, will you tell this lunatic what you told me? You said, and I quote, ""Harold, we will finish this discussion the first thing on Friday. "" Listen to him! He didn't mean the first session on Friday. He meant the first thing during your regular session, right? Will you look at that? Look at him. He is so ridiculous. He is so jealous. It's like looking right into the face of crazy. Look at him. - He's acting like little 12 year old. - He's acting like a ten-year-old. - Well, he's acting like a five- year- old. - He's acting like a little baby year old. Oh, that doesn't even make any sense. - All right, Harold. - It doesn't it's not / Harold! You may have misunderstood. No, no, no, no, no! No, he didn't misunderstand. No, no, he has been trying to get that first times slot for years. I need to see him first, when he's still fresh. After you, he's all worn out. - After you, he's a basket case. - No, that is / Excuse me. - You have never seen what he's - I have - Harold! - We laugh. Why is this door open? How, how, how did you two get in here? - Harold broke in. - No, I did not. - Oh, come on, you were sitting - The the door was open. He's a liar. Dr. K. - What are you talking about? - You are lying. Who is it? It's Teresa Mueller. She's with the cleaning service. All right, we'll call 911. But don't use the office phone. And whatever you do, don't touch anything. - I said, don't touch anything. - Well, you touched it. I am allowed to touch it. I'm a former police officer. Right? MONK Season 5 Epi. 07 Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink Mr. Monk, are you sure you're okay? You know, maybe we should take you home. I am home. I mean, I've always considered this room, this office, my second home. Captain. Lieutenant. Look. The bottoms of her shoes. Clean. Somebody wiped them off. Why? That's a good question. Thank you. - Did you check the vacuum? - Yeah. Bag's empty. Completely clean. Wait. Excuse me. Uh, this belongs right here. - How do you know? - Because it's my chair. - What's all this? - I'm checking for prints. Cap uh Cap Leland, sir. Uh, Leland. Can we get somebody to dust this chair? - I just dusted it. - No, I mean dust it. Dust dust it. Dust the dust. Macy. When you're done, make sure that the chair is clean. - Okay. - Thank you. Monk, why don't you wait outside? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Captain, I have to do this. I have to This is personal. / That's precisely why I want you to wait outside. No, please. I'm begging you. Look, I have to be here. Please Lieutenant? All right. Teresa Mueller. She's been cleaning the building for 12 years. Start on the top floor at 7:00. Works her way down. This is always her last stop. So it probably happened about 10:00, 10:30. Somebody broke in looking for something, probably a file. Teresa comes in. Wrong place, wrong time. But but Dr. Kroger said he took a quick inventory. He didn't think anything was missing. So the guy panicked, killed her, took off. No, no, I don't I don't think so. No Those sofa cushions and those files. There's blood under them but not on them. I think he killed her first, and then just took his time and ransacked the place. But why would he do that? Maybe he wasn't well. Harold! Harold Crenshaw. You think Harold did this? No, I guess not. Damn it. Uh, Captain? They need to, uh, release the body. I've always been kind of curious about this place. / Yep. This is where it all doesn't happen. Is that Harold's file? Are you allowed to do that? Look, I knew it. I knew it! ""Paranoia, acute narcissism. Patient believes Adrian Monk is obsessed with him. "" Uh, if anybody is obsessed with anybody, he is obsessed with me. I've been telling Dr. Kroger that for years. We we talk about it all the time. Okay, but Mr. Monk, you should not be reading this. How would you feel if someone read your file? My file? What are you doing? Oh, uh I just had a theory about the case. I was checking a suspect. Hey, that's your file. Well, you can't rule anybody out. Mr. Monk, I do not think this is a good idea. Come on, just a quick look. It'll only take a second. Monk, you cannot read that. Wait, wait, wait oh, my God, wait. Monk, that's it. That's it. You've crossed the line. Out of here. Out. Okay. You okay? I saw something in my file. Oh, Mr. Monk. I told you not to look. What was it? Two words at the bottom of the page. - Two words. - What did it say? ""No, Hope. "" She worked for me, cleaning my office, for 10, 12 years. I I didn't I didn't really know her. I think she had a daughter. Yeah, one daughter in Santa Fe. No other family. - It's terrible. - Yeah. Doc, you know the door wasn't jimmied. Somebody had a key. Who else has a key to your office? Just me. And and Teresa. What about your patients? My patients? No, of course not. Well, there was an extra set of keys in the desk out front. Which wasn't locked. Somebody could've lifted them and made a copy. Wait, wait, you're saying one of my patients To be honest with you, Doc, that's how it looks. We figure somebody broke in, looking for a file. Probably his own file. Look, I realize that you're reluctant here, but I happen to be a homicide detective, and this happens to be a homicide investigation. I I understand. I truly hope you do, because if you do know something If you believe one of your patients could be involved in this, you are legally obligated to help us out here. Go on, ask your lawyer. He'll tell you. All right. There is one patient. He's delusional borderline schizophrenic. He always thought that I was talking to his ex-wife behind his back. He wanted to see his file to prove that I wasn't lying. Of course I refused. He threatened me. He he threatened to break into my office. I didn't think he meant it. What have I done? What's his name? Wheeler. Joseph Wheeler. There he is! Dr. Kroger. I just called your house. Your wife said you'd be down here. Doctor, I'm sorry. I tried to stop him. - He doesn't mind. - Larry, I'll meet you outside. Here's the thing at the crime scene. My file happened to fall open, and I accidentally read something, something you had written. A a notation. It's no big deal. Adrian. Not a good time. No, I I understand. I understand this has been a tough day. A woman was slaughtered in your office, for God's sake. This can wait until Monday. Adrian, I'm not going to be in my office on Monday. Perfectly understandable. You need some time, I'll see you Wednesday. Adrian, you may as well be the first one to know. I'm I'm quitting my practice. I'm retiring. - As of when? - As of ten minutes ago. I have some money saved. Maybe maybe I'll do some writing. As you both know, I don't have much of a sense of humor. So sometimes it's hard for me to tell - Mr. Monk, he's not joking. - Adrian. I cannot continue to practice any more after today. The police think that one of my patients killed Teresa Mueller. I should have seen it coming. I didn't. I missed it. This is all my fault. This this isn't happening. This can't be happening. Adrian, I promise you I'll get you another doctor. I'll I'll call you next week. Okay. So it's not true. You're not retiring. I mean you can't, because He he can't retire. This is step one in the grieving process. - Denial, denial. - He can't possibly retire. Damn you, Charles! Damn you to hell! I hate you. I hate you! You are dead to me. That's not denial. No, step two that's anger. Okay. Okay, we're all adults here. We can work this out. I can hire you full time. I'll put you on the payroll. This is step three. It's bargaining. It usually doesn't go around this quickly. Why me? Why is it always me? Everybody's always leaving me. - Depression? - This just can't go on. It's just too much. Okay. You're right. It's not the end of the world. I'm just gonna have to find another doctor. I owe you so much. Thanks to you, I think I can get pass this. Thanks, doc. And finally, acceptance. - Thank God that's over. - He can't retire! The man can't quit! Because he's not a quitter! - What's going on? - I don't know, I don't know. It's like he's starting all over again, like he's in a loop. I hate you for this, Kroger! You are dead to me, you understand me? Dead! I I really should be heading home. Okay, okay, let's be reasonable. I'll come to your house. You'll never have to go to your office again. That's fair. Why? Why me? Why are they always leaving me? This place is great. Oh, cool! Hey, you can build your own bear here. Look, I know you have strong feelings about this one, Monk. But if you can't handle it, tell me now. - Don't go all ""you"" on me. - Watch it. Hey, you gonna go with the little baseball cap or the army helmet? - Patrolman's hat. - Oh. Why don't you give him your badge, too? You're not using that, are you? Go find the manager's office. See if this guy wasn't working on Thursday night. Yes, sir. Every baby bear needs a heart. So why don't you go over there to the heart room, and get a wonderful new heart for your wonderful new friend? Joseph Wheeler. I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, Homicide. This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. - Do you know Dr. Charles Kroger? - Is this about the cleaning lady? She had a name. Teresa Mueller. Ranger Joe! It's not beating. You have no right to be here. This is where I work. Actually, for the moment, we work here too. - You're squeezing it. - I know what I'm doing. Dr. Kroger said that you wanted to see your file. Let me ask you something. If some shrink had your file, wouldn't you want to see it? He said when he wouldn't show it to you, you threatened him. You're hurting him. I was in the middle of a divorce. I was in a bad place. I wasn't thinking straight. That doesn't mean I'm a killer. - I think you broke its heart. - Yeah, well, join the club. Okay, okay, okay. I think that he's good. I think he's okay. Look, look. You said yourself you weren't thinking straight. You broke into Kroger's office, didn't you? / No, no, not me. Yeah, you surprised Teresa, you panicked, you grabbed a letter opener, and you stabbed her. - And you know what else you did? - Monk. Do you have any idea? Dr. Kroger quit. He quit. He's giving up his practice forever. That's what you did. You're a patient too. I heard about Dr. Kroger. You think I wanted him to quit? I would've taken a bullet for that man. I love Dr. Kroger. He was all I had. That's how I feel too. I don't know what I'm gonna do without him. Wheeler was doing inventory until 1:00am Thursday morning. You mean he's not the guy? - What are we gonna do? - What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? I'm so bereft. I'm bereft too. We're all bereft. Everybody's bereft. And I've been thinking about Natalie. I've become so dependent on her. Too dependent. I don't know what I'm gonna do if she leaves. I maybe should say ""when she leaves,"" because it's just a matter of time. She's gonna die, or find another job. Either way, I'm screwed. Mr. Monk, I don't really feel comfortable about this. Well, it's Monday morning, 9:00am. I have to talk to somebody. Okay, but you can not talk about me. Okay? - I'm off limits. - Fine. So, when I was 12, my mother decided to go back to work. She said it was only part time, but she was gone almost every night That's hard. I know. I remember when my mother started to do volunteer work. - It was so difficult - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What are you doing? - I'm just talking. That's not how it works. Nobody cares about your problems. So I keep thinking about Dr. Kroger's file. Those two words. You know? ""No hope. "" ""No hope. "" That could mean a lot of different things. - Like what? - Like, it could Uh Uh I didn't see that last week. - Must've been covered up. - What? From here to here, it's been vacuumed. She vacuumed part of the rug. Well, what does that mean? It means she didn't walk in on the killer. He walked in on her. He knew she was here. He must have heard the vacuum. He was after her. This was all about her. Hi, hello. - Are you guys cops? - Not technically. No, but we work with the police. This is Adrian Monk, and I'm Natalie Teeger. Ah, Francis Merrigan. I have the office, uh, right there. Import - export. Oh, right. I I saw the door open. I got a little worried. You know, after what happened last week, you can't be too careful. Right. Can I tell you the truth? I'm kind of glad Doc Kroger's leaving. I mean, he's a nice guy. But his patients You know what I'm talking about. No, I don't think that I do. You know. I mean, some of them whoa! I I could see them from my office. It was like a freak show. Well, I'm sure that they're doing the best that they can. They are doing the best they can. Oh, yeah, sure. Uh but One of them did kill Teresa, right? Actually, we're not so sure. We were just talking about that. Well, I, uh I'm gonna make some coffee. I got a long night ahead of me. So I'll let you guys get back to work. - Okay, well, it was nice to meet you. - Yeah. Good luck. Very thanks. See you soon. Have a good night. Adrian. / Dr. Kroger, it's me. Adrian Monk. How did you get here? Where where's Natalie? - Natalie refused to bring me. - Good for her. I had to take a cab. It was horrible. - I'd love to talk to you about it - Adrian, no. No. I have told you, I'm retired. Here's the thing Joseph Wheeler did not kill Teresa. Adrian, I've been talking to the captain. I know that. It doesn't matter which of my patients killed Teresa, it is still my responsibility. But I don't think it was any of your patients. It was not about you at all. Adrian, of course you would say that. You you want me to come back to work. Hey, dad, close the damn door! It's freezing! - Is that Troy? - Yes, that's my son. Oh, he sounds wonderful. I hope he appreciates how lucky he is to have you in his life. The food's getting cold. We're not waiting for you. Mmm, something smells good. Adrian. Adrian. I can't invite you in. It's just I'm thirsty. I'm parched, really. Adrian, you can't come in. It's really inappropriate. Isn't it? Adrian, you've got to let go. It's not easy. I've been seeing you for almost nine years. No, I mean, you've got to let go of the door. Oh, yeah. Adrian, I promise you, I will find you another doctor as soon as I can. That's good. That's good. Two Two two more fingers. Go on, good. Go, go, go. Come on, that's very good. Great. I read your notes. What did you mean by ""No hope""? What does that mean? No hope. You get out of here! I'm here. You are out of your mind. You're crazy. No, you are sick. Go get a life. You're pathetic. You're crazy. You're out of mind. Dear, no, no. Don't don't answer that. Wait for the police to come. It's Adrian Monk. Oh, Mrs. Kroger. Is there a problem? Somebody threw a rock. It broke a window in the bedroom. How did you get here so quickly? We just called 911, 30 seconds ago. Well, I / Adrian, have you been out there all this time? It's been three hours. What have you been doing? - I was looking for my, uh - Hey, dad, ""Telegram for Dr. Kroger. "" ""Dr. K, you ruined my life. You will pay. "" You were in the den and the light was brown? That's right. Is that important? It means he could see you. He could have hurt you if he wanted to. I think he was just trying to scare you. Well, he succeeded. So you think it was definitely one of my patients. Well, that's what we think, yeah. - And nobody saw the car? - No. - Monk, can you ID the car? - No, sorry. I don't think he'll be back. But if it will make you feel better, I can offer you some protection. I'll do it. Be glad to do it. I'm the bodyguard. - No, it's not necess - I'll move in. I'll be right here with you, 24/7. I'll never leave your side. I just have to go home, pick up a few things, okay? Actually, I was thinking of a couple of these guys parked out front. - Great. - That would be Couple of cops out front. That's great. Fine. - It was just a suggestion. - Okay? - Wait a second. - What? I've seen that rock. I know that rock. - This particular rock? - I, I, I know that rock. I've seen it before somewhere. If anybody else had said that, I'd have said they were crazy. - Where? - My dad thinks I did it. - Troy, that's not true. - Yeah, right. Before you guys got here he asked me if I did it. Why don't you admit it? Why are you afraid of telling the truth? What kind of shrink are you, afraid of the truth? Troy, I'm sorry, I was upset! Hey, Troy, remember me? Yeah, I remember. - You, uh, staying out of trouble? - No. All right, why don't you just wait upstairs, son? I told you never to call me that! Look, officers, is there a way that a doctor or like a psychiatrist could fix a DNA test? Because there is no way Charlie and me are related. Troy, please. You're not my mother, Madeline! And that man is certainly not my father! He's your father, Troy, you're going to have to accept that! / No! Hey, what do you want from me? I've taken the test three times! Whatever! Um, we'd better be going, Monk. - Come on, we'll give you a ride. - Yeah. There'll be two guys out front, Charlie. You need anything, call me. I appreciate it. Adrian, I have some really good news for you. I called a colleague of mine earlier tonight. Dr. Jonah Sorenson. He's a great doctor. Very famous. He usually doesn't take new patients. But he's heard about you, so he's gonna fit you in. Maybe I'll call him. Actually, um, you have an appointment. Tomorrow, 5:00. Adrian Monk for Dr. Sorenson. Fill this out. It says ""List any phobias. "" That's right. There are only five spaces. You can use the back. I might need another sheet. I might need another sheet. I might need another sheet. - Mr. Monk. - That's right. Jonah Sorenson. Why don't you fill that out later. I hate all that paperwork, don't you? Yes, sir. Come on in. Are you ready? So, what do I call you? Um How about Adrian? Adrian good. Dr. Kroger sent me over your file. Seems like you've made excellent progress in the last year and a half. Oh, really? Is that what it says? Well, I've only taken a glance at it. Yeah, well, keep reading. Near the end, he's not quite so optimistic. Dr. Kroger is a good man. I'm gonna miss him. Yes, he's a he's a good man. He's very symmetrical. Symmetrical. Oh, you mean, like, well balanced. That's a nice way of putting it. Are are you okay? Yes, I'm.. I'm fine. It's just Just some dust. I understand that you spend a lot of time talking about your late wife. Tell me about her. Yeah, Trudy. She was a very beautiful Very very symmetrical woman. - A anything else? - No. Just beautiful and symmetrical. And.. and you have a brother, Ambrose, and an assistant Natalie Teeger? Tell me about her. In a lot of ways she reminds me of Trudy. She is also quite Quite - Symmetrical? - Yeah. Adrian, I get the feeling you're not very comfortable about my right arm. / No. Oh, no, no, no, no. No, not at all. Where is it? I lost it in a boating accident two years ago. / Oh. But I look upon it now as a positive experience. I've learned a lot about trauma and loss. The things that you're going through. Uh, huh. ³× - Can you handle it? - I'm sorry. I'm just used to the way things were. - Change is difficult. - Change is impossible. Well, I wouldn't exactly say impossible. Look, it's not just you. It's everything. It's this office. I spent nine years in Dr. Kroger's office. I knew every book on every shelf. Every leaf on every plant. Every rock Are you okay? I have to go. - Now? - Yeah, yeah. Let's remember where we were and we'll pick it up later. Oh, I mean I'll pick it up. Or you could pick it up. We'll both pick it up. We'll each take one end. I don't wanna talk about picking it up anymore. - Doctor? - Oh, no. Oh, Dr. Kroger. Thank God. I figured I might find you here listen. Adrian, you have got to respect my decision. No, no, no, no, I'm not stalking you. - At least not for the moment. - All right, all right, just give me a minute. The captain said that I could come in and pack up some things. How did your session with Dr. Sorenson go? Okay, I guess. I don't know I just felt like there was something missing. - When was the last time you saw him? - Um.. four or five years ago. How's he doing? I heard - I heard he lost some weight. - Yes, he lost a little weight. Ah! Oh! I think I have big news about the case. - I remembered where I saw that rock. - That rock? Rock form last night. It's been driving me crazy. Then all of sudden, pow! It was right there. But it's amazing. You remember one particular rock? Well, I've been staring at it for nine years. You know, gift/curse. Who else has access to this courtyard? Uh, just me. And Francis Merrigan. Do you see anything? I see a lot of powdered milk. Eight or nine cartons. He was carrying a carton with him yesterday too. So? So I don't see a coffeemaker, do you? No. Powdered milk is made from lactose. Drug dealers use it to cut heroin. You think that Francis Merrigan is dealing drugs? And I think he murdered your cleaning lady. Adrian, I don't think you should talk about Francis Merrigan anymore. Why not? Is he here? - Is who here? - Mr. Monk. No. What's up? How are you doing? I'm scared to death. What do we do? Okay. First thing. We have to move. I'm gonna need you to come over here. Okay. Now what? What do you mean? What's the plan? I don't have a plan. - Why did you have me switch places? - I always sit on this side. I've been thinking a lot about my brother lately No, no, Adrian. This is not a session. I'm really frightened. I don't know what's going on. Okay. Okay, do you see those figurines? Check the label. They're from Turkey. That one in the corner it's cracked. Obviously ruined. Why didn't he throw it out? Drugs? But what does that have to do with Teresa? I think Teresa broke that figurine. I remember, after we found the body, I asked Lieutenant Disher if he'd checked the vacuum cleaner. He said the bag was completely empty. But think about it. The bag couldn't have been empty if she had been vacuuming rugs all night. I'm I'm not following you. On Thursday night, Teresa was cleaning Merrigan's office. She must have knocked over that figurine. It broke open. - It was filled with powder. - Heroin? She had no idea. She just vacuumed it up and moved on to the next office your office. Meanwhile, Merrigan comes back. He sees the broken figurine. He figured out what happened. He knew somewhere in that building was a vacuum cleaner bag filled with heroin. He went looking for Teresa, and caught up with her in your office. Merrigan must have checked the bag to make sure the heroin was still there. Once he found it, he couldn't just let her go. She had seen too much. Then, he rifled through your files threw a rock at your house, so everybody would think it was one of your patients. Everyone did. Everybody except you. Adrian. I hope someday I'm as good at my job as you are at yours. So you're not quitting? Right now, I don't know if it really matters. We're in big trouble here, aren't we? Yeah. I'm never going to see my family again. My son I'm sorry. Do you think anyone will ever find us? I don't see how. Nobody in the world has any idea where we are. Don't worry, Dr. K I'm coming. I got your back. No sign of a struggle. Well, that's a good sign, right? Okay, somebody say ""right. "" That's right, right, That's good. Disher. Yeah, no, do it now. Captain, they're patching somebody through. He says he knows where Monk is. This is Stottlemeyer. Wait hang on, sir. Just slow down. Harold? All right. Okay. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Could you - Could you put me over there? - Pardon me? Please. I can't I can't be on this side. Please, I'm begging you. Just look into your hearts. He has a problem with ""situational disorder. "" Okay? Believe me, he's got a lot bigger problems than that. - So what do you want to do with them? - I figure we'll let Frankie decide. He's not gonna like that. Especially after what happened with that cleaning lady. What choice did I have, huh? What is all this? Dust bunnies? Yeah, it's from the vacuum cleaner. Just just clean it out. Here. Pick it out. It's everywhere. Just make it look good. Careful, don't lose any. This is pure stuff, you know. Look, I know what I'm doing, all right? Sift through it. Just make sure there's no more of that stuff. Careful. / It'd be easier if we had tweezers. I left them in the car. You should have that stuff in your arsenal. What is your mess. There's some on the table. Some mess for a cleaning lady, huh? Be careful. Watch it. Hey, hey. Hey! Police officer! Drop that gun! - No Shot. - Me, neither. No! Drop that gun! Get down! Show me your hands. Get down the ground. Show me your hands. Show me your hands! Relax, Harold. Take it easy. You'll be okay. We're gonna get a doctor. - We'll get a doctor. - How's he doing? He's gonna be okay. Did you see what he did? He took a bullet for me, Adrian. Monk Monk come here. Closer. Beat that. Listen I want to ask you something. When we were here investigating, my file happened to fall open and a couple pages fell out. And you read your file? I couldn't help it. I happened to glance down. And I saw something. Two words. ""No hope. "" ""No hope""? Is that what you think? Oh, Adrian, I would never say that about anyone, especially about you. Oh, wait, I remember. I remember. It wasn't ""no hope. "" It was ""N. Hope. "" An abbreviation for ""New Hope. "" We were talking about your father, and you said he was born in New Hope, Pennsylvania. New Hope, Pennsylvania. Yeah. You feel better? I knew it was something. Natalie was worried. Yeah, I'm sure. - Isn't this great? - Yeah. It's pretty great. Oh, I'm having trouble sleeping. I think I'm developing a fear of blankets. Is there a name for that? I I don't think so. Uh, oh."
"Hey, Billy. You've seen Kris Kedder? Check his trailer. Hey, man, what's going on? Where'd you get that? Disc jockey I know. They sent him an advance copy. Do you like that cover? That was my idea. Stealing my credit, stealing my song, was that your idea too? - What, your name's not on there? - Not, don't give me that. Peggy's Gone to Memphis, words and music by Kris Kedder. You know, you told me if I kept my mouth shut, if I was a ""good boy"" that you'd take care of me. I guess you figure I'm just some dumb roadie that you can rip off and nobody's gonna care. Okay, Stork, my man, let's just relax. Now I was gonna talk to you about this. I'm gonna offer you five grand. Five grand? - For a hit song? - Look, dude, you got talent. You co-wrote a great song, but you don't understand how the business works. I didn't co-write anything. I wrote that song, every note, every line. I let you take half-credit because you said you would jump-start my career. All right, all right, all right. Look, shh, let's just keep your voice down, come here. What's the matter, you don't want anybody to see us? No, just, whoa, come here. Yeah, hey, you know what, I don't blame you. The rock and roll legend hasn't written a half-decent song in the years. Well, I got some bad news for you, rock star. I can prove I wrote that song. I made copies of the sheet music, sent it to myself, registered mail. - That's not legal. - You want to bet your career on that? What are you doing? I'm calling a copyright lawyer. I'm taking my song back. All right, you win, you I'll give you half credit. / Mr. Jackson, all right, listen, my name MONK Season 5 Epi. 8 Mr. Monk Goes to a Rock Concert Captain! Oh, Captain, for the record, this was all her idea. All right, I I wouldn't even be here if I could drive or had anything else to do. Okay, I give up, what is it? It's a $34 dry cleaning bill to clean the shirt and jacket that Mr. Monk ruined when he ran through the poultry farm to recover the ransom money in the Jimmy Creskow kidnapping case. - What are you going to do about it? - Try to ignore it. No, no, no, we've already submitted this twice. It is a work-related expense, and we are entitled to compensation. - Not my idea. - Look, I couldn't agree with you more. I think you guys are entitled to every dime you can get. But there's nothing I can do about it. Lieutenant Disher is the disbursement coordinator. Okay, where is he? - Uh, he's not here he called in sick. - Is he okay? You know, he didn't sound too good, he's got a fever and he's got a cough. That phlegm fluid thing? Okay, okay, okay, when Randy is not here, who is in charge of payout? That would be the assistant disbursement coordinator. - And who is that? - We don't have one. - Anything else? - Nah, that covers it. Hello, Karen. He what? When? When? What I thought Jared was grounded. Well, how did he get there? Okay, I'll take care of it. Yeah, no, I'll call you. My kid, my oldest has skipped school, and Karen thinks he's gone to a rock show. Oh, I used to do that. Play hooky, go to rock shows. - You did? - All the time. Anyhow, I gotta get up there, see if I can't find him. / Okay. Oh, you need some help? Yeah, you know, I wouldn't mind. Thank you. - I'll come with you. - Sure. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. I'm sorry, I just can't picture you at one of these. What are you talking about? I used to go all the time. Get a bus into the city, see the Stones. Look at this mess. Well, for God's sake, it's gonna take me all day to find him here. I'm gonna miss a whole day's work. An entire day. Gonna wring his little neck. Hey, Captain, he's just a kid, don't you want to just stay out here and calm down before you go inside? No. Ah, wait, wa wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. What what kind of rock show is this? - It's the biggest festival of the year. - Festival? Oh, great, Mr. Monk. You thought they were real rocks? Like a geology exhibit? Like in a museum? Maybe. Perfectly understandable mistake. No, not really. Okay, well, no harm done. So I guess I'll need a ride home. Monk, I'm not going home without my kid. All right, look, I I can't move it. I can't do it. I I can't go in there. Okay, Mr. Monk, come on, the Captain needs you. But there's 10,000 of them, and not even one of me. Okay, look, I understand Monk. Why don't you just go wait by the car? - Yeah, I'll go wait by the car. - Okay, it's gonna be awhile. Yeah, I'll be okay, don't worry about me. Take your time, but but hurry back. But take your time. And hurry back Bracelets. All right, people, bracelets. Let me see them. Bracelets, people. Keep your arms up, see your bracelets. I don't have a bracelet, all I have is this. - How can I help you? - I'm looking for my son. Okay. / He's 15, uh - Uh, he's about 5'6"". - 5'6"", 15.

You don't have anything more recent? Uh no, I guess not. All right, look, I'm gonna do what I can. Meanwhile, you guys take these. You'll have full access, backstage, wherever you want. If you still can't find him, we'll make an announcement from the stage, all right? - Appreciate it. - Okay, good luck. Bracelets, people, let me see them. What? You think I don't spend enough time with Jared. Why, because I haven't got a bunch of pictures of him? Doesn't mean anything. How many pictures of Julie do you walk around with? Ah, I get it. You think I'm avoiding the boys on purpose because I feel guilty about the separation. And the fact that I'm dating Linda. Is that it? Don't you ever shut up? Okay, look, you go that way, keep your cell phone on. Give me a call if you find him. Excuse me. Excuse me. There's no dancing here! Uh, this is a parking area. This is for vehicles, and people waiting for the captain. I'm sorry, I don't make the rules. That's right, you don't. What are you doing? Oh, hey, hey! This is the police captain's car! How old are you? There's no way you're 25. Excuse me. Attention, may I have your attention, please? Excuse me. / Yeah. Is there a taxi stand? I I need a cab. Not around here, buddy. - Is there a pay phone? - Yeah, down on the right. Down here. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. Pay phone? This way? That way? This way? That way. Sorry, am I am I heading toward the pay phone? - Uh hey. - Over here, over here! Try to minimize the rough housing! Can we? Uh, phone? Who threw that? Who threw Who threw give me that. Who's? Who was it? You have to watch what you're doing! I've seen people's eyes poked out with these things. Not not poked out, but cornea was scratched! Or bruised, or there was some discoloration! I'm next. Phone. Uh, uh, Mr. Monk! What are you doing? I was just calling for a taxi. They're gonna pick me up out front in about ten minutes. But, Mr. Monk, that wasn't a phone booth. No no, that wasn't a phone booth Natalie, that was some kind of horrible plastic outhouse! Oh, my God. What was I talking into? My God, where's where did I put that quarter? For the love of God, Natalie, where did I put that quarter? Oh, my God. Oh, how long do you think I was in there? I don't know, Mr. Monk, maybe a minute. That was rough. It was like some kind of medieval torture device, that thing. Yeah, I know. I actually read, for the Spanish Inquisition, they used to lock people in Port-A-Johns. That wouldn't surprise me. All right, I, I it's it's time to go. No, no, Mr. Monk, we haven't found the captain's son. Excuse me. Excuse me, hi. I heard some cops talking back there. They said you're some kind of detective. That's true, I am some kind of detective. Hi, uh, Kendra Frank, I'm a roadie with Trafalgar. Now, here. I was a friend of Stork's. Here. I was more than his friend, I was his sponsor at Narcotics Anonymous. Uh huh, and, uh, Stork is The roadie? The roadie they just found? Oh, God, I'm so sorry. - Stork. - His real name was Greg Murray. Look, they're trying to say that he OD'd, okay? That's impossible. He's been clean for 17 months. I know, I talk to him about it every day. Well, Kendra, we were there, we saw a needle in his arm. No, that's how I know there's something wrong. Stork was completely phobic about needles. He was the only roadie I've ever met that didn't even have one tattoo. I mean, he missed a whole South American tour last year because he wouldn't get vaccinated. Well, maybe he got over it. You don't just get over a phobia like that overnight. Do you? No, you don't. - So, please. - What what is this? Well, they gave me his stuff, so, um It's his tour jacket. This is a map. Yeah, I have one of those. They gave it out at the door. - You say he was afraid of needles. - Yeah, that's right. He had an acupuncture appointment at 7:30 this morning. / What? Hello? Hey, Randy, how you doing, buddy, I'm I was worried about you. - Captain? - Yeah. What time is it? Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you up? Hey, what's that music I hear? Oh, it's just my stereo. It's broken, I can't turn it down. Wow. - Listen, Captain, thanks for calling. - Sure. I'm gonna I'm gonna get up now. I think I should make myself some soup. Oh, soup, that's good. Yeah, fluids are good. Drink plenty of fluids. Fluids, okay, I will. - Thanks for calling, Captain. - Take care, all right. My boss. Whoa, Captain. Lieutenant. Did you, uh, did you call in sick too? No, Randy, I'm looking for Jared. Well, here's what happened with me. I was on my way to the doctor, and the I was and the the I got nothing. Let's go find Jared. Black bandanna and sunglasses. Yeah, it was this morning, about 7:30. I remember. He was my first patient. Oh, was that the boy who died? The overdose? Heartbreaking. - How does that feel? - Horrible. Look, are you sure that's him? He was a friend of yours I'm sorry. Did he say anything? No, not much. He just told me a story about how he met Eric Clapton. He loved Eric Clapton. Oh, and he dropped this. Oh, my God, I made this for him. He loved this earring. Did he say anything else? Please, Annie, I have to know. He asked me where he could score some H. Heroin. H, heroin starts with an H. It's a street talk - Got that. - He said he was giving up. He wanted to get high. He said he used to be afraid of needles, but he got over it. I don't believe this. Well, I guess he's with Kurt, Jimmy, and Janis now. - Who? - I'll tell you later. Well, then he paid me and left. - Did he talk to anyone else? - No. Oh, no, but when he left, he stopped to help some kids, some girl, she had a beach ball. She was having trouble, so he blew it up for her. - A blue beach ball? - I think so. He blew that up? Thing almost killed me. I hate that beach ball. So it's true. They were right, he OD'd. I'm so sorry. Thank you, for trying. Mr. Monk, no! No, no, no! That's 400 watts. No no no. Dad? You needed backup, huh? This should help, just rub this in twice a day. Did he really touch a heat lamp? Why? I don't know. What about the other hand? He kept touching it. I don't know. They found him in a Port-A-John. Can you believe it? I know, we were there when it happened. He was so young. Overdose. The medical examiner should be here soon. If you could just step back. No, no, no, no, it's it's okay, I'm a police officer. At least, I used to be. There's no mud. Excuse me? On his boots. There's no mud. There was mud all around those outhouses. Yeah, but they carried him out. Okay, but who carried him in? No other track marks. Are these his? This this rubber strap was around his arm? That's right, I took it off myself. You work with drug addicts a lot? It goes with the territory. Natalie. They wrap it around, like this, then they tie it in a knot. Yeah, like like this. And then they pull it tight with their teeth? - That's right. - I'm not doing that. There's no other way to tie off your own arm? No, sir. - No teeth marks. - Wh someone tied it for him. You're in big trouble, you know that, don't you? I know. Can't I just stay for Kris Kedder though? He's on next, please, I've been waiting all year. Forget about it, Jared. You're under house arrest. You're grounded for two weeks. Captain! / Monk. Can we get out of here? Who's this? This is Kendra, this is a friend of the guy they found in the Port-A-John. Oh, yeah, I heard about that, sorry. - Overdose? - I don't think so. I think he was murdered. We can't leave yet. We can't leave? We can't leave I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Did you put this up? - Not me, no. And it was definitely locked from the inside? Yes, sir, uh, we had to jimmy it. He says it was locked from the inside. They could've rigged the lock. Over. Yeah, you know, it would help things if you were to stand a little closer. That's not gonna happen. Over. So is this how he does it? From 100 feet away? Not all the time. How long are you gonna be? Ah long as it takes, miss, this is a crime scene. With only one cop? Ah it's not just me. You see that guy up on the hill, he's a cop. And, uh, this guy here's a police officer. Oh, these guys are great. Oh, I hope they do Killer Machine! Killer Machine! Uh, I'm checking out the lock here. There are some scratches. Are they recent? Over. Yeah, there's no rust. Hold on. I got a little piece of wire here. It looks like a guitar string. Is that a B string? Nah, it's a D. A high D from a 12-string giutar. - Those are pretty rare. - Kris Kedder uses one. Yeah, yes he does, on the new single, right? / Yeah. - I love that solo. - I love that solo too, man. - Oh, yeah, right near the end. - Yeah. Uh, yeah, it's a guitar string from a 12-string guitar, apparently it's fairly unusual. Okay, isn't there a vent on the right side, up near the roof? Over. Yeah, Roger that, about 31/2 feet above the lock. He must've been killed somewhere else. They put the body inside, tied the wire around the bolt And ran the wire through the vent so they could lock the door from the outside. Yeah, you didn't wait for me to say ""over. "" Over. Hello? Over. Over. I'm saying ""over. "" You're right, there's a contusion. And some hemorrhaging. Was he, uh, was he hit? Hit, fell I'll know more when I get him under the lights. I thought Adrian Monk was here. Uh, yeah, he's, uh, he's backstage with Natalie. They're following a lead. Oh, I love this song. I can play this one on the piano. Good for you. Hey, Jared, thanks for your help with that guitar string. - I didn't do anything. - Sure you did. That was an important clue, and I might have missed it without you. We make a pretty good team, huh? What is that? What? Runaway child? Guess we don't need this anymore. Where'd they get that picture from? It's when we went to Cabo. Was that the only one you had? Look, Jared, it doesn't mean anything. I'm, uh, it's a new wallet. It's not a new wallet, liar. I bet you have 1,000 pictures of your girlfriend in there. Jared, please. A pretty good team, huh? Not a team at all. Or a family. Hey, this has been tough on me too. I lost my family too. ¢Ü She sends pictures From that place ¢Ü ¢Ü She didn't wanna go ¢Ü ¢Ü Haunted by her face ¢Ü You're on in 20. Well, thank you, brother. ¢Ü Peg I miss you so ¢Ü Excuse me. This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. They're with the cops. Cops? / Yeah, they're looking into what happened to Stork. What's the big mystery? He's been chasing that dragon for years. - I tried to help him. - When did you try to help him? See, now that he's dead, everyone was his best friend. - Where were you when he was sinking? - Where were you? ¢Ü Peggy's gone to Memphis ¢Ü ¢Ü Found another home ¢Ü ¢Ü Signed that piece of paper ¢Ü ¢Ü And Daddy's all alone ¢Ü - That's a nice song. - Thank you. It comes out next week, you should buy a copy. In fact, buy two. I got my eyes on this new beach house. You are Kris Kedder, the famous rock and roll song singer? I guess I am. Right, uh, this this was found at the scene. These are from a 12-string guitar. You're the only musician that has one. I am. What are you saying, Stork was strangled? I'm not saying anything, just asking questions. That's all. Chill, you know, out. Hey, man, anybody could taken it. I don't lock my case. You're out of tune. - Do you play, Mr. Monk? - A little bit, clarinet. Whoa. Clarinet. Hey, man, maybe you and I can get together and jam sometime. When I'm like 87 years old. You have mud on your boots. Yes, I do. I must be at a rock festival. It's just that I don't see mud on anyone else's shoes. I see some on yours. You were gonna show me where Stork lived. Yeah, he had a camper, it's back here. - It's locked. - I got the key, he trusted me. You mind if I tag along? Now you got me kind curious. He lived in here? He loved it. Between gigs, he'd take off, camp out. Sometimes I'd go with him. What did you do if one of you wanted to be happy? Asthma. Since I was a kid. Hmm, it smells like mint. It's imported from Denmark. - Do you want a hit? - No, thanks. Rhyming dictionary? Yeah, he was writing songs. That was his dream. He was really shy about it though. He wouldn't even play me his stuff. Who's this? Oh, that's his daughter, Margaret. Oh, no, where is she? Tennessee, her mom moved her there after they split. I guess I should call them. I know their number somewhere. Oh, hell, I'm late. Gotta go be famous. Catch you later. You'll catch me later? What? Something's wrong. Did either of you move anything? No. / No. Something's different there was an envelope. White envelope, right here. There was? Huh, it's a receipt. Registered mail, he mailed something to himself. I remember that. That was about six months ago, I went to the post office with him. He was mailing sheet music to himself. He called it as an insurace policy. What song? - I don't know. - I think I do. The song Kris Kedder was just singing. Peggy's Gone to Memphis. Kedder didn't write that song. Stork wrote it about his daughter. Peggy is short for Margaret. Peggy's Gone to Memphis. Oh, my God, he just took that envelope. We can't prove anything without that envelope. ¢Ü She sends pictures from that place ¢Ü - Come through. - Excuse me. ¢Ü She didn't wanna go ¢Ü - Move it, move, move, move! - ¢Ü I am haunted by her face ¢Ü ¢Ü Peg I miss you so ¢Ü ¢Ü Peggy's gone to Memphis She's found another home ¢Ü - Do you think he still has it on him? - I don't know. ¢Ü Now daddy's all alone ¢Ü Kris, whooo! ¢Ü She's found another home ¢Ü You are a God! ¢Ü Signed that piece of paper ¢Ü ¢Ü Now daddy's all alone ¢Ü ¢Ü Daddy's all alone ¢Ü He's gonna burn it, go, go, go, go. Excuse me. ¢Ü Well there's nothing That I can say ¢Ü ¢Ü Do I matter today? ¢Ü ¢Ü And you'll see Daddy's wave ¢Ü ¢Ü And it would end that way ¢Ü All right. Everyone, put your hands together welcome Ro Bolero! Wait, you Kris Kedder? You mean the singer? - He's the guy. - No, no, no that's not possible. I've known Kris Kedder for years. - Personally? - No. Here's what happened! The roadie, Stork, wrote a song. What? The roadie, Stork, wrote a song! Kris Kedder stole it! Stork must have confronted Kedder! Kris killed him! What? He tried to make it look like Stork OD'd! So he stuffed him into the hellhole! - You mean that Port-A-John! - No, I mean the hellhole! Hellhole what? At some point, he remembered that Stork was off drugs and that he was afraid of needles! He knew that nobody would believe that Stork OD'd like that! Then he had to make it look like Stork was back on drugs and over his fear of needles, so he disguised himself and he went to the acupuncturist! And he made sure he mentioned he was looking for heroin! Right. And he put the map in Stork's pocket to lead us to the acupuncturist. And he closed the door. And he locked it from the outside. God, I can't here the music. I think I've gone deaf. Mr. Monk, the song is over. Monk, it doesn't matter, the the D.A. not gonna buy it. We don't have anything. We don't have any real physical evidence! What about what about the sheet music? Nah, he burned it onstage! All we got are these these guitar strings! And that's not enough, and you know it. The beach ball, the beach ball. Excuse me? When he was pretending to be Stork, and he was still still in disguise, Kedder blew up that blue beach ball. There's a million fingerprints on that ball, Monk. The proof is not on the beach ball, it's in the beach ball. - Oh, the asthma. - In the beach ball? Kris Kedder has asthma. He uses an inhaler, very distinctive inhaler. And it's mint flavored, it's one of a kind. If we can get that blue beach ball to the lab intact You're talking about the air inside the ball. / Yes! There was a witness, somebody who witnessed him blowing it up! / Yes! And he was impersonating the victim! Is that enough? - Yes it is. - Get that ball. - I got it. - Over here! I got it. There is it. I'm a police officer. I need that ball. Over there, over there. Over here, over here. Excuse me. Excuse me. Oh, right here, right here. That ball, I need that beach ball! Right there, that one, the beach ball! Miss, I'm a police officer, I need you to drop that ball. Okay. - What the hell are you doing? - Whoa, whoa, calm down. We got a police emergency here. This guy needs to talk to the crowd. Thank you. Excuse me, hello. - I don't mean to kill your buzz. - Go home! I am a former police officer. Thank you, thank you very much. Take it easy. Everybody chill. That blue beach ball contains material evidence in a homicide investigation. So we need you to bring the blue beach ball, down to the stage. Hey, you suck! Yes, I know. I know. It's true. I am a straight. But I have a dream. A dream that someday all the hippies all the straights can live together side by side. Not too close. Because, you know, the smell. You know, the hippie smell. Okay, okay, people, I need that ball! I'm not joking! Music! Music! - Music! Music! - All right, that's it. That that's obstruction! You're all under arrest!

Hey, man, you do everything the cops tell you? You know I don't. - I like your shirt. - Thanks, man. - You play? - Yeah. Me and you, we should jam sometime. Jared, listen to me. If he deflates that ball, we don't have a case. Dude, he's trying to set me up. Because of what I am. - What I represent. - That's nonsense! Jared you might not like me, but you know me. Hey. You don't trust cops, do you? I trust this one. - Don't don't do it! - Come on, let's go. Punk. Be careful with this. You know Detective Kramer? He's waiting for this at the lab. / Yes, sir. Hey, check this T-shirt out. Sweet, huh? Oh, that's gonna be worth a fortune when he's convicted. Exactly. Mr. Monk, what did you think of your first rock concert? I like the old songs. Why don't people write old songs anymore? I don't know, Mr. Monk. Hey, we'll meet you guys back at the car. Jared, what do you think? How about a couple of pictures for my wallet? So I got a good one for the next time you take off. All right."

Hell, I'll do it. It should've been done a long time ago. So what's so important, hmm? We're being audited or the depot burn down or something? Looks like you were in my office. It's our office, Ben. We're partners, remember? At least I thought so. These are forgeries. Kenneth, you're an accountant. You don't know the first thing about maintenance. Do I have to call Chicago and crosscheck these invoices? Because I will. You, you been buying recycled parts for these rigs and pocketing the difference? / I don't believe this.

I'm, I'm beseeching you. I promise I'll never ask for anything else. Please! Please, I gotta have that cookie! - Okay, fine. Take the cookie. - Thank you. That was a little crooked. - What's up with that elf? - Mr. Monk, the elf is perfect. - A little droopy - No, no, no, no! That, that telephone for you. Julie, do not let him touch those cookies. - Okay. - Hello? Julie? Please, give it to me. Yes, captain, he's right here. Yeah, I'll tell him. - Just give it to me. - No, Mr. Monk. Stop, stop. Okay, I'll tell him. Julie, it's okay. Mr. Monk, you can have any cookie you want. Yeah. Mom, what happened? It's your father. My father? I almost forgot you had a father. Honey, everybody has a father. Well, it's just you don't mention him very much. Not everyone has a father worth mentioning. He's downtown. He's in jail. When was the last time you saw him? Ah, it was a lifetime ago. I was eight years old. He said he was going downtown to pick up some dinner. And I watched him drive away. He waved to me. I'll never forget that, how he waved Then he was gone. My childhood was over. My mother never laughed again. Families are always complicated. It wasn't complicated. He just waved, then he was gone. Let's see here. Jack Monk. They picked him up for a traffic violation. He ran a red light. What? They brought him in for that? Yeah, he resisted arrest. He shoved the cop. When they brought him in for booking, he started asking for you. We got him in a holding cell upstairs. His rig is parked in the impound lot out back. What rig? His rig. It's a tractor trailer. Your dad is a truck driver. I don't think so. He's a writer. He writes school books. You two obviously have a lot to talk about. What are you doing? I'm speed reading. - What's your rush? - I'm old. Jack Monk, your son is here. I'm looking at you but I see your mother. Um, no. I'm Leland Stottlemeyer, sir. This is Adrian. That man looks just like your mother. Adrian, how are you? How am I? - Is that what you said? - Yes, how are you? That's a rather conventional salutation. In Texas, people use it all the time. - Texas? - Yeah, yeah, Midland. I got a place in Midland, but I'm hardly ever there. I'm driving 18-wheelers. Long hauls. ""I travel for travel's sake to come down off of this featherbed of civilization. "" Robert Louis Stevenson. Jack, I don't want to hear that. You called me. I'm here. What do you want? For one thing you can call me ""dad. "" No. I'll settle for ""pops. "" ""Pappy?"" You know, forget about it. I'm getting used to Jack. What do I want from you? Two things. A, forgive me. Forgive your father. I was negligent. I was selfish. And I'm very sorry. B, get me the hell out of dodge. But if you can do one, I'll take B. I gotta be in Phoenix early in the morning. That's why you called me? After 39 years to fix a parking ticket? I know you can do it. I've been reading all about you. You are a hotshot detective. Which I take a little bit of credit for. Who read Sherlock Holmes to you every night? ""Holmes, oh, you amaze me. "" Adrian, here's the thing. If I don't get to Phoenix in the morning, I lose the job. And this gig, it's my life. What do you say? I say good-bye. Monk Hey, Monk, look. He's not a young man. If you walk away now, you might never see him again. You promise? - Mr. Monk? - Yeah. Well, I'm, uh, Randy Disher. - Hello, Randy. - I work with your son. This is an honor. - And a pleasure and a privilege. - Why? I, I don't know. I just thought it was an honor and a pleasure. I could be wrong. Here's your release, sir. - Oh, great. - Free to go. / Okay. I thought after I'm done with this run I would stop by and we could talk. - You know, catch up a little - Don't say that. Don't say anything. Just go. And when you drive away, don't wave. Okay. - Well, merry Christmas anyway. - Right, right. - Ask him. - Ask him what? You know what. Ask him. - Jack. - Yeah. Long as you're here, why don't you stay and have Christmas dinner with Ambrose and me. It'd mean the world to him. I wish I could. I'm already three hours behind. You see? He wishes he could. You could come with me. - With you? - Yeah. You'll be back here in three days. I don't think so. Okay, maybe another time. Take care. What? I can't just leave. I, I don't have my toothbrush. - I can't travel without my toothbrush. - You can buy a toothbrush. Or my pillow case or my Trudy kit or my house. I never go anywhere without my house. You can buy all that stuff, Monk. What you can't buy is another shot. Jack, wait up. Wait up. Other side. Come on. You thirsty? No, no. No, thank you. What? Here, look. I'm wiping. Come on. Here. You still got that thing about germs, huh? I'm not surprised. Your mother said you would outgrow it, but I tried to tell her people don't change. They say they're gonna change. They swear to god they're gonna change. But at the end of the day, you are who you are. So how was your childhood? Oh, it was great. It was a laugh riot. You should've been there. You're right. I should've been there. But I'm here now. I'm here, too. Do, do you hear that? Sounds like a rattle. Look, relax, relax. - Do you want to drive? - Uh, no. Come on, it's easy. It's like shifting gears. It's like riding a bike. I can't ride a bike. You can't ride a bicycle? I never learned. No one ever taught me. Okay. You want to get into it? Let's get into it. Adrian, I never planned to leave, okay? I went out to get some Chinese food, and on the way back I open up a fortune cookie. And it said, ""stand by your man. "" ""Stand by your man. "" Yeah, that's right. It sounds crazy, but it affected me, all right? It hit me right here. I realized I am my man. I gotta stand by me. I gotta follow my bliss. Well, I was driving home, and I kept on going. And I've been driving ever since. - Senior? - Excuse me? It's says, ""driver: Jack Monk, Sr. "" Oh, boy. Is there a Jack Junior? Your brother. I have a brother. It's another brother. It's a big day for you. A lot to digest. My other brother. And he's Jack Junior? If it makes you feel any better, I left his mother too. Why would that make me feel any better? I don't know. He lives in Baltimore. He's 31. He's an orthopedic surgeon. Very well respected. He's famous. He wants me to come live with him. I said, ""what am I gonna do?"" ""Sit on the porch and pet a dog all day long until I drop dead?"" Not for me. He looks happy. Yeah, that was his birthday. He was eight. - That's a nice bike. - That was his big gift. That's me, teaching him how to ride. Hey, I got an idea. Why don't we buy a bike? Come on, let's do it. I'll pull over and teach you how to ride. It's never too late. Yeah, it is. ¢Ü Eleven pipers piping ten lords a leaping ¢Ü ¢Ü nine ladies dancing eight maids a milking ¢Ü ¢Ü seven swans a swimming six geese a laying ¢Ü ¢Ü five golden rings ¢Ü Hello? Natalie. Oh, it's Mr. Monk, it's Mr. Monk! I've got Mr. Monk, I've been so worried about you. Where are you? How's it going? What's he like? Wait, hold on, I'm gonna put you on speakerphone. Hold on. - Merry Christmas, Monk! - Hey, happy holidays, buddy! Natalie, this was a big mistake. I need to go home now. Please. Please, I want to come home! Please, please. Mr. Monk, I'm taking you off speakerphone. Hello? What happened? What am I doing here? He doesn't like me. He never loved me. He doesn't love anyone except for maybe Jack Junior. Jack Junior? It's his other son. He bought him a bike. I never got a bike! There's another brother. Natalie, can you pick me up? Mr. Monk, it's only been a few hours. I don't think you should give up. Just keep talking. I'm sure you have a lot in common. That makes sense. You made a lot of good points. Now come and get me! Mr. Monk, I can't. I can't just leave. I mean, for one thing everybody but Julie has been drinking. He wants to talk to you. Hello? Mr. Monk, I can't. I don't have a license. I don't even know where Arizona is. Please stop crying. I He hung up. They're not as happy as they look. There! - There, there. You hear that? - Yeah. Normally I'd check, but we're screwed if we don't reach Phoenix. We gotta drop this load and get to Yuma by 4. Yuma? But we just went through Yuma. Why didn't we stop there first? Don't ask me. Ask the itinerary. ""San Francisco, Phoenix, Yuma, Tucson, Carson city. "" Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're zigzagging back and forth. - What are we carrying? - Toys. Can you believe it? I got two bosses. Partners. One of them, Ben Glaser, he marches into the office last Tuesday and he announces that he has found religion. Just like that out of the blue. This is a guy who never set foot in a church before. Then he goes and buys a bunch of toys. He loads up the truck, and he offered me five grand to drive around and hand them out. I feel like Santa Claus. I even got a costume back there. Hey, you wanna be my elf? But why are we zigzagging like this? - It makes no sense. - I asked him. He said he moved around a lot when he was a kid. Foster homes, orphanages. He wanted to retrace his steps city by city. What do I know? He's the boss. - I think we should take the 402. - We gotta stick to the route. The 402 is a straight line. It would save us an hour and a half. You know, you're right. It doesn't hurt to ask. Tiger trucking. Hey, hot stuff. Jack Monk here. I want to warn you before you say anything naughty. I'm not here alone. I'm here with my son. Hello. Is that Jack Junior? Sweetheart, I feel like I know you the way your daddy's always bragging on you. Every day he walks in with a new story. ""Jack Junior said this. Jack Junior won another award. "" Valarie, Valarie, this is my other son, Adrian. Who? Adrian, from a previous administration. You never mentioned him. I guess you really are an international man of mystery. Oh, Jack, you haven't heard from Kenneth Woods, have you? No. What happened? Well, everyone's looking for him. Karen said he went out shopping Monday and he just disappeared Hey. Hey, Jack, it's Glaser. Yeah, how's our little mission of mercy going? So far so good. We're outside of Phoenix. Ben, I was thinking of shooting up the 402. No, no, what the hell is wrong with you? Just stick with the route that I gave you. It looks like I can save about two hours. There is construction up and down the 402. It's like a parking lot. I know what I'm doing here, Monk. Okay? Anything else? You're the boss. Damn right I am. Don't forget it. He found religion? Who's been good all year? Me! I've been good. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Santa! - Okay. Ah, what have we got? Let's see what we got. Let's see what we got. This is for you. The kids have been looking forward to this ever since Mr. Glaser called. It's like a miracle. This is for you. Isn't Santa Claus the greatest? Isn't he the greatest man in the whole world? See what else we got. - I don't know. - This is for you. I don't know him very well. This is for you! - Well, nobody really knows him - What else we got. because he only comes around once a year. An easter bunny. That's correct. Who's Ronnie Milsap? I have no idea. What's this? It's a dreidel. - What's it do? - I don't know. I don't mean to seem ungrateful, but who selected these toys? Spit it out. Just spit it out. This is the worst Christmas ever! Where did you get all these stupid toys? At the dollar store? I hate you. Now, Kathy, you don't mean that. I do too mean it. I hate you to death. Go back to the North pole and die. What are you doing? Oh, Jack, there is something wrong here. Look, a whole trailer for six boxes? What are you looking for? I don't know. Drugs maybe. - Drugs? - Or guns, weapons. That's impossible. Well, at least it would explain what's going on here. Your boss, this Glaser. I think - I think he's using you. - For what? I don't know. But he did say he used to be an orphan here. I was just upstairs. I checked with the administrator. There's no record of him. You're checking up on my boss? What if he hears about it, huh? What are you trying to do here? My job. This is what I do, Jack. And I'm good at it. I know when something feels wrong. Look at this. Look. Shampoo, dog food, Q- tips, das kapital by Karl Put everything back in here, please. You're gonna get me fired. - Jack - Get it all back in. Think about it. Think about it. He's making you drive zigzagging back and forth to deliver this? All this junk? It doesn't make any sense. You want to know what doesn't make any sense, huh? You want to know what doesn't? This is the first day we've been together in, in 40 years. Are you trying to help me? No. You are trying to sabotage me! I'm 68 years old! You understand that? And nobody's gonna hire me. I need this job! You're impossible. You've always been impossible. And your brother and your mother too. Now I remember why I left. What did you say? Next time I bring Jack Junior. Get the job done properly. You coming? I gotta get out of here. You know where I am. Yeah, I know where you are. You're just running out to pick up some Chinese food. Tiger trucking. Hal, Val. It's me. Tell the man I'm on schedule. I'm heading back to Yuma. Uh, he's a little busy right now. Something happened, Jack. Kenneth Woods is dead. He was murdered. What? Two hunters found his body in a gulch near the 209. I don't believe it. I just saw him at the Christmas party. I know. When they found him, he was still wearing that tie you gave him. The police are here and they're talking to everybody. - Should I come in? - Uh, hold on. It's Jack Monk! He wants to know if he You tell him no! Just tell him to keep driving! Everything's fine! Did you hear that? Yeah, loud and clear. I'll check in later. Take care of yourself, Val. You too. Bye. - Where you bound? - Yuma. Did you take a wrong turn? Shouldn't you be on the 402? The 402's a parking lot. It's wall to wall. Where'd you hear that? I've been on the 402 all day. It's wide open. Clear sailing. How did you find me? I knew you'd walk in a straight line. You always did. Ben Glaser lied to me. The 402's wide open. And his partner's been killed. So how was he killed? I didn't ask. I didn't think to ask. You really believe there's a connection between Kenneth Woods' murder and me - being sent out on this wild goose chase? - I don't know. Seems like your boss, Mr. Glaser, wants you out of the way. Oh, that's impossible. I'm a great guy. Ask anybody who's not related to me. - Here you go. - Thanks. / Thank you. Two Christmas specials. - Enjoy. - Thank you. It's touching. It is. It's great. After all those years. No, I mean the food it's touching. Okay, okay, I forgot. I forgot. Don't worry. I'll fix it, I'll fix it. Don't worry. I forgot. Carrots separate. Good? There you go. Nice and separate turkey. Good? Thanks. You have a picture of her? Trudy, right? I'm glad. I'm glad she was there for you. Okay, come on. So detective, what do we do now? - Call the police? - Not yet. Your boss is up to something, but we still don't know what. No, I think we should stick to the route and drop off the toys. Just see what happens. Eat your carrots. I missed you. Good, huh? ¢Ü Silent night, holy night ¢Ü ¢Ü Holy infant so tender ¢Ü ¢Ü tender and mild ¢Ü ¢Ü Sleep in heavenly ¢Ü ¢Ü heavely, heavenly peace ¢Ü ¢Ü Oh, lord ¢Ü Atticus one, this is gumbo pot. Thought you'd like to know you're coming up on a plain brown wrapper. Roger that. If we see it, we will stop and pick it up. No. Plain brown wrapper. That's an unmarked police car. He's trying to warn us. Gumbo pot, this is atticus one. You're making it harder for the highway patrol to enforce the local speed limit. Which isn't very cool. Over. Jack, who the hell was that? What's this? It's a GPS. - Eye in the sky. - 5,000 miles. It's a memory chip. It remembers the last 5,000 miles that you drove. What are you doing? You started in Texas, right? Then we drove from San Francisco to Phoenix to Carson city. That's about 5,000 miles. Jack, pull over! Stop, stop the truck. Tell me about your boss. Is he a driver? He used to be. Does he ever borrow any of these trucks? Yeah, all the time. How do you know that? Here's what happened. Ben Glaser borrowed a truck, this truck. And he drove out to see Kenneth Woods. They must've had a fight. Makes sense. They hated each other. Ben killed Kenneth, and he hid his body. But he had a problem. There was a record of where he had driven that day. - Big brother! - Right. And he knew that eventually the cops would check the GPS computer. He had to erase it and quick. He had to put 5,000 more miles on this truck! So the box would reset. And he sends me out on this wild goose chase. Son of a bitch bastard! - Excuse my language. - It's okay. I'm a trucker. It's unbelievable. You solved it. You did it. You don't even know these people, and you solved the case! Just like when I used to read Sherlock Holmes to you. You'd figure it out by page two. What about the proof? This truck is the proof. It's all the evidence we need. As long as we can keep this under 5,000 miles. The district attorney can introduce the memory chip from the satellite why is this thing moving? Is this thing broken? - Come on. - Uh, Jack. Jack! What do you mean ""uh-oh"" What does that mean? It can mean a variety of things, but in this case, it means no brakes. Jack / Oh, no! No! / Jack! Oh, my god! Do it again! Pump the thing! Turn some knobs! You haven't even touched these buttons! Look out! Jump out and save yourself. I can't. I can't just leave you here. Easy! - There's gotta be a runoff. - What? It's a little side road for trucks in trouble. Look for a runoff! - There it is! - Where? Oh, we just passed it. You have to turn around. Turn around! I gotta say something. I'm sorry I wasn't there for you and Ambrose. I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm a bad father. That's all that matters. You're not a bad father. Look at Jack Junior. - He's a putz! - What? Actually, he's not even a putz. He dreams one day of becoming a putz. He lives downstairs in my basement. He smokes pot all day long. He steals money from my wallet. He's not a doctor? No, I made it up. I lied. I wanted to have a son that I could be proud of. I didn't know I had one in San Francisco. Dad, there it is! There's another runoff! - Are you okay? - Yeah. You called me dad. Oh, there goes the case. It's all been erased. I guess your boss is gonna get away with murder. You called me dad. - Um, I cleaned out his desk. - Hmm? Oh, yeah, thank you. Valarie, let me take that. You know, look, people, listen up. I know this is a tough time. And as Kenneth used to say, this is more than just an office. You all are family. And I think that's how we're gonna get through this By, by just supporting each other like a family. Oh, it's Jack Monk. Well, better late than never. Now who is this? Come on now. You know the rule about passengers riding in the cab. And you know the rule about killing your partner. Hello, Ben. Told you we might be back. This is a warrant for your arrest. You've gotta be kidding me. We've gone all through this stuff. You were with your partner, Kenneth woods, when he was killed. We can prove that. Jack, who the hell is this guy? He's my son. I don't believe this. Some orthopedist from Baltimore is accusing me? This is another son. Adrian. A homicide detective. Ex-detective. I hope to be reinstated soon. - You didn't apply yet? - Dad, I'm fine, all right. You want me to make a call? Okay, look, I can take care of myself. You were in this truck, this particular truck the day Kenneth disappeared. - We saw the sign-out sheet. - That's right. I borrowed it, and I went fishing. Now can you prove that I didn't? Because if you're talking about the GPS system, that thing's already been erased. It's only got a 5,000-mile memory, hmm? We don't need a GPS system to prove anything. There was this loud noise like a - Yeah, it was like a rattle. - Rattle. - Flutter. - Flutter driving us crazy. We figured, it's gotta be a fan belt. It wasn't a fan belt. Mr. Glaser, can you explain how part of the victim's necktie was found in a vehicle you were driving? Adrian! Oh, I'll be with you in a minute. Merry Christmas! I, I didn't get you anything. Oh, yes, you did. Here, it's all yours. I'll be right with you. Your first bike. Get on. I'll be holding you. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. - That's it. Now I got you. - Don't let go. So there's nothing to be afraid of. Are you ready, sir? Okay, start pedaling. Let's go. - Slowly. - Don't let go. I'm not. Okay. Go straight, go straight. That's it. Make a turn now to the left. Easy, easy. That's it. Pedal a little faster. Oh, you're doing great. You got it. You got it. You got it, look at you. That's it, like you've been doing it all these years. Dad, can I get some mud flaps? Come on. Yes, you can. That's my boy! Come on! Big circle. Big circle. Keep your eye on the road. I'm with you. That's it. Pedal harder. Keep pedaling. Go straight. Straight, straight. Go ahead, go ahead. - Hey, dad, watch this. - Go ahead. That's my boy. Come back. Come towards me. The finish line. Will he make it? Yes! Let me hear the bell. Attaboy."
"Hello. Your liquor license is expired. It's probably all right. My name is Adrian Monk. I'm meeting someone. Mr. Monk? Thank you for coming. Sit down. I know your work. I'm a big fan. There's, uh, more light over there. I prefer the dark. You obviously got my note. And the money. $500 to meet you alone, ten minutes. It's very generous. There's more where that came from. I have a job to offer you, Mr. Monk. It will take you one night. Not even one night. Two hours. I'm willing to pay you $20,000 for your trouble. My name is Derek Bronson. Bronson? Bronson technologies. I, I thought he, you You thought I was dead. Most days, I wish I was. I was ballooning solo up the coast. I'd done it a thousand times. That day, seven years ago, the trade wind shifted. Everybody assumed I was lost at sea. Actually, I landed on a small island west of Guam. And you stayed there for seven years? I could've come back years ago, but I got sick. Would you like to hear about the job? Yes, of course. But first, I have a couple of questions. Um, sick is a funny word. Could mean anything from a mild headache to When I say sick, I mean sick. Mr. Monk I am a leper. There you are. I was getting worried about you. Just get in. Get in. Start the car! - Well, what happened? - Tell you later. Let's get out of here. What are you doing? Unlock the door! - It's a new car. - Oh, Natalie. Please! It must be this button. I don't know. Forget it! Oh, wait. Mr. Monk, where are you going? I'll meet you back at the house. Wait, Mr. Monk. I got it, I got it, I got it. Mr. Monk, I got it. I got it! No, I got it! MONK Season 5 Epi. 10 Mr. Monk and the Leper Any more soap? That's it. No, I mean is there any more soap in San Francisco? Mr. Monk, you've been scrubbing your hand for nine hours. - I'm surprised you have any skin left. - It's not coming out. I can still feel it. I think it's spreading. What are you doing? Is that kerosene? Light me. - What? - For the love of god, light me! Okay, Mr. Monk, I'm not gonna light your hand on fire. Fine. You know what? You know what? Get out. You are overreacting, all right? All you did was shake a man's hand. You're right. You know what? I'm glad it happened. The worst possible thing that could ever happen to me has happened. I shook hands with a leper. - And I survived. - Exactly. Worst moment of my life is behind me now. I'm free. Right. Wait. Okay, now I'm free. Um, actually Mr. Monk, it's not completely over. Uh, don't be mad. But I talked to Mr. Bronson. You did what? What? He called here this morning. The leper? He called me? On what phone? On this, on this phone? Yes. Mr. Monk, you can't catch anything over the phone. Oh, uh, and now, all of the sudden, you're an expert on lepers? Okay. You know what, Mr. Monk? He's a nice man, all right? He's in pain. He was crying his eyes out. And, okay, listen to me. He upped his offer. He said he would pay you $25,000. All you have to do is meet him again. Natalie, listen. Let me explain something to you. No! That's it? That's your argument. Okay, let's go through it. A, whatever he's asking us to do is probably illegal. B through Z, the man is a leper! You know what? I don't know anything about leprosy and neither do you. So I called a doctor. He's a specialist. He said we could come in and talk with him. Let's just see what he recommends, okay? I mean, it can't hurt to listen, right? $25,000. You okay? Are you holding your breath? Is that Randy? Oh, my god. That is so funny. Not funny in a ""ha, ha"" way, but funny in an ""oh, boy, ""this'll really embarrass him"" way. Miss Teeger? Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm I'm Dr. Polanski. Hi. / Hi. So nice to meet you. Uh, this is my boss. This is Adrian Monk. Thank you for seeing us. It won't take much of your time. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Oh, doctor. Can I ask you one thing? - Certainly. Right over here. - Go ahead. - Is that Randy Disher? Yeah, Randy was one of my first patients. Do you know him? Uh, I know Randy Disher. I don't know that kid. Well, you know, teen years. I don't know how any of us survived it. We can talk over here. Come on. Mr. Monk. You're not gonna catch anything in here. Promise. Come on. Now, what can I do for you? Could you explain to my friend that leprosy is a serious condition? It's very contagious. Well, actually, that's a common misconception. See? / For one thing, it's not called leprosy anymore. It's called Hansen's disease. It's quite rare. Most people are naturally immune to it. And if you do happen to contract it, it's easily treatable with an antibiotic called halazzen. See, I've been talking to this man. He wants to hire us. But he's allergic to halazzen. Yes, that does happen. - Is his condition full-blown? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yeah, yes, yes. Yes, full-blown. Full-blown! - Sir? - Full-blown. I don't think you have to worry. As I said, it's not very contagious. I've been practicing for 15 years. I've only seen one case first-hand. I can't do it. I just, I can't do it. Well, how about this? If you do contract the disease I'll treat you for free. The hell are you talking about? How about this? We never call the guy back. We don't see him again. I avoid him like the plague. Yeah, you know what? Exactly like the plague. You know what? Could I just talk to you for a second, please? - Just excuse us. - Please. / Okay. Mr. Monk. - Did you hear what he just said? - No. - He said it's almost impossible to catch. - Yeah. In that sentence, for me, the word ""almost"" is really the most interesting word. Okay, Mr. Bronson has an affliction. He needs our compassion and understanding. You know what? Let me let you in on a little secret, Mr. Monk. You're no picnic, either. A lot of people would rather not deal with you, but they do. They reach out to you. And Mr. Bronson is offering us a lot of money to do the same thing, okay? And I've been talking to him. You wouldn't even have to shake his hand. Good. Good. Because I would rather die than have to shake his hand again. You don't even have to look at him. All you have to do is go back to that bar and sit and listen to what he has to say. You just sit there and listen. Stop it. Stop. Thank you for coming, Mr. Monk. I was afraid you wouldn't want to see me again. Why would you think that? My assistant is over there. I know she'd like to meet you. I'm sorry. I can't bear to have a woman see me. Not like this. I'm hideous. No. I wouldn't say hideous, exactly. Believe it or not, women used to find me quite attractive. I never went home alone. After I married Mandy, I resisted those kind of temptations. At least, I usually resisted them. God! Oh, god. - Have I offended you? - No. No, sorry. You just leaned into the light. Sorry. I had an affair. That was my first mistake. She wrote me some letters, which I kept. That was mistake number two. In a week, there'll be a probate hearing. I'll be officially declared dead. The vultures are gonna go through my office, reading every file, opening every drawer. They'll find the letters. The letters themselves don't mean anything to me. But they would destroy my wife. Mr. Monk, I want to hire you to break into my home, find the letters, and bring them back. That's the job? It's still my house. So you wouldn't be breaking any law. Why don't you just do it yourself? I tried. I, I just couldn't do it. That house, that life, everything I've lost. It's just too painful. I've drawn you a map. Everything you need, the layout, the security codes. I just have one question. Why me? - I'm not a thief. - Exactly. You're an honorable man. You won't turn around and try to blackmail me. Mr. Monk, I am at your mercy. - I'm reaching out to you. - That's okay. I get it. You don't have to really reach. I get it. Will you help me? So what happened? I took the job. Be careful. I could use some help. I am helping. I just told you to be careful. Wish we had more time. No, no, no, no. It has to be tonight. The leper said his wife goes into town every Friday to visit her mother. Mr. Monk, please stop calling him ""the leper"". He has a name. Believe me, he's got other things to worry about. Car! Car! Get down! Okay. Now. Hurry. What are you waiting for? Go! - Okay, you're next. - No. It's, uh, it's wobbly. Somebody has to hold it. Mr. Monk, I can't come back. I'm already over. Well, it's too wobbly. Look, it's all wobbly. I can't climb this. Why is it so wobbly? How did you do that? I opened the gate. Good thinking. Okay, hold the ladder. - No, Mr. Monk, the gate is open. - Natalie, look. These are the leper's instructions. I promised him I would follow them to a tee. We nodded on it. Well, I'm using the gate. Okay, but don't tell the leper. The leper was right. She never changed the locks. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He said it's kinda tricky. He says you have to slide it. Okay. Here's the code. The leper thought of everything. They look so happy. Here it is. Top drawer. In the back. Freeze! Don't move. I'm calling the police. You, you're supposed to be at your mother's. My mother died five years ago. What are those? What are those? Throw them here now. Now! Mrs. Bronson, you don't want to read those. - Who sent you? - Here's the thing. I said who sent you? Your husband. Derek? He's alive? Is he okay? Well, ""okay"" is a funny word. So you've seen him? - Most of him. - Where is he? Can you take me to him? Mrs. Bronson, you need to trust us. There are reasons why your husband cannot see you. What, because of these? These don't mean a thing. I've known about this girl for years. Please. I have to see him. - That's not a good idea. - Yeah, no. / Trust us. Or I can have you both arrested right now for breaking and entering. Over here. Mr. Monk? Miss Miss Teeger. Did you get the letters? Derek. - Mandy. - You're alive? I knew it. I always knew it. You're wrong, darling. I died seven years ago. - Are you looking for these? - Oh, Mandy. She didn't mean anything to me. I know that, Derek. I've known about this woman for years. I forgave you a long, long time ago. No, please. Stay away. It's okay. It's okay. Let me see you. I just want you to come home. I can't. Not like this. Go away. Forget about me. Darling, there are doctors, treatments. There must be something they can do. You don't think I've tried? I've gone to every doctor in Europe. No one would have to see you. You could stay inside. We could build you a room in the new house. What new house? You're, you're moving? I have to move. As of next week, you're legally dead. Your sister's kids will inherit everything. I, I barely know them. Darling, that money is yours. Unfortunately, your will says otherwise. Tell them I'm not dead. I'm, I'll write you a letter. Sweetheart, they're not going to believe me or any letter. There's a probate hearing next week. You could come. You could talk to them. No, no. It's out of the question. Not like this. Mr. Monk. Is that you? No. Yeah. Yeah, yes. I'm afraid I have one more favor to ask. ""Wife claims missing billionaire husband still alive. "" ""Probate hearing is set for tomorrow. "" ""Former homicide detective Adrian Monk is set to testify. "" What the hell's Hansen's disease? - Leprosy. He's a leper. - Oh, my god. I thought they lived in colonies. You know, like in Ben Hur. And, uh, you met this guy face-to-face? Yep, he's a client. He called us. He needed our help. Mr. Monk put aside all his fear and prejudice and offered to do what he could, and I am very, very proud of him. I shook his hand. I can still feel it. He's not at all contagious. We talked to a specialist. Randy, I think you might know him. Dr. Polanski? No. Aaron Polanski? Can't say that I do. Really? 'cause we thought we saw your picture hanging up in his office. Right. It was a case. I was undercover, posing as a kid, a teenager with bad acne. - Captain, you remember that case? - You're on your own, Randy. Still tingling. Well, I'll tell him you said hi. We're going out tomorrow night. When this hearing was originally scheduled, the intention was to have Mr. Bronson officially declared deceased. But, as you all know, some new information has surfaced, provided by his wife Mrs. Bronson. We have her statement, plus a handwritten letter from Mr. Bronson. Which cannot be authenticated. Of course it's not a perfect match. I told you Derek is sick. He could hardly write his own name. That's rather convenient, isn't it? It wasn't just me. Mr. Monk saw him, too. Your honor, if I may. Mr. Monk, is this the man you saw? I believe it is. According to your testimony, you only saw him in a dimly lit bar and a parking garage. - Hardly ideal conditions. - That's true. Well, Mr. Bronson's nephews have been waiting a long time for this estate to be probated. I'm reluctant to make a decision based on one man's testimony. Your honor, Adrian Monk is not just anyone. His memory and powers of observation are legendary. Well, there's a lot at stake here. You say he has a great memory. Mr. Monk, would you mind standing up and turning around? Could you describe my shirt? Which one? Which one? The shirt you're wearing, or the shirt your stenographer is wearing? That's your shirt, too, isn't it? - Uh - You cut yourself shaving, and there's a tiny drop of blood on her collar. What are you implying? You were having a sex affair with her on that couch. The cushions are backwards. And one of her earrings fell off. It's, um it's right here, over here. She must have torn her blouse. I can see it sticking out of her briefcase. Your honor. I'm ready with my decision. I will accept Mr. Monk's word that he met with Derek Bronson. Therefore, Mrs. Bronson will retain control of the entire estate. How long has Mr. Steiner been living here? And he never missed a canasta game in all that time until last night. When was the last time you saw him? Monday. I saw him leaving. And he didn't have a gig. I could tell 'cause he didn't take his sheet music. He's a musician. I know he's a musician. He's one of my oldest tenants. You don't think I know he's a musician? Mrs. Kennedy, relax. When you called the police, you asked for homicide. Now, I don't see any evidence of a murder here. He's dead. I know it. The canasta game. Plus I found his cat starving this morning. How do you explain that? Okay, uh, why don't you wait downstairs, Mrs. Kennedy? And we'll take a look around for you. Thank you. What are you doing? Background music. You know, they don't keep playing the same thing over and over. Sure, they do. - Hard to concentrate. - Isn't it? Hey, Randy. Look at this. What do you got? Makeup kit. Bandages. Skin disease. That's interesting bedtime reading. His appointment book. Looking pretty busy every weekend. Captain, look at this. Last new year's eve, he played a private party for Mandy Bronson. This must be the best first date in the history of first dates. Maybe we should quit while we're ahead. I'm so glad your boss needed my help. Mmm, me, too. - Whatever happened with that case? - Oh, it's over. Bronson went back to his leper colony on Camino island. He says he loves it there. Really? Well, you know, I can believe it. I've seen some colonies in Africa. They're like four-star hotels. You really are an expert. Well, I should be. Why is that? Well, you remember I said I knew one person with leprosy? - It was me. - What was you? I had it as a kid. Leprosy. Hansen's disease. Well, don't worry. I'm completely cured. Yeah, actually, it's why I became a doctor. - Oh? - Yeah. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. Really. Imagine that. Okay. - What are you doing? - Making a snack. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. No, no. No, I promised your mother. No junk food. - You promised? - Yeah. I am the babysitter. Um, I don't think so. My mom said I was babysitting you. Okay. Are you getting paid? Yeah. How much? You know, that's between your mother and me. Why? How much are you getting? $8 an hour. An hour? I guess you're the sitter. Enjoy your fries. ""Since 1840."" Who needed ketchup in 1840? The security panel. Pardon me? The security panel in Bronson's house, Bendis security, founded 2003. The leper said he hadn't been home in seven years. How did he know about that alarm system? Julie, I was duped. It was all a con. - A leper-con. - What? - Was he magically delicious? - What? Okay, thanks. I'll talk to you later. Bye! - Natalie! - Oh, god. Natalie, listen. Mom. Hotter! Need it hotter. - But mom, are you okay? - I'm fine, honey. How was the date? Oh, it was great, sweetheart, sweetheart, sweetheart. I need you to do me something. I need you to go upstairs and fill the bathtub with listerine. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Natalie, listen to this. - I gotta tell you something. - We've been duped! - I've been duped! - Are you ready for this? - Okay, you're not gonna believe this. - He's not a leper. - He's a leper! Oh, god. You have the camera? You better have the camera. What are we looking for? Evidence, proof, anything. Oh, how could I not have seen it? Derek Bronson is not a leper. Hey, watch it. Derek Bronson is dead. His wife killed him seven years ago. And she's been living off his money ever since. I mean, she Watch the shoes. She knew that when he was declared dead officially, the will would kick in, the nephews would get everything, and the party would be over. So she found someone who resembled Derek. And she either hired him or seduced him to suddenly ""reappear. "" Will you please? That's why they chose me. Adrian Monk, the perfect patsy. They knew about my problems. They knew I'd never take a good look at the guy. So there never really was a leper. Except for the guy you were making out with all night. Are you drinking that? Where's the woman who's been lecturing me all week about compassion and tolerance? Okay, you know what? It's not funny. You didn't have your tongue down his throat. Well, I shook hands with one. That's bad enough. Your leper wasn't even a real leper. - I thought he was real. - My leper was the real deal. That's what counts. You know the old saying, ""there is no heart so black as the black, black heart of the phony leper?"" No, I never heard that one. - Well, it's a saying. Up you go. - Up you go. - Up you. - Up. - Go. - Go. What if she's home? She's not home. We've been calling the house all morning. - You still have the key? - Yeah. What is that? - You hear that? - Yeah. - Can I help you? - Oh, no, I'm just browsing. Browsing for what? Oh, did I say browsing? No, I'm, I'm waiting. I'm just, just waiting for someone. Randall. What a nice - surprise. - Hey, doc. This fell off the wall. Right. Yeah. Not to worry. We'll just toss it. - Thanks. - That's okay. Well, you're looking good. Thanks. Well, uh I'll, uh, see you around. Take care. Oh, hey, I, uh, I hear you're dating a friend of mine. Natalie Teeger. Oh, yeah, she's amazing. But I don't think it's gonna happen. Well, she reacted pretty badly when I told her I used to have leprosy. Really? - She couldn't handle it, huh? - No. Some people. Actually, I've been trying to reach her to give her a heads up. I think Derek Bronson lied to her. I mean, he told her he's been living on Camino island. But I checked this morning, and it turns out the leper colony there has been closed for two years. Really? I mean, maybe that guy wasn't really Bronson. I mean, all those bandages. Well, no, I mean, the wife met him. It's funny, though. We We're working on another case, missing persons. We were gonna talk to Monk about it. We found a makeup kit and a book on skin diseases. I think I'm gonna stop by and have a chat with the wife. Thanks, doc. Uh, can I come with you? It, it, if Natalie is in trouble, I'd just I'd like to be there. Yeah, sure. Oh, that's great. Thank you. Why don't we, uh, take separate cars? Randy, I'm not contagious. No, no, no. That's not what I meant. - Well - Is that what you thoughtI meant? - I mean, is that what you - Seemed like that. Hell, no. Come on. Hello? Can it wait? All right, hold on. Oh, my god. Why all the barbells? Weights. She's gonna dump him in the ocean. Probably did the same thing seven years ago to her husband. I know this guy. He's the leper. - He's not my leper. - No, he's my leper. Well, we, we better call it in. Give me your phone. No, no. There's no time. Here she comes. Come on, that way! No, no, we'll never make it! That way! - That way. - I don't think so. - No, come on. - No! All right, Mr. Monk, get up. Mr. Monk, help me unhook them. - Hurry! - Throw the ropes! - Do something! - Hurry! - Mr. Monk, help, uh - We're moving. Hurry! - Mr. Monk, take the ropes down. - Faster! Faster! I'm trying. - That's good. - Go, go, go. - Now it's good. - Okay, okay. - Here we go. Do something! - I'm trying. Natalie, we're too high. Stay down! We're too high! Stay down, I said! Police officer, put your gun down! Wait, it's Randy. He's with somebody. Drop the gun! It's my leper. Too low, too low. We're too low, we're too low, we're too low, we're too low.

Take my hand, or you'll die! Mr. Monk! - Mr. Monk! - I'm thinking. Please, please. Take my hand. Come on. That's it. Come on. Give me your other hand. I've got you. Well What's the matter? Hey, is the necklace too much? Mom, you look hot. You must really like this guy. You're not scared? No, why would I be scared? Well, um, Mr. Monk, he said Oh, well, we can't all live by Mr. Monk's rules. What kind of world would this be? Am I late? No, you're right on time. You're perfect. - Well, these are for you. - Oh, thank you. And, uh Oh, gosh. Sorry. Give me a little time. Work in progress. Yeah, well, you take all the time you want. - Come on in. - Okay. Thank you. Uh, is that Monk? Adrian. Did you get my message? Hey, doc. I meant to call you. I'm not much of a golfer, but thanks for the invite. Oh, psh. Hey, what are you cooking?

I'm having a great time. - Really? - Yeah. So we're still on for tomorrow, then. Yeah. / All right. I told you, I was at my restaurant all day. I got 15 people on staff. Why don't you ask them? Well, they work for you, right? They're not gonna lie for me. Not about this. I mean, you work for him, right? You gonna lie for him? I mean, about a murder? I think about that a lot, actually. I mean, of course, it would depend on a number of factors We're not talking about him. We're talking about you. I took her to Greece. She'd been wanting to go for years. She got back Friday morning. She was dead three hours later. I didn't come back with her. She dumped me. She met someone at the hotel. Second day we were there. So I decided to come back early, Tuesday night. - You can check that too. - Oh? Who was he? She wouldn't tell me his name. I saw him. He had a beard. I guess she likes beards. - And money. - How do you know? About the money, not the beard. I could smell it. Plus, he gave her a bottle of wine. Santorini, it must have cost him 500 bucks. Would you recognize him again if you saw him? Oh, yeah. Call Athens, check the hotel guest lists against the list of passengers on her flight home. - Yes, sir. - Did you hear that? Sorry, I wasn't listening. I'll, I'll hear the tape. We didn't record it. That's okay. I was half-listening, so I'll play it back in my head later. Mr. Monk was just telling me about his big date. You mean the guy on the phone? I thought that was a prank. No, why, why would you think it was a prank? No reason. Uh, how was the hockey game? Great! Great game. We won. The San Jose Sharks 4, visitors 2. It was a lot of fun. It was so much fun. And then later we went out for brews and beer. Brews and beer? Actually, there is Monk, you know that I worked Vice for a couple of years? / Yeah. Sometimes a scam artist will spend a couple of days with a guy before asking him for money. - It's called softening the mark. - No. No, no, no, no, no. Hal is not a con artist, no. Why would anybody con me? I don't have any money. Does he know you don't have any money? Yeah. / Did you tell him you don't have any money? Wait. Wait. I think I know what this is about. You guys are worried that I'm gonna ask him to be my best friend. Don't worry. Please. Hal and I just met. We are nowhere near making that kind of commitment. You guys. Unbelievable. What kinda guy do you think I am? - Ah, this is the life, huh? - Yeah. A sonny chow movie, pepperoni pizza, a couple of guys hanging out. Absolutely. I'm sorry I had to send that first one back. Oh, don't worry about it. No, you were totally right. Sliced 10 ways makes all the difference. - That's all I'm saying. - Yeah. Hey, listen, I'm gonna go help myself to one of those bruise-free apples. - You want one? - No. I'm good. All right. Oh, your mail's here. I'll get it for you. Junk mail. Don't you hate it? Yeah. All those trees chopped down just to make a bunch of stupid catalogs. Right. I love this part. I can see why. Oh, yeah. Crank it up. Sorry, we're closed. Closed on Mondays. I want to make a reservation. Call tomorrow. We're open at noon. Yeah, but I'm here now. It'll only take a minute. Come on, I promised my wife. Hi, you, Tim. Remember me? We met in Greece. - Yeah, I remember. - Yeah. - You shaved your beard. - Yeah. Gail didn't like it. You remember Gail, don't you? The cops are looking for you. I know that, Tim. That's why I'm here. They show you any mug shots of me? - Not yet. - Good. Then I'm not too late. You know, he sounds like a great guy. He is. Oh, he's a great guy! Well, having a good friend, Adrian, is a blessing. Yeah. - He's outside right now waiting for me. - Really? Yeah, we're going back to my place after the session, just to hang, you know, out. That's what we do. We hang out. We went out last night, me and Hal. - To a bar! - To a bar? Yeah, it was so much fun! You should have seen Hal. He was talking to two girls at once. Saying, saying funny things. Everybody was laughing and Adrian, this is, this is really amazing. And it's very significant. I always wanted a best friend. I used to pray for it every Christmas. Best friend. That's what was missing. One friend would have made it all bearable. Well you had Trudy. That was different. Trudy loved me. But Hal likes me. Beautifully put. You know what I'm gonna do? I just decided. I'm gonna ask Hal if he'll be my best friend. You know, I, I've never heard it put quite that way. I just have to figure out when to pop the question. Do you have any advice? - About - About when to pop the question! No! No, I, I don't. Nothing. No. Oh, hey, buddy. How'd it go? I think it went pretty well. I told him all about you. Oh, hey, I'm famous. So, you want to head over to your place? You promised to show me that rock polisher. I'm parked right over here. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. Look, uh, just something, uh, I, I've been wanting to say. More of a question, really. I know we haven't known each other that long Mr. Monk, thank god! Hey, Hal. - Hey! - The captain just called. They found a body, Gail Segalis' boyfriend. He was killed in his restaurant. I'm sorry, I, I got to go. Hey. Do you mind if I tag along? I've never seen a real crime scene, except on TV. Can he? Can he come? He can be my guest. Mr. Monk, it's a crime scene. It's not a party. Natalie! It's Hal. Come on, the captain won't mind. We'll tell him you're with me. And that you're just gonna watch. All right, when we get there, be careful. You can't get your fingerprints on anything. Yeah, that would be funny. 'Cause then you'd have to arrest me. See anything? Nothing much. Captain! Murder weapon. Boys found it under the stove. The handle's cracked. Is that from hitting the guy? Yeah, that's right. The serial number's been filed off too. Makes it almost impossible to trace. Are you reporting to him now? The serial number's been filed off. Makes it almost impossible / Thank you. You know, I read an article about all the crime in this neighborhood, how it's all drug-related. Nah, this was no junkie, though. This was personal. This was very deliberate. If he'd been that desperate, he would have gone through the victim's pockets. See? Yep. I've never known a junkie not to. And our guy's still wearing his watch, ring - You okay? - Oh! Yeah, I just dropped my shades. Hey, Monk? Do me a favor. Check the alley in the back, there. - See if we missed something. - Sure. Be right back. Hal, this is pretty cool, right? Very cool. Can you get that down to the lab for me? Hal, can I speak to you for a minute in there? - Sure. - Thank you. Here, have a seat. What's going on? That's exactly what we were wondering, Mr. Tucker. You mind telling us why you've been hanging out with Monk? Well, he's a good guy. He's a lot of fun. I'm gonna ask you one more time, why are you hanging with Monk? You know he doesn't have any money. So what? Does he know you have a record? Receiving stolen property. Yeah. Yeah, he knows all about it, and he's cool with it. What's this got to do with you? We love him. Oh, you do? Then when's the last time you hung out with him, you know, just to hang out, or called him just to talk? He is a great guy. He's odd and funny and brilliant. But you wouldn't know that. I mean, to you, he's just some sort of crime-solving machine. A robot that you wind up and point at a crime scene and let him do your job for you. And to you, he's your funny, quirky boss. That you can make fun of and tell stories about behind his back. What kind of friends are you? If Adrian Monk has a problem, it's not with me. - You ready? - Yeah. - Are you ready? - Yeah. Oh, wow! It's fantastic! That's so smooth. / Yeah. I gotta get one of these things. We could start a club or something. Oh, there's your mail. I'll get it for you. You get started on this one while I'm gone. All right. Mr. Monk, I finally made it! With my new boyfriend! - Love, Gail. Oh, I did this one last week. Yeah, that's great. Listen, uh, I just remembered. I have an appointment downtown with a client, so, uh, I'll call you later. Okay, yeah, Hal! Wait, uh, before you go. There's, uh, something I've been meaning to say. Uh I'm really glad we met. Yeah, me too. I'll call you. Yeah, yeah, uh, you know, I, I, I know this sounds childish, but, um if you wanted to say we were best friends, that would be cool with me. Yeah, sounds great. Let's do it. Really? Yeah, look, I really gotta go. - I'll catch you later. - Yeah. Dr. Kroger. I'm sorry to call you at home. He said yes! Why doesn't he call? It's been two and a half days. Why don't you call him? I did. I left 14 messages. Must have said something. Done something. I came on too strong. Scared him off. So now I'm back to zero friends. Mr. Monk, I'm your friend. 'cause I pay you! You don't pay me that much. There's this girl in my grade, Jenny Merrick. And when Becky Zucker stopped talking to her, you know what she did? She told everybody that Becky wets her bed. Thanks, Julie! Oh! That's him. That's him. It's him, it's him, it's him, it's him! But how do you know? Who else could it be? You're right here. Hello? Yeah. She's right here. It's for you. It's your friend, Bonnie. I'm sorry. I gave her this number. Hi. No, I can't talk right now. My mom's boss is crying again. Mr. Monk, you can't just sit here and sulk. - It's killing you. - It's killing me. You know where he lives, go over there. He's your friend, right? You know, talk to him. See what the problem is. Man to man. Man to man. Hello. - Adrian. - Who is your friend? - What are you doing here? - Does he work for the phone company? 'Cause your phone must be broken. I've been calling and calling. Okay, I'm sorry. I've just been really busy. I will not be toyed with, Hal! Look, we were just having dinner. Where? Where, Scotty's pub? Were you in our booth? Oh, Hal? Look. I bought tickets for us. Got, uh, Disney on ice. That's, like, animals ice skating, I think. And, uh, women's volleyball, and something called Pearl Jam. I just want another chance. Whatever I did, I take it back. I can change. I can change. I've never actually done it, but I'd like to give it a try. He doesn't like hard rock. You! Don't know the first thing about Hal, so don't pretend you do. How does he like his hamburgers, huh? Didn't hear that. Medium rare! Can you name three of his shirts? 'Cause I can. The turquoise one, the yellow one, and the one he's wearing now. Adrian. Come on. We had some laughs, but to tell the truth, we don't really have that much in common. He wets his bed. What? Michael, I'm sorry. But we - All right, I understand. - Yeah. I'll see you tomorrow. And don't forget to bring the merchandise. / I won't. Bye-bye, Mikey. - Adrian. - Your bag. Santorini. What's, what's in here? It's heavy. You, you bought this in Europe. Boy, am I glad he's gone, huh? Huh? / He gets so jealous when I'm around my friends, you know? Really? Yeah, you know, Adrian, I'm so glad you're here 'cause, uh, my mother's coming over in a little while. Would you like to meet her? Your - your mother? - Yeah. I told her all about you. Come on, I live right upstairs. Let's go. Your, your mom. Yeah. Here's the report on the murder weapon. You know, the firing pin was worn down. That's why it wouldn't fire. Maybe we should call Monk in on this one. Oh, yeah, I already called him. He's not available. He's having some kind of problem with Hal. Hal. I still can't figure that one out. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? No. When you showed this gun to Hal and said, ""here's the murder weapon,"" he knew that the killer used it like a club. That's right, he pointed to the cracked handle. But we never told him how Tim Hayden died. You show anybody a handgun and say, ""this is the murder weapon,"" they're gonna assume that the guy had been shot. - How did he know? - How did he know? Wow. What a great apartment! Wait, wait, wait. I just wanna soak it in. Yeah, you soak it in. What are you doing? All these windows. It feels like a fishbowl. So is this your mother? - Yeah. - And this is your sister? I don't know. I know that song. - What song? - That song you're humming. The music box at Gail Segalis' house. You You've been to Greece? Many times. I've been everywhere. You had a beard. Gail Segalis. She said she'd send me a picture from Greece. Is that why you kept coming over? She must've taken the picture. And you were in it. It would've connected you to Gail, oh, god. You kept bringing in my mail all that time. You were just waiting for her letter. First class, my ass. That thing took forever. So you never really liked me? Are you kidding? Spending a day with you is like pulling teeth. I'm surprised your own shadow keeps you company. No. Back up! Back up! Over there. There. Open the bottle. Open it. Open it! Stolen. Of course. You have a record. You knew you'd be searched at the airport. That's why you seduced Gail Segalis, to get that through customs. And then you seduced me. Come on, Adge. I was just joking. You know, I was punking you. Punk, punking? Yeah. I was joking. That gun's not loaded. I mean, I was just goofing around. It's it's what best friends do. - Best friends? - Yeah. I don't believe you. Oh, come on. It's me. Hal. It's your old pal Hal. You know me. I wouldn't hurt anybody. Come on. Let's go over to your place. Let's order a pizza. Have it sliced ten ways. - Maybe polish some rocks. - Okay. Okay. But I'm gonna need that gun. Hands up, you freak. So it really is loaded? Yes. Drop the gun! Drop the gun now! Step away from my friend. Turn around. Against the wall. You okay? Uh, I'll take Pearl Jam. Good seats? No, I'm sorry. They're right next to the stage. Okay, that leaves Disney on ice and women's volleyball. I'll take women's volleyball. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Okay. Hey. Wanna go? With you? Me and you? Why? We don't need a reason. We're friends. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that. Listen, can we invite Hal, I mean, if he makes bail? Mr. Monk, he tried to kill you. No friendship is perfect. Mr. Monk, he murdered two people. All right, I'll sit between you. - You don't even have to talk to him. - No, forget it. Natalie. I'm punking you. That's what friends do. They punk each other. It's fun, isn't it? Now you see if you can punk me. - You have a smudge. - That's not funny. Don't, don't. Come on."
"While looking at the design right here. You said it would sleep six. A bunk bed? Are you mental? I'm not gonna sleep on a bunk bed. What is this? A luxury yacht or a summer camp. It's 4:00, sir. I have your Manhattan. Formica? I want mahogany from the stern to the to the other end. Well, I hope so. Because I swear to God, if you don't, I will cancel this contract. He thinks I'm bluffing. Do you think bluffing? I wouldn't know, sir. You miss them, don't you? It was the worst day of my life, sir. I'm sure you feel the same way. Will that be all, sir? As a matter of fact, there's something I wanna talk to you about. I received another one of your letters. Don't try to deny that it was you. Before I made the last drop, I marked the bills. Then I found them in your room. Since when is blackmail on your list of duties? Master Paul, I don't know what to say. I wasn't thinking straight. You weren't thinking straight? No, sir. The grief. Your father's death and your step-mother. It won't happen again. Well, you got that right. Thank you, Stilson. That'll be all. MONK Season 5 Epi. 12 Mr. Monk is at Your Service All right. What what's this all about, Adrian? Come on. Let's have it. Ah, police announce hiring freeze. A hiring freeze for the next four years. By then I'll be too old to be reinstated. So that's it. I'll never be a cop again. All right, Adrian, I am truly sorry. I know how much reinstatement means to you. Only everything. It's my reason for living, that's all. What do I do now? I think you go back to what you've been doing. Consulting. For how long? I haven't had a new client in weeks. The department hasn't renewed my contract. You know, Adrian, I think this is an opportunity for you to make a decision, a very important decision. Now, you can let this news completely depress you Okay. Thank you. Or you can look at this like an opportunity. A chance for you to reassess your life, start over, do something completely different. Different. Yeah. Different can be good. Different good? Different good. Adrian, it's not too late. You know, Winston Churchill did not become Prime Minister until he was 60. What are you talking about? - I'll never become Prime Minister. - No, no, I'm not saying that I don't even live in England. Even if I did, I - I'd be such a long shot. - Adrian. It's just an example. What do I do now? And right then, I promised myself I would never fly commercial again. - Thank you. - Mom, it's not even 12:00. It's 12:05. Bobby, can i ask you something? Do you love your job? Yes, I do. - What do you do exactly? - He inherits money. I could do that. I bet I'd be good at that. There's a hiring freeze at the department, but we're working through it, right? We'll figure something out. There's always hope. - There's never hope. - Sue, there is. There's never hope. I wish I drank. Is it wonderful? Yeah, it's pretty great. Oh, you know who asked about you? Paul Buchanan. No, thank you. Sweetheart, I really don't think you can be so picky. You aren't getting any younger, you know. Who's Paul Buchanan? He lives in the big house up the road. The big house? This isn't the big house? He's always had a think for Natalie. He's proposed to her twice. He's a creep. He's a spoiled, arrogant, creepy creep who's just He's very creepy. Now, now. He's a good man. You know, that poor boy. He's been through so much. You heard what happened with his parents. It's the most incredible story. They died within ten minutes of each other. - Within ten minutes? - Yeah, it was about a year ago. Ralph and Camilla, that's Paul's stepmother, were driving home, and they were in his little sports car. That one he brought over from England. It was a Morgan, a beautiful machine. Ralph collected antique cars. Yeah, well, anyway, they never made it home. It was about 8:30 at night. And they were coming around that dangerous curve at the end of Sweeney Road. The one with the big rock. I I think we passed it when we were coming up. Isn't there a sign that says slow down? Obviously Ralph ignored that because the police said he had to be doing at least 80. Let's say that this is the car. All right? Now, this is a Ralph, and this is Camilla. Now, they come speeding around that curve. They hit the guard rail. And Camilla wasn't wearing a seat belt, goes flying and boom. Hits her head on the big rock. Honey, don't use the pate. That is not pate, darling. That is the big rock. And then Ralph calls 911 on his cell. Oh, it gets worse. He had a heart attack right there on the phone. While he's calling for help. So the road curves to the right. And she was thrown from the car? Yeah, right this. But if it was a Morgan, a British car, then then she would have been sitting on the left. How did she hit the rock? You know what else? I remember driving with Mr. Buchanan. He was the pokiest driver in the world. We used to tease him about it. He would not start the car unless you fastened your seatbelts. - You wanna check it out? - Ah, it's probably nothing. No, let's check it out. / Natalie, it doesn't matter. I'm not a detective anymore. Daddy, give me your wallet. / Uh-oh. - Brings back memories, doesn't it? - Yes. Okay. Here you go. I am hiring you. We are checking it out. Well, this section of the guard rail is new. It must have happened right here. Car was heading west. It went off the road here. So you were right. She couldn't have hit that rock. It's hard to tell without seeing the police report. Maybe the car flipped over. Maybe it spun around. No, I think he did it. I think he killed his parents. You really don't like this guy, do you? What did he ever do to you? You really wanna know? / No. What is that noise? Oh, frogs. They live in that pond over there. It's mating season. They go crazy every year. Frogs Frog, frog, frog, frog, frog, frog, frog, frog, frog. Are you afraid of frogs? / I don't know. I've never been this close to one. Yes. The answer is yes. Put the frogs on the list. Where's the list? Okay, kay, kay, kay. I got it. I got it. I got it. - Where does it go? - Put them between possums and, uh soccer riots. No, no, no. Uh, after after soccer riots. And before, uh, before before hailstones. Yeah, so it goes I got it, I got it Soccer riots, frogs, hailstones. At least now we know. Information really is power. I'm gonna call my parents and tell them we're gonna be late. Wait, there's no signal. There's no service at all. Are you sure? How could Ralph Buchanan have called for help? He couldn't. He didn't. Wow. I know. I know. Wow, 14 bedrooms. And he wanted to marry you. Hey, let me just tell you about Paul Buchanan. He basically stalked me for three years. All during high school he just kept on asking me out. He wouldn't take ""drop dead"" for an answer. The week before my senior prom, somebody mugged my boyfriend. They broke his jaw and both his legs. Mr. Monk. He beat up my boyfriend or hired some thug to do it. He thinks he can get away with anything. - Like killing his father? - I wouldn't put it past him. All right, so the garage is back there. The Morgan is inside. He hasn't even bothered to fix it. - How do you know? - My father saw it the last time he was here. Okay. Okay. Let's take a look. I can't go in. I'll meet you back here in ten minutes. What are you talking about? I'm not going in there alone. That would be like me going in some place alone. Mr. Monk, if he sees you, you can talk your way out of it. If he sees me, it'd be horrible. It'd be like high school all over again. I can't. Here, in case you need it. Natalie, I really think you're overreacting here. this was 20 years ago. People get older. They mature Can I help you? What the hell are you doing? Sorry. I, uh Are you here for the job interview? Yes, the interview. Exactly. Follow me. He's been waiting for you. Sorry to keep you waiting. This is in case the interview doesn't go well. Just joking. I was doing a little hunting. All right, so you're here from the agency. - Where's your resume? - I lost it. You lost your resume. Well. - It doesn't bode well, does it? - No. - What's your name? - Adrian. Adrian? Melville. Adrian Melville. Huh. What's with this place? I had friends over last night. The room was a mess. While I was waiting, I sort of tidied up. Well, I'm impressed. Very well done, Adrian Melville. Thank you. - Did you do this? - Yeah, sorry. Sorry, I couldn't help myself. In 20 minutes. I've been working on this puzzle for a month. Sorry, I'll mess it up again. I think I remember exactly how to No, no, no, no. I got a couple of step sisters who think I never finish anything. Huh. Well, come on. Sit down. Tell me, Melville, who have you worked for? Anybody I know? I don't think so Leland Stottlemeyer, of the San Francisco Stottlemeyers. Randy Disher. Dr. Charles Cook. No, I don't know them. And Natalie Teeger. Natalie? Really? She grew up right down the street. I went to school with her when she was still Natalie Davenport. She had a big crush on me, wouldn't leave me alone. Is that right? How does she look? - Does she still have that tattoo? - She has a tattoo? I guess you wouldn't have seen it. Not where she put it. Look, I'm having a big luncheon on Sunday. A bunch of the old fossils from the family foundation. You think Natalie'd show up? Make the afternoon a lot better. I don't think Maybe. Well, Adrian Melville, I go with my gut. My gut likes what it sees. If Natalie Teeger recommends you, that's good enough for me. Congratulations, you're my new butler. - I'm your butler? - Yeah, come on. I'll show you around. Your room's upstairs. Grab that drink. Natalie, it's for you. Oh, thank you. Hello? Oh, Mr. Monk, thank God. I'm gonna need you to come and get me now. Well, what happened? Where are you? I'm in my bedroom. I work here now. I'm the butler. - You're the butler? - Yes, your old boyfriend just hired me. - I'm the new manservant. - I think that's great. Do you? Do you really? Do you think it's great? Yeah, you'll be able to look around. You're right there. You're in the belly of the beast. Natalie, it's not a good thing. It's a bad thing. Okay, it's a belly, and it's a beast. Now come and get me. How about this? I pick you up tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning? Yes, maybe by then we'll have something to show the captain. Okay, yeah, that's one scenario. May I suggest an alternate scenario? Pick me up! There's somebody he somebody here. I'll call you later. Wait, wait wa wa wait. Come in. - Mr. Melville? - Yeah, Melville. Hi. I'm Suzy, the housekeeper. Assistant housekeeper, actually. And Mrs. Murphy wanted me to see if you needed anything. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm supposed to pick up your uniform, and I need to know your size. Oh, thank you, Suzy, but that won't be, uh I'm a 42 regular. I'm sorry about all the mess. This was Stilson's room. And he subscribed to, like, - Who's Stilson? - Your predecessor. Edward Stilson. He was with the family forever. I just can't believe he left like that. What do you mean? Well, Mr. Buchanan said that they had a really big fight about back pay or something. Stilson just stormed out of the house. - When was this? - Last week. And he left his suitcase and all of his pictures. Well, he'll probably send for them when he cools off. Um, I know you haven't even unpacked yet, but we need you to approve this. It's the seating chart for the luncheon on Sunday. I'm sure it's fine. Just do whatever you want. Very well, sir. I'm right down the hall if you need me. Excuse me, could I uh, could I see that again? - There'll be 11 at the table? - Yes, sir. So do you just wanna put five on one side and then six on the other? No, no, no. That wouldn't be even. It has to be even. How long is the table? Um, I'm not sure. Suzy. Suzy. I don't know what I'm going to do with you. This fork is a centimeter too close. It's only a centimeter. For the want of a nail, Mrs. Murphy, the kingdom was lost. One centimeter off on this side. One centimeter off on that side. Before you know it what have you got? Two centimeters. - Uh-oh, who folded this napkin? - I did, sir. And you call this a beveled half-Bedford? Mr. Melville, it's 2:30 in the morning. We've been here all night. Luncheon isn't until Sunday afternoon, sir. Almost done, Mrs. Murphy. Almost finished. - How tall is Mr. Fairchild? - About my height, sir. Then he belongs over here across from Miss Monica. Symmetry. Sweet symmetry. That's fine, sir. Except Except? You can't put Mr. B next to his stepsisters. They hate each other. There was an accident about a year ago. A car crash. Their mother died a few moments before Mr. Buchanan's father. Mmm, yes, I heard that story. Apparently when it came time to divide the estate, Monica and Clara didn't feel they were treated as fairly as they might have been. I see. How much did they get? Nothing. - And they wanted more? - Yes, sir. Apparently they did. - My wife. She's dead. - Where are you? On Sweeney Road. Right near Spider Lake. I'm feeling her pulse. She's definitely dead. She's not breathing. Her neck is broken. I don't think I uh Oh, God! I can't breathe. Uh - Sir? - Uh my heart! - What does that prove? - Are you kidding? It proves everything. There's nothing to discuss. Captain, we were there yesterday. There's no reception. He couldn't have made that call. That happens all the time, Natalie, for a million different reasons different cell phones, terrain. Read the coroner's report. April 9th, one year ago, Camilla Buchanan died in the accident upon impact. Ralph Buchanan died of a heart attack. He did it. I know he did it. Why? Because he made you cry in homeroom? Because I know him and guys like him. They think they own the world, and you know what? Because they do. Monk, what do you think? Look, Natalie, you heard the tape. It was an accident. She hit her head. He had a heart attack. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work. Wa wait. Why are you going back to work? - What work? - He's a butler. We prefer to be called house managers. He's working for Paul Buchanan undercover. I was undercover. Now I'm thinking about making it official. - As a butler? - A house manager. They prefer house manager. - Why? - I'm good at it. No, you're good at this. You're good at being a cop. Really? The department doesn't seem to think so. Oh, I get it. Those sons of bitches and the hiring freeze. Look, Monk, I told you I am working on that, okay? Just give me a little more time. It's too late, Captain. I've moved on. It's a new dawn. What about Natalie? / I'm hoping that Natalie will remain in my employ. There is a position opening up in the kitchen. Speaking of kitchens, I really must get back. I have a duck in the oven that's not going to braise itself. And the master is very particular about that sort of thing. The master? Wow. Very good. Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Melville. Well, I don't have to remind you people how important these stupid luncheons are. The old bats are gunning for me. They want me to screw up. They expect me to screw up. I intend to disappoint them. - Mr. Melville. - Thank you, sir. Mr. Puckldge. I've divided the house into four zones. Mr. Stilson usually just has us start in the kitchen. Mr. Stilson is no longer with us. So from now on, we're going to be cleaning the house my way. The Monk way. Who's Monk? You see I grew up in a monastery. And the monks were very demanding. We were cleaning constantly. Mostly dusting. It was very dusty. Crypts, catacombs. It was holy dust. But still You know, dust. That is the Monk way. Well, you heard the man. We'll be doing it the Monk way. Zone one The Swiffer please. A flaw in the crystal. - I don't see it. - I do. No. - Are you all right, sir? - Yes. I'm fine. There's just so much to do. He does one of these every month? Yes, sir. Is that blood? I'll take care of it, sir. See that you do. Almost done. There you go. Thank you, Melville. Your attention to detail is almost pathological. Thank you, sir. It's almost noon. I think we should be getting downstairs. I'm sorry. Still not quite - Thank you, Melville. - My pleasure, sir. - Oh. - I'm sorry. There you go. Now, your guests should be arriving any second I'm sorry. It's still slightly You know what? It's fine. It's close enough. One second. Almost have it. - I said it's fine. - I just have to center it. You know what? I'm just gonna lose the tie. And go with something a little more casual. Yes, sir. Good choice. - Speaking of Natalie. - Were we speaking of Natalie? Well, we are now. / Ah. - She didn't RSVP, did she? - I'm afraid not, sir. It is better to have loved and lost, then never to have loved at all. Do you believe that, Melville? I don't know, sir. It's a tough call. Paul, this mushroom bisque is just heavenly. Well, it's Camilla's recipe. I thought it was appropriate since the foundation was her idea. Mr. Melville, I'll have some more soup. My diet be damned. Very good, sir. Paulie, I have to say, when you're sitting in that chair in that suit, you look just like your father. You sound like him too. He's a crook. Monica, did you say something? I said you can't judge a crook by his cover. Sir, there's a phone call for you. A Miss Teeger. - Who? - Natalie Teeger. I'll call her back. She said that it's very important. It can't be more important than this, can it? He said what? Oh! It's only the second course, and I can barely move. As long as you can still sign those checks, Alfred, that's all that matters. Paul, I'm so glad you decide to keep the house. We were afraid you might sell it. Oh, absolutely not. I will never sell this place. This is the homestead, Roger. This is where Clara, Monica, and I grew up. Until you kicked us out. Monica. Not now. Why not now? We may never be invited back. You know what I can't get past? Our mother died ten minutes before his father. If Ralph had died first, we would have inherited everything. Ten minutes. Are you accusing me of something, Monica? All I'm saying is, you're either very lucky or very smart. And I'm very drunk. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have another guest. Natalie! Is there room for one more? I changed my mind and decided to come. Well, of course there is. Mr. Melville! You remember Mr. Melville, don't you? Yes, of course. Miss Teeger. / I should never have let Mr. Melville go. Miss Teeger will be joining us. We'll need another place setting. I don't think there's room, sir. It's all been planned out to the centimeter. It took me all night. Melville, I'm not gonna ask you again. Thank you, sir. Put Miss Teeger at the table. Put her next to me. And do it now. As you wish. Everyone, this is Natalie Davenport, an old friend of mine from high school. At least I hope she still consider me a friend. You look fantastic. Really. I mean, you haven't changed a bit since high school. Oh, wow. I wouldn't say that. Look at that. - Congratulations. - Oh, thank you. My boyfriend couldn't make it. He had to go to anger management class. Again. Well, I better get back to the I'm glad you could come. Mr. Melville. Will you help me with my coat? How did you do that? See, Mr. Monk, when two people love each other, they wanna express that love. - What? - It's a pillow! Ah, well, that explains almost nothing. I had to come. I realized something about the frogs. / What frogs? Okay, on that 911 call there were no frogs in the background. You were there. Remember how loud they were? That call was definitely made from someplace else. Not necessarily. Maybe they just weren't croaking. - Maybe they were tired. - Frogs don't get tired. - You don't think frogs get tired? - No, I don't. Believe me. Frogs get tired. The hopping and the thing with the tongue. You try hopping around and catching flies. You wouldn't last ten minutes. This man is a creep. Why are you protecting him? I'm not protecting anyone. There is no evidence here. Then find some. You're a detective. You were supposed to go check out the car in the garage. Have you been to the garage? No, something came up. - What? - This. My life. My new career. I love it here. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. No, you don't. I can tell. You look terrible. Well, fortunately, this job is not about my looks. Have you been sleeping at all? Mr. Melville! Shall we begin the main course, sir? Yes, thank you, Mrs. Murphy. Should you be drinking that? I'll have some quail, please. He took the quail. We're alternating. I'd prefer the quail. It's just we've been going quail, duck, quail, duck, quail, duck I don't like duck. Then you'll have to sit over there. I have to change seats? / Fine. Here. Two quails right next to each other. Enjoy. By the way you're all invited to stay. Alfred and I are gonna do some quail hunting later with a few of the neighbors. Where's Natalie? She said she had to freshen up, sir. Really? April 9th. The night they died. God, so he was here. There you are. I was getting worried. Oh, I was just feeling nauseous. So you came to the garage? Yeah, I didn't wanna bother anybody. I'm glad you did. I wanted to talk to you. Sometimes I think about adopting a kid. Someone to share all this with. So if things don't work out with you and your boyfriend Oh, yeah.. Yeah, that's something to think about. - Well, I'd better get back in there. - Okay. You're leaving? We're going hunting. I wanted to invite you. No, thank you. Your parents will be joining us. I can't. I have to take care of something. Oh, I'm sure they'll be fine. What do you mean? You know what it's like hunting. Accidents happen all the time. Don't worry. I'll look after them. Police? What have I done? Hey. We're over here. It's okay. Go ahead. We'll catch up. - Hey! Where's Natalie? - The pregnant lady? She's with the boss. They went hunting. All right, give me the page. - What? - My father's journal. You stole a page. Give it to me. Put it on. Why? There's gonna be an accident. I told you, it happens all the time. - Hey! Have you seen Natalie? - She's with Paul. - Back that way. - I'm gonna have to borrow this. What you just you can't do this. Oh, I can't? Look up there. See that well? Two weeks ago I shot my butler and dropped his body in it. You should gone with me to the prom, Natalie. Buchanan! Lower the weapon. - Melville? - Just lower it! Well, you're fired. That goes without saying. Mr. Monk, look, his father kept a journal. He came back before he died. Makes sense. It all makes sense now. His father died of a heart attack, like the coroner said. Paul must have found him. But he had a problem. His stepmother would inherit everything, and he would be completely cut out. - Unless - She died too. She not only had to die, she had to die first. Or at least it had to look like it. Because if she died second, even by a few minutes, her children would inherit everything. He got her to leave the house. ""Come quickly. There's been an accident. "" He brought her up to Sweeney Road. And that's where he killed her. Then he set the stage. You were right about the phone call. There was no signal. He had to walk a few miles to call 911. My wife! She's dead! - Where are you? - On Sweeney Road. Right near Spider Lake. I'm feeling her pulse. She's definitely dead. She's not breathing. Her neck is broken. I don't think I uh! Oh, God. I can't breathe. - Sir? - My heart! Are you all right? Imitating his father was easy. As Clara had mentioned, you sounded just like him. So it was perfect. They were both dead. Your stepmother had obviously died first. - Who are you? - This is my boss, Adrian Monk. Hello! Sorry we're late. Hello, darling. Natalie? When did this happen? - I told you I'd take care of it. - What is it? It's from the deputy commissioner. That's his signature. It says that you, Adrian Monk, are exempt from the current hiring freeze, and when you are ready to come back to work, your badge will be waiting for you. - How did you do that? - I talked to the man. I laid it all out. - He threatened to quit. - You did? Yeah, I was there. It was pretty intense. And I seriously considered quitting. I wasn't bluffing. I meant it. Me too. You could tell I was about to consider it. - Leland, I don't know how to - Buy me lunch, we'll call it even. - Okay. - What are you doing? - I was just - You're not my butler. - Oh, right. - You're a cop. - I'm a cop. - You're a cop. - You're a cop. - I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop. I'm a cop."

Yeah, I'm a ""blade-down"" man. But that's what makes horse races, am I right? Doesn't mean we still can't be friends. Actually, I run them twice. Blades up and then blades down. That's fascinating. Oh! Is this dishwasher safe? Let me just yes, it is. Funny story, I have a casserole dish. It was a gift from my sister. Not the sister you met. The one who used to live in Milwaukee but moved to St. Paul last summer. - Well, not summer, per say. - K Kevin It doesn't matter. Anyway, the dish didn't say ""dishwasher safe,"" but, you know what? I took a chance. Cause you only go around once in this life. That's the best news I've heard all day. I'll finish up. You get the door. How's that sound? - Mr. Monk? - Yeah? I'm sorry to bother you at home, I read about you on the Internet. And I looked up your address. I don't know where else to go. I'm on the Internet? Thank you. Thank you. If you could wait until my assistant gets here. She's in charge of saying the right things. Adrian, I'm putting the tablespoon in the front and the serving spoons in back. - Any objections? - Kevin, it doesn't matter. Okay. My sister, Jeanette, died four weeks ago. - There was a gas fireplace in - Excuse me. Actually, I do prefer the serving spoons in the front. Really? In the front? Okay, you're the boss. Sorry. There was a fireplace? There was a gas fireplace in the bedroom. It was turned on, and she was asphyxiated. This is a copy of the coroner's inquest. They said it was an accident. But, Mr. Monk, Jeanette never used that fireplace. I know he killed her. - Who? - Her husband Max. Getting a divorce would have cost him $30 million. I'm I'm sorry. Could I have another? Here's the thing. Uh I buy ten boxes at a time. And they have to last me the whole month. Oh Uh, so okay. Okay, okay, okay. Thanks. Okay, I'm pouring the detergent. You're missing it. Kevin, please. Please, I'm trying to talk to I'm sorry. Linda Riggs. Jeanette Hudson was my sister. Jeanette Hudson? Max Hudson's wife? Yeah, everyone thinks he's so funny. Jeanette was terrified of him. You know, he once get arrested for assault. He has a terrible temper. So you've actually met him? - Kevin. - Yes, I've met him. I think he killed my sister. What's he like? - He's a monster! - Kevin. Forget it. Withdrawn. Never said it. Excuse me. I have dishes to do. Well, I don't like that guy either. He's such a bully. Have you ever heard his show? I don't think so. What station is he on? - 99.9. - Ah so close. I just don't see how he could have done it. Have you looked at this? So when Jeanette died, Max was on the radio doing a live show. And the night before, he's in Los Angeles at a party. - He hasn't been home in two days. - I promised her sister I'd look into it. I had to. She was using up all my Kleenex. - Hi. - I don't think he's home. Did you tell him I was coming? - GO AWAY - No, Mr. Monk. That's not for you. - That's a joke. - It's a joke? How how is.. How is that funny? Um well, I guess it's funny because it says the opposite of what a Welcome Mat would normally say. So it's an opposite joke. Yeah, that's right. He's not home. I live right there. I saw him leave about two hours ago. / Okay. - That's a nice dog. - Well, thank you. That's a nice cat. Come on. Let's go. - Pew! - That's it. This is still my sister's home. I'm going in. This is where she was found. On the bed. This morning, I heard him joking about it on his show. I don't know how somebody can joke about something like that? I don't know. Anytime I'm at a restaurant or a store and he's on the radio, I just have to leave. According to the police, Jeanette turned on the gas, then forgot that it was on and just went to sleep. Uh oh What? There's only 39 shoes here. There's one missing. - Mr. Monk, it that important right now? - It's looks like a dark brown Ramato loafer. - It's about a size 101/2 or 11, I guess. - Okay, okay. - That's a 101/2. - Okay. So, Mr. Monk, Jeanette was found here. So she turned it like this? And then forgot it was on? No. - Mr. Monk, are you okay? - Oh yeah. / That's gas. Yeah, I'm I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just a little a little gas. According to the police report, the flue was was was closed? - You're right. - Right. It's closed. Look at this. It's just dried out Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Dried Dried leaves. Fire would have burned them or charred them. This thing hasn't been used in months, if ever. That's what I was saying. It couldn't have been an accident. - Oh, oh, oh. - Oh. - You have the inventory there? - Yes. Are there any matches or cigarette lighters in the room? - No. - No no no matches anywhere. That makes no sense. - She died on the 15th? - Yeah, that's right. Two days before her 10th wedding anniversary. They always did something special. Go on a big trip. Last year they went to Cabo. Not this year. Look July 17th, ""Tenth anniversary"", Natalie, nothing's written. Nothing planned. Nothing erased. He knew she wouldn't be around. Linda, I think you're right. I think he killed her. I'm going to be down at the Book Barn on Market Street tomorrow, signing copies of my new book Sex, Lies, and Radio. So come on down. But get there early. I was at a book signing in Dallas last week. And, I mean, it was freaking insane. It was a riot. It was on the news and everything. - It's an amazing book. - Like you know. You can't even read! - You didn't read it. - That's true, I'm waiting for the movie. - I read it, boss. Twice. - Kiss ass. My master plan Very careful. He's very quick. I'm quick. / No, Mr. Monk. You're not quick. You have to focus. He'll try to make fun of you. Why would he make fun of me? He doesn't even know me. Howard Stern, if you're listening and I know you are - you're going down. - Going down. Chairman of The FCC So, um let's take some calls. Bill, from San Diego, you're on the air. - Max - Please don't do that. It's amazing. It changed my life. Uh, yeah, thanks. Micky? Micky, who the hell is that? His name is Adrian Monk. He says you invited him down. Oh! Yeah. The private dick. Ouch, oh. My sister-in-law hired a private detective. What's he doing to Mr. Limpey? Uh, excuse me, Monk? - Monk. / Monk. - Monk. Please, don't. Whoa! A little freak's show in our control room. - Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! - A left, a right. - Oh! - Oh, my God! - He killed Mr. Limpey! - Monk. Get in here! - What is that? - He's a maniac. - Do not go in here. - Monk. Get in here, buddy. Come on, Monkey. Hey, Detective, you want to talk to me? Now's your chance, okay? It's now or never. Don't be afraid of me. I won't bite you. I'm the one that bites! Wow, start. Come on. / That's it. I'm just gonna talk to him. I talk to people all the time. Yeah, yeah. But these aren't people. - Okay, here he comes, eventually. - The sleeves. - Look at the sleeves. - Come on. Here they come. Oh, hello. - Hello, there. - Hello. - Who is this? - This is Natalie. She's my assistant. - Natalie. / Oh, hello. - Oh, Natalie. Oh, nice. - Do a little twirl, Natalie. - No thank you. No, thank you. Okay, she's feisty. She's brassy. She's sassy. She's got gusto! Sassy, brassy, but she won't show her I like it. Doing a neck crank. You can't see it, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, I talked to this guy last night. He wants to talk to me about what happened to Jeanette. Why don't we talk about that after the show? You don't get it, sugar bumps. He is the show. My life is the show. Detective, why don't you have a seat, please? Somebody give him some headphones, please. / There you go, buddy. - Please don't do this. - It's okay. Please, be careful. Oh, he looks exciting. Wipe. Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. Wipe, wipe, wipe. Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. Okay, folks. Uh, folks, you gotta see this. First of all, his shirt is buttoned up to his eyeballs. And he's swabbing at his headphones with a baby wipe. This is not a baby wipe. This is - This is an adult wipe. - Adult I stand corrected. - You gotta know the difference. - Sorry about that. Hey, Adrian, let me ask you something. When you go to a crime scene, do you take a police car or a short yellow bus? Mr. Monk, you don't have to answer that. No. No. I'll be happy to I'll be happy to answer that. - Natalie drives me. - I bet she does. - She's driving me, baby. - Who's driving Natalie? - I wanna change your tires. - Natalie! - Wow! - I volunteer Hey! You're hurting me. This guy is great. He's he's possessed. Yo! Adrian! Yo. What? / Okay, we just lost a third of our audience. All rightee, then. So, uh, just for the record, you're here because of my sister-in-law - Loony Linda. - That's right. Loony Linda, who thinks I murdered my wife. Isn't that charming? So what do you think, Mr. Monk? Are we on the air? Yeah, we're on the air, buddy. It's okay. I have no secrets from my fans. Oh, I think you do. Cool, okay. So you think I murdered my wife, even though I was right here, on the air, live, when she died? - Well, I do have a few questions. - Oh, of course. Cause from what I've seen, it seems unlikely that that bedroom fireplace was ever used. According to the crime scene photos, the fireplace flue was closed, and there were no matches anywhere. Okay, that's great. That's very compelling, compelling cross examination. Uh, how's this? Uh you can ask me three questions, which I will answer right here in front of 4 million witnesses, if Natalie sits on Willie's lap. - Please. Please. - Don't do it, Natalie. It's a trick. - Do it. - Adrian. I thought you'd like to know that the last guy show wore those headphone had head lice. Ooh! Wipe! Wipe! - Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. - Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. Wipe, wipe, wipe! Wipe, wipe. - You should be ashamed of yourself. - I agree. I should be. But I'm not. And there we got the view. She gave us a twirl. - I think he's the guy. - I do too. At least I hope he is. Max Hudson, the jerk on the radio? According to her sister, his wife had recently started taking sleeping pills, 30mg. - Which is the maximum dosage - And it was Max's suggestion. He called the doctor personally to get the prescription. Here's what happened, Max is out of town. It's a perfect alibi. He knows his wife is gonna take those pills, so she's out cold Something funny? Uh, no. Sorry. He knows his wife won't be waking up. - So he has one of his guys - Randy? Do you want to share it with rest of the class? I'm sorry. I I heard you on the show. You really got zung. Oh, my God, you listen to that creep? I think he's great ting It's grating De grating. Degrading to women. Yeah, I keep listening, hoping he'll grow up, but he never does. - Anyway, one of his guys - Goons. They're called Goons. The Goon Platoon. Goons. One of his Goons thank you snuck into the house, turn on the gas It could have been J.J. The guy's a joke machine. He's been with Max for 15 years. Since Philadelphia. Whoever it was, turned on the gas, closed the bedroom door. - She never woke up. - All right. - How did they get in the house? - Max made an extra key. It sounds good, but it doesn't track. This is new. It's from the security company. That house is wired. It's monitored 24/7, sealed tight. No door or window was opened all night long. No one no thing came in or out. What about that window? It says ""open"". That is a ventilation window to the basement. It only opens 8 inches. - Little Willie. - Who? Little Willie He's a little person. He's do anything for Max. Last week, he ate his own weight in bologna. Jiggle me timbers. - I think I just solved the case! - ""Jiggle me timbers""? Yeah, that's something that Ma I heard on the radio. I don't remember who says it. I don't know. I mean, we don't even know if a little person can get through an 8 inch window. Sure they could. It's awful small. Monk, could a little person fit through an 8 inch window? I am proud to say I don't know. Look, we don't even know where this Little Willie person was the night she died. Wait a minute. We can settle it right now. They're all downtown at a book signing. We go down, we talk to Little Willie. If we get a chance if it happens to come up we measure the circumference of his head. Then divide it by pi. Or something. What do you think? I think we have to check it out. See that guy over there? He's on the show all the time. They call him ""The Burpinator. "" Really? The Burpinator is here? Is he single? Do you think you could introduce me? Yeah - Sure, come on. - I was kidding. You knew that, right I was kidding? Come on, Randy. Let's get this over with. - William Kareili? - That's me. Hey. Word with you? I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. This is Lieutenant Disher. We're big fans. Not not ""big"" height. Just I love the show. We are looking into the death of Jeanette Hudson. Why? There was an inquest. It was an accident. - Don't you guys talk to each other? - You're probably right. There's just a few loose ends that, uh we want look into. Um Where were you the night she died? Where was I? I was on the air. No. I mean before that, the, uh, the night before. I know Max was in Los Angeles. But you didn't go with him. That's true. I was with my wife and kid. I got nothing more to say to you guys. You want to talk, talk to my lawyer.

The Defective Detective. - You're not gonna like it. - I know. I read a couple of pages. It's nothing but toilet talk and opposite jokes, right? - So how would you like me to sign it? - How about ""I confess""? I'll be taking a little break. Come with me. You don't think what happened to Jeanette was an accident, do you? - Uh - Yeah. Well, I'm gonna tell you something. Just between us, man to man, I loved Jeanette but she was sick. She was clinically depressed. - Depressed? - Yeah. Her own family didn't even know. She turned on the gas, and closed the door, and - Suicide. - I tried everything. See? You happy now? Was she seeing a doctor, a psychiatrist? Nah, she never went. She wouldn't go. And she didn't even tell her sister? And you dealt with this clinical depression by mocking her on the air and not making any plans for your anniversary? I'm not buying it. You killed her. How? How could I possibly have killed her? The house was locked. I was on the radio. I don't know yet. - According to your publicist - No, no. That's it. That's it. You have any questions for me, you talk to my lawyer. Unless you want to come back on the show. On the show? / I'll talk to you anytime about anything on the air. What about Monday morning? I didn't think so. Na Natalie. Wipe, wipe! Wipe. Hey! Here's the Wipe Guy! Wipe, wipe. Wipe, wipe Well, I think our work here is done. Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk! Mr. Monk, come on. You have to call the Captain. - I can't hear you. - Oh, God. You heard me. If you think Max Hudson killed his wife, then we need to call the Captain. And tell him what? I have no proof. Okay, let me see if I understand. One, you need proof. One-A, to get this proof, you need to talk to your suspect. One-B, your suspect won't talk to you unless you go on his show. One-C, omitted. Two, you're afraid to go back on the show because you think he might embarrass you. No, no. I'm not afraid. I'm terrified. There's a big difference. You heard what happened. It was a massacre. They ripped me apart in there. I felt like I was back in seventh grade. Okay, then the next time you go on, you'll know what to expect. No, it won't help because I can't fight back. I'm just not funny. - I'm not funny. - Mr. Monk, that is not true. Natalie, you've known me for three years. Have I ever said anything funny? Yeah Um Kevin, have I ever said anything funny? That's good question. Okay, let's see. I met you in October, 1998. First week no. You were kind of a Gloomy Gus. Second week No. Third week - What? - Yes. The wait Sorry. No, that wasn't you. It was Arsenio Hall. - He's hilarious. - It's like a blind spot. It's like everybody else in the world can speak another language that I can't learn. Maybe it's genetic. I don't remember my parents ever laughing. Okay, Mr. Monk, that is not possible. Everybody laughs. You're just blocking it out. Sit down. Sit down. I want to show you something. Sit down. These are home movies my brother Ambrose edited together for me. Oh, what a treat. Mr. Monk, I love home movies. They always make me feel better about my own family. Oh. Is that you? Look at you. That's my Aunt Clara. Did somebody die? Christmas morning. Oh, that's me playing Hide. You mean Hide-and-Seek? You still don't get it, do you? Oh, this this one is my cousin's birthday party. And There's me. Got a balloon there. I don't remember his name. Oh, and family picnic. There's Ambrose. Oh, there's more. There's there's a lot more. Mr. Monk, that's the saddest movie I've ever seen. I'm not hugging you. I'm hugging the little boy in that movie. I am so sorry. Kevin, what time is it? Did I ever tell you about my uncle? No. Sy Dorfman? The comedian? Sy Dorfman? You've heard of Milton Berle, right? - Uncle Miltie? - Uh, yeah. Well, they were contemporaries! Worked a lot of the same venues, had a lot of friends in common. Take a seat. Come on. When I think about all the great Milton Berle stories they would tell Uncle Sy and then he would relay to me. And when he died he left me this. It's his joke file. Professional jokes? Field-tested. Guaranteed. You want to go back on the Max Hudson show, right? Well, here's your chance to give him a taste of the medicine that he prescribes. ""For the first year of my marriage, I thought the only flavor was charcoal. "" Uh uh. Yeah, cause she was a bad cook. She burnt everything. - You see? - That's good. Oh, wow. That's powerful. Are they all that good? Well, he performed a lot of them at my Bar Mitzvah. And he killed. Oh, thank you, Kevin. Wow. All right, let's see. I'll I'll take some ""Mother-In-Laws. "" Oh, ""Hippy jokes.. "" - I bet those are good. - Those are good. And what are these red ones? These are his dirty jokes. He only used those when he was in real trouble. I'll just take on of those, okay? - I think I'm going to change that to ""B.M."" - Yeah, that still still works. Hey, Max, guess who's back. The psycho wipey detective. Monk? Spunky Monkey is here? I didn't think he had the nerve, the way he skedaddled outta here last time. Is the blonde with him? - Natalie, I love you. - That's disgusting. Hey, well, let's bring him on inside here. Let's hear what's on him so called mind. Mr. Monk, maybe we should wait for the Captain. No, no, no, no, no. Look. What are those? - Those are golden bullets. - What are you talking about? What are those cards? What are you doing? Don't worry. It's in the bag. - Monk! - He's scared. Look at the sleeve. Look at the sleeve. And the sleeve. Yeah. Hi, Max, J.J, Willie. Did you guys miss me? Wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe, wipe. Well, well, well. Look who's' back. - Surprised? - More like annoyed, actually. For those of you who missed it last week, Adrian Monk is a private detective who was hired by my ex-sister-in-law who's delusional cause she thinks I killed my my wife. So what can we do for you today, Mr. Mo oonk? Well, for three weeks before Jeanette died, you left the house at 2:00 every afternoon. / Yes. According to her sister, you said you were going to the gym. - That's right. - Well, I went to your gym. And they said that you haven't been there in six months. So my first question is, what were you doing at 2:00 every day? Well, uh, that's really none of your business, but, uh, I'm gonna tell you anyway. It's no secret Jeanette and I had an understanding. We had what some people would call an ""open marriage"". In my house it's called, ""The Impossible Dream. "" So you're absolutely right. I did not go to the gym. I was getting a different kind of workout. Yeah, baby! And for those of you keeping score at home, that's Max one, Monk nothing. You wanna play? Okay. Let's let's play. Oh here we go. You know, Max. You look like you're out of shape. When you go to a restaurant, you don't use a fork. You use a harpoon. Uh what? You heard me. When you took your dog to the dog show, you won first prize, not your dog. Yeah, that's, uh that's not funny. - Yes, it is. - No, no, it's not. Yes, it is. You know who you remind me of? The hippie who came home and gave his dog fleas. ""Hippie?"" What year is this? Actually, you remind me of several different hippies. Like the hippie who moved into a new apartment and it was six months before he realized there was no hot water. - I'm sorry, but you had that coming. - Yeah, um Adrian, uh, are you telling jokes, buddy? - Max, you've get a caller. - Thank God. Hello, Mr. Hudson. Long-time listener, first-time caller. - I love the show. - Thank you. I can't believe I got through. Listen, I just got back from Los Angeles and the smog was terrible. I was wondering if anyone there has any thoughts on the subject. Max, I'll take this one. I know what he means. The smog was so bad, one time I shot an arrow into the air, and it stuck. In the a air. just stuck From the smog. Yeah, yeah, J.J., that sound-effect is about as funny as my wife's cooking. Do you know what she made every night? A noose? No. No, not a noose. Leftovers. Why would she make a noose? Yeah, seriously, though. Are are you married? Because that's a woman I would love to meet. I was married. Her name was Trudy. She died. She was murdered. It was a car bomb. Ah, man, that sucks. May she rest in peace. Well rest in pieces. I mean, at least my wife was buried in a coffin. What was Trudy buried in, a bunch of little snack bags? Oh, God. Let me in there! - Whoa, whoa, Max, take it easy. - No, no, seriously. You should have called me in. I could've helped you with the case. I'm great with jigsaw puzzles. Are you joking about Trudy? Adrian, I'm wanna use the car now. Go for drive. What's this button do? I bet you needed a whole bunch wipes that day, huh? By the way, you know the last thing that went through your wife's mind the steering wheel. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. Oh my God. Thanks for stopping by, Adrian. Come by anytime. We'll be right back. Did you hear him? Did you hear what he said about Trudy? Yeah, we were in the car. We had to pull over. - I couldn't even drive. - That wasn't funny, was it? No, Mr. Monk. It was unspeakable. Here's what I was thinking. Number one, sounded like you got a couple good shots in. I was proud of you. And two, he sounded scared. - Scared and guilty. - He is guilty. That's the best revenge. So let's just take a deep breath. Let's focus. And let's figure out how he did this. Okay. Okay. Okay, he was on on the radio. Doing his show and the house was locked. Locked and bolted from the inside. The little window in the back was open but only eight inches. Not big enough for a little person. Which has already been established scientifically. Oh, yeah, you got it! Oh, here he comes. Here he comes. Oh, he's got it. Is that a loafer? Yeah, I think so. - A brown, Ramato loafer, size 101/2. - How do you know that? Oh, uh, hello again. Uh, he's not bothering you, is he? No, no, no. Just curious Where did he get that shoe? Oh, hell. It's not yours, is it? I am so sorry. He has a thing for shoes. I don't know where he got this shoe. He, uh, just had it when I got back from our vacation. - You were on vacation? - Hawaii. We go every July. Who was watching the dog? Oh, you're not gonna believe it. I still can't believe it. Max Hudson. He just volunteered. I mean, you think a guy like that would have better things to do. What uh? What's going on? Well, I could tell you, but Adrian Monk wants to tell you himself. He's upstairs. After you. Linda. Uh-huh. Uh, I don't know the legal definition of harassment, but, uh, this is pretty close. Mr. Hudson, that's a search warrant. You've been duly served. Uh, sure, okay. Knock yourself out. You'll just embarrass yourselves again. It's over, Max. We know how you did it. We know what you were doing everyday at 2:00. - You were next door. - That's right. I was. I was house sitting. I was watering their plants. Nah, you were training their dog. We replayed a tape of the show you made the morning your wife died. That was the day you introduced your new catchphrase. - ""Jangle my tenders. "" - ""Jiggle me timbers,"" sir. - ""Jiggle me timbers. "" - You never said it before that day. Or since. I'm a big fan. Well, I was. Unless you're not guilty. In which case, we're all really sorry, about all of this. Although, I'm pretty sure you're guilty. But, if you're not, I'm sorry. This is insane. Well, it's easy enough to prove. Let's do it. come out the Friday. I saw it last night. Jiggle me timbers! Hey, Max, where'd you get that ""Jiggle me timers?"" You've been saying that all morning. The new catchphrase. That was your command. That dog was your accomplice. You worked with him everyday for a month. You trained him to murder your wife. That morning, you could have been a hundred miles away. You left his cage open and a radio on. All you had to do was go on the air and give the command. You knew Jeanette would be fast asleep. You knew she'd never wake up. Oh, here he comes. You made one big mistake. Your partner, your accomplice. He's got a thing for shoes. He stole one of yours and brought it home. - So is he under arrest? - Yes, he is. Thank you, Mr. Monk. Thank you. You heard lady, Max. You're under arrest. Gimme your hands. You're not laughing now. Are you? Are you? No. I'm not laughing. Join the club. Let's go. Oh, here we go. That looks good. I love how you laugh."
"That feels good, doesn't it? Doesn't it, honey? I got a great meal for you. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. That's a good girl. Now you finish up all those vegetables. I mixed it up for you. Just the way you like it. Yes, I did. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. You're the prettiest baby on this farm. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Harvey. - Hello, James. - I figured you'd be here. I heard she took another blue ribbon on Sunday. That's right. We're going to Sacramento in 3 weeks. Now why don't you two just get married already and make it legal. What the hell are you talking about? - She's a pig. - Harvey, it's a joke. Well, wasn't funny. I was just down in the gulch. It's all still there, James. I'm no fool. You said you'd get rid of it by Friday. / Relax. We've been neighbors, what, 15 years. / right. You're a businessman, right? / right. $10,000. And I know you could use it. This isn't about the money. It's about the law. All right, I got it. You're a Boy Scout. That'll buy you a whole lot of merit badges and a pretty pink bonnet for your girlfriend too. You keep that money, cause you're gonna need it for a lawyer. I'm calling sheriff Butterfield. Harvey, wait. Okay, you win. I'll do it. I'll do it. I promise, I'll get rid of it. I promise. But I can't do it tonight. Now, I need 24 hours. All I'm asking, one day, and it'll all be gone guaranteed. - Okay, 24 hours. - Thank you, Harvey. Good man. Good pig too. - Did you hear that? - I didn't hear anything. Hey! Hey, hold on! Quiet down! That sounded like a gunshot. Oh, my God. It's Nadine. How are we gonna break the news to Harvey? I don't think we have to. MONK Season 5 Epi. 14 Mr. Monk Visits a Farm Okay, this is it, 109. He's flushing the drugs. We gatta take him now. - The Captain said to wait. - No, no time. Let's do it.

If there's anything you need me to do quickly Maybe some filing. - Now it's 8 minutes and 49 seconds. - Randy, I know how you feel. You screwed up. Everybody screws up. You're right. Everybody does screw up. But I am a screw up. There's a difference. - You need to sign for those. - We picked up Rivera this morning No thanks to me. You don't have to worry about Garrison. State's Attorney's negotiating with him. He's gonna settle. They always do. Randy son, this badge represents ten years of your life. - Ten years of good work. - Captain, I'm done. I'm leaving. Hey, I already sublet my apartment. You remember my uncle? Uncle Harvey? Sure. The farmer. The suicide. Yeah, well, an estate lawyer called me last week. - He left me his farm. - You're kidding. I know, I was gonna I was gonna sell the place, but, you know, after this I'm gonna do it. - You're gonna do what? - Take it over, run the place, - work the land. - Work the land. What are you, Woody Guthrie? Randy, you're not a farmer. Well, you might be right. All I know for sure is I'm not a cop. I still can't believe they wanted $20 to deliver this stuff. - Who's laughing now? - Yeah, we are. - We're laughing. - Ha. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Dirt that's dirt. You're gonna drag dirt all through the kitchen. - Wait there. Don't move. - Come on, Mr. Monk. It's heavy! - Don't move. - Hurry. Sorry, I just I have a thing about dirt. It's just so dirty, you know? I'll be that's how it got its name. Dirt. Forget it. Phone. Natalie, the telephone. I'll get it. I'll get it. Hello? Randy. It's Randy. Nothing. Nothing much. Just helping Natalie carry in some boxes. How's it going up there? Actually, Monk, that's why I'm calling. Something came up. - You know about my uncle, right? - Your uncle the dead one? - Mr. Monk! - Well, they say he committed suicide. But I started asking around, and some thing just don't add up. Unless I'm wrong which I probably am. Monk, do you think you can come up here and take a look around? - You're on a farm. - It'll only take a few hours. A few hours O on a farm? Monk, I think somebody killed my uncle. Randy, I'd like to. I really would. But, um you're on a farm. He wants us to come up there? Mr. Monk, I can't. Julie has school. - Natalie can't come. Sorry. - Monk, you can come alone. - Please. There's a bus. - Bus. To a farm. A b bus to the A bus. A bus? - Bus to the farm? - Hey, stranger. How's it going? Of course he'll be there. Don't be silly. You're family. Tomorrow morning I will put him on the bus myself. - A bus. A bus? To the farm. - Take care. Thank you for letting me keep my bags up top. Uh, is this where I get the bus to go back? No! That's lot of dirt. Oh, God. And these changes are like ripples on a pond. But is that enough? Are you satisfied being just a ripple? No. Not a ripple. You are a tidal wave. Say it with me. - I am a tidal wave. - I am a tidal wave. I love and approve of myself, - Mr. D. - I live in the now. Hey, tidal wave, pushing my fears into the past and my inadequacies - You got company. - Who is it? - Funny fellow, kinda nervous. - Oh, it's Monk. Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up. Oh, hey, something smells good. What's for breakfast? It's lunch. Been up since 5:00. - O'clock? - Yes, o'clock. Why? I know, farm stuff. You should've woken me up. I did. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's just, you know everything. The earth and the outdoors. All the animals and animal by-products. Well, you know, all the food you eat comes from farms just like this. Not anymore. Not as of the last 23 minutes. Well, I love it. I used to come up here every summer, helping Uncle Harvey run the place. Still can't believe it's all mine. It's all mine. It's my farm. I own a farm. I'm the farmer in the dell. - Get that tractor running. - Was it broken? - Since Tuesday. - But it's working now. Good. Good, good, good man, Oates. - You feed the jerseys? - Yes, yes, I did. - Today? - No, not today, exactly. They gotta be fed every day. Animals eat every day. I'll do it. Oates, Oates, would you tell Monk what you were telling me the other day? You mean about how you're not cut out to Oh, no, no, no. Um, about Uncle Harvey. Well, I've been working this farm for 20 years. Your uncle was a tad peculiar, especially about Nadine. - Nadine? - Uh, his pig. It was like his child. Old Harvey was a character. There's no denying it. but it was just him and me up here. I knew that man better than I knew myself. I could live a thousand years before I'd believe that he tried to do himself in. Monk, can I show you something? This is exactly how they found it. They were gonna tow it away, but I took another look. Something just didn't feel right. I covered it up, and I called you. - I'm glad you did. - Really? No. Where was the pig? She was right there on the road. So according to the police, your uncle was driving home, lost control of the truck, and accidentally ran over Nadine, his beloved prize-winning She was Pig of the Year three years in a row. yeah, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to to meet her. So he he hit Nadine, and then he careened off the road and into the electric fence. And he realized what he had done ""Oh, my God, I killed the Pig of the Year. "" And he was so depressed, he was he was so overcome with grief. And he grabbed the rifle from that gun rack and killed himself. Right. That's the official version. But look at this. Uncle Harvey kept a handgun under the seat. Why didn't he just use it? It would have been a lot easier. So you think he was killed by somebody who didn't know about the handgun. - Did he have any enemies? - Well, I've been asking around. Two days before the accident, he was seen arguing with Jimmy Belmont. He's another farmer. He lives up the road. - Arguing about what? - Nobody knows. - People argue all the time, Randy. - Okay, okay, I know. But what about this? How did Nadine get out of her pen? She was locked up 24/7, and she wouldn't let anybody near her except Uncle Harvey. Okay, okay, yeah, maybe maybe she was drugged. Where's the pig? Maybe we could have them do an autopsy. - We ate her. - You ate the pig. - Yeah, I know. I'm an idiot. - No, you didn't / No, I'm See, Monk? That's why I'm not a cop. What kind of cop eats a crucial piece of evidence? Mr. Disher. I've been telling you all week you gotta fix your fence you got deer all over the road. You must be the famous Mr. Monk. Disher talks about you all the time. You gonna clean his house while you're here? He's joking. We were joking with you. Welcome to Chambers County, Mr. Monk. Got a housewarming gift for you. It's the case file, complete with photos. but you're both wasting your time. - It was a suicide, sure as shooting. - How do you know? Lenny and me were the first ones up here. We were at the community center down the hill. There's a big dance every month. Someone heard a gunshot. We were here four, maybe five minutes later. You didn't see anybody else? He was alone. I'm 100% sure. The irrigation sprinklers were on, the ground was muddy, there were no footprints, by the truck, on the road nowhere. - It was suicide sad but true. - Sheriff, we have to go. I'm gonna need that back. Uh, there's another dance tonight. You can bring it with you. Well, I wasn't planning on going to the dance tonight. I wasn't talking to you. - Do something about those deer. - Yes, ma'am. Did she wink at me? I think she winked at me. There's no footprints. Monk, I'm sorry. Guess I brought you out here for nothing. Maybe not. Maybe not. She said that somebody at the dance heard the gunshot. Check out who it was. - Jimmy Belmont. - Yeah. - How far away is that dance hall? - I don't know. Half a mile? You really think somebody could hear a gunshot from that far away. Especially if there was dancing and music playing? I don't know, but we can find out. - Lemonade! - Okay. - I made it myself. - Oh, then, no, thank you. - Were you here last month? - I sure was. I haven't missed a dance in 12 years. Great. Did you hear the gunshot? From the Disher Farm? No, sir. I sure didn't. Sir, did you hear the gunshot last month from the Disher Farm? Well, I can't say as I did, because I didn't. Mr. Monk! I was hoping you were gonna be here. I'm going undercover tonight. What do you think? Oh, is this your first square dance? I'm not here to dance. Randy and I have a theory about the case. Well, I have a theory too. I think you really came here to dance. - Come on! - No, no! No, no, I can't. I can't! I'm I'm married. - Where's your wife? - She's dead. To be honest, I've got mixed feelings about that. On the one hand, I'm sorry for your loss. On the other hand, here we go! Loosen up. - What are you afraid of? - Well it's a pretty long list. Is Jimmy Belmont here? Why? Just curious. He never comes to these things. Wasn't he here a month ago? You're right, he was. Did anybody else besides Belmont hear the shot? No. That is pretty odd, now that you mention it. Mr. Monk. Damn it. Bang! Bang! Bang! I still can't believe I forgot to load the gun. I tried yelling. Did you hear anything? / No. Standing in the middle of the road yelling bang for 20 minutes. I'm just glad the captain wasn't there. - These things happen. - Yeah, to me. They happen to me, Monk. Okay, look, our little demonstration didn't work. But you might be right about Jimmy Belmont. That night a month ago was the first dance he had been to in 10 years. And he was the only person there who heard the gunshot. - It's pretty suspicious. - Suspicion isn't proof. You know, I'd still like to meet him, talk to him. Well, it won't be easy. Belmont never leaves his farm, and he don't like visitors. But he is looking for a new farmhand. No. No, no, I can't. I I can't Randy, you know, I just can't. Fine, Monk. I don't blame you. Forget it. Just Forget about me. Look at us. Losers all. Hey, at least I don't have any kids. It ends with me. Hola, Senor Entiendo que usted busca ayuda. Muchachos. Este es Adrian. el empieza hoy. Mira, this is Raul y Raulito. Raul es mi maldomo. el le mostrara alrededor. Si? Si. Si. Si. - Javier. Javier. - Eh? Javier vio jamas uh, usted, al Senor Belmont - luchar con senor - No entiendo. No entiendo. No, no. Senor Belmont uh, lucho lucho con Senor Disher. Lucharo, uh, discutir uh / No. Yo nunca vi nada de eso. Hey, que estas haciendo? - Ona cien. - Cien? Uh, pastilles. Pastilles a hundred. One hundred. Es bueno. estas loco. Four salt blocks missing. Proque es una zona prohibida. Es importante. Alla es una zona prohibida. Entiende? Prohibida. Prohibited. - Senor Monk. - Si. Tienes una ardilla en tus pantalones? - Si. - Si? / Si. I just asked, ""Have you got a squirrel in your pants?"" U una - You don't speak any Spanish, do you? - Some. High school. You gonna tell me what you're doing back here? No. / You know, there are no secrets in a town like this. I know all about you, former Detective Adrian Monk. I heard you were dancing with Sheriff Butterfield last night. Badly. Heard you were asking about me. Well, here I am. Now, you wanna ask me something, you go right ahead. Okay. What's back there? Let me guess. Fields of reefer. Fields of reefer? What kind of cop were you? You know what I mean. Ditch weed. Boo. The old Ali Baba. What makes you think that I'd actually Magic dragon, bambalachi, Yellow Submarine, Black Bart, Dr. Giggles, Kentucky Blue. You know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about Railroad Weed that's right. The Devil's Parsley. Skunk, Splim, Splam, Mooster. - Side Salad. - Side Salad. You've been supplementing your income. What do you have, about 4 or 5 acres of marijuana back there? Harvey Disher found it. And he was threatening to turn you in. - You killed him. - Did I? How? See, Harvey Disher's truck went off the road at 10:30pm. That's fact. Hit the electric fence. Everybody saw the lights go out. I was in the dance hall, half a mile away, in front of 50 witnesses. Now, you think you got enough for search warrant? Yeah, I don't either. Not in this county. It's time you were headed home, former Detective Adrian Monk. Front gate's that way. Go on ahead. Go on. Bambalachi. Reefer! Reef - Mr. Monk. - Oates! Oates, thank God! - Where's Randy? - He's asleep. I can't help but noticing that you're handcuffing yourself to that grain drill. - I inhaled some reefer! - I gotcha. - It's gonna kick in any minute. - Okay. Here's the thing. I can't tolerate any drugs of medication. It's my metabolism. I don't know what I don't know what's gonna happen to me. I might go berserk. I might hurt somebody! Dude here. Here. Listen, whatever happens, don't don't unlock me. No matter what I say, even if I'm begging you! Oh, my God. Here it comes. Here it comes. Oh, God! I think it's starting. We're talking about marijuana, right? Uh-oh! River dance! Oh! I I can feel it. I'm I'm getting hungry. Did you have dinner? We got some pecan pie in the fridge. It's the munchies! Don't whatever you do, don't put anything near my mouth! Can do! But I gotta say you know, I've had some experience in this area, and I don't think you're stoned at all. No! Oh, no! - I see lights flickering! - Yeah, they're fireflies. What was that? What was that? It's an 8:00! Irrigation sprinklers. Do they come on every night all over the property? Every night. Oates I know how he did it. I know how Belmont killed Randy's uncle. - Get me outta this. - Okeydoke. Son of a gun. You solved the case. - You figured all that out just now? - Mm-hmm. I can't quite get a handle on you, son. One minute, you're handcuffing yourself to a piece of farm machinery, sobbing like a schoolgirl. The next minute, you're putting all the little pieces together, like Sherlock Holmes. Which is the real Adrian Monk? Yeah. I like to think that a man is - made up of many different - I think it's the schoolgirl. - Yeah, you're probably right. - What do we do now? Call the sheriff. What? What is it? Well, I was just thinking it would have been nice if Randy had been able to figure it all out. He's been feeling pretty down about himself lately. - That's true. - Solving a big case like this one, he would have felt like a cop again. You're a tiger, a wild carnivore, stalking through the jungle. I'm a tiger. In the jungle. Randy. You were right. Belmont killed your uncle. Killed my uncle. Here's what happened Morning. Any coffee left? Got a full pot. How'd you sleep? Oh, fine, I guess. Eh, it's sour. What kind of farm is this? Don't even have any fresh cream. Randy? What is it? Mosquito. So, fill me in on what happened on Belmont's farm. Not much to tell. It was a dead end. Ho how about you? Any new thoughts on the case? No. What? What What is it? No, it's nothing. Wait! Wait! Wait a minute! My, God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Monk, call the sheriff. I think I solved the case. I told you to do something about the deer. Actually, sheriff, the deer in the road was a big clue, was one of the keys to my solving the case. What case? What am I doing here? Sheriff, you said this was important. Well, I think solving a murder case is important. Don't you, Mr. Belmont? Here's what happened. My uncle must have stumbled across your secret crop. Oh, you know what I'm talking about fields of reefer. You lured him up here. We'll never know how, but at some point, you hit him. Probably from behind. Then you put him in his pickup truck and you shot him. You shot him point-blank in the head. You're delusional. - Am I? - Yeah. - Am I? - You're doing fine, Randy. It had to look like a suicide. You needed a motive. So you killed or drugged Nadine and left her on the road. Then you backed up the truck and put salt licks under the fender probably the same four salt licks that are missing from your supply shed. Then you went to the dance and made sure you were seen. It was a perfect alibi. And that is how you did it, Mr. Belmont. - Um I'm not following. - Hey, Randy, uh, I don't think you're quite done. Remember, you mentioned that part about the - sprinklers. - Yes. I'm not done yet. The sprinklers! At 8:00, the sprinklers kicked on and melted the blocks of salt. Touchdown! When the lights flickered, you were half a mile away in front of 50 witnesses. As pretty a piece of homicide as I've ever encountered. - Where were you? - I I guess I just I don't know. I understand. You're in a slump. Don't worry I've been there. Just give it time, you'll be back. It would explain lot. It would explain everything, including the deer. - They were licking the salt. - Now, that is a nice story. See, that's all it is. Where's your proof? Physical proof. You don't have any, do you? I think he's right. Sheriff, do you have an evidence bag? Monk, your pen. This truck was never touched or moved, right? Yes. That's a fingerprint. See that? If this is your fingerprint, that means you were the last person to operate that vehicle. Is that proof enough? Mr. Belmont, could you wait in the cruiser? - You have the right to an attorney - Lieutenant Disher. Do the people a favor get your butt back to San Francisco. You're a cop. You don't belong here. Mr. Monk, I don't know where you belong. I got a feeling you don't know either. But if you're ever in Chambers county again, bring your dancing shoes. Gentlemen, now if you'll excuse me, I got a prisoner to process. - What? - Nothing. - Why are you smiling? - I'm just proud to know you. That was good work. What? Why are you smiling? Well, I guess I need to talk to the chief now. No, you don't need to talk to anybody. I never sent it down. You've been sick. You had meningitis. What's this? I have a I have a new technique. Go to sleep, wake up, case is solved. Good for you. / I don't know how I do it. It just happens. - Here, what are you working on? - A double homicide in the Castro Great, I'll take it. Cold case? / Yeah Good, I'll take that one too. Hey. I, um I missed you too. All right. See you in a couple of hours. Just try to keep it down a little bit. Okay."

Damn, you still amaze me after all these years. How did you figure that out? - Name tag. - Name tag. Sorry, excuse me, excuse me. All right. Ooh, I have to go to the bathroom.

I'll be right back. Natalie, please don't! - Captain - Yep. We just talked to the brother. He said she had a date tonight with a doctor she met at the convention. - Did the brother get a name? - Wouldn't that be nice? No luck. We checked the hotel, - Well, we know he wears glasses. - We figured those were hers. They're not hers. She was wearing contacts. Well, that's a start. We're looking for a doctor who's lost his spectacles. Get those downtown. Maybe we'll get lucky with the prescription. Mr. Monk, answer the phone! What? / That's the phone! Answer the phone! Mr. Monk, please! Hello? Hello? Here, here, here! Was it him? Call him back. It's a private number! Why didn't you answer it? - I couldn't. I, I don't know how. - Mr. Monk, that was important to me. How could you not know about cell phones? Everybody has a cell phone. How do you function in the world? I don't. Did you wash your hands? There, it's him! Answer it! - Stottlemeyer. - Answer it! Yeah, we're all here on a job. Now? Yes, sir. That's the deputy commissioner. We're being redeployed. - They want you too, Monk. - What's going on? I don't know, but it must be big. Let forensics handle this. - Captain, Monk. Thank you for coming. - You didn't give us much choice. It's a firestorm heading right this way. We have a body south of market. Caucasian male. There was a note. It looks like a serial killer. The mayor's on his way back from Hawaii. Okay, Randy, you know the drill. Let's get two dedicated phone lines upstairs Actually, Leland, you won't be quarterbacking this one. What? / It wasn't my call. The feds are all over it. - That was fast. - The mayor called them in. Kelsey, I have been working serial cases for 20 years, since I was in pajamas. Since when do I need a babysitter? It wasn't my call. What is that? Mr. Monk, that is the future of law enforcement. - Talk to me. - Me? Well, we just got here. We're sort of playing catch-up. - I don't really have any - What are you doing? - I assumed you were asking - I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to Washington. Has anything leaked to the press? Has anything leaked to the press? Yes or no? I, I don't know. Like I said, we just got here. Hold on. Will somebody shut this man up? What is your problem? Was that for me? About the problem? I, I can't tell. If it's for me, just nod. - Nod if it's me. - Billy, I'll call you back. Agent Thorpe, thank you for coming. This is captain Leland Stottlemeyer, lieutenant Disher, Natalie Teeger, and Adrian Monk. Who's Billy? / Well, there must be two Adrian Monks. 'cause the one I've been hearing about is a world class detective. The best of the best. He's just never seen an earpiece phone before. - Where's he been? In a coma? - In a coma? No. I wish. Welcome to San Francisco. I guess you and I are going to be working in tandem. I guess we are, captain. Let me tell you my definition of tandem. I say something, you do it. Okay. Your show. Where would you like to start? I'd like to start at the ME's office. Take a look at the body. Fine, you can follow us. Actually, lieutenant, I think you should follow us. Straight up mission street, Yeah, you don't want to go up mission. This time of night, all red lights. Is it? - Wow, where'd you get that? - I designed it. - Can I see it? - No. - You see that? - Uh-huh. Talk to me. / Male caucasian, I read the preliminary. Tell me something I don't know. Where'd we find him? In a parking lot near a TV station. Minimal blood on the scene. The body was probably moved postmortem. Mr. Monk? What are you doing? - What is he doing? - I don't know. I don't always know. Sorry, we were working on this case before. We got called away. / That is correct. You were called away. Mr. Monk, we're not worried about her. / We're not? Whoever that poor woman is, she is a side show. - This is the primary right here. - Here's the thing. I'll tell you the thing. The thing is over here! That case doesn't exist. I want you to forget about her. Cover her up. Cover her up. Cover her up! I want you over here. Both of you, over here! Don't look back! Look, um we can't help you unless we know what's going on. Can I see the file? Thank you. What's the cause of death? Uh, blunt force trauma to the back of the cranium. / Oh, no. Plus a small puncture injected with poison. / Oh, no! Plus signs of petechial hemorrhaging and suffocation. / Oh, no! Plus two gunshot wounds, four stab wounds, and a tire track across the upper torso. - So the cause of death was - Pretty much everything. - Why? - That, Ms. Teeger, is the question. That's why I'm here. Well, we need to know what happened and when. I suggest we start with the ballistics and the tire tracks. Already done, captain. Thank you. Get the stomach contents and liver tissue to toxicology. I want to know what he ate and where he ate it before it dissolves and disappears forever. He played guitar. Calluses. According to the file, his pockets were filled with coins and tokens. - He's probably a street musician. - That should help ID him. We don't need any help ID'ing him. I just got a hit on the fingerprints. His name is Cyrus Canning. Good, I'll get a copy of the driver's license. - Already done. - How many MEs on staff? - 3, and 2 assistants. - Wake them up. All leaves are canceled. I need to know the exact cause of death and the exact order these wounds were inflicted. Well, he's pretty banged up. It might take a while. We don't have a while. We have 36 hours, doctor. This was pinned to the body. ""The cleansing has begun. I will claim another victim in 36 hours. "" ""1 P.M. Friday, then every 36 hours after that. "" ""Signed, the Six-Way killer. "" - The Six-Way killer. - I'll take that. We have less than 30 hours before he strikes again. Every second counts. That's why I've divided the strike force. Stottlemeyer and his group are at the secondary location - where the body was found. - I can't find my seatbelt. Here, maybe it's under the seat. Mr. Monk, are you listening? Yeah, I'm with you. That is correct. I read your file. You appear to be a first-rate crime scene analyst. - Those skills could come in handy. - Here it is! Oh, no. False alarm. Mr. Monk, we're looking for the primary location where the murder actually took place. The victim's clothes, covered with DNA and microscopic trace evidence. - So we're going to a crime lab? - Ms. Teeger, you're in a crime lab. This is the most advanced forensics laboratory in North America. Gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer, a continuous digital uplink to FBI facilities in Quantico. That's great. I can't find my seatbelt. You don't need a seatbelt. This thing is built like a tank. Yeah, here's the thing. I feel better if I'm strapped in. I could fall out and bump my head. It's very dangerous. I have a seatbelt. All right, let's switch. - Aren't you worried about her? - No, she's fine. Is there a shoulder strap? I'm used to dual restraint. It's just Can I get a light wave output? / Copy. I just don't get it. Why 36 hours? What kind of deadline is that? Why not one day? Or one week? And why six ways? It doesn't make any sense. - Well, he's crazy. - We think it's from the Bible. Three 6s, it's the number of the beast. / No, no, no, no. Something's wrong here. I think we should slow down, take a step back, look at the big picture. I don't care about the big picture. God is in the details, Mr. Monk. It's all right in front of us, right here, if you know where to look. Bingo! I have an animal hair. Mammalian. It's from a ferret. A ferret? / The jacket contains perchloroethylene. - It's a chemical used in dry cleaning. - Ferret hairs and a dry cleaner. These are all the pet stores in the bay area that sell ferrets. We'll cross-check them against dry cleaners that use perchloroethylene. Bingo! A shopping plaza, corner of Powell and Sutter. Welcome to the 21st century, Mr. Monk. What are you doing? / I'm just borrowing your blackboard here. - It helps me think. - That's a TV monitor! So it's a combination? TV/blackboard? - No, it's not! - It is now. What is your problem? Haven't you ever seen a plasma screen television before? What are you doing! That's hydrofluoric acid. That's for identifying firearms. I'm worried about mom going shopping alone. - What do you mean? - You know, the crazy guy. The Six-Way killer. - Everybody's talking about it online. - Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine. How come you're not working on it? This FBI agent in charge, he won't even talk to me. He thinks I'm an antique. He's not wrong. - I think you're a genius. - What are you doing? Talking to my friends. Talking to Really? This is my friend Carly. She wants to know if I'm going to Kayla's slumber party. Julie, do you think you could teach me? - Teach you what? - That computer Oh, yeah, sure. It's easy. Okay, so this is called a mouse. Oh, God. I know that. I haven't been living in a cave. - And this is a mouse pad. - Wow, that is so rubbery. It's outstanding. So you slide the mouse around like this. And you see that little arrow right there? That is called a cursor. And it's kind of like a little pointer. You want to try it? You think I'm ready? Mr. Monk, you can go faster. It's not like it's a ouija board. Let's say you want to play extreme GoCarts. What you gotta do is put the cursor in that little empty box right there. Now click it. Hey! Hey, there we go! I did it. / Yeah. / I did it. Thanks a lot, Julie. I feel so relieved. Uh, Mr. Monk, you better come back here. There's a lot more to learn. Is there? - Let's set you up an email account. - Yeah, yeah. It's so that your friend um, so my mom can send you messages. Okay, you need a screen name. - Mr - Monk. And now you need your secret password. / Yeah. ""Trudy. "" Well, you know, everybody will probably guess that. Let's think of something else. Okay, let's do ""Trudy. "" There you go. You're online. Oh Oh I'm on the web. The world wide web. Welcome to 1998, Mr. Monk. - Hello? - Natalie! Natalie, it's me, Adrian Monk. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm great, Natalie. Guess what I did. I was playing solitaire. And I won. And the cards are dancing! I think they're dancing! How soon can you get here? - Mr. Monk, what time is it? - The time is, uh oh, yeah, okay, hold on, I got this. Hold on. I know this, I know this. Hold, please. Yeah, it is exactly 2:55 A.M. and 44 seconds Pacific time, and 1:55 P.M. in Moscow, and in Singapore, it, hello? Natalie? Sweet. Keep your eye on the clock, people! We have three hours before he strikes again. Last night, the suspect called a local radio station. - You have the transcript in front of you. - If he reaches out again, the call's going to be forwarded here and we're going to try to trace it. The Six-Way killer parked his car in this alley. We found traces of fresh paint on the wall. It belonged to a 2006 silver Chevy Impala. The paint contained traces of a polymer soap which is commonly used in car washes. We located a car wash on Geary street, where an employee named Raoul Calaro remembered seeing the suspect's car. Mr. Monk, what are you doing? / I'm, uh I'm, I'm just booting up. That means ""start. "" - Yes, I know. - It's a Dell, so fully-loaded. I'm sure it is. Under persistent questioning, Mr. Calaro admitted that he stole some items from the Chevy, $4 in change and some liquor. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember the driver. There was a security camera at the car wash. We captured a partial image of the license plate. Hey! Sorry, I got, I got mail. - Bigger what, guaranteed? - May I continue? Yeah, you can talk as much as you want. I got tons of memory. It's called bits. Memory, or bits of memory. It's all, it's all the same. The first digit is obviously a 5. The second letter is either an F or a P. Wait! Wait, uh wait, wait, saving, saving I think I liked you better when you were a dinosaur. I heard that. That's funny. That's enough to make me LOL. Out loud. That's him! / Keep him talking. We need 25 seconds. - Hello? - Who is this? My name is captain Leland Stottlemeyer. Who's this? I assume you're a cop. That's right, I'm a captain with the San Francisco police department, homicide division. And may I ask who I'm talking to? This is Six-Way, your new best friend. Are you wearing a watch, captain? Um, oh, yes, I am. Then you know you have 3 hours left. The beast must be fed. The beast? Why are you doing this? You could figure that out for yourself, Leland, if you were smart enough. You know, I am just smart enough, beast, to know that sometimes I need the help of friends. Relax, Leland. We've got a long drive ahead of us. See you around. We got him. He's in the Richmond district! we're there in 10 minutes. Have the SWAT team meet us there. We're going in hard and heavy! Saving saving saving, powering down. FBI! FBI! Everybody down! Everybody down! Let me see your hands! - What the hell happened here? - I don't know. Mr. Monk, come on. You. How old are you? - Are you a child or a man? - Thorpe, hang on. It's my call, captain! We are men trying to do a job. There's a killer out there. If you can't help, it's your responsibility to step aside. I'm sending you home. - Go home now. - Here's the Don't talk! We're not talking. You don't belong here. Turn around. Do it! Now walk away. That's right, walk away. Keep walking. Don't look back! Good-bye, Mr. Monk. You know it's all over the news, right? The 1 o'clock deadline, the Six-Way killer - It's really frightening. - I think there's more to it. I'm not sure this guy is a real serial killer. I guess it doesn't matter what I think. - Why, you're no longer on the case? - Not just the case. I'll probably never get back on the force. The agent in charge made sure of that. He said there's no room for a dinosaur like me in modern law enforcement. Well, I'm sorry. I don't know how it happened. At some point, I just got stuck. The world kept turning and changing. Microchips, cell phones, TV screen blackboards And I didn't. I didn't change. You know, Adrian, I think that this is your way of keeping your mind clear. No, no, no, no. So that you can focus on what's really important. Adrian, let's not forget you've put a lot of very dangerous people behind bars without the use of a computer. Your mind is amazing. No, no, really. You make connections and leaps intuitively. No machine could ever do that. You know, maybe a computer would just slow you down. - Maybe you're right. - Yes. Yeah, you know you're like John Henry, man vs. the machine. You know that song? / No. I was, um I was in a folk singing group in college. We always used to end each show singing that song. - You never heard it? - Uh, no. Uh-uh. ¢Ü When John Henry was a little baby he sat on his momma's knee ¢Ü ¢Ü he picked up a hammer, a piece of steel said hammer will be the death of me ¢Ü ¢Ü Lord, lord ¢Ü ¢Ü hammer will be the death of me, yes! ¢Ü Well Okay, okay then. Thank you. Adrian, the point is that he was a steel driver. There was a big contest between John Henry and the big, new, modern steam drill, and John Henry won. - He, he did? - He won, yes. I mean, absolutely. That's why I'm telling you this. Oh yeah. He won, he was a hero. Everybody loved him. God, I just loved it when everybody joined in on that last verse. Really? ¢Ü When John Henry was hammering that mountain mountain was spitting fire ¢Ü ¢Ü he worked so hard that he broke his heart ¢Ü ¢Ü laid down his hammer and he died ¢Ü ¢Ü lord, lord ¢Ü ¢Ü he laid down his hammer ¢Ü ¢Ü and he died ¢Ü So he he died? Oh. Yeah, I guess he did. No, no, no, in this version. You know, there were a lot of versions. - I think our time is up. - No, no, no, it's not, Adrian. - Yeah, I think our time is up. - No, it's only 20 after. Adrian, no, really. Ad, Adri This body's pretty badly mutilated. We're gonna need a little more time. We don't have any more time, doctor. What the hell have you been doing? We've been working 24/7 on this case like you told us. Okay, all right. Here's my best guess. The victim was hit first, but the blow didn't kill him. Cause of death was probably suffocation. The other injuries were inflicted postmortem. Keep going, keep working. Call me back when you're sure. Cause of death, suffocation. Let's add that to the psychological profile. You're wrong about Adrian Monk. - Am I? - Yep. I know he's a little strange and he can be difficult but, I can tell you of at least 12 different cases where all of the evidence Captain Stottlemeyer you're looking at $1/2 billion worth of equipment. Are you trying to tell me that your funny little friend is smarter than all of this? Yes, I am. Is that a radar detector? / No. You wouldn't tell me if it was, would you? It's not a radar detector. Right. Here's an updated profile. Suffocation indicates the assault was personal, motivated by repressed anger. Choice of street performer as victim may be significant. The suspect's father was probably a failed musician. - So he hates street musicians. - Who doesn't? We can nail this bastard. Sweep the city. I want all musicians off the street, except one. ¢Ü Well, I'm tired of sucking up and working for the man ¢Ü - ¢Ü keep the people down ¢Ü - Bravo one, good to go. Bravo two, locked and loaded. ¢Ü Cuff my brothers and sisters oh, that's not the way to be ¢Ü ¢Ü 'cause, baby, those days are gone the music set me free ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a captain to make me feel strong ¢Ü - There's a flaw in your plan. - What's that? Well, the first person that attacks him might not necessarily be your serial killer. - It would be me. - 27 minutes. Well, that was the captain. They're all at the Sheridan square trying to stake it out. - Want to go check it out? - Nah, I'd just be in the way. Here's where I belong. In there. Why don't you call Dr. Walsh? Tell him to meet me here. He can stuff me and put me on display with all the other relics. Come on, Mr. Monk. You know the medical examiner's a little busy today. Everybody's working on the big case. What? - What did you say? - I said they're too busy. They're all working on the Six-Way killer thing. That's right. Natalie, you're right! That's the key! Everybody is too busy. - What time is it? - It's 12:45. Come on! - What's going on? - I'll tell you in the car. Let's go! ¢Ü I don't need a captain to make me feel strong ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a badge to tell me wrong from right ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a badge to tell me day from night ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need nobody 'cause, baby, I am free ¢Ü This is a complete waste of time. You know that, don't you? Did you say something? Yeah, yeah. I said, uh, I think Monk's right, sir. I've never read one of these psychological profiles that meant squat. Particularly if it was compiled by one of these gizmos. These gizmos, as you call them, are gonna catch our killer. - Mark my words. - Southeast corner. ¢Ü Cleaning up the streets, God bless. Poppa's got a new gig, ¢Ü ¢Ü he's got a brand new ¢Ü Male caucasian, green jacket. He fits the profile! Everybody stay frosty! ¢Ü and music set me free ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a badge to tell me wrong from right ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a badge 'cause my eyes can see ¢Ü ¢Ü I don't need a badge 'cause, baby, I am free ¢Ü - This guy looks like approaching. - Moving in. ¢Ü I don't need a badge ¢Ü Move, move. Down on the ground! Get down! FBI! Stay down! Let me see your hands! Easy, easy. Stand down. Harmonica. / I was just gonna play with him. Yeah. You hurt? - Just your pride, right? - What do you mean? Never mind. / It's a message from your friend Natalie Teeger. She said, ""Monk just solved the case. "" You got, like, 5 bucks in there. - Really? - Yeah. What the hell's going on? Who told you to stop? I did. / What are you doing? I told you before. She doesn't matter. Actually, agent Thorpe, she not only matters, she is the key to this whole case. Your so-called Six-Way killer killed her first. The other kid, the street musician, was just a diversion. It's true. Captain, the same guy killed both. You found a liquor bottle in the killer's car. Remember, there was a cognac stain on her sleeve. Monk. Do you know who did it? She'll tell us if it's not too late. We've already wasted a day and a half. It was the deadline, 36 hours. It seemed so arbitrary, didn't it? I mean, when you really stopped and thought about it Then Natalie reminded me how hard everybody was working on the Six-Way killer case. And I wondered, ""who would benefit from that?"" And there's only one answer. The man who killed this woman. Here's what happened. Ms. Garnett met a doctor at the convention. He took her out to dinner. I don't know what they ordered, but it must've been pretty special. - Why do you say that? - Bcause whatever it was, it could've been traced back to that restaurant. That meal, what they ate, that's what this whole case has been about. He must've paid for it with a credit card. Something that we could trace later. Just listen. They ended up at Mt. Davidson park. Something went wrong. We'll never know exactly what happened. All we know is that she got away. She ran across the street to the gas station. But now the killer had a problem. He was a doctor. So he knew there'd be an autopsy and that we'd be able to trace whatever she had for dinner. But he also knew that if he could stall us, distract us, eventually the food in her stomach would be digested. And the evidence would be gone. /36 hours. Exactly. Everything's gone in a day and a half, even after death. So he distracted us. He picked a victim at random, a street performer. And he killed him in a particularly gruesome way. Six particularly gruesome ways, actually. He wrote a note, he called us, he taunted us. Anything to keep our attention off of her. / Here it is. What the hell is that? These shiny little flecks. - Are those flower petals? - I don't know. - It's a gold leaf cake! - What? They use real rose petals and flecks of gold. I had it once at this restaurant called Justine's. They call it the world's most romantic dessert. Looked better on the plate. It's the deadline. Help me turn this damn thing off. Dr. Leven? These belong to you? Hey, you were right. One of your gizmos caught the killer. - Nice shot. - Yeah, I nailed him. Here. ""Dear Kimberly,"" ""I am sorry that I inadvertently sent the SWAT team to Kayla's slumber party"" ""and made you cry. I'm sorry about the nightmares. "" ""It will never happen again. Adrian Monk. "" Very good. This next one is for Allison. ""Dear Allison"" Mr. Monk, that's gonna take you forever. Why don't you just borrow my No, thank you. I'm fine."
"So I said, ""You can't "" This is not a day care center. I know. Well, it took me five years to tell her. I'd been watching the kid, oh, gosh, since he was about six months old. Well, that's it, I'm sleeping. Oh, no. Don't start. Dr. Graydon Whitcomb Neurotrauma What are you doing out of bed? MONK Season 5 Epi. 16 Mr. Monk goes to the Hospital Another step. We're almost there. One step at a time. Ah, you're being so brave. Tell them I'm a former police officer. You can tell them yourself. Okay, here we go. No. No, you can't bring them here. We're out of beds. Where I'm gonna put them, on the roof? Well, try St. Barnabus. They might have room. - Hello. - Yeah. - What's she doing? - She's holding up a finger. - The bad finger? - No, Mr. Monk, the pointy finger. Good luck. Can I help you? - Yes, this is Adrian Monk. - M.. o n.. / MONK - He has a bloody nose. - It's been bleeding all morning. - Yeah, it's been bleeding all morning. - It won't stop. / It won't stop. Cause of injury? I was putting away my ironing board, which is normally a two-person job Mr. Monk, it's my day off. It still is. An ironing board. I need your insurance card. - Yes. - Fill this out, both sides. - Former police officer. - He's a former police officer. I appreciate that, but he has to wait, just like everybody else. You and your husband can have a seat over there. - Oh, we're not married. - Congratulations. Have a seat. Wait a second. Hey, wait, wait. Excuse me. - I I was here before him. - That man has a head wound. - This is a head wound. - That is not a head wound. - Actually, it is, technically. - You have a bloody nose. It's a wound, and it's on my head. Do you have a dictionary back there? - What is she doing? - Now it's the bad finger. Let's sit down. Yeah, I promise, I will definitely be there. Okay, let's synchronize our watches. - I'm allergic to tetracycline. - Yeah, I know, Mr. Monk. One dose of tetracycline will kill me. Yeah, look, I have it right here. Allergies: tetracycline. No, I will probably beat you there. I'm right around the corner. I'm at St. Mark's Hospital. Emergency room. Oh, it's not me, it's my boss. It's a bloody nose. I know. Okay. Me too. All right, bye. Uh, Mr. Monk, I need - There's a light bulb out. / Yeah - Two, actually. Okay, Mr. Monk, I need to tell you something. Don't freak out, but I've made some plans, and I'm just gonna go for a couple of hours. No! No, no, no. No, you can't leave. You can't leave me here. Mr. Monk, you're in really good hands. It's a really great hospital. And I mean, come on, it's not like it's life or death. - It's it's a nosebleed. - How can you say that? I've lost a gallon of blood. I'm hemorrhaging. You are not hemorrhaging. Look, I've already cancelled on this guy three times because of - well, because of you. - You're leaving me? Don't say that. Please don't make me cancel again. - I really, really like this guy. - You're leaving me. I'll be back by 2:30. - Natalie, I'm really scared. - You're always scared. Yes, but now I'm scared and hemorrhaging. Okay, Mr. Monk, come on, please. I've been on call for 24 hours a day, I mean, it's my first day off in in what, two months? And this date, this guy it's important to me. Oh, God. God All right, but I mean, if you really, really want me to stay, I'll stay. - I want you to stay. - I can't stay. Okay, I'll leave my phone on, all right? I will be back in just a couple hours. Okay, bye. Is it seeping or oozing? Okay, Mr. Lam, you have to sign right here. - We're sending Mr. Lam right in. - Hello, excuse me. I have been sitting there for an hour and a half. I know, we're booked up, as you can see. If I may? I speak a little Vietnamese. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, he's saying that he's feeling much better. He's feeling fine, and he would like to go home. On a city bus. Right. Yeah, yeah. He thinks, uh he thinks this man oh, yah, I guess he means me should go ahead of him. - I speak Vietnamese. - I'll be sitting right over here. Yeah, you do that. - A nosebleed, huh? - Uh-huh. My stepbrother had the same thing. It turned out to be a cerebral hemorrhage. - He was dead in a week. - Adrian Monk. A cerebral hemorrhage? Who told you that? A very prominent patient. I didn't get her name. Well, I have to respectfully disagree. What you have is a simple rupture of the olfactory membrane. - Yeah? - You're basic nosebleed. I think I should be admitted, just for a few days, so you can be sure. I'm gonna cauterize it. Tilt your head back. Here's the thing. She said that her stepbrother had the exact same symptoms. And here's the thing. It feels like a cerebral hemorrhage. Mr. Monk, I've seen a cerebral hemorrhage. I interned with Graydon Whitcomb for two years. - Who's that? - He's the head of neurotrauma. Let's call him. / I'll tell you what, if this doesn¡¯t work, I will take you upstairs to see Dr. Whitcomb, okay? - Yeah. - Now sit back. Okay, this might sting a little bit. Wait, wait, wait, wait wait wait, wait. - Okay, okay. - All right. - Okay, wait, wait, wait - Mr. Monk, I have other patients. Can't we just wait 'till Natalie comes back? - Who's Natalie? - She's my assistant. She's on a date. Sure. What time do you think Natalie will be back? Uh, probably, like Aah! There, that's it. You're done. - That's it? - Mm-hmm. It stopped. Unless Unless I'm out of blood. That wasn't so terrible, was it? / No. Oh. I have to take this. Can you find your way out? - Yes, thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank Thank you. - You're welcome. Hello? Hello? Whitcomb, 504. Uh, excuse me, Dr. Whitcomb, I know you're busy. My name is Adrian Monk. I I I saw a doctor downstairs, but I would like a second opinion. I thought maybe if I could check in for two or three days, you know, maybe you could run some tests. Dr. Whitecomb? Ow! Ow! Ow, God! Okay, I I I'm okay. - Captain. - What do you got? There may have been somebody else here. - Look at that blood spatter. - Uh, no, no, that was me. Sorry. You still bleeding? / Yeah. - What'd the doctor say? - She cauterized it, but I don't think Sometimes you gotta cauterize them again, Monk. I used to get nosebleeds all the time. - I'm not sure it is a nosebleed. - Well, what else could it be? That's what I was gonna ask him. Captain, I talked to the secretary. What happened to your nose? Ow! It's okay. It's all cool. Yeah, it's all cool. Monk, as long as you're here Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay, no problem. Empty bottles. He took the pills, but not the bottles? There's a drug rehab center downstairs. We get addicts and junkies in here all the time. Security's a nightmare, but we're a hospital. We have to keep the doors open. Why didn't he just take the bottles? He wanted us to find these. He wanted us to think junkie. Oh, yeah, see there? He was wearing slippers, rounded and smooth. A patient. Not a junkie, a patient. - What do you got? - There's powder. Yeah. Smells like talcum powder. Captain, look at this. - What is that? - That looks like a seal. That could be from one of our oxygen tanks. Room 623/623. All right, let's go! / Uh, Lieutenant, that's the geriatric ward. If he's a patient up there, he's at least 80 years old. Well, then, we'd better move fast. All right, boys, 623. Let's go. There's a stain. Must be a leak from upstairs. Would you stand up straight? It's just a nosebleed, for God's sake. I hate hospitals. Well, let's meet our suspect. ""Hank Johansen. 82 years old. "" He's getting a colostomy on Wednesday morning. I think you can secure your weapon, Lieutenant. That's a perfect match. Get the tech guys down here. We've found our murder weapon. / Yes, sir. What do you think? Is he the guy? Uh, stranger things have happened. Although, I can't think of one offhand. Yes, they have. Look at this. What? Looks like it might have been readjusted. Seems like it'd be too small for this guy. Aah! / What the hell are you doing? - Are you trying to kiss me? - No, no, no. No, sir. Mr. Johansen, hi. I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. I'm a homicide detective. - This is Lieutenant Disher. - Who's your lady friend? This is Adrian Monk. He's a special consultant. What happened to your nose? / Uh - You get shot? - Shot? No. No. But it is bleeding pretty badly. I caught a bullet in my nose in Korea. It still hurts like a son of a bitch, but you don't hear me crying about it. - I'm not crying. - But you want to, don't you? Yeah, he wants to cry. Yeah. I'm gonna call you Soft Serve. Like the ice cream soft and squishy. Thank you. Mr. Johansen, there was a homicide last night on the fifth floor. - We're investigating it. - Good for you. Sir, a man was beaten to death with that oxygen tank. Your oxygen tank. What the hell are you talking about? Where were you last night between the hours of 1:00 and 3:00am? Where do you think I was? What is this, your first day with a new brain? / No. I was here. Hooked up to this damn machine. Beep, beep, beep. You see Dr. Scott, you tell him I want this thing unhooked. It's driving me mental. Who Who's Dr. Scott? Dr. Davis Scott is taking out half my colon on Wednesday. And he's the second-best surgeon in California. And that's not my opinion. That's a fact. Soft Serve, I know my rights. And you people can't just walks in here and Hey, Soft Serve, come here. Crime Scene's on their way, and the floor is secured. So what do you think? Do you think somebody came in here, stole this guy's oxygen tank, and took it downstairs? - Why would they bring it back? - Why would they bring it back? It's not possible. Mr. Johansen never left his room. He's been on the heart monitor all night. Here's cardiogram. No gaps, no interruptions. Actually, all we know for sure is that he never took the monitor off. - What if he took it with him? - Randy, please. No, it's possible. I mean, all he had to do was strap the monitor to his back. And then climb out the window, shimmy down one story, unspooling - He's 82 years old. - He's a veteran. They were the Greatest Generation. You're through? Miss do you think Mr. Johansen could lift an oxygen tank? It must weigh about 40 pounds. You might want to ask his primary physician, Dr. Scott. - And where is he? - I know exactly where Dr. Scott is. Room 694. Down the hall, to the right. Follow the signs. He's been there all day. All day? / He's a patient in the cardio ward. - He admitted himself last night. - Thank you. It's possible, though. Well, sounds good, Davis. You know, Dr. Scott, we could come back later, when you're feeling better. No, I feel great. This is just a precaution. Last night I had a slight substernal chest pain. I checked myself in, had them run a couple of tests. - Is everything okay? - Never felt better. First good night's sleep I've had since med school. You got lucky, Davis. You gotta tap the brakes. Thank you, Mother. Do you seriously think Hank Johansen was involved with what happened last night? - Well, we're not sure. - I can't imagine how. He has progressive rheumatoid arthritis in both legs. So you don't think he could lift a 40 pound oxygen tank? Hank Johansen? He can't even put his own pants on. And besides, isn't he hooked up to one of these? I mean, you'd know if he left the room. I heard it was somebody from the clinic. A junkie. Excuse me. Excuse me, Doctor. Doctors. Would you mind taking a look at this? / Have we met? I'm sorry, this is Adrian Monk. He's unofficially with us. I see. Well, it's not my specialty, but as long as I'm here. You're a lucky man. Most people have to wait three months for this consultation. - Thank you. - Bleeding on and off? - On and on. - Does this hurt? Yes, ow! Ow, ow, ow! - I haven't done anything yet. - It was going to hurt. I can tell. Okay, I'm not going to touch you. Relax. Here's the thing. I went to the emergency room Let me guess, they tried to cauterize it, and it didn't take. Exactly. And there was this woman in the waiting room. - She said that her stepbrother - Had the exact same symptom. Yes. / And now you've convinced yourself there's some kind of tumor. You think it's a tumor? He said tumor. He said the word ""tumor. "" You heard him. You heard him, and I knew it. I knew it. I can feel it. It's right back here. It's like the size of a basketball. For the love of God, can I get a room? - Monk, that's not what he meant. - Mr. Monk, you don't have a tumor. Relax. Take a breath. Now, these conditions often have psychological components. - Are you under a lot of stress? - I wouldn't say that. I would. Mr. Monk, I have good news. You're not sick. Really? / You don't belong in a hospital. You belong on the beach, with your feet up. - That's a lot of sand. - Get out of town tonight, lower the heart rate. Doctor's orders. Book two seats. And, please, take him with you. Okay, no signs of arrhythmia, so I'm kicking you out of here. - This bed is for sick people. - Thank you, Bradley. - See you at 2:00. - We're not still doing your rounds? I have 18 patients in this joint a lot sicker than me. - Somebody's gotta be responsible. - Well, it's true what they say. Doctors make the worst patients. Good luck, gentlemen. Thank you. - Did you hurt yourself? - Oh, racquetball. I missed the shot, too. That's what really hurt. Is that talcum powder? / Yes. And if you keep over focusing, that nose is never gonna shut itself off. I have powder on my hands all the time. All doctors do. It's in the latex gloves. Now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen. If you need me, give me a call. Thank you. I think he's right. It's all in your head. Not all in my head anymore. See? - Where's Natalie? - I gave her the day off. - That was nice of you. - Yeah, it was. You were right. There's a motive. Dr. Scott's being sued for malpractice. The late Dr. Whitcomb's scheduled to testify against him. - Malpractice? - Yeah, a year ago. Scott lost a patient on the operating table. Dr. Whitcomb claims or was about to claim that he saw Scott popping pills before the operation. Amphetamines. He would have lost his license. He did it. Dr. Scott, he's the guy. - Was it the talcum powder? - The powder, plus the bruise on his leg. It was still swollen. Had to be less than a day old. Well, that could have been from racquetball. No, I don't think so. I think he hit his leg on the coffee table in Dr. Whitcomb's office. I hit it too. Look. See. It's in the exact same spot. And Randy, you hit it. Remember? - Yeah. - Well, let's see it. - What are you doing? - Showing you the bruise. - What's he doing? - It's near your ankle. - Just pull up your pant leg. - Well, six of one, right? It's not six of one. Roll up your pant leg. I'm already unbuckled. Okay, fine. Ow! / See, Dr. Scott was in that office last night. He was killing Dr. Whitcomb. How? I mean, I talked to the security guard who was sitting in front of Dr. Scott's room. He said no one went in or went out all night. He did it. / Plus, he was hooked up to that heart monitor. I don't know how he did it, but he did it. He's the guy. Nice and steady heartbeat all night long. He never left his room. First Mr. Johansen, now Dr. Scott. Are you gonna want EKGs on all our patients? No, ma'am. That will not be necessary. Okay, all right, look. Okay, all right, Captain. Captain, Captain, Captain, listen. I have an idea. Okay, Dr. Scott was hooked up to the heart monitor, right? - Yeah, that's right. - What if he took the monitor with him? What if he hooked it up to a battery pack, and he just carried it with him? The security guard said he never left the room. Out the window. It's only one floor. - Interesting. - Interesting? It's worth considering. I said the exact same thing a half an hour ago about the old guy, - and you shot me down. - You didn't say the same thing, Randy. You said something about a spool of cable. 800 feet of cable It was the same basic idea, except for the battery. The battery is a big part of what Monk is saying. No, it's the same thing. What, if I say something, it's a punch line, if he says it, he's a genius? Would you explain to him what you mean about the battery? All right, listen. Okay, he's a doctor, right? So, okay, the monitor the monitor Okay, I got nothing, all right? Okay? We're both wrong. All right, he couldn't have taken it with him. But there's gotta be something else. I'm sorry, Captain. It's this damn tumor. I'm losing a lot of blood here. Okay, let's move on. Randy and I are gonna go down to security again, and review surveillance tapes. - What about me? - You're going home. What? / Monk, maybe you're right. Maybe the guy is the guy. But he's also a doctor, and he gave you some very good advice. You need to go home, you need to relax. - You need to turn your brain off. - Uh uh, I can't. I can't. Go home. Come on. - Something from the bar? - Oh, no, thanks. What happened to your / I slipped in the shower and sprained my wrist. - No big deal. - Oh, and they're making you work? What was I gonna do? They didn't have anybody to cover for me. The boss is a pretty decent guy. I didn't just want to leave him hanging. I'll be back to check on you in a minute. Taxi. - Hello, Shelly. - Dr. Scott. - Did you miss me? - They told me you were sick. Don't worry about me, darling. I am the Rock of Gibraltar. So are you. I brought some friends with me. The best and the brightest. Or so I'm told. Mr. Collins, you're up. She's your patient. What do you see? Okay, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis - Your diagnosis, Doctor. - Acute diverticulitis. Congratulations, Mr. Collins, you just killed my favorite patient. Mr. Collins has conveniently overlooked her persistent fever, and right lower-quadrant pain, indicating what? - Indicating what? - Appendicitis. We may have a doctor in the house after all. - Any questions? - Yes, I have a question. Mr. Monk. I thought I sent you home. I had some unfinished business. This is Mr. Adrian Monk. He's with the police department. I'm sure you all heard about what happened to Graydon Whitcomb? Could you take a look at this, Doctor? This is from an EKG. Yes, I think I've seen one or two of these. Well, this was from last night. Midnight to 3:00am. There are some gaps here and here. It looks like it was disconnected. Eva, explain these gaps to Mr. Monk. There are gaps like these in any EKG. Anytime a patient rolls over or changes position. Well, what about this one? How long is this gap right here? - 8 seconds, maybe ten. - 10 seconds. Not much help, is it? - What's going on? - It's almost too absurd. You remember my patient Hank Johansen? kidney failure. He is Detective Monk's number one suspect. I think that may not be blood, Mr. Monk. I think you may be losing cranial fluid. Yeah, actually, I have a different suspect. - Well, that's a relief. - This one had a motive. The victim was about to testify against him in a malpractice suit. I hope your new suspect wasn't hooked up to a heart monitor, too. Because that would mean he couldn't possibly have done it. Am I right? It would also mean you're wasting my time. Your time may not mean much, Mr. Monk, but my time in this hospital is a precious commodity. Go bleed somewhere else. Excuse me. I'm out. Bye. - Oh, sorry. - Don't mind me. - There's a stain. - Yeah, there's a leak upstairs. I saw the same stain in another room. They're probably connected, or used to be. A lot of these rooms were divided up a few years back. Not my problem, that's all I know. Soft Serve! What the hell are you doing in my closet? How long have you been in there? That's it. After my operation, it's go time. In the parking lot, you and me. Mr. Johansen, who assigned you to this room? None of your damn business, you moron. Now, where's my wallet? What did you do with my wallet? Sir, please! This is very important. I am investigating a homicide here. If you touched my wallet, so help me, God, you're gonna be bleeding from more than your nose. - It was Dr. Scott, wasn't it? - As a matter of fact it was. There was a waiting list, and he had to pull a lot of strings to get me in here. Oh, there it is. Okay. - You're a lucky son of a bitch. - Mr. Johansen, listen to me! Dr. Scott killed Dr. Whitcomb. And I know how he did it. He checked himself in as a patient. He knew this hospital. He knew there had been a renovation. So he made sure that at one time, his room was connected to your room. At about 2:00, he made his move. He came in here through the supply closet. He knew you'd be sleeping. He probably prescribed your sedatives. As a matter of fact, he did. Then he put his monitor on your chest. He took the oxygen tank, and then he went downstairs. After the murder, he came back here, put his monitor back on, and snuck back into his room. It was perfect. Your heartbeat was his alibi. So, what do you think? I'll tell you what I think. I owe you an apology. / Really? Yeah, that would explain everything. / Yes. You know, you really are a great detective. - But I need proof. - Yeah, that's the thing. - You need proof. - Yeah. I've got it. I've got it. Okay, if I'm right, which, you know, I am, for about tem minutes, during the murder, your heartbeat, and Dr. Scott's heartbeat, are the exact same heartbeat. All I have to do is find those cardiograms. Yeah. Good thinking. You'd better go. - It's very exciting. - Yeah. I'd better use the door. Dr. Scott, please. Yes, it's very important. Dr. Scott, this is Hank Johansen. You know that wack-job detective you know uh Adrian Monk? Yeah. He just jumped out of my closet, screaming that you had killed some guy with my oxygen tank. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. You'd better do something before he hurts somebody. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know exactly where he is. So the judge is laughing, half the jury's laughing, and I look down I'm still wearing my slippers. Oh. Did you win the case? / Yeah. And now they're my lucky slippers. I keep them in my briefcase. Clara? / Don't worry, I got you. - I didn't know where you were. - It's okay. I'm right here. I wouldn't just walk away. You know me better than that. Alex, I am so sorry. You are so great, but I have to go. - You're leaving? - My boss needs me. - Uh, how do you know? - He always needs me. I'm sorry. You said you wanted to be admitted Your prayers have been answered, Mr. Monk. No, you can't speak or move. Don't even try. You're literally wasting your breath. I've injected 3ccs of tribusonol into your larynx. Do you have any idea what I do here every day? How many lives these hands have saved? How many lives they will save? Hundreds, thousands. That's my mission. It's why I'm here. I am the miracle man. Do you think I would let you, former-Detective Monk, or Dr. Graydon Whitcomb or anyone stop me? Oh, by the way, I have some good news for you. I stopped that pesky nosebleed. You're welcome. I have some other news, not quite so good. You had an accident. At least, that's what your chart says. You were in a stairwell, you tripped. You suffered a concussion. Possible nerve damage, multiple fractures. Ah, it gets worse. I don't know how this happened. The name on this chart is Dale Butterworth. In four minutes, the day nurse who is new to this floor is going to walk in, read this chart, and administer a massive dose of intravenous tetracycline. Yes, I know about your allergy. Unfortunately, mistakes like this happen all the time Hi. Excuse me, I was looking for Adrian Monk. He was sitting right over there. - He's been admitted. - He's been admitted? Mm-hmm. He's in Intensive Care. For a nosebleed? Mr. Monk? My God. Oh, my God, Mr. Monk, I'm so sorry. I can't believe this. What happened? They said you fell down the stairs? Oh, it's all right. I'm here. I'll take good care of you, okay? Oh Hi. How's he doing today? I don't know. I just got here. - Are you his wife? - No, I'm his assistant. And his friend. I think he's in a lot of pain. He's not very good with pain. Okay, well, this should help. Tetracycline What? Dr Dr. Scott? That's his primary. You're very lucky. - Dr. Scott¡¯s the greatest. - Did you hear that? You have a great doctor. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, it's okay. Just relax, I've got you. Give me your hand. There you go, just relax. - He should have some ice chips. - Okay, I'll get them. It's okay. Mr. Monk, I just want to tell you that I'm so sorry for leaving you here this morning. It will never happen again. If you are ever in trouble, I will be there for you, I promise. Okay, let go. Let go. Okay, I'll be right back. Nurse, excuse me. I just want to thank you for being so sweet to him. But I wanted to ask you, do you have the kind of ice maker that makes round ice cubes? - Because he'd prefer that. - We might. So how long have you worked for Mr. Butterworth? Who's Mr. Butterworth? Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. Oh, God. It's okay. Take it easy. Take it easy. One step at a time. There you go. There you go. - You're you're scraping the bag now. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. It's a perfect match. I'd like to see him try to explain this to a jury. - It was my idea. - No, it's not, Randy. It's completely different. No, it was the same basic idea. Our next crime scene, I'm not gonna say anything. I'm just gonna write everything down and copyright it. Yeah, you copyright everything in your notebook. Maybe I will. Ow! Son of a preacher man! - Oh, God, you okay? - That's bleeding. - You want to go back inside? - No, no, no, I'm fine. Let's just go. Mr. Monk, it could get infected. Maybe we should just go back in there. No, Natalie. No. Can't do running into the ER about every little thing. Let's just go. Let's go. Come on, let's go home. Ow! Ow.."

So do you wanna talk about the case now or should we just relax for a little while? What are the choices again? Relax or talk about the case. Yeah, relax! Let's just relax. Plenty of time. Five hours and 52 minutes. Mr. Monk! Excuse me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is my favorite. It's from last summer. See, what I do is I read the articles about you and then I make dioramas of the various cases. This one is ""Mr. Monk and the Three Pies. "" What?! When you went to see your brother. That's what I call it. Is that me? Adrian, should we call the captain? Not yet, Marci. We need to gather more evidence. Natalie, get the car. On my way, Mr. Monk. Is that me? It's a troll doll. I can't imagine life without you. Adrian, I've waited so long Marci, are you a musician? You know I am! I've only sent you all my demos. I'm working on a song. Here. There's a man in California If you're ever in a funk He may not be F. Murray Abraham But I think he's a hunk And his name is On second thought, why don't you tell me about the case? I'm sorry. Can we start over? You had a dog. - His name was Otto. - Yep, that's right. - And Otto died last week? - Monday, yeah. Well, I buried him Monday night. So he's in the ground, dead. Dead, dead dog. And then three days later, on Thursday, the woman across the street was attacked? By by a dog. Yeah, she was mauled. Isn't that the grossest word? ""Mauled. ""Mauled. I mean, Otto had snapped at her last year, but it wasn't a big deal. But of course, the cops naturally think that he did it. So they dug him up to compare the teeth marks. And they matched. Well, that's what they say. They're gonna return him tomorrow. I guess I'm gonna have to bury him again. So to recap, the dog dies on Monday, then three days later, kills your neighbor. Pretty freaky, huh? And the dog was definitely dead when you buried him. Yeah, the dog was definitely dead when I buried him. What do you think, I'm a nut? What do you think, Adrian? I stopped thinking an hour and a half ago. What do you think? I think we should call the captain. That's the men's room. And Hey. This is my desk. Lieutenant Disher. Oh, check these out. Real handcuffs. Wanna try 'em on? So Sam. How long have you wanted to be a policeman? I don't wanna be a cop. But your mom said you did. Maybe when I was nine. How old are you now? Nine and a half. Who'd want to be a cop? You don't make any money and everybody hates you. Okay, so, what do you wanna do? We got some game and stuff, I think, for when kids visit. How about that? Let's see. No. Ah, yeah, here we go. How about this? We got crayons. Coloring book. - I did that one. - I used to love this game. Hm. Timber. Set it up. I'm looking at the forensic report right now, Monk. Your girlfriend's in a lot of trouble. Yeah, she's she's not my girlfriend. Look, the bite marks all match 100%. It's as good as a fingerprint. She says the dog was already dead. Debbie Ringel was attacked by a dog. And it wasn't a ghost dog. Here is a more likely scenario. The dog kills the neighbor, Marci panics. She has her own dog put down and claims that he died a couple of days earlier. I don't know. I- I don't know. Animal control warned her about Cujo at least twice, which means she's responsible. She could be indicted for manslaughter. What she needs is a good lawyer and you need to get the hell out of there. Okay? Bye-bye. Right. Natalie. Not like that. Push it with your fingertips. Now pull it from the other side over here. - All right. - That's how you do it. Having fun? Yeah. You know. If you need me, I will be at the Four Seasons with Linda. Do not need me. She'll kill me. Okay, that's yours. Have fun. Oh, Captain? Have fun. Okay, I'm gonna go again. Push They think i killed Otto?! - Well, that would explain quite a bit. - Makes a lotta sense. No, I-I don't do that, okay? I don't kill things I love. Well, that's reassuring. There must be another explanation. Like what, Marci? Like, I don't know. I mean, you do it all the time. The police have a theory and they think it's cut and dry. And then you come in and you do your thing. And you get clues and you figure it out. You know, it's like ""Mr. Monk and the astronaut. "" Or ""Mr. Monk goes back to school. "" - Oh, remember that one? - No! Where are you getting these names? According to the forensic laboratory reports Yeah, well, they're wrong. Okay. They can make mistakes. Maybe it was, uh, a frame-up. They framed your dog? Yeah, maybe theydid frame my dog, Natalie. It's not totally unprecedented. What about ""Mr. Monk and the Panic Room""? They tried to frame a monkey, didn't they? See, things aren't always as they seem. - That's true. - Okay. We made a deal. Okay I spent $800 for six hours. I own you. You have to do what I say. What if he's home? There's no car in the driveway. Worry wart. Adrian. - You'll be the lookout. - I'm not the lookout. That's where they found her in the shed. He's doing it. That is so cool. I've got goose bumps. I really do. You wanna see? - No, thank you. - Bumpy. You have the best job in the world. Not today, I don't. Did you say something? 'Cause it sounded like you said something. What? She was attacked right here. You can still see the blood. But she must've tried to fight back. Right? Look at all these tools. Why why didn't she grab one of these tools? What are you doing? - Clue hug! - No! - Natalie! - Marci! Ooh, right. Yes, go! Keep going you're amazing. You're amazing. Do your thing. What is that? It's a flower petal. Tulip? There's no tulips in this yard. That's not a clue. That's just something I notice. This is what we call an observation. Okay, right. Can I help you? Oh, it's you! Why can't you just leave me alone? Mr. Ringel, I'm very sorry for your loss. I wonder if I could ask you a couple of questions. Did you actually see Marci's dog on that day? Weknowit was her dog. He crawled in under the fence. You can still see the hole. I talked to the cops. All the teeth marks match. And who the hell are you? Thisis Adrian Monk, okay? And he happens to be a genius. Marci, don't don't If you have anything to hide and I have a hunch that you do he's gonna find it he's already found, like, a million clues tell him. Okay, Marci, let's just leave this man alone. Youdid it! You killed her. You are in big trouble, mister. Big trouble because Adrian Monk always gets his man, friend Sorry about her sorry about everything. Sorry for your loss. So sorry. I- I did manage To get your tools all this hose is kind of a mess, though you might wanna.. it's okay. Natalie! He said Natalie! According to the police, Otto dug this hole, attacked Mrs. Ringel, then got out the same way. So? Well, where's the dirt? It's all on the other side. But that's the wrong side. When a dog digs a hole, he pushes the dirt behind him. And look! - Dead - Tulip. It's possible. There's a chance she's not crazy. I mean, she's crazy, but she might not be wrong. - Clue hug? - Take it like a man. Uh, I need a wipe, Natalie. Hold on! Right here here. Oh, no! Use mine. They're monogrammed. They're better. I- I did it myself. They're sanitary wipes. Doesn't that defeat the purpose? Adrian, she's ruing everything. I mean, who is she? I'm his assistant, okay? I been with him for three years. Well, I've known him even longer,okay? Here's a little news flash, Marci. Stalking someone and knowing someone two different things! Excuse me. Ladies, let's settle down. I think we might have an actual murder on our hands. Oh, woo-hoo! Exactly. Woo-hoo. Let's just think for a minute, okay? Tell me about the dog. How did he die? Kidney failure. He went really quickly. Before he passed, did anything unusual happen? Oh, yes! About two weeks ago, he disappeared for a whole day. I couldn't find him. I was worried sick. I was putting up posters everywhere. And then around 6:00, he just showed up. And you have no idea where he was? No. He was covered in woodchips, though. Is that important? It took me an hour to brush it out. You still have the brush? The brush? Please. Actually, that's a good idea. I'll get it. It's teak. Mahogany. Lumber yard. Oh, no. We have to now. It's tradition. Can I help you? This is Adrian Monk. He's gonna be asking you some questions. - What about? - You'll find out. First, there are some ground rules. No coughing, no sneezing. You will not shake his hand. You will not make small talk. Do you understand? Lower that sleeve so it's even with the other one. He's very particular. Yes. Have you seen this dog? No. Thank you. That is four lumber yards down, one to go. How am I dong? Not bad, actually. Well, if you ever need an assistant Well, I have Natalie. Maybe it's time for a change. Natalie and I have been together for three and a half years. So I don't thi I'll work for free. What? You're considering it? Well, you know free. So? You wanna make a counter offer? Yeah, here's my counter offer. I'm not nuts! You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. It ju It's her! - I get so flustered. - Mr. Monk, you're not flustered. You're flattered. Who wouldn't be? She adores you. She knows everything about you. After all, you're only human. There's no need for name-calling. You know what? On second thought, I think it's a great idea. What are you doing? Calling a cab. I'm going home What?! I'm glad that this happened, actually. That woman is as obsessive and compulsive as you are. I want you to see what it's like. Go ahead. Hang out with her, work with her. I'll call you tomorrow. We'll compare notes. It's for the best, boss. Last weekend was my fault. Hmm. And the weekend before that? That one - okay, that was my fault too. - Mm-hmm. Look, I've got two detectives on sick leave. I have been swamped. What does a girl have to do to get your attention, Captain? Kill someone? I'm not gonna answer it. It is in the briefcase. It's in the briefcase and the briefcase is locked. Now where were we? Okay. Fingertips. Lt, we caught a break on that Chinatown thing. Okay. Give it to Kramer. Tell him I'm busy. I am Kramer. Uh-huh. Yeah. ding It's John Ringel. That's the guy. That's the husband. Oh, yeah, he owns a lumber yard. I forgot. You forgot?! How could you forget?! We've been checking lumber yards all day! I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. I'm not a perfect person. - I need a hug. - No, no more hugs. Sorry, I was just closing up. Not you again. My dog was here. You kidnapped my dog two weeks ago! You really are certifiable, aren't you? I told you to stop harassing me. But that's it. I'm gonna call my lawyer and then I'm calling the cops. Let's just get outta here. I think he's bluffing. He's bluffing. What is it? It's chew marks. Look! Otto! You are amazing! What do you wanna call this case? I don't know! Shut up. How about ""Mr. Monk is Friggin' Awesome""? How about ""Mr. Monk and Marci: The Adventure Begins""? It doesn't matter. Nobody cares about the name. Just shut it. Monogrammed wipe. ""Plaster mold. Do not ingest. Marci, when Otto died, did you tell anyone? No. Oh, my God. Don't turn! Don't don't don't turn around. I think you were right. He's the guy. And I know how he did it. Oh, my gosh. Say, ""Here's what happened. He must've been planning this forweeks! - Say, ""Here's what happened""! - Shh. Here's what happened. John Ringel realized he could murder his wife and blame it on your dog. Nobody would ever question it. Everybody knew Otto was a little wild. What are you doing? There's no hugging during the ""Here's what happened. "" - Sorry, go on. - Just stand over there. That day Otto disappeared Ringel must've brought him here, drugged him, and made an impression of his teeth. Oh, poor Otto! Then Ringel built a lethal weapon using the mold of Otto's teeth. It couldn't have been too hard. After all, he owns a lumber yard. He had all the equipment he needed. Then he waited. He was in no rush. One week, two weeks, until finally, she was alone. He knew the bite marks would match up perfectly. The cops everyone would assume it was your dog. It was a perfect crime, except for one thing. He had waited too long. He didn't know that Otto had died three days earlier. He was framing a dead dog! Wow. That is incredible! Where did he go? Do it one more time for the website. What are you doing?! I'm not gonna say it again. You don't have to do the whole thing. Say how you know how he killed his wife. Would you keep your voice down? He's gonna hear us. Too late. I already heard ya. Shut up and don't move. - Shoot him. - I don't have a gun. You did in ""Mr. Monk and The Dragon's Lair. "" The what?! Oh, wait. I made that one up. - It's called ""fan fiction. "" - I said shut up! Son of a bitch! What is it? Leland, this is not very romantic. What are you looking at? Bite marks. I'm afraid to ask. Look at the bite marks. That woman was attacked by a dog. - Look at the bite marks. - No, thank you. They're all upside down. Even the defensive ones. I gotta make a phone call. No, it's me. I'm trying to find him. Disher. Randy, meet me at 420 Vinton Street. It's a lumber yard it's owned by John Ringel. Chop chop. Who's John Ringel? As of ten minutes ago, he's a murder suspect. Monk is there now. I think he might be in trouble. I'm on my way. You still playing that stupid game? Randy? Randy? No. What is this? Is this blood? - You've been shot. - Oh, my God! I've been shot! It's okay. It's just a scratch. - What am I doing here? - Shut up. This isn't fun anymore. Why did you bring me here? I didn't bring you here! I don't wanna do this. I hate this. Excuse me pause. Pause, please. If we could just put a pause on this for a second. I wanna go home. And I know, but I am absolutely not gonna say anything about you killing your wife. It's no biggie. I mean, she was asking for it. I've seen her out there. I'm your neighbor. I've seen her in the garden with her flower pot going blah, blah, blah. My gardenias are awesome. So I'm just gonna go. Yeah, I don't think so! Monk! Come on out! I have your girlfriend! I'm not his girlfriend. I don't even like him anymore. Monk? Come out or I'll kill her. Okay, right here. Natalie, stay back. - Where's your car, Marci? - Out front. I hope you have a full tank. - We got a long trip ahead of us. - Listen. I have to sit in the front. It's one of my things. Yeah, he's got a million ""things. "" I don't know what I was thinking. SFPD! Drop the weapon! Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! Where is he? I can't get a shot. Go around. Go around! What are you doing? Let me see your hands! Let's see 'em. Stupid game, huh? - What is it? - Oh, it's it's from Marci. ""Adrian, I'm sorry. ""I can't have your things in my house anymore. ""How would I ever explain them to Fff-Murray Abraham? F.Murray Abraham. - The actor. - May God have mercy on his soul. - Your pants are back. - I'd already thrown this stuff out. Oh, hey. Look. It's you. Oh, Adrian, I adore you. Aren't you amazing? I love everything you say and do. All right. - It wasn't like that. - Thank you, Marci. I think you have excellent taste. You'd like to be my new assistant? You could follow me around and worship me all day. Cut it out, will you? And let's seal the deal with a great big clue hug. Clue hug! Clue hug! - Clue hug! - Stop it. Oh, I love you. I'm your biggest fan. I just want a little clue hug! Cut it out. I know it's you. Clue hug, clue hug."

Cause they knew you was gonna harass me. Matter of fact, remind me - to thank the owner. - 2 questions. I will make you look Ever since you left your old label, Murderuss has been saying some - pretty wicked things about you. - You asking me if I'm afraid? Is that what you asking me? Yo I ain't scared, a'ight? What they say on their records, it just this and that. It's about what I say onmyrecords. It's all just talk. Just harshing each other. You're sure?

I'm out here waiting and stuff, man. Sorry I'm late. Had a drop-off all the way uptown. Don't sweat it. Yo, make sure they spell my name right.

Five, four, three, - two, and now! - Ya! Perfect! - No, it's 2 seconds off. - No, no, Mr. Monk. No one's ever gonna notice. - No one except for you. - Let's just try it one more time.

Do you think a secretary has to do what I do? It's a huge responsibility. What? What about the Secretary of State? That's a very important job. Or Secretariat, Triple Crown winner. Love to see an assistant do that. You don't respect me at all, do you? I mean, really, really respect me. Of course I do 22. I do, Nat Ooh, doorbell. Natalie, hurry back. Hurry back. 15. Never mind!

Excuse us, we were just, uh, we were just setting the clocks forward there. - Daylight savings time and all. - Ah, hell, man. I always forget to do that. That's a beautiful watch. Oh, you like that, huh? It's that white gold. Imported. I have to get you one next time I see you. - They're his trademark. - Really? Sorry! My name is Murderuss. Murderuss? I've heard of you! I've taken your records away from my daughter. You'll have to excuse Natalie. She's a little prudish - about that stuff. - I'm different these days. I'm more of a businessman. Have my own record label. Manslaughter Records. This is Snake Da Assassin, my VP. Mr. Assassin. Sss. - Hello. - And this is Silent Killa, secretary of defense. Secretary? Uh-oh. Natalie here thinks secretary is a dirty word. Have you seen that? My lawyer's already calling me. Police looking for me. They think I did it. Well, uh, why would they think that? - Motive, yo. - Motive, yo. The deceased, Extra Large, used to record on my label. But the splits wasn't exactly cordial. I hate that motherf fella. I hate that fella. - Is this all they have? - Plus, about a month ago, I made a song talking about how I wanted to kill him and how I planned to do it. Tick, tick, tick, tick Ka-boo Name of the song wasCar Bomb. And that's the exact same way he died, you know what I'm saying? Now, look, I'm no angel, and I never pretended to be. But this time, - this wasn't me. - No. Of course it wasn't. We've been asking around, and street's been saying you're some kind of super cop. Well, I guess if other people say it, it's not really bragging. You feelin' me there, Silent? - He's feelin' me. - I wanna hire you. I want you to do what you do, sniff around and get me the hell outta this. Oh, we're flattered. We really are. But we really, were just talking about - we have so many other commitments. - Don't listen to her. - I'll take the case. I'm your man. - Well, all right. It's an honor. It's a privilege. And don't you worry, because I am gonna get you out of this. - My word is my bond. - Now, that's what I needed to hear. Pay the man. Here's a retainer and my business card. You call me as soon as you get some good news. Natalie, it was a pleasure meeting you, beautiful. Thank you for your business, Mr. Murderuss. Mr. Assassin. Mr. Killer. Sorry Killa. K- Killa. Natalie, Killa. Don't worry about anything. I got your back, yo. Have a nice day, yo. That was close. - Are you okay? - But he seemed to take it pretty well, didn't you think? Take what well? When I turned down the case. When I said I was too busy. Mr. Monk, you said yes. You took the case. He wrote you a check. It's right there. Natalie, there's nothing in my hand. Mr. Monk, it's right here. You said yes. You gave him your word. You said you had his back. That piece goes there. And that piece goes near the front. You're pretty good - at this. Have a secret? - You do the corners first. Can't believe he's dead. You a fan? - No. - Extra Large? He's the godfather of second-wave east coast rap. You know, this was before Jay-Z, Nas, Got myself strapped for the war goin' down, down I looked death in the face and I called him a clown, clown Pulled out my nin Randy, do you think the captain respects you? Does he respect me? Yeah. He teases me a lot. Yeah, but at the end of theday, I think my opinion means something. Why? Found the limo driver over there. He's in intensive care. We think - he's gonna survive. - You okay? - Car bomb. Mm-hmm. You wanna - sit this one out? No. No, I'm good. We've already got a primary. Get this the guy had a rival, another rapper. They'd been threatening each other for months, even wrote little ditties about each other. Guess what his name is. - Murderuss. - That's right! Is that perfect, or what? I can't wait till a jury hears that. Well, it's only a name. Doesn't mean anything. Murderuss? Monk, that's not a name. It's a confession. Plus, the guy has got a rap sheet like 10 miles long. - Alleged rap sheet. - No, a very real, grown-up rap sheet. I arrested the kid myself three times back when he was a hood in the 'hood. - What are you, his lawyer? - I don't know. Natalie am I his lawyer? No. You're his investigator. Murderuss paid us a little visit today. - He came to your house. - He was afraid he was gonna get blamed for this, so he asked Mr. Monk to take the case. - And you said yes. - Well, so I've been told. - I wasn't really there. - You did it again. When he gets nervous, he blacks out sometimes and agrees to do stuff. God. Oh, my God, what did I do? Well, look, maybe you're right. Maybe he's not the guy. Of course he's the guy! His name is Murderuss. I mean, I cannot believe - this is happening. - Captain, we found the detonator. Wow, what is this, silver? Naw, that's white gold. Imported. - Well, how do you know that? - Cause my client wears them all the time. They're his trademark. I am so screwed! And where were you? Don't look at me. I'm just the secretary. Extra Large was your biggest star, your cash cow. But he left your label and started recording for Fresh P - Fresh Produce - Fresh Rhymes. Fresh Rhymes Records. You couldn't stand that, could you, Russell? - My name is Murderuss. - Well, you'll always be Russell to me. Little Russell Kroy from Millburn Avenue. Flushing dime bags down the toilet every time I came knockin'. Does this one belong to you? It's one of your trademarks, isn't it? It's like those Special Edition Ponys you're wearing? - It'd make an excellent - timing device. I ain't no bomb maker. Well, you don't have to be a bomb maker. Any Boy Scout could make this. What you do is you take one wire and you connect it to the hour hand, and the other wire goes to the face. Tick, tick, tick, tick. 9:00 kaboom. - Guess what. - What? I ain't a Boy Scout either. No kiddin'. How 'bout this, Russell? It's a blasting cap. See here? That's a serial number. That's how we know that this particular blasting cap was stolen from a construction site a half a block away from your house. I am not going to be putting a bomb up onto somebody's town car. You know me. I'm up close and personal, face-to-face. Not according to this. Track four. Little song calledCar Bomb. Put the bomb in your lim That's what the surprise is Under your seat Like Oprah giving prizes - Sound familiar? - Not the way you do it. Yeah, well, I wasn't really performing it. Look, you got to be one of the whitest white boys I've ever met. And I met Kevin Costner. Well, uh, could have done it right brought in a beat box. Captain wouldn't let me. I owe you one. You know what? You're not the only musician in the room. Actually, I'm in a band too. We have a very eclectic repertoire. We do rap. We also do folk. What is this, good cop, demented cop? - Yo, just go to my website. - Randy! - He called me white! - Sit down. - Don't deny it. - Sit down! Yo got a problem, Russell. The limo driver was with the car all night long. He probably saw whoever planted this. He's gonna pull through, and when he does, he's gonna tell me what he saw. Well, he didn't see me. I'm being set up. I'm innocent. All you gotta d is ask Adrian Monk. Ain't he one of y'all? I thought he was up here. He'll tell you. He know what's happening. I been set up, and this is a bunch of bull, man. I can't believe this. - Well, I mean I don't think it was him. - Of course it was him. Didn't you hear the captain? There's amountain of evidence. He is so so, so guilty. He is what we call very guilty. Mr. Monk, you're just so nervous, you're not thinking straight. If he did it, why did he hire you? You're the best detective in California. Probably his lawyer's idea. It's just PR to make it look good. I don't think so. I think he's frightened. He's like you in a way. I think deep, deep down he's just this frightened little boy. A- a-and this is based on what? I have a hunch. Okay. You get hunches all the time. People don't laugh at you. People laugh at me. Plenty. But not about that. The captain gets hunches. Why can't I have a hunch? Oh, I get it. I get it. This is about the secretary thing, isn't it? And how you don't think I something about not respecting - Wait. I wrote it down. - Mr. Monk, this is not about me. This is about your client. That man is in trouble, and he's depending on you. You shook his hand.

Every Sunday we have breakfast together to figure out what we're gonna do with the money, where it's all going. Last Sunday morning, I had to take my limo uptown. - I forgot, okay? - I show up.

Well, I was thinking about it, and Saturday night, the night before it happened, I was leaving my office. It's, like, 7:00 exactly. I remember, cause I was late for a meeting. I looked at my watch. - And - I saw somebody. Yeah he was hanging out near the garage where the limo was parked. And, you know I thought it was weird. Couldn't figure out why he was hanging out around there. Well, who was it? It's okay, it's okay. - Nobody'll know it came from you. - Well, it was dark. So, you know, uh couldn't really see his face. But he was tall. - Six, two, six, four? - Six, four my God! Murderuss. I can't swear to that. I didn't want to say You just did. I had to say something. Should I call the cops? All right, uh I'll call them right away. But it was nice to meet you guys, and good luck. He's the guy. Who's who's the guy? Hodges? I don't know. There's something about him. Another hunch? Well, we should at least check him out. Why would he kill Extra Large? He had no motive. - None! Extra Large was his meal ticket. - I don't know. The limo driver's out of intensive care. We can talk to him tomorrow. Maybe he saw something. Hello? Hello? Who who is it? Do I know you? Mind if I join you? Randy's upstairs talking to our medical examiner in rap. Why? I learned a long time ago not to ask Randy why he does anything. Where's Natalie? She went home. She's mad at me. Something about how I never listen or I understand you bought her a big bunch of flowers for Secretaries' Day? Big mistake. - They were on sale. - Monk, that woman would crawl through hell for you. She is not your secretary. I know. They were on sale. So you gonna come up? We have a fresh crime scene upstairs. Yeah, I'll be right up. You're not gonna like it. - We found a footprint on the windowsill - Let me guess. Special Edition shoe. The only kind your client Murderuss ever wears. - The murder weapon. - Yeah, let me guess. White gold. We found it out back in the hazardous waste bin. Of course! He knew I would never look out there. Grand jury's meeting tomorrow. We're gonna indict him on Thursday and arrest him on Friday. He is gonna blame me. I gotta get out of that contract. - Then get out of that contract. - Will you Will you Will you Yes, Monk, I will go with you. - Apologize, but don't cry. - Don'tcry? Just tell him the truth. There's too much evidence against him. You're not a miracle worker. Don't do that. What? This. It's a gang sign. Don't do this or this or this. - They're all gang signs. - I'll keep my hands in my pockets. No, don't do that. He'll think you're carrying. He'll shoot us here on the spot. How how 'bout this? Do that. Killa. How are you? He's shy. Hey, homely. How how's it going? He means homey. And he doesn't eve mean that. Um, we'd like to talk to Russell. What's wrong with your hands? Just keepin' it real. Who's your friend? Leland Stottlemeyer. - You a cop? - Yes, I am. He goes in, you stay out here. You'll be okay? - Be right here. - Uh, Chatty Cathy. That man's a friend of mine. I'm holding you personally responsible. Mm, right on. - Monk, what it do, baby? - Murder. Snake. Hello. I be right with you, soon as I pass this level. - Which one are you? - I'm the one trying to kill that fool. Why? It's called gang-banging. Them two are partners. Then the white dude got scared and tried to back out. I love this game! You gave me your word. You wanna play? I feel like I just did. Heard about that limo driver. I suppose I'm gonna get blamed for that one, too, huh? He was strangled with a chain, you know white gold. Like this? It's quite obvious, somebody trying to set me up. I'm just glad you in my corner, Monk. About that, um I'm, uh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Maybe we could just turn this off. No. Okay, first off, thank you for thinking of me. I will always cherish the time we we've had together. And that goes for you, too, Killer. And you, Mr. Assassin. I think I'll miss you most of all. Are you goin' somewhere? I have to respectfully return your money. You're backing out? I'm not dissing you. This this is not a diss. Look, man, if you back out right now, I'm in deep dookie, mookie. And that's church. Fershizzle my dizzle. You know what I'm sayin'? Um no. Not not not so much. I wish I did. Here's the thing. When you came to my house and I said yes, - that wasn't really me. - Well, he sure as hell looked like you. He shook my hand and he gave me his word. That should have told you something right there. I almost never shake hands. When I get nervous, I say things I don't mean. Okay? So here's your check. It's a little wrinkled. I'll just, uh No charge. We're two men, right? We can work this out. Check this out. Wanna hit this peace pipe? No, thank you. Come on, man. It'll relax you. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm I'm relaxed. Dog, you are not relaxed! You got to be the most uptight little puppy I ever met. I bet if I put a lump of coal in your butt and let it sit there for ten minutes, I could get a diamond out of it. D- diamond? Murderuss, listen to me. You gotta believe me. - That wouldn't work. - Man, what are you talking about? There's no way you'd get a diamond from a lump of coal up there. I- It's not physically possible. Chill out, man. It's just a figure of speech. I'll buy you a diamond. I'll buy you I'll buy you all a diamond. Diamonds for everybody. Diamonds for everybody. You heard him, man. Diamonds for everybody. Toast to my main man Monk. I'm the new head of security. And how did that happen? Stain remover. Backup stain remover. Trudy pillow. You know, Mr. Monk, running away never solved anything. the guy who said that, about running away here's what we know about him. He didn't keep blacking out and making deals with a man named Murderuss, who, by the way, is about to be indicted for two homicides. What are those? Oh, clothes, soap, wipes, water. Be careful carrying the water. - Where are you going? - I haven't decided. I'm either gonna buy a rail pass and bum my way through Central Asia, or go to your place. I'm leaning toward your place. You know, what you obviously don't care what I think, and you obviously never will, but I don't get it. Why isn't somebody checking out that guy Denny Hodges? I told you, there's no motive. Extra Large was his biggest star. It's just weird, okay? The way he happened to notice Murderuss near that garage at 7:00. It's just too convenient. - He did say 7:00, didn't he? - Yes. He was sure about that. He said he checked his watch. - Natalie. - What? Hodges had to be lying. But why, why, why would he do this? I've got it. I've got it. Hodges. did it. He's the guy. Which means - It wasn't Murderuss! - It wasn't Murderuss! Can you believe it? He's innocent! Who would have thought? Exactly! He didn't do it! He's innocent. He's an innocent, innocent, innocent man! This is the best Secretaries' Day ever! I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Check this out. It's a celebration right now for my homeboy Extra Large. We miss you, homey. You dig? Yeah. Put your hands up. Come out here with your boy, man. Come out here with your boy. D., come on. C- come with your boy, man. We got Fresh Rhymes in the building, you dig what I'm sayin? We makin' it happen, man.

I should have listened to Natalie. Good advice. You should write that down so you won't forget that. Would you write that down, please? Sure. Now, tell me this, Monk. I wanna know. How did you solve the case? I want all the details from start to finish. Here's what happened. It's a celebration, yeah I look at y'all and see a celebration, yeah See, this ain't nothing but a celebration, yeah Celebrating the life Of my homeboy Extra Large, yeah Celebratin', celebratin', you'll be celebratin' Yeah, give it up for my homeboy Extra Large. In the building. How long will they mourn me? You did it, homey. You a man of your word. You solved the case, - I appreciate that. Hey, - dog, come in here. He's talkin' about you. You know, I, uh, I feel like I lost a brother on Sunday morning. I do. And I know that y'all, you know, feel the same way. You know? We know that the police have a suspect. Y'all know who I'm talking about. Murderuss! I ain't gotta say his name. Yeah, you know what? But let's just be cool. 'Cause if Large was here, Large would tell us to what he'd say just chill out. So we gonna chill out. We gonna let the cops do they job for once. Speak of the devil. You got a lotta nerve. I will give you that. You know what? Let's just calm down. Somebody call the authorities. Let them know that we have a murder in the house. Word. Word. Word. Everybody, word. People, brothers, let me give you the 411. That means information. Murderuss didn't kill anybody. Denny Hodges wanted us, wanted everyone to think that Murderuss planted that bomb. Hodges said he saw Murderuss in the parking lot at 7:00 PM, but that's impossible. The timing device was a 12-hour clock like this. But the bomb went off after 13 hours. One second, one second. Let let me get this straight. Are you accusing me? This man was family to me, all right? We was gonna make each other rich. Why would I hurt him? That's what I couldn't figure out the motive. But then I realized Then I realize Here's what happened. Here's what happened. Word! Here's what happened. Everybody, word. Here's what happened, y'all. I got this, Monk. Yeah, you can't believe what you hear all the time. Sometimes seein' is believing. Like the man said, I was set up. I'm just a pawn in this game. Let me break it down for y'all. No, for real. Here's what happened. Have you ever been accused, Man, you got set up And it really wasn't you, Man, you got set up Trying to plant something on me Man, you got set up And then you say I killed your homey This fool was greedy, had to have the whole thing Let me run it down to you,it's a cold game He wanted more than half of the pie That's why his partner had to die You heard me,you were the target all along Am I right, or am I wrong You're making a lot of excellent points. He is. Every week, they had a breakfast date Captain Crunch, French toast, or a stack of pancakes But this week they wasn't serving nothin' But murder on the plate He wanted to pin it on me like a Purple Heart But his perfect plan just fell apart as he fled the scene, homes. Cause like Aaron Burr who was tried for treason You made a mistake, dog, forgot about the season There was the fatal flaw to the perfect crime See, Sunday was daylight savings time Twice a year we reset the clock Ahead one hour, but I guess you forgot Your partner showed up to break some bread What he found was an empty table instead You didn't order room service Cause you thought the homey Waddy was dead Extra Large ran outta luck When the limo came by and picked him up The pocket watch up under the car The trigger went boom And there went Extra Large Have you ever been accused, Man, you got set up And it really wasn't you, Man, you got set up Trying to plant something on me Man, you got set up And then you say I killed your homey I went to the source and found a great detective I told Adrian Monk to follow my direction He solved the case and rocked it well Next stop for you, Denny Hodges Is a Death Row jail cell You dropped your, uh You dropped your you dropped your mike, Murder. Hello. You can't prove any of this. Au contraire. That's a search warrant. We just came from your house, Denny. We found your little bomb making workshop in the basement. Lieutenant, take him down.

Uh, he doesn't like the beach. What's he doing? Putting on his sand shoes. What are sand shoes? I don't know. Look, we've got a little problem here. This is a clothing optional beach. - Clothing optional. - Yeah. Oh. Oh. Yeah. So what do you think? I just want him to look around a little bit, see if we missed something. It'll just take a minute. Oh my God, I see one. Oh God, they're everywhere. Oh no, there's another one. I gotta take him home this is too risky. It's too late. Here he comes. We can do this. Let's just distract him. Monk! Hey. There should be a law against murdering people on a beach. Who was she? Actually, we don't really have that much. Her name was Vickie Deline. 23. Lived in Mission Hill. And she worked in a bar. What was she doing here? Well, don't know. She parked her car up top, left her keys in the ignition. Up the hill? Why why didn't she park down here on the access road? - Any footprints? - No. Uh, it rained this morning. But body's over here. Oh, hey, like those shoes. Yeah. These are my sand shoes. Nice. Oh, look at the sand! Never seen sand quite that color. Mr. Monk, what would you call that color? I don't know. Sandy. Oh, look. A sand dollar. No, just a shell. Here she is. Here we go. What are you doing? I just missed her. Natalie. There's a smaller cut, before a finger. - I guess Dr. G missed that. - It's like a paper cut. Oh yeah, those hurt like the dickens. What about all the stab wounds? Yeah, they probably hurt too. There's still sand in it. It's fresh. Did you find anything nearby? Any papers or an envelope? Not yet. Well, she was holding something. Maybe that's what the killer was after. - She's missing a fingernail. - Yeah. Yeah, we got that. Officer! You got that fingernail? We found it on that porch over there. - Who lives there? - His name is Chance Singer. We haven't found him yet. Officer, XYZ. XYZ? Examine Your Zipper. - I get it. XYZ - It must be him now. Mr. Singer? I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD. There was a homicide last night. A woman was murdered. Oh, wow. No. All that negative energy. It's the last thing the world needs. Am I right? Do you know a girl named Vickie Deline? I know a couple of Vickies. I'm not so into last names though. Sir, would you mind putting your shirt on? May I ask why? It would just it would mean a lot to me. we found a broken fingernail belonging to the victim on your front porch. Where were you last night around midnight? - I was in jail. I just got out. - That'll be easy enough to check. Sir, about that shirt I'm gonna have to insist. All right. Fine. Whatever. Well, had one cause I had to go to prison. - There we are. - Now I'm one of you. Are you happy? Take it you're a nudist. I prefer naturist. You know, social nudity has been around for hundreds - of years, gentlemen. Get used to it. - XYZ! There's absolutely no biological necessity for clothing. It's a construct. It's a man-made artifice. XYZ. XYZ. XYZ. - Sorry I don't know what that means. - Examine your zipper. Maybe you should examine your attitude. Sir, do you mind taking a look and see if you recognize her? You know, when I first pulled up, I thought Peter Magneri sent you. Peter Magneri? - Magneri Computers Peter Magneri? - Yeah, he lives up there. He's been hassling me for years. That guy owes me 200 bucks. Mr. Monk, what are you doing? You'll go blind. I know, But when? Mr. Magneri I just need you to look at one photograph for our investigation. I appreciate your seeing us. I understand your time is valuable. Actually, a reporter worked it out. I'm worth $300,025 a minute. Well, then we'll make it quick. - Do you recognize this girl? - Never seen her. - You didn't even look at her. - Where's my coffee? You've already had four cups, sir. And your wife said - Do I need a doctor's note? - No, sir. I got a clean bill of health from St. Andrews less than three weeks ago. They checked me over, head-to-toe. MRIs, X-rays, blood tests. Do you know what, I'm going to bury the lot of you. Coffee, coffee, coffee now. She was murdered last night on your beach. Oh, not my beach. It should be my beach, but it's not my beach. Don't even get me started on that. I didn't actually pay for this, did I? No, sir, that's a thank-you note from the children at Lincoln Elementary. You donated some computers. The zoning commission meets on Wednesdays. You want to come? Sir, where were you last night about midnight? I was here. I'm always here. I was working late. Did you see anyone or hear anything? As a matter of fact, a woman tried to get in last night. - She kept on ringing the buzzer. - Who was she? How should I know? Did she say anything? Yes. Something about a matter of life and death. - And you didn't let her in. - What, are you crazy? Everybody wants a piece of me. Everybody's problem's a matter of life and death. Yeah, I know. Happens to us all the time. Everybody wants something. Listen, while we are here, when I press play, why does it keep sending me back to the menu? I have no idea. Call customer service. No, no, no. Ha ha. They kept me on hold for an hour and a half. Look, my warranty just expired. - If you could take a quick look at it.. - Lieutenant! Holster your MP3. That's an order. Is there a security camera by the gate? - Yeah, but it's broken. - That's a big surprise. Look at him, out there in public. Mr. Monk, it's a nude beach! It's repugnant. That's the word. - Repugnant. - Degenerate. That's the other word. Degenerate! Don't you think that's a little bit harsh? Being polite. Where was he last night? Exactly. We already spoke to Mr. Singer. Yeah, well, speak to him again. Oh, he likes to pretend he's all peaceful and new age-y, but believe you me, there's a dark side. I believe it. I can tell. Even from here. He threatened me once at a zoning meeting. Hit me with a microphone. He's a nudist! That's what they do. They they hit people with microphones. Captain. He's the guy. He says he was here all night. - We're going to talk to his staff. - Not him. Thenudist. Singer? I already called, Monk. His alibi checks out. He was in a lockup all night. I don't know how he did it but he's the guy. I still can't believe it. She was more than my roommate. She was my best friend. I'm so sorry. How long did you know her? Three years. We met at a bar downtown. She was waitressing, and I was working across the street at the hospital. I used to be a lab technician. - Used to be? - I quit about two weeks ago to play the market. Day trader? - Good for you. - Well, we'll see. - Ask me again in a few months. - Sand. That must be Vickie. She'd been going to the beach a lot. - To meeting a nudist? - A nudist? Was she seeing anyone in particular? Uh, I think so. - She'd been hinting about a guy - Was he a nudist? Let me put it another way. Was he always naked? Mr. Monk, you're not letting her talk. I don't know. I think she might have been meeting him last night. - That's him. I knew it. - You don't know his name. - We all know his name. - Can I talk to you? Excuse us. Come here. What are we doing here? We should be getting a search warrant. We gotta get back to the beach. Get into his trailer. Would you relax? I have never seen you like this. We're wasting our time. It's the nudist. - We both know it. - I don't know that, Monk. Look, maybe you're right. You usually are. But I have to do my job here. I need to dot every I and cross all the Ts. You can appreciate that. You don't want any uncrossed Ts, do you? Just sticking up. - Some crossed. Some of 'em not crossed. - Hello. With different angles. That would be anarchy,wouldn't it? - Yes. - And we don't want that, do we? No. Sweetheart, I can't leave just now. Mr. Monk isn't feeling very well. He saw a naked man today. I knew you'd understand. So I'll be there at 4:30. I just need to get the address. - Scuse me. May I use this? - Sure. Go ahead, sweetie. CDs, huh? I've gone digital. Over 5,000 songs in here. - Of course, I can't play any of them. - Okay. Where were we? - We were talking about the nudist. - No we weren't. Randy check your notes. - Where were we? - Uh, right. Um, did, uh, Vickie have any other There it is. What? No, no, no. No, no, no. Scuse me. Okay. Did Vickie have any other boyfriends that we need to know about? Wait, Mr. Monk. I don't think we should do this. You got a better idea? Yes. Not doing it. Door was open. Must've been the wind. Don't we need a search warrant? What about the guy's rights? All your little rules. All your little laws. They don't apply down here. It's nudie town. It's a petition to keep beach clothing optional. Oh yeah. That could give somebody a nasty paper cut. There's a knife missing. It's right here. He was making a sandwich. Oh, this guy's good. He's one step ahead of us. Hello. - What? What? What? - Skinless chicken. Seedless grapes. - You see how it's all fitting together? - No. Look sugar in the raw. Mr. Monk, you're scaring me. I've never seen you like this. It's like you want this man to be guilty. Mr. Monk, there's something that I have to tell you. When I was an exchange student in Greece Oh. Someone's coming! The nudists. It's the nudists. The nudists are back. The closet! No! There's no room! Oh yeah. No clothes. Okay, I'll get the light here. Do you have anything to drink? Oh yeah, sure, in the fridge. Anything you want. The water's potable. Oh, cool. So who was she, the girl who was killed? You know, I just know what I read in the paper. She was a waitress from Mission Hill. Right, and they think that you're actually involved - in this somehow. - I'm not surprised. They're always looking for a reason to kick me out of here. What was she doing? You know, I don't know. I get kids coming down here every night. Maybe she was looking to score some drugs or meet a dealer. Can we talk about something else? All this murder talk's really bringing me down. - It's sad. - All right. To business. Okay. So Jenny, can you take some notes? - Sure. - Okay, yeah. - Anybody got a pen? - Do I have a pen? - Definitely not. - Whoops. Scuse me. Sorry. I got one! - Oh, cool. Whoops. - Oh, I'm sorry. It rolled down that way. - Under here? - Yeah, right behind you. I think you just kicked it behind you, man. I don't see it. Maybe under the fridge under the fridge? - Check under there. - Where? I'm getting tired of this. Just get a new pen - If I get lower, - I can see more. - I don't. - That's weird. - Right by there. Bend over. - This is getting tiring. Wait a second. Wait a second. Isn't that it right there? Move your foot. Move your foot. - The other foot. No, Chance's foot. - Where? There it is. I see it. Wait a sec there. Yeah, it's right there. It's right under there. We're good to go. - Very good. - Nice grasp. Sorry about that, guys. Slid all the way down there. - That's crazy. - Okay, so item number one. Zoning board meets tomorrow. Marin County Court House. 10:00 am. This is it, people. The Super Bowl. What's the use? Peter Magneri's gonna buy their votes anyway. Hey, no negative thoughts. Come on. We have to share. It's our beach. - Nobody can take it from us, right? - No. Okay, so we have to rember the petion and copies of the survey. And also here's the thing we have to go textile. - It's just for one day - and we don't want to do anything to offend these people. Plus, I think it's illegal. Forget it. I don't have anything to wear. Literally. Huh. You know, I have an old suit in the closet. You wanna try it on? - You don't want - Suit? What about the principle of the matter? I'm with you, but still, I don't give a rest of it. Just take my hand! Mr. Monk, where are you going? It doesn't matter. Just keep running! - My friends are going to worry about me - What friends are you talking about? Let go of my hand now. Where's your warrant? Where are your trousers? Why don't you just leave us alone? We're just trying to live our lives. So was Vickie Deline. I know you were seeing her, Singer. Her roommate told me. - Her roommate. - What happened? She didn't want to join your little cult? She tried to run. You grabbed the knife. - I did not know the girl. Liar! - I never met her! - Will you get out of my face, please? - No, no. No, I know that trick. I step back, I see the whole schmegge. - Mr. Monk, are you okay? - Your friend here is psychotic! We both know you did this. Pervert! - Mr. Monk! - How? Tell me that! I was in prison all night! There are 20 witnesses. Check it out. Don't think I won't. Natalie, let's go. He was here all night. Yeah, booked at 7:30 p. m. and released at 8:00 a. m. the next morning. It was definitely him? Positive ID. You want to see the fingerprints? - What was he in for? - Public nuisance. He was collecting petions at a strip mall. Strip mall. Doesn't mean anything. That's what they're called. Well, he got out. - Somehow, he got out. - And back in again. Without the guards noticing. Excuse me. Where did you get that? From the guard. How about this? The guard gives Singer an apple. Singer chews the apple core into the shape of a key. He fashions a rudimentary kiln using that light bulb and a sardine can. He hardens the apple core in his kiln, and uses it to pick the lock. Thank you. An apple core key. No? Okay. Okay. He slipped through the bars and out the bathroom window. How? He wiggled through. He's a nudist. They're all double-jointed. - They are? - Randy. Don't be so naive. They're not like us. I- I have a theory. I- I think I think they secrete a fluid. Like an oil. It's odorless, but I can smell it. It makes them all slippery. They can wiggle through anything. They're like slugs. Monk, nobody wiggled through anything. There was a guard on duty all night. Then he's in on it too. He's one of them. Well, what about the 20 cops that are outside? They're all in on it! Don't you see? It's a cabal. - What? - A cabal. It's a secret society. Sometimes they're naked. Sometimes they go around dressed to confuse us. Well, they're certainly doing that. Have you read their literature? I have. They want to convert us all. And they won't stop until we're all like them, on beaches, in parks, hanging out everything hanging out. Hanging and hanging. Captain, there's only one way to deal with them. We gotta ship them back. Ship them back where, Monk? Exactly. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Look, I don't know what happened on that beach Monday night. I do not know who killed that girl. - Actually, - I have another Let me finish. Don't you talk. This is not a conversation. This is an intervention. I'll tell you what I do know. Number one - it was not Chance Singer. - Captain! Chance Singer was in my jail all night long. Number two you are off this case. You You-you're defending them? Monk, this is San Francisco! There's a million weirdoes out there. Some of them are wearing clothes. Some of them are not. And yes, I am defending them. That's what this means. We defend them. I spend a lot of my time too much of my time trying to keep bigotry and racism out of this department. - I am not a bigot. - I don't know what else to call it. You wanna put this guy away for the rest of his life because he makes you uncomfortable. Look, you've always had issues. But this isn't just another quirk or phobia. Like, uh, your fear of clowns or round things. This is different. This is new. And weird. And ugly. First of all, I am not afraid of round things Monk, you're a great detective. Look at it like it's a mystery. There's something going on here. Something's going on inside of you. Figure it out. Detective. I don't wanna see you back here until you do. - This is this is not fair treatment. - How do people wear these things? - I feel like I'm suffocating. I know. - I'm chafing. Are you chafing? Hey, does anyone have any more of that powder? I need it. - Hey, there he is. - Here he comes, here he comes. - Peter It's Magneri. - Peter! Mr. Magneri. Channel 7 News. - How do you feel? - I feel great. I feel the Board of Supervisors will do the right thing. They understand that I'm just a taxpayer. All I want is a front lawn of my own where I can relax and play with my kids. The problem is, Mr. Magneri, Barr Beach is not for sale. It belongs to the people of San Francisco. Mr. Singer, is that really you? I didn't recognize you with your clothes on. You look almost human. California has been blessed with 1,200 miles of coastline. Surely there's another beach somewhere where Mr. Singer and his freaky friends can throw their Frisbees. The real issue here is that I am a high-profile individual. I need my own beach for my privacy and my personal security. A young woman, as you may recall, was murdered on that beach only recently. And the police have been questioning Mr. Singer about that very incident. You can't say that. You can't just accuse people. I'm not accusing you, sir. Adrian Monk is accusing you. Mr. Monk happens to be the finest detective in San Francisco, and he has confided in me That Mr. Singer is his primary suspect. And you believed him? Adrian Monk is certifiable. He was in my house last night without a warrant, hiding in my closet. I was gonna press charges, but frankly, I feel sorry for him. I hope he gets the help he needs, I really do. There's something I never told you. Something happened when I was a boy. There was an incident. With a with a man. Who was that? I'd never seen him before. Stranger. How old were you? I don't remember. Young. I was so small. I remember I remember I was naked. Take your time. I was so naked. I just hated being naked. And I remember I was crying. And then he hit me. - Adrian, I'm so sorry. - There was blood. There was blood everywhere. I was screaming. I wanted him to stop. And my mother my mother was smiling. W- w-wait, your.. your mother was there? Why didn't she stop him? She was supposed to protect me. He kept hitting me. Swinging me around upside down, and Youwere upside down? Was he wearing a mask? I never wanted to be naked again. Adrian, that man was a doctor. You're rembering your own birth. Doctor doctor? Anybody else, I wouldn't have believed it. But you Doctor? Mm-hmm. Well, that would explain a lot, actually. The lights, and my father in the doorway holding a balloon. - You feel better? - Yes. I do. That only took 11 years. Hello! Sorry, the door was open. Natalie, listen. Monk, I'm so glad you're here. I was just about to call. Something happened. I was talking to Dr. Kroger. I remembered something. Mr. Monk. There's been something I've been trying to tell you. When I was 19 - Is this gonna be a long story? - Please let me finish. I was an exchange student in Greece. There was this beautiful beach that was about three blocks away that I went to all the time. - Great. - And this is the thing, Mr. Monk. Um It was a European beach. Which means - Topless - I don't care. I had a breakthrough. I was a nudist, Mr. Monk. I was one of them. I went back four years ago, so technically I guess I still am one. I was in the cabal. No, Natalie, forget that. I mean, maybe it means you can't work with me anymore, but I don't care. I'm not apologizing for it. I met the best people. It was the most amazing time of my life. Great. Natalie, listen. I am not that guy anymore. It's okay. I had an amazing session with Dr. Kroger. I went back. I went way back. Way, way, way, way, way back, back. Back, back, back, back, back. And I got past it. This whole naked thing. I understand it now. - Wow. - Yeah. And guess what I just did? I walked through Bishop Park. You know, the big statue? The nude statue of the nude woman? I looked right at it. Mr. Monk, the statue in Bishop Park is a man. Okay, I glanced at it. But I wasn't completely and totally repulsed. I didn't black out. And I didn't throw up! Wow. You know, there's a word for that. - Progress. - Progress, that's me. Only 312 other issues to go! take 'em one at a time. Let's start with dryer lint. Hey, I guess this means you owe Chance Singer an apology. Yeah, I guess I do. Maybe I'll bring him something. Like a bottle of wine or some overalls. What's this? What? Oh, a note. No, I mean this stationery. This is This is from Vickie's roommate. Piece of scrap paper. St. Andrews Medical Center. Radiology, Natalie. Radiology. My God. I think I know what happenned. - To what? - To the girl to Vickie. Not that I can think staight. I know who killed her. - Miss Boras. Good afternoon. - What are you doing? Searching your apartment. he yellow copy is for you and your lawyer. You worked at St. Andrews Hospital, is that right? You were an X-ray technician. - Did you ever meet Peter Magneri? - Who? Peter Magneri. He founded Magneri Computers. They make these. I thought yours broke. Yeah, I bought another one. Mr. Magneri had a checkup July 23rd. That's four days before you quit. I got a clean bill of health from St. Andrews three weeks ago. They checked me for everything, head to toe. We just spoke to the SEC. Apparently, since July, you've been very interested in the Magneri company, except you haven't been investing. You've been selling short. You've been betting against the company. - Randy. - Turn it off. I'm sorry. It won't stop. Here's what happened. Three weeks ago, Magneri went in for a checkup. You were the lab tech. You must have noticed something on his X- rays. Something serious. Something that could kill him. It was the ultimate piece of inside information. Literallyinside. Peter Magneri isMagneri Computers. You knew if anything happened to him, the stock would plummet. All you had to do was switch X-rays and put a different label on it. Magneri got a clean bill of health. Nobody knew how sick he really was, not him, not even his doctor. But you knew. You quit your job and started selling short, betting against the company. When Magneri died and the stock crashed, you'd make a small fortune. At some point, Vickie found out. Maybe you were looking for a partner. Maybe you were just bragging. But Vickie wasn't like you. She couldn't just sit back and do nothing and wait for another human being to die. She tried to warn Magneri. You knew you had to stop her by any means necessary. That night, Vickie told Magneri it was a matter of life or death. She was talking about him. His life or death. You chased her down. You killed her on the beach and you took back the X-ray. That's insane. You don't have any Proof? Mr. Monk found this. It was hidden behind your toilet. - Behind your toilet. - Got it. I don't know what she was thinking. I was even going to share the money with her. Tell that to Vickie's family. - You're under arrest. - You understand if anything happens to Magneri, anything that could've been prevented, it'll be two counts of murder. How bad is it? That spot? It's called an aortic aneurysm. He's a heart attack waiting to happen. Any excitement, any stress at all, could kill him. The uh the zoning board. What?! What kind of verdict is that? You're pathetic, all of you. Mr. Magneri, please sit down. The decision of the board is final. I will not sit down. This is a travesty! They don't even pay their taxes! Hello? Oh, thank God. Mr. Singer, it's Adrian Monk. Don't hang up. Oh, Monk, I don't want to talk to you right now. I'm in too good of a mood. We just won our case. Ugh, the hippies won. Is Peter Magneri still there? Yeah, why do you care? Chance, you've gotta trust me. It's a matter of life or death. What do you mean, life or death? Oh, put your clothes back on, you freaks! Oh, this isn't over. I'm gonna appeal this all the way to Sacramento! - We can't appeal. It's a - Shut up! You are so fired. Uh, Mr. Councilman, members of the board. I'd like to have your attention. Could I have everyone's attention? Uh the Naturist Beachfront Committee would like to withdraw its petion at this time. - What? - Are you crazy? Mr. Singer, the board has decided in your favor. We've granted your group the rights to that property in perpetuity. Well, we're giving it back. You know, we were talking about it, and and the beach is a little rocky for our tastes, a little tough on the feet. So we're gonna find another beach. Wait a minute, Singer. Is this a trick? No, my friend. This is no trick. You've won. The beach is yours. You've won. Breathe. Relax. That's good, sit. Let me adjust your chi. - What's going on? - Mr. Magneri. Sir, we need to get you to the hospital. - Hospital? - Trust me, sir. You're a very sick man. - I'll explain everything on the way. - He's right sir. I've seen your X-rays. We've got an ambulance waiting downstairs. - X- ray? - Hi. Remember me? Listen, I don't want to upset you or anything, but my MagnaPod died. No, I bought another one. It's the second one I've bought in 3 months. Randy, give it a rest. No, it's no big deal. You see, it just keeps getting stuck on ""menu. "" So, I mean, and my Walkman never did that. Well, get yourself another Walkman! Leave me alone. No, no, it's no big deal. Here, put it in here Randy, Randy, Randy! Randy, give me this. Give me this. You're right, it's broken. - hello! - Hi Hi - You're moving? - Oh, yeah. Moving on up. Peter Magneri bought us our own island down the coast. It's the least he could do. You saved his life. Oh, well, yeah, sure. I'm his neighbor. That's what neighbors do, right? - Mr. Monk? - Yeah, look at that cloud. What does that cloud look like to you? - What cloud? - Oh, there's a cloud. - Way up there. - You guys talk. I'm gonna keep looking at it for a while. Well, hey if you're ever in, uh, San Diego, give us a call. You won't have to - crouch in the closet this time. - Okay. I'd love to. But I promised Mr. Monk I wouldn't be visiting any nude beaches until five years after he's dead. Mr. Monk, wasn't there something you wanted to say? Uh, yeah. Chance I'm sorry for hating you and accusing you of murder, and I've learned a lot, and I'm a better person. Hey, you know we're all just caught here on this crazy, big blue marble doing the best we can. Am I right? Yeah, right. Right? Come here. Come here. Come here. He wants a hug. Come on. Come here. Little closer. Come on. Oh, yeah. Good. Good. Oh, yeah. You're a good hugger. You smell good. Real good. Good. Good. Thanks. - You want a wipe? - No, I'm good. Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk!"
"Hey, is the Captain around? He forgot to sign these. Yeah, he's in his office talking to Linda. Look who's here. Monk and Natalie just walked in. Hi guys! - Linda, hi! You look great. - Thanks, so do you. Is that your new place? As of last weekend. - I love those curtains. - Thanks. It's like a television and a telephone. Together? Brave new world, huh? I guess you can't call somebody in your underwear. - Sure you can. - Natalie, they would see you. We have a webcam date at 6:30 every night. It's the only chance I get to see her now that she's moved uptown. Well, don't worry, baby, you'll get to see plenty of me in Hawai'i. Look. Wait. See what I bought? Now, hold on. For the full effect - I love it. - Hawaii. Yeah. Yeah, we're leaving Friday. I haven't had a vacation in over 10 years. - Oh, so jealous. Where are you staying? - On Kauai. And look, it's the North Shore right there. And we may never come home. You're gonna have so much fun. I am counting the minutes. And, is that the correct time? It's 7:00. I gotta go. I've got a closing tomorrow, so I have to crunch some numbers. What happened to Sean? Well, uh, he's up in Marin County, showing a house. Better him than me, right? So I love you, and I will see you tomorrow! - Bye, all. - Bye. Good-bye! I love you too. Good-bye. I mean, aloha. You're a lucky man. So Sean is her partner? Yeah, yeah, they've been together for 17 years. Oh, God, that's longer than most marriages. Longer than mine. - Hi, you must be Richard. - Richard Young. My wife, Carol. Hi, Sean Corcoran. Fusco Realty. Come on in. Sorry we're late. We got a little lost. No problem, I was just returning some phone calls. The owners are out of town. So we can take our time. I love the foyer. All original mahogany. And the fixtures are all custom made. Shall we start upstairs? Could you hold on? Just a Leland, what are you doing here? I'm taking you out to breakfast. Charlie! Charlie, take a break. Well, what is going on? Well, this tree was dead. If it fell down, it would take out half your roof, so I called a buddy of mine at the Parks Department. You are really a full-service boyfriend, aren't you? What's he doing? Some idiot parked in front of your fire hydrant, so I made a phone call. You know, I think you worry a little too much. It's my job to worry about you. That's sweet. Sorry. Linda Fusco. Yes? What? Oh, my God. When? No, I understand. Thank you. - Sweetie, what's wrong? - t's Sean. He was killed last night. In the house that he was showing. He was murdered. Sweetie, I'm sorry. That's Marin County, right? I know some guys up there. We'll work this together. No, no, no, Leland. Don't leave me. Okay. Don't worry, I'm here. I'm here. It's okay. Help you? Yes, I am Natalie Teeger, and this is Adrian Monk. Ah, yeah, yeah, I talked to Leland Stottlemeyer. He said you'd be dropping by. Guess he didn't think our little department could handle - a grown-up homicide, huh? - No no. Not the whole department. It's just one guy. Stottlemeyer worked with a guy from here 20 years ago in Malibu. Apparently, the guy was a real What was the word? - Hammerhead. - Hammerhead. That's the word, like: Just one guy. No, no. Not no, did I say not Malibu. - No, it wasn't you. - It wasn't you. Yeah he never actually said who.. Never. But, uh, it wasn't you. Who are you? What is your name? - Hendrix. - Hendrix. Nah, definitely wasn't you. Yeah, that was the guy he said it wasn't. All right, all right. You can come in, but not one word. Do you understand? Observer status only. Keep your mouth shut. Mr. and Mrs. Young? Just a couple more questions, if you don't mind. You said the killer was 5'7"", right? He was hiding in the bathroom, and he came out and he shot Sean Corcoran. - Then what? - He just stood there. For a couple seconds. Then we just ran away. He could've killed us. I don't know why he didn't. - Did he say anything? - Excuse me? I've been thinking about it I think it might've been a woman. Why do you say that? The lips. They were sort of a coral peach. Lipstick? I'm a buyer for a cosmetics company. It's a pretty unusual shade. I think Runway makes one. I love Runway. - It's so expensive. I can't afford it. - Why not? Oh, yeah. It was her. She said something. I was just answering her. It wasn't you. Lieutenant. - We found the point of entry. - Excuse me. Okay. All right. Well Simple as pie, huh? He, or, she breaks the glass, reaches in, throws the lock, opens the door. - Permission to speak. - Permission denied. - Permission denied? - Permission to speak anyway. Just say one thing real quick, and then I'll shut up. These shards of glass they're still intact. If she came in this way, she would've stepped on them. So at least some of them would be cracked. Or maybe she stepped over 'em, right? Like this. Right? That makes sense, doesn't it? Maybe. Or she had a key. I still can't believe it. I feel like crying, but I can't. Is that normal? - Anything you feel is normal. - It's just such a shock. It is so heartbreaking. I just talked to Keri that's Sean's wife. She's devastated. Well, we all are. They really think that it was a woman? Well, they're not sure. Who else had a key to that house? Well, let's see The homeowners, obviously, and probably some relatives. Maybe some household help. Anybody here? Your sales staff? Yeah, there was a lock box on the front door. Uh, yeah, that's true. Any one of the agents ould've gotten in, but it could not have been anyone here. We are a family. - Did Sean have any enemies? - No. Wait. There was one client. A woman? Her name was Hubbert. Helen Hubbert. Sean sold her a property last year, and she had been writing him letters. And it was pretty nasty stuff. I think the letters are in his office. Is this a picture of you with your father? My grandfather. It's him just before he died. Sean's office is this way. Was he leaving? Well, it's no secret that he was starting his own company. That happens all the time. Yes. Here it is. Helen Hubbert. I met her at a closing once. She didn't seem dangerous. Maybe a little tightly wound, but - I guess you can never tell. - No. You can't. Well, if you will excuse me. I am going to go home and have a nervous breakdown. You okay? - What is it? - I'm afraid to say it out loud. She knows how to use a shotgun. She had a motive. You saw those boxes. He was taking a lot of their clients with him. - Wait, are you talking about Linda? - Shh! Natalie she's the same height as the killer, she had a key to the house. Mr. Monk, that's the captain's girlfriend. I- I don't believe it. I mean, it could all just be a coincidence, right? I found it in her purse. Coral Peach by Runway. Great, thank you. Yeah, I'll see you there. Aloha to you too. I just booked the second best ukulele band in San Francisco. I'm, uh, throwing the captain and Linda a little going away party. It's a luau. - Grass skirts, limbo dancing. - They're still going? Yeah, they pushed it back a week, until after the funeral, but they're still gonna go. The captain says Linda needs it now more than ever. - You know, plus any excuse for a luau. - Is he here? No. He took Linda to lunch. Can I get him on his cell? No, no. Actually, we wanted to talk to you. It's kind of important. Randy, what we're about to tell you is absolutely confidential. You can't repeat it to anyone. Are you in love with me? What? No! I think Linda Fusco might have killed her partner. What? I don't believe that. There's no way, Monk. - Am I in love with you? - No, it's Linda. We know her. - Do we? - Yeah. Besides, it it's impossible. I mean, she was talking to the Captain that night on the webcam from her house. I mean, Monk, you were there. I know, but let's just Okay, what? It was about at 7:00? Right? And she was definitely here in Richmond at 7:00. The guy was killed when? Okay, he was killed at 7:20 here in Novato hmm - It's, like, 30 miles. - 32.2. Okay, 32.2 miles in 20 minutes? There's no way. That's 100 miles an hour through traffic. It's just not possible. Maybe she had a jetpack. Like in those James Bond movies. Yeah, well, there's no such thing as a working jet pack. Don't ask me how I know. Randy, do you have any ideas? I mean, anything at all. One of your crazy theories? My crazy theories. - Like what? - Like me being in love with you? You think that's crazier than Linda Fusco flying across San Francisco in a jet pack? Too close to call. Well, here they come. Ask her for yourself. False alarm. I heard a motorcycle. I thought it was them. I thought the captain sold his motorcycle. Yeah, he did. Linda has one too. Pretty sweet, huh? Where did you get that? From a biker friend of mine. I did him a favor once. - What kind of favor? - You really wanna know? Okay, so I just how exactly Mr. Monk, why don't you just wait here? I can do this. No! No, no, no. When I talk to Leland, I I have to tell him that I checked it out myself. Okay, then let's do it. Yeah, I don't think so. Brand-new, straight from the factory, nobody's even worn it. Mr. Monk, if you don't put it on, bugs are going to fly into your mouth. - Can't you just avoid them? - I can't avoid the bugs. Sure you can. You see a bug. Zigzag. See another bug. Zig. Zag. If you don't put it on, we're not going. What's so funny? Nothing, sorry. I was just thinking about something else. You look great. Here you go. Hop on. Would you stop stop laughing. Would you, please? All right. - Born to be mild. - That's funny. Yeah, yeah, instead of wild, then you said mild. That's that's hilarious. Okay, we're here at Linda's house. She had 20 minutes to get there, so you're really gonna have to haul bottom. Haul bottom? It's biker talk. It just means don't stop for anything. - All right? - Got it. All right, hold on. - To what? - To me. I'm I I'm okay. Mr. Monk, you're gonna fall off the seat. I know what I'm doing, okay? I'll just lean forward. It's called weight displacement. We're wasting valuable time. Let's do it. Ready. And go! Are you all right? Wipes! Wipes. Well? - Could she have done it? - Done what? Mr. Monk, check the stopwatch! An hour and five minutes. - Not even close. - So just remind me. The captain's girlfriend. She couldn't have done it. We proved it. Right! Linda. Thank God. She couldn't have done it. Oh, what a relief. She didn't do it. Natalie, I have never been happier to be wrong. Captain! Hey, what are you guys doing here? Oh, we're waiting for you. You got a minute? Not really, I'm supposed to meet Linda in five minutes ago. She's still working through what happened. I hate to leave her alone. Yeah, we have some news, some good news. Yeah. We have good news. We think we know who killed Sean Corcoran. That's great. That was fast. Yeah. This individual has a motive - Good. Motive is good. - Owns a shotgun, and had access to the house. Well, let's pick him up. What's his name? Monk, the suspect has a name, right? And what is that name? Linda. Linda Fusco. That's hilarious. You got me. That's good. Ha! That's rich. - See you guys ma~ana. - Captain? He's not joking. He never jokes. That's true. She's the guy. No, no wait. She She was at home. We talked to her. - She was 30 miles away from the thing. - Captain, she made a point of mentioning the time. It was 7:00, rember? We were her alibi. How? - I don't know how. But she's the guy. - Captain - we found this at the scene. - Hibiscus. Linda was putting a flower just like it in her hair the night Sean Corcoran was killed. A lot of people I can't believe we're having this discussion. - I can't either. - What about the lunatic? The, uh, the client that wrote those letters? - Have you even looked at her? - Captain, this isn't easy for me. Oh, really? What is? You're talking about the woman I love, Monk. I know. I know. I think I know what's going on here. You look at me, and you can't stand it. I have what you want. A badge, a woman, a life. - That's true. - But But nothing! This is not my problem, Monk. This is your problem. You deal with it. All right, look. Why don't we Why don't we talk to a neutral party? We could call the Marin County D.A I am done talking! I am done talking. But I'm gonna do you a favor, Monk. For old time's sake. I'm gonna forget that you said anything. This never happened. Okay? Now, if you'll excuse me, my girlfriend is very upset. Her partner has just been murdered. You don't mind if we record this, right? It's your party. For the record, your name is Helen Hubbert. You teach physical education at Edge Park Middle School. So you must be in pretty good shape. - I guess. - How tall are you, Ms. Hubbert? - 5'8"". - 5'8"". I understand you bought a house from Sean Corcoran last year is that correct? You're asking about those letters I sent. I meant every damn word. That man lied to me. The roof leaks, the furnace is crap, and I've got carpenter ants in both bathrooms. Sounds like you have very strong feelings about Mr. Corcoran. I hated his guts. - I'm sorry about what happened, but - You hate his guts. You hate his guts. I notice you're wearing lipstick. Do you wear lipstick every day? Is that a crime now? No, ma'am, no. A lot of women wear lipstick. Doesn't mean anything. Anything at all. Where were ya Friday night around 7:30? - Friday night? - Yeah. I was sick. I came home and took a sleeping pill. That was about 5:00. So, uh you didn't see anybody, - you didn't talk to anybody? - No. I live alone. I just went to sleep. So you don't have an alibi for Friday night, do you? I guess not. Do I need one? When we spoke on the phone, you said your father was a locksmith. - That's right. - And you used to work in his store. A couple of summers in high school. So you could pick a lock. If I had to, I guess. Excuse me. Could you fix the blinds, please? I don't feel like it. I wasn't talking to you. Ma'am? I'm gonna need you to fix the blinds at this time. Who is that? I'm with the FBI. In Washington. - Stop it. - D.C. Watching you on my computer. - Screen. - Don't listen to him, ma'am. He is not Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to fix the blind. And while you're at it, pick up the Styrofoam pieces - scattered about the room. - He is not a federal agent. - Yes, he I am. - No, he's not. He's an ex-cop who hates himself and hates his life and isn't happy unless everybody else is as miserable as he is! I'm sure you wouldn't want us to inform the school board about your little drinking problem. - What? I mean, how - How? How? We're the FBI, that's how! God's sakes, he can see the flask in your pocket. And Ms. Hubbert, I'm sure you wouldn't want the IRS to know about your 2nd job. You've been moonlighting as a waitress, haven't you? Have you been reporting all of your tips? He's looking inside your purse. He can see your wad of singles. Agent Nat Lee? Here, Here, what do you think of that? Leland, you can put this woman away for the rest of her life. Linda Fusco will still be guilty. Hey, how'd the interrogation go? I got a roast pig for the party. That's big for a pig. Did you tell the Captain your theory about Linda? Yes. We did. - How'd that go over? - Leland It's not Linda. She was 30 miles away. It was this woman we're holding, Helen Hubbert. Weren't you listening? She has no alibi! Then it can't be her. - What the hell are you talking about? - Think about it. That night, the killer was hiding in the bathroom. She could've shot Corcoran any time. But she didn't. She waited. Why? She need a witness. I don't have to listen to this. Yes, you do! You're a cop. You're the best cop I know. Leland, the killer need a witness to confirm the exact time of the murder. Why? There's only one possible reason. The killer had an airtight alibi for 7:20. Now, wa Because Helen Hubbert does not have an alibi, it means it couldn't be her? That's right. - Her not having an alibi clears her? - That's right. It's the best alibi of all. I am so glad we're not talking. I'm 51 years old. She's the last chance I have. She's the guy. So this is it. All new hardwood floors, brand-new appliances. And the closets are great. It's it's so it's so homey. - And how much is it? - Uh, it's 2,200. Well, you are paying for the neighborhood, and and for the schools, of course. - Of course. - Will you excuse me? Oh, hi, honey. Yeah, back in the saddle. I'm showing Natalie an apartment. No, no, just Natalie. He what? You can't be serious. Can I call you back? - Is everything okay? - Yes. I'm I'm fine. Hey, where's Adrian? I thought you two were always together. Oh, you know, he does something every Wednesday. It's Thursday. And Thursday. You know Mr. Monk. He can't just do something he has to go back the next day - and just check his work. - Right. I'm sorry, I forgot I'm showing an apartment to someone else downstairs, so - I'll be right back. - Okay. Thanks, Linda. What are you doing? I could have you arrested. But you won't. You don't have to snoop around Mr. Monk. If you want to ask me a question, you could just call my office. Are you afraid of me? Oh, yeah. Where's the shotgun? - What shotgun are we talking about? - The one that was in there. You have a barrel cleaner and gun oil. My grandfather left me his 12-gauge when he died. And it was stolen. - Did you report it? - Of course I did. - It would be illegal not to. - Do you have a copy - of that report? - Of course I do. It's upstairs. In the bedroom. It's in here someplace. Is this where you talk to the captain? That's right. Leland told me that you're becoming obsessed with me. To tell you the truth, I'm a little flattered. I know about your wife. About what happened. You miss her. You are obviously in a lot of pain. And pain like that can make it difficult to think Well to think clearly. I wish there was something I could do to help. The report. Oh, I can't find it. I've misplaced it. I'm I'm very forgetful. Mm, no, you're not. What are you doing? - Negotiating. - Well, you're a bad girlfriend. Maybe. But I am a very good negotiator. I'm probably the best negotiator in Northern California. And I think that it's time that we close this deal. Leland is my friend! My best friend, my only friend, really. There was this guy last year Ke no Hal. Hal Tucker. You know, we went to a hockey game, but he's in prison now. I think he was using me. I'm pretty sure Well, what Leland doesn't know won't hurt him. That's not true. That is not true. This will kill him. Are you looking for something? Why don't you come on over here and search me? - Sorry, she must've figured it out! - Go, go, just go! Are you okay? What happened? Did she have a gun? No, no. Are my eyes bleeding? Natalie She did it. She definitely did it! And I know how she did it. Go! Just go! See? It's all in the hands. Every movement tells a story. This means palm tree. This is shark. Shark. Rain. Rain. Hey, Randy! What does this mean? Yeah, well, we all know what that means, Sergeant. How about this? What about this? Okay, you know what? That's not in the hula spirit at all. If Hawaii looks anything like this, I'm not getting off the plane. So how's the investigation going? So far, we've hit a dead end, but we'll catch a break. We always do. Say, this would look really cute on you. Have you talked to Monk? He's been leaving messages. I'll call him back when I calm down. Maybe next year. Well, it's just that, uh, something happened. Yesterday, when I came home, he was there. And he was crazy. He was accusing me of the most horrible things. I told him to leave you alone. I'll take care of it. I'll get a restraining order if I have to. he was touching me. And he said that he would set me up and frame me for the murder if I didn't sleep with him. Adrian Monk wanted to sleep with you? Is that so hard to believe? All right. Lower, lower, lower. All right, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Oh, Natalie, uh Sorry, Captain said that Monk isn't invited. I feel terrible. It's like a divorce. It's always the kids who get hurt. - Who are the kids? - Me and you. Well, Mr. Monk isn't here. It's just me. You don't have a problem with me, do you? No. No, keep going, keep going. Excuse me? Thank you I have a little surprise for the two of you. If you would just come with me for one minute. Come on, Captain. Come on. All right, everybody. Hello, can you see me? Yes, Mr. Monk, we can see you. Don't don't touch anything. No, Mr. Monk, it's fine. - Look, here I am. - Yeah, but don't don't touch it, it's fine. Okay, so, everybody's here. Including the captain. Yeah, and me. Hey, Monk! - Is that Randy? What are you wearing? - Police tape. - Where are you? - That's her bedroom. So it would appear Linda was playing some music, remember? You see? I told you. He was stalking me. Now, can't you do anything? Leland! Leland. I've been trying to call you all day. Something I have to show you. I know how she did it. Leland. Please, just get me out of here. Please, I can't take this anymore. Let's just go. Right now. Let's just go to the airport. - We've got reservations. - Oh, forget Hawaii. Let's just Let's just disappear. We can start over. Maybe South America. Maybe Venezuela. Listen Do you hear that? I think it's coming from down there. You can turn that off. - That's your bedroom. - It's not her bedroom. It's a replica. It's a duplicate. Here's what happened. You rented this truck under your maiden name and went to work. You duplicated everything. The furniture, the computer, the curtains, even the pictures. You must've been planning it for months. You began talking to the captain every night, from your bedroom at 6:30. Except for last Friday. Last Friday, you were talking from a parking lot a couple of blocks from that house in Novato, - from a robot uh, satellite. - Wireless internet. Whatever. That night, - you chatted - with the captain like you always did. You fooled him. You fooled me. You fooled everybody. At 7:00, you signed off and snuck into the house. You knew Sean Corcoran had an appointment there at 7:15. All you had to do was hide and wait. It worked. Except for the part about the truck getting towed. That was a tough break. When were you gonna go pick it up? The next time Leland left town? How did you know? - A pen? - The night we talked, you put the pen down on the table. I remember. It rolled a little. Yesterday in your bedroom, in your real bedroom, it didn't roll. It just stayed there. I couldn't figure it out. And then it hit me. On the night of the murder, your bedroom must've been on a slant. You parked on a hill. I parked on a hill. Leland Sorry. Yeah, me too. I did this for us. We had something. We had something real. We could've made it all the way. Randy? Here's what I can't figure. Was it a setup from the beginning, is that what it was all about? Did she figure a cop would make a better alibi or was it for real? Man, it sure felt like it was for real. I guess I'll never know. Sorry, did you say something? No. You know, I think it worked out okay. I mean, all things considered. But here's what I can't figure out, though. Did she really love you or was it a setup from the beginning? I mean, maybe she figured a cop would be the perfect alibi. Or maybe it was the real thing, and the plan came later. Something to think about, though, huh? Yup. Something to think about. What was that? That was nothing. It was just a rock."
"Hey. What are you doing here? You said the place was gonna be empty. Change of plans. I decided to help out. - You're the boss. - That's right; I'm the boss. Wait Did you wipe your feet? Yes, sir. I wiped 'em outside like you said. Good. Then let's do it. - Get started with these right here. - So, um How's this work? I mean, when do you call the insurance company? I won't be calling the insurance company. - What's that? - This? This is your gun, Dewey. My gun? This one's mine. This is the one I kill the intruder with. Intruder? Rob? What was that? Are you all right? I'm fine, ann. Everything's fine. Better come down. It sounded like a gun. - It was. - Oh, my God. Rob, is he dead? What did you do? He had a gun this one. No, wait. This one. Oh my God! You've got to help me. It's my wife She's been shot. It's eight fifteen. That's it, I'm officially late for school. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I can't just leave. This is my job. Well, what about Tim? It's not fair to him. Don't worry about me, ms. Teeger. I already finished all my homework And all of my classwork. I told you he was a genius. But what about me? This is my third tardy in two weeks. Ugh, all right, all right, all right. You're right. okay. One second. I'll take care of it. ""Dear Mr. Franklin, ""please excuse my daughter Julie and her boyfriend "" - Mom. - Sorry ""Friend, Tim Sussman. They are late to school today because as I was driving them my boss was called in to the scene of a double homicide. Thank you, natalie Teeger. All right, so if he has any questions just have him call me. I'm sure he will. - You're not wearing that t-shirt. - Why not? Because it's not appropriate honey. You're in high school now. I can't take it off. And I promised him I'd wear it every day. - For how long? - Til I die. You're gonna wear that t-shirt until you die? That's the plan. Did you know him? His name is Jordan. Dewey Jordan. Ring a bell? Did you ever kill anyone? Yes, I have. It's not like in the movies, is it? - Sorry about this. - About what? About calling you in on this one. Obviously pretty open and shut. Justifiable homicide. is it? Isn't it? When did you buy the gun? Five months ago. There were some break-ins down the street. It's a lucky thing you did because he would've killed you too. That's for sure. I don't feel lucky. All right, we id'd the bodies. A kid A punk named Dewey Jordan. He lives in Cole Valley. About 4:00 am, parks in the driveway right out front. Point of entry: side patio door. He parked in the driveway? That's kind of risky. - Probably figured he'd be in and out. - Maybe. The husband Robert Sherman and his wife pam, they're upstairs in bed. She wakes up, says she's cold. She comes downstairs to adjust the thermostat. - Thermostat. - Yeah, it's right over there. She confronts the intruder. He shoots her. One shot,.38 caliber. Husband hears the shot he grabs his gun. It's a 9-millimeter glock. - It's registered we already checked. - Where was the gun? Upstairs in a lockbox near the bed. So he comes running downstairs. The intruder fires, misses, hits the wall. Husband returns fire. Bang One shot. End of story. One shot. Bang End of Story. The soles of his shoes are clean. - So? - He cut through the garden out back. You think he wiped his feet? Well, it makes sense. He did want to leave footprints. But he did leave footprints on the patio. I saw them when I came in. Why would he wipe his feet? You wiped your feet. But I'm me. That doesn't count. Why would a kid A burglar Stop and wipe his feet? That doesn't make any sense. Hey, excuse me. Hello? yeah, you. Right, yeah. Did you wipe your feet? Did I Wipe your feet? It's a $23,000 rug. Yes, sir. I wiped them when I came in.. Ten times. I don't believe we've met. Rob Sherman, this is Adrian Monk. He's a consultant with us, and I can assure you that Mr. Monk's feet are clean. In fact, you could probably eat off them. It's nothing personal. It's just It was my wife's favorite rug. I understand. - Sorry for your loss. - I guess it, uh - Hasn't completely sunk in. - It will. It'll sink in. Completely. Do you mind if I check upstairs? how's it going? Somebody unplugged the phone. He kept the gun in here? yeah, Is this how you found it? Yeah, we locked the place down. He heard his wife screaming. - Opened the box, he grabbed the gun. - Yeah, that's what the man said. The box is closed, latched. If I heard my wife screaming, I wouldn't stop and close the box. Would you? Oh, I'm not married. Her slippers. According to the husband, she went downstairs because she was cold. If she was cold, why didn't she put on her slippers? That's a good question. Yeah You'll get the next one. What are you doing? We're supposed to wait by the car. It's the final dive. It's all up to Sussman. You line your feet up. You visualize the dive. And That was perfect. Excuse me. This is private property here, okay? Shouldn't you guys be in school? We're with my mom. Natalie Teeger. - She's here with Mr. Monk. - Yeah, she just went in to get him. And you are? I'm I'm nobody. His name is Tim. He's my boyfriend. Yeah, I can see that from the shirt. So where were you guys Some amusement park? Um, yeah, the bay city pier. He works there. Guess there's no such thing as dress codes anymore, huh? Mr. Sherman. We appreciate your patience. You can have your house back now. Do you have any family? Is there somebody that you can call? I'll be fine. Thank you. So what happens now? Well, the d. A. Will file a report. And I don't think have anything to worry about. Kid broke into your house. You had every right to defend yourself. I'm not supposed to say this, but I would've done the same thing. In fact, I would've emptied my gun into the creep. Why didn't you? - Why didn't I what? - Empty your gun. You only fired once. I would think in the heat of the moment. That's all I needed one shot. That's all he need. I guess that's it. Thank you very much. Mr. Monk. - What do you think? - I think he's the man. I don't think he's the man. I think he's the guy. Okay, let's do it again from the top. Husband, Robert Sherman. Owns expensive rug. Intruders shoes indicate that he wiped his feet. why would a kid breaking and entering wipe his feet? Because he wasn't breaking and entering. They knew each other. It was a setup. - Maybe - Maybe the kid The intruder Was planning on stealing the rug and he didn't want to scuff it up. - Thank you. - Any time. Maybe he was planning on stealing the rug. All right, how about this one? The phone in the bedroom was unplugged. That doesn't mean anything. I unplug my phone all the time If I want to sleep late or if I'm working. She's right. Doesn't mean anything. Well, here's another one. The wife's slippers. The husband said she was cold. That's why she went downstairs. Why wouldn't she put on her slippers? She wasn't really cold. She was just saying she was cold. She went downstairs to get a bite of that chocolate cake in the refrigerator. What chocolate cake? Who are you? This is rita depask, aka the lovely rita. She's a material witness in a knife fight downtown. Allegedknife fight. Alleged. I love that word. The lovely rita has a point, amazingly enough. Any hotshot lawyer could explain away that entire notebook. That's true, that's true. But if you add it all up, if you look at the big picture. I mean, it's plain as day. He's the guy. - Was the wife insured? - No. So where's your motive? Wake up! You got two people living under the same roof. One of them wants the other one dead. Believe me, I know. Yeah, he didn't love her. I was there when the m. E. Wheeled out the wife. All he was thinking about was the rug. You're cute. - No, I'm not. - You ever unbutton that top button? Nah, not No. There is one problem with your theory. They never met. We checked their records. The bank records, their phone records. We talked to their friends. There is no connection between Rob Sherman and Dewey Jordan. I know I've seen them together. - Where? - I don't know where! somewhere. It's driving me crazy. Well, they lived in different worlds. Here's Dewey Jordan's rap sheet. bad checks, drugs, couple of burglaries. And in sharp contrast, here is Mr. Sherman's jacket. One arrest. One in his entire life. Driving with a suspended license. Wait, wait, wait - There is a connection. - Hey, we did it! You'll mention this to the D.A., right? Fine, okay. Oh, my God! It's Clay Bridges. - Like he even knows who we are. - Julie, he's so cute! Is he looking at us? Oh, my God. - What's he doing? - He's coming over here. You're Julie Teeger, right? I'm Lisa. Hi. I've seen you around. - You have? - Yeah. I'm Clay. We know You had a great game last Saturday. Thanks. You're in honors spanish, right? I'm taking spanish one and I just I can't seem to get it. You know, some sort of mental block or something. I was thinking, um, maybe you could tutor me? Um, well, actually, I'm getting ab. But I could recommend somebody Oh, no, I'm asking you. Yes or no? Moment of truth. - Okay. Sure. - Cool. All right. Hang on. Who is that? My boyfriend Tim Sussman. Yeah, I know him. He's, he's in the band or something. The swim team. - I don't remember him. - He's a diver. Coach doesn't really use him very much. Towel boy, huh? This doesn't feel right. Meeting him here. What choice did we have? He wouldn't see me at his office, and he's not returning my phone calls. Yeah, I know, but this is his wife. Who he killed in cold blood. Don't forget that. Gosh. I remember when Mitch's father was cremated. We went to carolina and spread his ashes on the beach. I'm gonna be buried next to Trudy. I can't wait. I'm really missing Mitch lately. You know? He would know what to do with Julie. She started tutoring this older kid in spanish. - This senior A big football star. - Right. Just yesterday she was crawling around in diapers. And today I'm worried about some 17-year-old quarterback named Clay. - Right. - What did you do? Skinny, fat, skinny, fat. Skinny believe me; this is the way they would've wanted it. Yeah, but Mr. Monk No, what are you doing? The name tags are all mixed up. - Yeah, I know, but - No I know that this one - went over here. - No, this is her. - This one. - All right, I got it. No, I got it That's no good. I got it. - What are you doing? - Separating them. - What, you could tell? - I can tell More or less. Just don't sneeze. Somebody's coming. - What are you doing? - It's uneven. Mr. Monk, those are people! Maybe they weren't the same size. Well, they are now. Mr. Monk. - Hello! - Hello again. - What are you doing here? - Are you family? No, we are, uh We're with the police. Mr. Sherman, I'm sorry about this. I've been trying to call you all day. Yeah, so I've heard. You got a problem with me Mr. Monk? No Just a couple of questions. Part of the investigation. What investigation? I spoke with the district attorney. - He said the case was closed. - What happened here? The wind. - Just a draft. - Like a tunnel. Table's a little wobbly. You might want to put a matchbook. But we cleaned it up. - A draft? - It's no problem. You You told the police that you didn't know Dewey Jordan, the man - you killed you said you never met him. - That's right. But you were in traffic court four weeks ago, august 14th, 8:00 am, the vinton street courthouse. And this is Dewey's rap sheet. He was at a bail reduction hearing. Same courthouse. Same day, 8:00 am. Is that where you met him? Mr. Sherman. Is there a problem? No No, there's no problem. No problem at all. This is my, secretary, allison clark. Well, you're right, Mr. Monk. It appears that Mr. Jordan and I were in the same building. On the same day a few weeks before he was shot. And I don't believe in coincidence. No, neither do I. Maybe that's where he saw me. - Excuse me. - Maybe he saw me pull up in my bmw. Wearing this suit and this $5,000 rolex watch and that's where he decided to try and rob me. Now, that's possible. Isn't it? - I'm sorry; I couldn't hear you. - Yes, it's possible. Uh, we have to go. Is that her? That's Mostly her. Anything else, Mr. Monk? I didn't think so. Megu Me gusta mi hermano. No,mi hermana, remember? Feminine words end in ""a. "" it's easy. No Screen passes are easy. This is hard. Okay, and masculine words end in ""o. "" likemi amigo. I hope so. I was actually hoping we could be more thanamigos. Honey, it's 10:30. Didn't you say you wanted to get to bed early? No No, I didn't. Well, it's probably a good idea. You have a big day tomorrow. Clay, see you maniana. What? - Tomorrow. - I guess that's my cue. I'll see you around. Hey, you've got study hall second period, right? Yeah, how'd you know that? Well, quarterback has to see the whole field. - It's me. I just left her. - It's only 10:30. Her mom kicked me out, but don't worry. It's going fine. She's hooked. I can tell. I just gotta reel her in. Well, reel her in quick. - Did he ask her out? - Not yet. Maybe tomorrow. Relax. She likes him. It's gonna happen. Just like you planned. I'm not saying no. I'm just saying that I have to think about it. When did he ask you? - Just now. Like, ten minutes ago. - I didn't hear the phone ring. It's called a text message. Welcome to the 21st century, mom. It's just one party. It's no big deal. Okay, then how would you get there. He would drive me. Clay is, like, the most popular uy in school, and he really likes me. And if you don't let me go, then I'm never gonna talk to you again. Sweetie, what are you doing? This is stuff Tim gave me. I'm getting rid of it. You're breaking up? We already did. When? - Just now! - I don't believe it. You don't, huh? Well, keep watching. Why? Tim was so great. Of course you liked him. Mothers love Tim. He's He's safe and he's polite.. And smart, and he's cute, and he's on the swim team. Great! Why don't you date him? Wait, what are you doing? Don't Don't do that. Come on, let's just talk about this. It's my life, mom. Yeah, I know it is, honey. Well, you don't act like it. And just rember, in four and a half months, I'm gonna be 16! What does that mean? How long did he live here? Ten months. I should've known he was gonna be trouble. Always late with the rent. Always coming and going. I mean, is it true what they're saying? He broke in and killed the guy's wife? I don't know. I don't think so. She'll be 16. Four and a half months. Stop torturing yourself. It doesn't mean anything. - You think so? - Of course. She's looking forward to her birthday. It's no big deal. - This is your daughter? - Yeah. What is it? This air vent - It's rusty. - So? The screws are brand new. Do you have a screwdriver? Mr. Monk, I just don't think you're getting it. He's a senior. He's like an adult. He invited her to a party on Saturday night. - There will be college kids there. - She'll be fine. There'll be a lot of other people around, right? No, I'm not worried about the party. I'm worried about after the party. Oh, God, Mitch. I miss you. Mr. Monk? Will you talk to her? - Me? - Please, I don't know who else to ask. There's no man in her life. What about him? Who, Mr. Morrissey? Kids respect landlords. I think it's the keys. What is it? It's a. 22. Why didn't he bring this gun? So he had another gun. But there's no ammo for a. 38 caliber. It's all for this gun. I don't think he had another gun. Mr. Monk, please. This is important to me. Julie loves you. You're like family You know that. Just I-can't I just can't. Why don't you ask the Captain or anybody else. When it comes to this particular issue, I'm probably the least qualified person in north america. That's what makes you perfect. You waited for Trudy. You were faithful. You respected her. You're a wonderful role model. In this particular case. Why don't you just give it a few weeks? See how it goes. I always find doing nothing and never mentioning it again is always the best policy. Mr. Monk, two weeks will be too late. Please, please talk to her. It's my daughter. My little girl. - Mr. Monk, are you still here? - Yeah, I just Do you have a minute? Sure. Um, Julie, your mother Is, uh, very worried about you. What's going on? She wanted me to talk to you about Certain things about life. And, uh And things She thought it might be helpful if you had someone you could talk to. I'm supposed to be giving you the big talk. Why? Because you're dating an older boy. No, I mean why you? That's what I said. See, Julie, the years between 14 and 32 are a very confusing time for a young girl. I really appreciate this. It'll just be a couple more minutes, okay? You know, you're body's changing. You're gonna start feeling things New things. And you're gonna wonder how to act and what to do. It might be best just to wait Until you meet the right person. Or you don't have to do anything, right? Until Until you're sure. You have any questions? no? Great, well, I'm-I'm-I'm glad we had this little talk. I can tell that it's been very helpful to you. We certainly had a positive, very, very productive talk. This is the end of the talk. Wait, Mr. Monk. How do you know if What you're feeling is real? - What are you doing? - No, I'm serious. When you met Trudy - How did you know? - Listen. This is not real. I'm not really here, okay? This is just for your mother. Don't cry. you can't cry. I can't leave if you're crying. What you're feeling is perfectly normal. What you're feeling is probably normal. It's just How did you know? Okay, look I used to wonder the same thing. When I met Trudy, I said, ""now I see. - Now I see why I'm here. "" - was it wonderful? Yeah. I loved falling in love with her. Every day, every morning, I fell in love with her again. I think what your mother has been trying to say is just don't worry. All your dreams will come true. They don't have to come true this weekend. Right? You can take your time. You can wait. Until I find Trudy. Just wait for Trudy. Believe in Trudy. Trudy will come. Now stop crying And let me out of here. Captain. Make yourself at home, randy. Door was open. - What's going on? - I think Monk was right. It looks like Rob Sherman and Dewey Jordan did meet at the courthouse. This is the security camera from the main lobby, august 14th, 8:00 a. M. I can't see anything. This is Rob Sherman; that's Dewey Jordan. Where? Right there. Here. Here and there. Randy, they're two blurs. Even for blurs, they're blurry. - Can you make it bigger? - It's already enhanced. Well, that could be anybody. That could be fred astaire and ginger rogers. But they're both dead. Ginger rogers is not dead. Yeah, I'm pretty sure she is dead. I'm sorry. Even if she wasn't, what would fred and ginger be doing in the courthouse? I'm not saying it is fred and ginger, I'm just saying that you can't tell who or what they are. Yeah, look Right There. See? He comes in, they shake hands. That is definitely Rob Sherman. Is that a permanent marker? No, it'll come off. I don't think so. Have you seen the new screens? Pretty beautiful. Flat. You're worse than Monk. Well, I just wanted to thank you again. Oh, I'm glad I could help. Be careful, I don't want them to get wrinkled. Oh, sorry. Well, Julie told me about how you talked about Trudy and how you met. She just said it was really, really sweet. So, thank you. - What lesen? - That's Clay! Is that Julie? What did you say to her? Excuse me. Ms. Teeger. Sorry Does Julie know about this? Who's Julie? This is not what you think. Or what you think. Somebody hired me to go out with her daughter. - You said get a job! - Somebody hired you? Your sister, karen. Aunt karen? She said she didn't like Julie's boyfriend so she paid me $500 to break them up. - Clay, I don't have a sister. - No, it's true. I can prove it. I still got the money. Most of it. Excuse me. Can I see that? Careful. This woman, this aunt karen What did she look like? Uh, pretty, long dark hair. With glasses? How'd you know? Natalie I know what's going on. Julie, the murder It's all connected. - Is this it? - The bay city pier. - Who are all these people? - I don't know, Mr. Monk. - Who's he? - I don't know, Mr. Monk. Is he bothering you? You want me to ask him to leave? You better not. He might get mad. The Captain will be here any minute. Maybe we should just wait here. Mrs. Teeger! Mrs. Teeger, what are you doing here? Hey, right here! Hey, you guys, what are you doing here? Is Julie here? No, we're here on a job. You might want to give her a call though, because I'm pretty sure she's gonna break up with Clay. - She is? Did she say that? - No, not yet. - Can I tell him? - I don't think you should. - I'm gonna tell him. - Why do you bother asking? Clay Bridges never liked Julie. Not really. - Somebody paid him to go out with her. - Somebody paid him? Who? He did. Mr. Sherman? What's he doing here? - He's not here to play skeeball. - I better follow him. Stay here and wait for the Captain. Julie's t-shirt? That's what this whole thing has been about. Her t-shirt? I don't understand. Tim, I've been waiting a long time to say this. Here's what happened. We know Dewey Jordan has been here. Mr. Monk noticed some game coupons in his apartment. Mr. Sherman and Dewey Jordan met a couple weeks ago at the courthouse. Sherman probably told Dewey he was pulling some kind of insurance scam but they had to meet again some place to work out the details. They met here at the pier. It was perfect Noisy, a big crowd, nobody would notice them. I don't understand. What does all this have to do with Julie? It was the same day you and Julie were here getting your picture taken. That's where Mr. Monk had seen them together. On Julie's t-shirt. They were in the background the whole time. That's why he was acting so weird that day we met him. When Mr. Sherman saw that t-shirt he knew he was in trouble. He saw Julie hanging out with Mr. Monk, the Captain, and randy. It was only a matter of time before somebody noticed it. I know, but why didn't he just try to steal it? Much too risky. Remember, he didn't have to destroy the shirt. He just wanted Julie to stop wearing it. So he had his girlfriend contact Clay. - She pretended to be Julie's aunt. - I get it. Julie breaks up with me and she never wears the shirt again. She's right, you are pretty smart. That's why we're here. The Captain's getting a search warrant. The photo booth keeps backup copies of all the pictures. Uh, copy Why do you need a copy? Where's the t-shirt? Julie burned it. She what? sorry. Guess you can't win them all, detective, huh? - Tim! - You okay? I got them. That's Julie boyfriend. He's on the swim team. Thanks, Tim! Back up disc. And I printed off a copy. Well, you and your friend take a very nice, very incriminating picture. I put it on a mug too. What for? I figured the jury would appreciate it. They're human, the get thirsty. Exhibit a, thank you very much. Mmm Guilty. How are you guys doing? I think we're okay. We were just listening to the news. You're a hero. I don't feel like a hero. - Well, you are. - Thanks, mrs. Teeger. Tim and I are gonna hang out here for a while. I mean, if that's okay. Sure, go ahead. have fun. Have fun. What What's that for? Our little talk. Wipe. - No. - Natalie. No, that one stays on. - For how long? - Maybe forever. - I can feel it. - Good. Come on, I'm not gonna wipe it off. I'm just gonna dab it. You."
"No, my mother was a wonderful cook. I can still remember coming downstairs. The aroma from the kitchen would just fill the Is that a new watch? Oh, yeah, it is. It was actually a gift. From your wife? It's not your anniversary. No, no, it's not from my wife. It's not from my wife. - It's from a patient? - Adrian, please, um - So we were talking about your mother. - Harold? Adrian, it's not important. Now, you were talking about your mother. So what, he just gives you gifts? I didn't know patients were allowed to do that. I'd be glad to give you something. - Adrian, it's really not necessary. - I've thought about it. I've thought about it. A lot. I have. I mean, I I wouldn't even be wherever it is I am without you, Dr. Kroger. - I mean, I'm grateful. - Adrian. - I'm very grateful. - Adrian. - Adrian. - I wish I could think of Adrian. Don't buy me anything. It's really not appropriate and it's very important, to me that you understand this. - Okay? - So what are you, about a 42 regular? I'm sorry. Um, your mother? Any meals in particular that you might, uh - You want to take that call? - No, no. It's just Troy, my son. It's a message from his school. He didn't show up again. - Maybe he's sick. - No, he's not sick. He's probably in some parking lot listening to trash metal music and skateboarding with his friends. You know, the truth is I'm at a loss here. I have been a therapist for 22 years. I I don't know what to do with him. Would you like me to talk to the boy? No. No, thank you. Yes, I'm gonna get this one. I'm gonna get it. Hit it this time. I wanna see some mad air, bro. I want to see you like this. - All right, here we go. - Mad air! That was bitchin. Dude, wicked. Are you good? Where's my board? - Oh, dude. - Yeah, um Hey, I'm really sorry about that, man. I didn't mean for it to hit - Whoa, are you okay? - Yo, I think he's dead. - What? - Excuse me. Hey, mister! Wake up! He is dead. What? - Yo, that's messed up, man. - Oh, check this out. West Bay Trust? I bet they're from that robbery. What robbery? It was all over the news, man. There was a big robbery yesterday. They got away with, like, $2 million. So where's the money? He buried it. How do you know? It's a treasure map. X marks the spot. - Okay, this is it. - Wait, wait, wait. What if he wants a cut? I mean, we can't cut anyone else in, man. This is our shot. This is our once in a lifetime. He's not gonna get a cut, okay? We're not even gonna mention the money. - Weren't you listening? - Uh Okay, just let me do all the talking. Give me the map. Where's the map? - Got it. - Give me it. - What are you doing? - Give me the map. It's a map. Yes, I can see that. And your English teacher drew this? Yeah, we're all in the same class together. And we're reading Treasure Island. It's about pirates. I think it was written by a pirate. - Yeah. - Totally. No, Robert Louis Stevenson. Not a pirate. See, we kinda messed up. We're flunking out of the class. The truth is we've been ditching school. Yes, your father mentioned that. What's with all this plastic? Oh, that couch is, um, what's the word? Mine. Okay, so this is, like, homework? Extra credit. You see, our teacher, Mr. Broderick, he's giving us one more chance. Yeah, see he drew this map and said if we could follow it and find the X like the pirates did in the book, then he wouldn't flunk us. Ew, did he bury something? - Oh, there's nothing buried. - It's totally just a game. Extra credit. Yeah, he said all we have to do is find the X and, uh, take a picture - with a camera. - Yeah, we're telling you the truth. Right, I'm sure you are. Yeah, but it's in code or something. We can't really figure it out. So you want me to help you decipher the map? Yes. Exactly, that's awesome. Please, decipher the map. The only thing is, is you can't tell anybody you're helping us. Not even my father. Is because we're supposed to be doing it ourselves. Yeah, you can't tell anybody. Even if they lock you up. Why why would they lock us up? Would you excuse us for one minute. We'll just be right back. Something is not right. I don't trust them. - Why not? - Because they're guys, teenage guys. So that automatically means they're lying? Yes, it does. - Why else would they be here? - I don't Natalie, I can't say no. It's Dr. Kroger's kid. The Doctor's always been there for me. Three times a week. Weekends. Holidays. I've been racking my brain trying to figure out a way to pay him back. You made me No. Ow. It's testosterone. Get him. Get him. Ow. Hey, Troy, you gonna buy that map? We were thinking about it, Morris. So we figured ""BBQ"" means barbecue. That makes sense. Yeah, but we checked every barbecue in town and there's none in that area. Plus, there's no zoo or Route 44. - I can't sell you these. - Oh, wait, I have ID. There's no way you're 47. You can't prove I'm not. I'm in your homeroom, man. - So, wha I can't buy beer here? - No. - I'm totally 47. - No. Elle Decor? It's a home magazine. You wouldn't be into it. I could be. I'm into lots of stuff. I got a corn snake who eats mice. I'm old enough to be your mother. But you're not. Hey, hey, guys. Over here. Check this out, we totally got something. - Mr. M.? - Okay. I don't think this is ""Route 44"" because it's going north to south, and highways with even numbers always go east to west. I think it's a mile marker. Didn't I tell you? He's a genius. Look, this is the reservoir, right? So that means this is Old Lake Road, mile marker 44. - Let's do it. - All right, so we'll follow you. - No, no. - Uh! Mr. Monk and I have to be together because he's the navigator. So Ridley, you go with Natalie. Uh, yeah, whoa No, no, I will, uh - Pez and Ridley, you guys take my car. - Good idea. Wait, no, no. Um Help me out We had two bad guys in the bank. Guard shot one of them. Wasn't this guy. This is your basic, no-frills heart attack. Guess that's one way to catch a crook. I'll take it. Where's the money? That's a good question. Here's another one. Where's his partner? Here's another one. Who is he? So far, he's John Doe. No wallet. No cell phone. Somebody picked him clean. Probably his pal. Maybe. Maybe some kids. - Kids? - Yeah. Skateboarders. They were here earlier today. We got a ramp. We got skid marks. And we've got a scratch. It's fresh. - I'd say three, maybe four hours. - Captain. - Yep? - Store receipt from Aunt Boo's. Yeah, we know he went to Aunt Boo's, Randy. We got wrappers all over the car. Yes, sir, I know. Uh, can I have it? - Can you have what? - This. There's a contest. It's like a promotional thing. Collect all the pieces, you get free refills for life. I've been looking for this one for six months. Ha, free refills for life. Captain. Captain, I drink four of these a day. I live to be 100, that's, like, a million dollars. Randy, a security guard was shot and killed. - This is a homicide investigation. - Yes, sir, I know. This coupon is three weeks old. CSI guys just cleared it. It's not part of the case. Cap Captain, you're a spiritual person. I mean, you believe in God, right? I think this happened for a reason. Him dying, me finding this. What are you talking about? Circle of life. - That'sThe Lion King. - Exactly. Except instead of a lion, it's me. And instead of a baby cub, it's a Diet Coke. Randy, I'm gonna let you have the receipt on one condition. You know what you just said about the lion, and the baby cub, and the Diet Coke? You don't ever repeat that again as long as I'm alive, understood? - Yes, sir. - Captain. Blood. A lot of it. Soaked into the seat. There was a body back here. o/~ o/~ Hey, what's that mean, ""The Zoo""? I've got the map. Just keep your eyes on the road. There's no zoo up here. Where's the freakin' zoo? - Blinker blink blinker. - I never use my blinker. I don't like people to know what I'm thinking. So your husband's deceased? He was a Navy pilot. - What happened? - I'd really rather not talk about it. Did he crash? I thought they had ejector seats. She said she doesn't want to talk about it, nimrod. The point is, you're a single woman. You're alone. That must be tough. I'm doing okay. Nat, this is me you're talking to. Come on. Now, I know that you think that I'm just a loser or a zero, but you never know. Things happen. I mean, I could hit the lottery or something. Don't you have to be 18 to win the lottery? There are all different kinds of lotteries. - Weird stuff happens all the time. - You got that right. Yeah. Are you guys planning something? No, no, extra credit. Could we turn this down? It is down. Could we turn it down further? Down. So my dad talks about me in the sessions? Sometimes. What does he say? Well, he's worried about you. Doesn't know why you're so angry. He wouldn't. He's impossible. Have you ever tried talking to him? Yes, I have. Three times a week. No, you're paying him. He has to talk to you. With me, it's like he doesn't even try. He just regurgitates that psychobabble crap he learned in college. - Wanna hear something funny? - No. When I was a kid, guess what I wanted to be. A shrink like my old man. Maybe you will. Yeah, or maybe I won't have to work at all. Anyway, next time you're in session, tell him I said hi. Troy, pull over. Pull over. It's not a ""Z."" It's a ""2."" The 200. That means we take the next left Yes, it's gonna happen. I can feel it. I can smell it. - Dude, this is it. - No, thank you. Let's do it. You okay? If you need anything, you let me know, all right. I'm fine. It's not at bad as it looks. Mr. Connelly. Karen, you didn't need to come in today. I know, I just I didn't want to be alone. Well I'm glad you're here. Any calls? Uh, the police. Detectives keep calling. - Anybody else? - Nope, that's it. Okay. - Thanks. - bye. - We are. We're facing north, right? - Right. There's the reservoir. Supposed to be a barbeque over there? Barbeque, that doesn't make any sense. How old do you think she is? I don't know, 34 maybe. That's twice my age. So when you're 60, she'll be 120. Where'd you get that phone? - From the guy. - The dead guy? - What, he's not using it. - Don't answer that. What are you doing? No, stop! Don't answer that, don't answer that. No, come one! You were supposed to call. Where the hell you been? Sorry, bad connection. So how'd it go? Did you bury our little package? Yeah, yeah, I buried the package. I just hope I found the right place. Look, if you could just remind me where exactly, uh Who is this? This is your new partner, nimrod. Where's Tony? Look, don't worry about Tony. You got other stuff to worry about. - We got the map. - The map? That's right. And sooner or later we're gonna find where the money is. But if you want to save us some time, we might be willing to cut you in. What happened? Yo, he hung up. Bro - What is that, number three? - It's four. Used to pay $3.50 for these. And you're still single. Go figure. At some point, I'm gonna need a bathroom. No kidding. Steven Connelly. Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD. This is Lieutenant Disher. Got a minute? Just spent three hours with the FBI. It's been kind of a rough day. And I appreciate that, sir. This won't take long. Something's come up. That's Jack Connelly. You remember him? Happy Jack Connelly. He's your brother? Don't remind me. Do you recognize him? No. - No, was he one of them? - You tell us. You got the best look at them. Uh, I was pretty busy opening the safe. Getting beat up. - Besides, they were wearing masks. - I think that's it. Was he the one that was shot? No, he died of a heart attack. He found him in a parking lot in pacific heights. - I'm sorry I can't help you. - Oh, I think that's it. Can you think of anything else? Anything at all? Okay, if you do, please give me a call. - Absolutely. - I have a question. Where's your bathroom? It's in the lobby, but it's out of order. Do you have another one for executives? No, we've been using the one in the deli around the block. No further questions. Captain, I'll meet you out front. It's 5:30. What are we doing? Let's just forget it. Wanna go behind that tree and make out? - No, thank you. - How 'bout that tree? No, thanks. Sorry, you guys. I tried. I really I really did. Seem to have hit a wall. Maybe if I just talked to your teacher. - No. That's okay. - That won't be necessary. What? It's not a barbeque. BBQ. It's a quarry. Troy There it is, I see it. It's a big X straight ahead. Do you see it? - There it is. - Awesome, man. Cha-ching. Wow, this is really going to increase our GPA. Yeah, definitely. Listen, thanks a lot, man. Everything my dad said about you is totally true. Not just the weird stuff, but the good stuff too. Everything he said about you is true too. Don't forget that. So you guys probably want to go home. Come on, I'll give you a ride. Let's go. Wait, wait, don't you want to get a picture? Oh right. You guys, come on, the money will still be there. Come on. Boy, you're in a good mood. Just finished a big case. Well, then, it must have gone well. You could say that. Oh, it sounds interesting. Wasn't a big case. But in same ways, it was the most important case of my career. - Well, I am intrigued. - I'll bet you are. Well, was it, what, for the city? No. It was a private client. It was a chance to help a friend of mine, a very dear friend. I'm sure he appreciates it. He doesn't even know about it. And I'm not gonna tell him. I don't want him to feel indebted. See, now that is the purest form of charity. You know, to help someone and not take any credit. - What? - Nothing, it's How's Troy doing? He's much better. Thank you for asking. You know, he He came downstairs this morning whistling. Opens up the curtains and says, ""What a beautiful day. "" I said, ""Is that my son?"" Sounds like he has a whole new attitude. I think his schoolwork is gonna start improving too. - Yeah, well, I hope you're right. - I know I'm right. - Well, I hope so. - I know so. Time will tell. Yes. It will. We hit a wall on that West Bay Trust robbery. I wanted to run a couple of things by you. We could have done this yesterday, but you were on your little road trip. What was that about? I was helping Dr. Kroger's kid with his homework. Who, Troy? Yeah, the boy needs a role model, somebody to look up to. What, you're gonna help him find one? Actually, Mr. Monk did a great job yesterday. He was like a big brother. You would have been proud of him. Excuse me. Let's do this. We've got surveillance video from the bank. There we go. Wednesday. 9:18 in the morning. Two Caucasian males enter the Vinton Street branch. They pistol-whip Steven Connelly, the assistant branch manager. Yeah, and guess who his brother is. Happy Jack Connelly. Remember him? Uh-huh. Security guard gets off one round. This guy, the guy in the green ski mask is hit, we think in the chest. They kill the security guard. Grab the cash. Two minutes later, they're gone. Yesterday, Thursday, we find one of them in a parking lot dead as dust. - From the gunshot? - Nope, this is the other guy. Mr. Black Ski Mask. It was a heart attack, one cheeseburger too many. We found blood in the backseat. No body. No footprints. And no money. - Double cross? - Maybe. Or somebody else found him. Could have been some kids, hanging out, skateboarding. We traced the car. Mr. Black's name was Tony Gammalobo. Single. 47 years old. Lives in Daly City. Did four years in Arizona. Ring a bell? He was 47? There's no way you're 47. I'm totally 47. You you said there were kids. It's possible. We're checking it out. Whoever it was, they cleaned him out. They got his cell phone, wallet, everything. What kind of cell phone? It was a We found the charger. Yeah, it was a Motorola. What what do they look like? I've got the same model. It's in my pocket. You okay? I I just remembered something. - I have to go. - You're leaving? Yeah, I'm sorry. I have to talk to Troy about something. - Well, I'll go with you. - No, no This is between me and him. You you stay here. I'll call you. - What was that about? - I don't know. I don't care. Free refills for life. Pretty sweet, huh? No, you got to bite the end off, nimrod. Dude, this is awesome. Oh, hey, Mr. M. What's the name - of the pirate inTreasure Island? - Excuse me? Tell me one thing aboutTreasure Island. You never read it, did you? There was no assignment. Where did you get the map? Listen, let's just relax, okay? You found it in a car next to a body. This is not a game. Troy. A man was killed in that bank. Hey, man, we can explain. Yeah. Go ahead. Not now, I mean, we need a few days. - Are you gonna tell the cops? - I don't have to tell the cops. lamthe cops. Mr. Monk, please, you can't tell my father. I mean, you know what this will do to him. It'll break his heart. Oh, God, it will break his heart. Okay, okay. Let me think. - Where's the money? - In my trunk. All right, I have an idea. We're gonna go back to that quarry. Oh, I can't go back there. I'm supposed to be Not you. Just me and Troy. I have to know exactly where you found that money. Show me everything you did. Then I'll take the map and the cash to Captain Stottlemeyer. Maybe there's a way to keep your name out of it. Well, it was fun while it lasted. No, it wasn't. Take me through it one more time. We got here at around midnight, maybe 12:30. We parked the car over there. We saw the red X and we started digging. Can you see okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. Look, it's just gravel. It's not gonna kill you. Gravel, yeah I'm fine. Thank you, Troy. But that is not the right place. According to the map, it should have been over there. In line with that shed. Yeah, but the X was here, so we dug here. Think about it. Why would they bury $2 million and then leave a giant X marking the spot? They're bank robbers. That doesn't make any sense. There wasn't $2 million when we dug that hole. We only pulled out, like, five grand. $5,000? Are you sure? Yeah, we counted it, like, a hundred times. We figured that the bank just said that to rip off the insurance company. Everybody does it. Yeah, like, when my house got robbed, my dad said we had a rare coin collection. He did? What is that? What is that back there? It's a hole. Like a pit. No, no, no, behind you. Over over here. It's a ski mask. Troy. Troy, get back in the car. - Come on, we gotta go. - Wait, why? We gotta go, come on. Come on, we gotta go. - I think we were followed. - Okay. - Let's go. - I'm going. Let's go. Make it go. It's not going. Make it go. Make it go. Trying to make it go. - It stalled. - Make it start. Make it start. What are you doing? Oh, my gosh. Back it up. I can't. - What what happened? - Where'd it go? - I don't know. - Where'd it go? Try to back up. Okay, okay. It's done. It's not it's not working. It's not working. - Let's go. - We're stuck. We're stuck in here. Come on. Wait, wait. Look. What time is it? Oh, my God. Is that AM or PM? - AM. - Oh, my God. I'm gonna get out and push. It's locked. It's not locked, Mr. Monk. Stop! Troy. Unlock the door. The door isn't locked, Mr. Monk. I've told you a thousand times. Troy, I am not joking around. Listen, let's just take it easy. Okay, Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk, just keep it together. We're gonna be okay. Cell phone. - Cell phone. - I already checked. Like, four hours ago. There's no signal. Try the other one. The.. the one you took off of Gammalobo. Who? Bank robber! The dead guy, dead guy, bank robber. - Nothing. - Push all the buttons. Cause you're not hitting all the buttons. What what is this? Calls he received. Jack Connelly. And Steven Connelly? Four, five Calls from the bank. From the bank. Oh, my God. What? Troy, I know what happened. Yay. I just solved the case. Bro, that game's pretty tough. I can figure it out. - Hey, I was just thinking about you. - Well, don't. I mean it, Ridley. Well, you can't stop somebody - from thinking about somebody. - Yes I can. Don't think about me again. Now, where is Mr. Monk? He hasn't been home all night. - Didn't he tell you? - Tell me what? Maybe we should conserve the battery. No, no, no, no! All right, we'll keep the lights on. Ah! Stop! Mr. Monk, try Mr. Monk, try not to think about where we are. Concentrate on something else. You solved the case, right? You said you solved the case? Well, talk to me about it. Yeah, tell me about the case. There was a bank robbery. It was a It was an inside job. The branch manager, Connelly, must have masterminded the whole thing. It was him, Tony Gammalobo, and Connelly's brother, Jack. He made sure they beat him up, so nobody would suspect him. Then it went wrong. Connolly's brother was shot. Must have died a few hours later. Connelly had a problem. He had to get rid of the body. If the cops found it, they'd identify him. They'd know it was his brother. They'd know it was an inside job. This wasn't the treasure map. This was where Connelly wanted his brother buried. There was money, $5,000. Connelly put that money there later. He wanted you to find it. He didn't have time to dig up his brother. He made a big X and buried a few bucks. He figured if you found any amount of money, you'd be satisfied. You'd stop looking around and just go home. So what do we do now? I don't know about you, but I plan on suffocating. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, look at me. Look at me! You're gonna be okay. I know, let's play a game. Yeah, you and me are gonna play a game, Mr. Monk. Any word you want. Anything. Animal, vegetable, mineral, anything. Mineral. It's a mineral. - Is it gravel? - Yes, it's gravel! It's gravel. Gravel! It's gravel! It's gravel, okay? Gravel! It's everywhere. And he was coming back here? That's what they said. Well, he's not here now. Must have gone home. Let's go. Okay, come on, keep going. March 2nd. It was partly cloudy. They said it was supposed to rain, but it never did. Good. You're doing great. So, okay, next day? March 3rd. It was sunny. Wait, listen. No, no Windy. No. It's a car. - Down! - Here! - Somebody! - Help! Cap, they stop the car. - I should pee. - Again? Sorry, gotta go. - We're down here! - Somebody! Help us. I told you to go at the filling station. Down here! - Somebody help, come on. - Hey! Wait, wait, wait, I got an idea. What What are you doing? - Trust me. - Help! I've got two 12inch subwoofers and 1,600 watts worth of power back there, man. I'm gonna blow this thing up. Yes. No oh, no, please, God, no. No, not that crap. Don't you have anything else? - This'll be good. - Oh, no. Hurry up. Much better. What are you doing? You hear that? - Hear what? - Turn the car off. Come here. Do you hear that? I know that song. Oh, my God, it's Troy. Down there. Randy, call it in. Call it in. Get a crane down here. We're gonna need some paramedics. Monk. Monk, we're coming. Come on! Down here! You can turn off the music now. It is off. It's been off for over an hour. That's what I'm saying, I can still hear it. It's terrible. Oh, Mr. Monk, that music saved your life. I'm not going to lie, Randy. Can't you just say I had a hunch? But you didn't have a hunch. You had to pee, and that's what I'm putting in my report. - How's he doing? - Doing just fine. Feds just picked up Connelly. He already coughed up the money. Good job. How's Troy doing? He's great. He's great. He said he changed his mind about going to college. He said that he might actually want to study psychology. Ha. So how you doing? Uh, yeah, uh What happened down there? I had a little talk with the boy. Heart to heart. It's important to listen. That's that's really the main thing, listening. No, listening, listening is good. Listening. Whatever you did, Adrian, thank you. You gave our family a wonderful gift. Better than a watch? - Better than a wristwatch. - Mention that to Harold. - I don't think that's appropriate. - Call him right now. Natalie, where's your phone? Here, sit down. Why do you have his number? I mean, a watch, give me a break. Did I ever say to you that it was Harold? I never said it was Harold."
"He's late. He's always running late, mr. Monk. Just relax. If I could relax, I wouldn't be here, would I? It's harold krenshaw. He's in there right now. He knows I'm waiting. He knows it. Oh, they're never gonna catch him. who? The frisco fly. This is him on the golden gate bridge. This is him, three weeks ago, climbing coit tower. The police always get there too late. He's like a real-life superhero. I wonder if he's single. I wonder if he needs an assistant. Mr. Monk, what are you doing? He's crying. You can't listen in. What if somebody listened to you? They wouldn't hear me crying Very often. Adrian. Sorry. I guess we lost track of the time. I heard you crying. - I was not crying. - I heard you, harold, through the wall. We were laughing, you idiot. We were laughing. I told him a joke, and we both just started laughing. He doesn't laugh. Yes, he does. He doesn't laugh with you. - Go to hell, harold. - You go to hell! The only reason I would even consider going to hell would be to visit you. You are really a sad, sad man. I don't know why dr. Kroger even bothers. I wasn't crying. I wasn't crying. Natalie. - Good-bye, harold. - Bye. So how was your session? Mr. Monk? Natalie! I just got it! Got what? What I should have said to harold! Oh, my god. A zinger! It's what they call a ""comeback. "" Mr. Monk, I don't think it really matters. No, no. Just listen, listen to this. Listen to this. I said dr. Kroger doesn't laugh. He said, ""he doesn't laugh with you. "" what I should have said is, ""maybe he's laughing atyou, harold. "" at you. Get it? At you. Get it? At you. - Yeah, I got it. - It would have destroyed him! He'd be boxed in. He'd be boxed in. There's no possible response. - At you. Let's call him. - Call him? Yeah. No! No, you're right. You're right, you're right. We'll go to his house. We'll do it in person. But we have to hurry before he forgets what he said! No, Mr. Monk. I don't think that's a good idea. Please, natalie. - I have so little. - No, forget it. I am not driving downtown so you can zing harold krenshaw. Why don't you just mail it to him? It's not the same. Hey, dad, look. It's him! It's the frisco fly! - I can't believe it. It's actually him. - Wow, he's awesome. Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. It's all part of the show. Come on. He's moving! - He's alive! Call 911! - I already did. They're on their way! - The awning must've broken his fall. - Be careful with him. Easy, easy. Hang on, fella. You're gonna be okay. - Where's natalie? - Oh, she's still in the car. She's talking to Julie. One body? Yep. Driver. He was still behind the wheel, buckled in. - Who was he? - We don't know. The killer doesn't want us to know. and removed every bit of I.D., filed off the vin numbers off of the car. Whoever did this stuck around All we got is a gas can and a flashlight. No fingerprints. Yeah, dr. G figured, uh, it happened about four days ago. No, it was longer. At least a week. The grass is already starting to grow back. It wasn't me. It was dr. G. - Cause of death? - Vehicular homicide. Dr. G says the victim was forced off the road. I don't think so. There's no dents on the side or the rear. I think this was an accident. Look, I think this poor guy hit a deer. Look. A little piece of antler. Plus, the headlights were off, so this must have happened during the day. But the guy burned the car later. He needed the flashlight. - I guess dr. G is 0 for 2. - This doesn't track, does it? The guy hits a deer, runs off the road, crashes into a rock, dead on impact, a few hours go by, maybe a day. Somebody comes along, a stranger. He files the vin number off the engine, which would have taken a few hours, then torches the car and the body. - Why? - Why, indeed. Is that poison ivy? No. - Oh, thank god. - It's poison oak. Wait, you guys. You're not gonna believe what I just heard on the radio. I've got some weird news, and some really weird news and some really, really, really weird news. What do you want first? Uh, I guess the weird news. Okay, you know the frisco fly, the daredevil? He was just climbing telegraph tower and he fell off. Hmm. And what's the really weird news? He's okay. It's a miracle. He hit a flagpole and two awnings on the way down. What's the really, really, really What's the last one? It's harold krenshaw. He's the frisco fly. What? It doesn't make any sense. Harold krenshaw is more afraid of heights than I am. He's more afraid of everything. - Well, apparently he got over it. - How? How did he do it? - I don't know. - How did he do it? - I don't know. - Okay. But how did he do it? I don't know. Harold krenshaw. Friend or family? Neither. We have the same therapist. They're very good friends. They just don't like to admit it. Room 312. Oh, do me a favor. Tell him sylvia said thank you for the autograph. My nieces loved it. My family can't believe I actually met the frisco fly. I can't believe it. - How is he doing? - Oh, much better. I was here when they brought him in. At first, he kept denying he was the frisco fly. Really? - Yeah. - Modest and brave. If I wasn't married. Look at me. I'm a hero sandwich! You were telling us about the accident. The last thing I rember, I was almost at the top, which we call ""the summit,"" and I lost my footing. I must've slipped. You had a parachute. Why didn't you? It happened so quick. I wasn't thinking. Next time, I'll know better. So there will be a next time? I'd better not say. Are there any cops in here? Oh, honey, look at this. It's from evel knievel. - I I still can't find my glasses. - Okay, I'll read it. It says ""harold, you are the man. P.S. Next time, check your damn parachute. "" evel. What a character. Jimmy, how do you feel? Are you proud of your dad? I am now. I used to be kind of embarrassed. I could hear him downstairs, crying and cursing all night. But now I know what he was really doing. Planning his next big stunt. I love you, dad. I love you, too. Oh, harold, your cousin joey's here. - Harry. How are you feeling, cuz? - Fine. Uncle ronnie couldn't make it. He's not doing too well. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Who's uncle ronnie? - Last of the original krenshaws. He owns a dude ranch in nevada. About a thousand acres. Me and harry used to go down every summer. yeah. - What was harold like as a kid? - This guy? He was indestructible, and that's a fact. Me and uncle ronnie used to throw him off the roof, then down the stairs, then off the dock. Remember? yeah. Yeah, me and uncle ronnie was just goofing off, but for harold, I guess it was practice! Okay, that's it, folks. Everyone out. I've got to change those bandages. You can come back after dinner. I'll call you later. Thank you. Adrian? I knew you'd come. Can I talk to him? It'll just be a minute. Oh, I can't say no to the frisco fly. Two minutes. I'll be right outside. Bye, harold. So The frisco fly, huh? - You look surprised. - lamsurprised. Here's the thing I can't figure out. You look surprised too. It's killing you, isn't it? How did you do it, harold? You've always been afraid of heights. You got vertigo when dr. Kroger put in thicker carpet, remember? I'm cured. How? It wasn't easy. I'll be honest with you. I don't think you can do it. You don't have it in you. It takes strength. I'm not talking about physical strength, although I've got plenty of that. I'm talking aboutit. It? - It? - Yeah. The right stuff. Strength of character. I have it. Neil armstrong has it. Rocky has it. - Rockywas just a movie, harold. - Excuse me. I'm a little confused. I just fell off telegraph tower. How was your day? Here's what I do know. You don't have it, and you never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever will! Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk. It couldn't be him. He fell off a building. There were 50 witnesses. I know it was him. Of course it was him. But it couldn't be him. For the record, my crush on the frisco fly is officially over. He's not the frisco fly. He can't be. He can't be. - No, thank you. - No. You know, mr. Monk, you and harold have a lot in common. I think that you could actually be friends. I don't think so. The fact that I despise him would always come between us. Harold, harold! Fly! Frisco fly! I love you! Harold! Mr. Fly! That's not him. His room is up there. You mean you've met him? - What's he like? - I've seen his file. He wet his bed till he was 34. And he has to be hypnotized to get his hair cut. Excuse me. You were up there? Yeah, is he okay? Cause we heard he broke, like, seven ribs. Yeah. What he broke was at least seven city ordinances. The cops won't press charges. They wouldn't dare. - He's a real-life hero. - He's a hero. He is not a hero! What is wrong with you people? I mean, he fell, right? A daredevil basically has one job Not falling. I mean, I could fall. I bet I could fall Why don't you, man? In fact, I'd be glad to help. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? Now, don't hurt him. Hey, ask yourself, what would harold do? Yeah I hate to tell you this. I've known arold krenshaw for 31/2 years, and he is a lot of things, but he is not the frisco flyer. Oh, yeah, man? Well, we were there. We saw him fall, so how do you explain that? We saw him fall. It's so quiet. It is quiet. Which I prefer, actually. It makes it easier to hear the voices in my head, screaming and pleading. Are you okay? I'm fine. How high are we? Uh, 24 stories. Yeah. All right, so that's west, which means he fell off the roof over there. It's not possible. I just came up in the elevator and it nearly killed me. You're telling me harold krenshaw climbed up the side of this building? Will you shut up?! Shut it! Not Not you. Okay, but Mr. Monk, everybody saw him fall off the roof. Maybe not. What if he had two costumes, and he put one costume on a dummy, hired someone to throw the dummy off the roof. Meanwhile, krenshaw is down below, hiding, in the other costume, waiting to be discovered. There. Mystery solved. Will you stop interrupting? I'm not gonna tell you again. Okay, Mr. Monk, harold krenshaw almost died. He had a concussion and five broken ribs. Are you saying that was self-inflicted? Why would he do that? Why would anybody do that? - To get to me. - You? So this is about you? Not entirely. It's mainly me. - He's obsessed with me, natalie. - Okay. What happened to the dummy? If somebody threw it off the roof, where'd it go? What about the real frisco fly? He would have contacted the press by now. Here's all I know. Harold krenshaw was never on this roof. There is no way. Eyeglasses. They look like harold's. He said he lost his, remember? - They couldn't be. - They're engraved. Look. ""H. K."" Oh, my god. It really was him. Wait. Mr. Monk, this is good news. This should inspire you. If harold krenshaw can overcome his fears, then you can too. Sure you can! I'll help you. We'll do it together. Okay, so we're just going to take this really slow. Mr. Monk? Okay, now, you're afraid of a lot of things. - 312. - Right, 312. But all we want to do today is beat one of them. Wouldn't that be great if we just crossed one of those right off your list? Okay, here are four things that you're scared of, but don't worry, you don't have to do all of them. You can just pick one. You can drink the milk, or you could play the harmonica, put the ladybug on your finger, or you can climb the ladder. That's a big ladder. It's only four feet. Harold krenshaw did it - Excuse me? - Is this how harold krenshaw did it? Why, I don't know, Mr. Monk. But yeah, probably. Something like this. You know what? Soon you'll be climbing skyscrapers! Oh, no. We're not even gonna think about that right now. We're just going to concentrate on one thing, okay? Uh, baby steps, okay? Little baby steps. Here you go. - Baby step. - Baby steps! Which one? Oh, wait, I forgot. come on, come on. You can do it, you're doing great. - Is there a fifth thing? - No. The ladybug. Let me try. Okay. Put out your hand. Yes, yes. Oh, my gosh! Yes, you're doing it. You're doing it. You got it. That's great, mr. Monk. Oh, yeah, yeah. A ladybug? It was this big. You could barely see it. But I was the one who was scared. - When he flew away, I thought, - that little insect Happier than me. He's happier than I'll ever be. Adrian, you know when you talk this way, I get a little concerned. How did he do it? The man was a basket case, right? - We're talking about harold krenshaw? - Harold krenshaw is climbing buildings. Skyscrapers. And he's parachuting! Whatever it is you did for him, why can't you do it for me? - I didn't do anything. - Did you hypnotize him? no. Some kind of special, new treatment? The 10:00 session, is that it? It's one hour earlier, so you're sharper, you're fresher. Adrian, I'm really not comfortable talking about other patients. Oh. I'd hate to make you feel uncomfortable. We wouldn't want that. I'm dying over here, but as long as you're comfortable. Are you warm enough? Are you thirsty? Can I get you some water? I'm sorry. I understand how upset you are, but the fact is that when I heard that it was harold up on the roof, the frisco fly, I was as surprised as anyone. But whatever harold did, whatever he accomplished, he did it on his own. I'd like to take credit for it, but it wasn't me. So no matter how bad it got, no matter how low I sank, I could always say ""At least I'm not harold krenshaw. "" he was my northern star. He was the only thing in the world I could really, count on. You know, you're unbuttoned. Adrian, it's been a while since we talked about medication, but there are some new anti-depressants on the market. It doesn't matter. I give up. Did you just say, ""I give up""? Captain, we got a hit. A gas can by the burned-out car? It was bought 15 days ago at a hardware store, g & g hardware in pacifica, eight miles from the crash site. And they don't rember who bought it. And he paid with cash. Of course. No security camera. No picture. But? We can I.D. The car. We got the vin number. It was on the radiator support bracket. Guess our boy must have forgot that. They always forget the radiator support bracket. Vehicle identification Universal tracking program. Come on, come on, come on. - Okay, shoot. - First letter ""t,"" as in tsunami. - The tsunami. - Silent ""t. "" wha No, ""t"" as in ""tom. "" just say ""tom. "" what's the difference? It doesn't The ""t"" is silent. It's not completely silent. T- sunami. All right, all right. Let's go. Uh, second letter, ""p"" as in ""P"" as in ""paul. "" - No. - Too late. I typed it. ""P."" yeah, but the person reading the letters gets to say the word. - That's how we do it. - That's how who does it? Society. We live in a society. Yes, we do randy. Meanwhile the p's been sitting on my screen for ten minutes. Fine. ""P"" for pan. No. Panavision. Tsunami, panavision. The next letter, ""I."" - ""I."" - as in No, we can come back to that one. No, we can't come back to it, randy. We. Whoever this is, thank you very much for calling. When? Is he okay? We'll be right there. - Come on. - what? Come on. Suicide watch. Harold! Harold krenshaw! Harold krenshaw! I've never actually seen him sleep before. Sometimes I wonder what he dreams about. Cleaning supplies. No, I think he dreams about a perfect world with no surprises, no emotion. Everything is clean and neat and in groups of ten. For anybody else, that would be a nightmare. Yeah. Oh, he's smiling. I'm glad he's happy somewhere. He's probably talking to Trudy. Yep. Hey, why don't you take off? You have a life. I can stick around. Nah. Julie's with my folks. I can stay. Well, I hope he enjoys it while he can. Cause when he wakes up, it's back to reality. Have you seen this? The whole city's gone ga-ga over harold krenshaw. Hey, how you feelin'? After years of thrilling the public ""and eluding authorities"" the frisco fly's true identity ""Mild-mannered loan officer Harold krenshaw, school board member, a real-life spider-man. "" he's not spider-man. Spider-man goes around helping people. Yeah. You're spider-man. Where are my shoelaces? - Dr. Kroger thought that - Yeah. Okay, I get it. - Where are you going? - Bathroom. Why? - I'll go with you. - I don't think so. No, let me go with you. We promised dr. Kroger we wouldn't leave you alone. I am not suicidal. I just wish I was never born. There's a difference. Monk, I gotta go with you. I won't look. That doesn't mean anything. I'm not gonna look either. Okay. You're gonna leave the door open. Leave the door open? Have we met? Monk, I am just looking out for you. You're not going in there alone. Then I'm not going. Well, this is ridiculous. You can't hold it in forever. - I think I can. - Then so can I. My record is nine days. Let's keep going all the way to the ice machine. That's the spirit. That's the frisco fly spirit. - Excuse me, mr. Krenshaw. - Yeah? I'm sara hollins. I teach kindergarten at st. Mark's elementary. This is evan, and this is molly. - Hello. - hi. Hello. The kids just adore you. You're all they talk about. We've been waiting downstairs all day. They wanted to give you this. It's a picture of you. That's me, huh? Well, I hope not. Look at the size of my head. I'm surprised you can stand up. I know. And what is that? - The golden gate bridge. - Really? What's keeping it up, magic? Because I don't see any suspension cables. - Joey, you got a pen? yeah. - What's the matter with you? Okay. Now it's a bridge. It's basic physics. They're only six years old. They're not gonna learn any younger. That's what my uncle ronnie always says. What's this, a bird? My god, it must be 20 feet long. yeah. It looks like mothra. Remember that old movie? You're on the school board? Yeah. - Hello. - Mr. Krenshaw? That's right. This is dr. Levine, calling from reno. You wanted me to call if there was a change in your uncle's condition. I'm afraid it doesn't look good. You might want to think about coming home to say good-bye. How long does he have? Five days. Maybe a week. I'm sorry, son. Thank you, doctor. All right, kids, you got your notes. I want you to go back to school and try again. - Oh. - Hit it. Bye-bye. - That was nice. - Who was that? Cousin, that was money calling. Endorsement money. - You ever heard of neptune energy bars? - No. Well, they've heard of you. They want to pay you ten grand to be in their next commercial. But they're on a tight schedule. They need to shoot tomorrow. You think you're up for it? Of course I'm up for it. I'm the frisco fly, right? Yeah. I don't have to climb anything, do I? Thank you. Disher. Lieutenant, I've tracked down the vin number you gave us. - I got a name for you. - Great. Hold on. - Okay. Shoot. - His name is victor grajna. ""V"" as in ""victor. "" sorry. ""V"" as in what? ""V"" as in ""victor. "" Sorry, I still can't hear you. ""V"" as in ""V"" as in what? I know it's a ""v,"" but ""v"" as in what? If you know it's a ""v,"" what does it matter? Well, I just I'd still like to know. ""V"" as in what? - Why? - Because that's how we do it. - Why? - Just Just say it. ""V"" as in what? That doesn't start with a ""v. "" how are you doing? I feel good. - Never better. How are you doing? - I'm okay. Don't you worry about me. You know, I'm pretty well acquainted with all seven of the deadly sins, and I'd have to say that envy is the granddaddy sin. That's the one that causes all the real problems out there. - What are you trying to say? - I'm talking about you and krenshaw. You comparing yourself to him, wanting what he has. What good is that doing you? Hey we gotta go. I just talked to randy. He wants to show us something. No, thank you. Believe me, Mr. Monk, you're gonna want to see this. Randy? The landlord let me in, so we're legal. But don't touch anything. Okay, I won't touch anything. Where'd you find this? Under the bed. Check this out. Look at this. A parachute, bright yellow. That's his trademark. Whose trademark? I think the guy who lived here was the frisco fly. The real frisco fly. - Well, where is he? - He's dead. Or at least I think he is. Remember the burned-out car? I tracked the vin number. This guy owned it. I think he was our driver. His name's, uh, victor grajna. I checked with immigration. Guess what he did back in hungary? - Circus performer. - Acrobat. What do you got? Coit tower Golden gate bridge Pacific electric building. Reconnaissance photos. Before he climbed them. Wait a second. If this guy, victor grajna, was the real frisco fly, what What was harold krenshaw doing on that roof? And how did he get into that costume? - You okay? - Poison oak, that day in the woods. Poison oak? I didn't want to tell you. It's not contagious. This is This is wonderful! I know what happened! Harold krenshaw isn't the frisco fly. He was never the frisco fly. Wait, it gets better. Somebody is trying to kill him. And shouldn't we do something about that? I'll call it in. What's this guy's name again? Grajna. ""G"" as in ""gnome,"" ""r"" as in ""randy Disher"" Mr. Monk. Your shoes are untied. Should we leave a note for dr. Franklin? Negative. The energy bar people want to keep this on the hush-hush. Why? Show business reasons. Don't worry about it. You okay? Well, it's kind of tight. You look great. - All right, let's go make some money. - Yeah. Up? Change of plans. The energy bar people want to shoot on the roof. The roof? Oh Mmm Oh, no. He's gone. Excuse me. Sfpd. We're looking for the frisco fly. He's not the frisco fly. He was just here. He was with his cousin. His costume's gone. My god. Listen, joey, I gotta tell you something. I You gotta promise not to tell anyone. I'm not the frisco fly. Oh. I gotta tell you something. I know. You two stay here. Randy, get some back-up. Call hospital security. We're locking down this building. This is Disher. We got a possible 312. Subject could be wearing a parachute and goggles. What? I don't think they'd go outside. It's too risky. Harold's famous now. He'd be recognized. The roof. The roof. Come on, buddy. It's not as bad as it seems. All right, daredevil. Let's go wave to the people. We need some witnesses. Uhh! do it! Hey, on the roof! Fly, fly, fly, fly! Sorry about this, cuz. Uncle ronnie said he's gonna leave everything to you and me. As you rember, I never was very good at sharing. Oh, a little extra. Last time, I don't think I used quite enough. Come on, Mr. Monk. I can't. I can't. All right, this won't hurt. I promise. Harold! The gun, harold! Grab the gun! Harold, are you okay? Yeah. I I was just I I saw my fans down there. Thought I would climb down the building and say hello, 'cause the frisco fly never disappoints his fans. Yeah, forget about it, harold. Give it a rest, okay? The show's over. Here's what happened. Your cousin joey wanted you dead. I can think of five or six reasons off the top of my head. Money. We have a rich uncle. He didn't want to share the estate. That's what I figured. Two weeks ago, joey's wish came true. There was an accident. He happened to see it as he drove past. The driver's name was victor grajna. He was a professional acrobat. He was the real frisco fly. For Joey finding that costum was like hitting the jackpot one match And the real first go fly gone for ever All joey had to do was wait for the right moment. On monday night, he made his move. Where did it happen? Was it at your house? It was in a parking garage. He dragged you up to the roof. It must have take him an hour to get that costum on. They have to admit it was a brilliant plan. Everyone would think the frisco fly slipped and fell. It would have worked, if you hadn't hit that awning. I don't understand. What did you think when you woke up? In that costume? It was pretty confusing. It was a very confusing few minutes. It was probably the most confusing two or three minutes of my life. Why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you say, ""excuse me! Somebody just pushed me off the roof""? Because of me. He was trying to drive me crazy. It wasn't you, Adrian. I know this is hard to understand, but not everything is always about you. It's about my family, my little boy. He was so proud of me. Everybody was making such a fuss. I didn't know what had happened or why. I just I knew that it felt pretty good. Plus It was driving you insane. Harold, he just saved your life. Thank you. Mr. Monk. You're welcome. Glad you're Okay. - Enjoy your ineritance. - Now I get it. This is about money, isn't it? Well, forget it. There's no reward. What? He's not in this for the money! You really are delusional! Go to hell, Teeger! - You go to hell! - You can both go to hell! You go to hell! Not you. I will see you both in dr. Kroger's office. And I hope that chuck and I don't keep you waiting too long. - Harold! - Is he Is he His parachute opened. He's okay. Well, what's going on? Well, they're carrying him off on their shoulders. Because he broke his legs? I don't think so, mr. Monk. Can I go home now?"
"I'll call you back. Valerie? The door was open. John? Are you okay? Oh, my god. Somebody call the police! Please! Please help! Mr. Monk, 14 years ago you were the chief investigator of this crime scene. It was your testimony that put max barton behind bars. As you know, mr. Barton's eligible to be paroled at the end of this month. I understand you'd like to make a statement before our final decision. Yes, sir. Thank you. I've been a homicide investigator for more than 20 years. I have seen more crime scenes than I could possibly count. Well, 410, but That's not the point. What I saw that morning in that house was beyond imagination. What he did to those people, the The husband had been tortured. We found the wife in the backyard. She had She had tried to crawl away Take your time, mr. Monk. I've tried to forget it, but I can't. And I'm sure that sarah mcnally, who found the bodies, will never forget it either. Putting people like max barton behind bars is the reason I became a cop. In my opinion, he should never be released. He should never be considered for release. - He - Ms. Lawrence. Is there a problem? Excuse me. Commissioner, members of the board, mr. Barton would like to withdraw his application for parole. - Withdraw? - Yes, sir This is daniel crosby of the innocence league. The federal appeals court has exonerated mr. Barton. He will be released by the end of the week. Uh, what What's going on? It's a new DNA test. DNA? They've retested the crime scene evidence. Apparently, the blood at the scene under the victim's fingernails does not belong to mr. Barton. May I say something? I'm afraid it's too late, ms. Mcnally. There's been a mistake. Uh A mistake? Looks like you got the wrong man, mr. Monk. Fourteen years ago, San Franciso was shocked by the gruesome double murders of john and valerie davis, two local jewelry merchants who were found tortured and slain in their quiet anderson village home. Everyone considered the case closed with the conviction of this man, maxwell g. Barton. Until last week, when, in a stunning reversal, the ninth circuit court of appeals, citing new DNA evidence, overturned the conviction and ordered mr. Barton's Max, you son of a bitch. Police department spokesmen Leland Stottlemeyer will be holding a news conference later this afternoon. So I come out. ""The department deeply regrets "" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. ""We are reviewing procedure to make sure mistakes "" yak, yak, yak, yak. Are there any questions? - Randy, the questions. - Sorry. ""Captain Stottlemeyer, - yes - Max barton plans to sue the state for wrongful conviction. Do you have any comment?"" max barton can sue whoever he wants to. However, we are not at liberty to comment on any pending litigation. - How about that? - That's great. It's wonderful. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. Keep going. ""Does the department plan to dispute the DNA evidence?"" nope. In fact, we have tested the evidence ourselves, independently, and we agree that the blood found at the crime scene does not belong to mr. Barton. Hey. Sorry. Um ""Will you be reopening the case?"" we already have reopened the case. And, uh, as you know, there is no statute of limitations on murder. However, we. What the hell is going on? It wasn't me. - What wasn't you? - This screwup. It wasn't me. It's always me. I can't believe it's not me. It's always me. This wasn't me. I wasn't even on the force back then. You understand that this wasn't a traffic violation. An innocent man spent in a state penitentiary, and the son of a bitch that murdered those poor people is still out there. Yes, sir. I know, but it wasn't me. You're right, randy. It wasn't you. It was Adrian Monk's case. I just talked to natalie. Monk is devastated. I can't blame him. Can you imagine? The guilt. The pain. Adrian Monk had this much confidence to begin with This'll probably kill him. What have you got to say to that? It wasn't me. I should just quit. - Quit? - Why don't I? Just quit. Now. Today. Never leave the house again. If I had any decency at all I- I won't let you quit, Adrian. You're too good a detective. I haven't been sleeping. Been up all night. Reviewing my old cases. How many other mistakes have I made? What else did I miss? How many other innocent people are sitting in some cell right now because Adrian, it was one case. One case is enough. I used to think the worst mistake I could make was letting a killer go free. But this is worse. Sending that man to prison Adrian, what you're feeling here now, this remorse, this is actually healthy. You're No, you're connecting with another person. This max barton. What you're feeling is empathy. It will make you a better detective. It might even make you a better human being. You should've seen him at that hearing. Staring at me. He hates me. At least we have that in common. He's He's being released tomorrow morning. From the seabrook penitentiary. It's a 47-minute drive. I know where you're going with this. - You do? - Yes, yes. And I think it's a great idea. - Really? - yeah. Thank god. I'm so relieved. Tell him how sorry I am. - What is this? - It's a card. I wrote a little note on the back. No, Adrian, I thought you were going up there. Me? I put the man away for 14 years. He'd crush me like a peanut. Well, Adrian, I cannot do this for you. You're right. Sorry. You're absolutely right. I don't know what I was thinking. And natalie can't do it either. Barton, maxwell. Yeah. Barton, I'm happy for you, man. Got some personal items for you. Wallet, belt, and Just check that and that. Well, looks like I lost a little bit of weight. Yeah, just throw this out. No, just take the belt, punch a hole. - You ready? - Oh, yeah. See you around. Mr. Barton. It It's me. You You look great. Get me out of here. Max! Mr. Barton. I Just wanted to say sorry. Sorry. I'm I am sorry. I'm I'm really sorry. This is natalie Teeger, my assistant. Natalie, this - This is max. - Hello. You know the best thing about getting sprung? I don't have to listen to you. Right. Max, this is for you. Uh, it's a little - Little something. - Yeah? Are 14 years of my life in there? No, just Mostly caramels. - Chocolate pretzel. - And a chocolate pretzel. Listen, I-I just wanted to explain about what happened. It was an honest mistake. I mean, look at all the evidence. The killer used an upholster's knot. You were an upholsterer. You had a criminal record. Your fingerprint was on the doorknob. I made a delivery there the week before. I told you that. But you didn't listen. There was an eyewitness. Mrs. Mcnally swore she saw you leaving the house. Plus, the killer was left-handed. I proved that. - And you're left-handed. - Yeah, not anymore. My first week here, they stomped on it. Why? Because I looked at a guy, that's why. I'm against that. Stomping on hands. I've always been against that. - Do you need a lift? - No thanks. Somebody picking you up? Your wife? My wife? You mean the woman who stopped visiting me nine years ago? Who divorced me five years ago? That who you mean? You really want to help me, Monk? Why don't you curl up in a corner and die? Well, at least you tried. I have to do something. I have to help him. Mr. Monk, I don't think he wants your help. How do you know? Well, the ""curl up and die"" thing was sort of a hint. I can't just walk away. I have to make this right. Hello again. It's me again. What do you want? Just want to start by reiterating once again how very, very, very sorry we both are Mostly me I'm very sorry. So, really - So sorry. - Do you live here? I got a room in the basement. It's part of their halfway program. Oh, it's, uh It's nice. It's a cesspool. I'm lucky to get it. I thought you were suing the state. Yeah, my lawyer said that could take years. Meanwhile, I'm broke and alone. I'm I'm so, so, so, so sorry. Let me I'll take that. Let me take that, no problem. I'll just. What are you doing here? I'm Well, I-I wanted to We wanted to invite you to, um I'm sorry, is that steven rudner? - The district attorney? - That's right. Is that Is that me? That looks like me. It is me. Is that a knife? Heh. It looks like Looks like you're Stabbing me. Right between the eyes. Invite me to what? I don't know if you're hungry. We, uh, just did some shopping, and we have plenty of food. You made me a sandwich, Monk? You think that's gonna put things right? We have chips. Admit it, Monk. You're not here for me, you're here for yourself. The pain, the guilt, it's It's crushing you. Am I right? Yeah, you wanna hear those three magic words, ""I forgive you. "" well You want me to give you absolution? You want me to release you? Please. Sorry, detective. It's not my job. Why don't you go talk to a priest? Thank you. Ow! - Oh - You okay? I can feel it. That knife tattoo going into my head. It's like voodoo. Mr. Monk, there's no such thing. It's all in your head. Oh, yeah? What What are you doing? - I'm hungry. - What? I made that sandwich for max. Mr. Monk, I don't think he's coming. What if he changes his mind? He'll come in here, see you eating his sandwich. He'll never forgive me. ow Mr. Monk, he obviously doesn't want your help, okay? Let it go. You did everything you could. Maybe not. Look, I have an idea. He likes you. - Who likes me? - Max. - I could tell. - So? So you go back there. Talk to him. Why? I think you should date him. Mr. Monk. I'm not gonna date him. I don't even know him. Okay, okay. It doesn't have to be a date. Just make out with him. - All right. - Really? - No. - Come on! - As a favor to me. - No. What would it take? You're telling me you can't spare five minutes? You're so busy? Mr. Monk, I'm kinda choosy who I make out with. What? You made out with a leper. That's different. You sent him to prison. Why don't you make out with him? Nah Ow, ow Oh. Ow. He's working out again. - Hello? - Ow, ow, ow! Ow. Oh, my god. where? Okay. All right. We'll be right there. What? What is it? That was the Captain. Max is in trouble. Let's go! It's that guy they just released, max barton. - We know. - He's in there freaking out. - Something about his ex-wife. - Wait! What are you doing? We're taking him in. No. No, wait. Let me, uh Let me talk to him. I can talk to him. He'll listen to me. - Is he a friend of yours? - No. He hates my guts. Look, I need to find her right now! I've been in prison for 14 years! Where is she? You tell me right now and I'll leave you alone. You'll never see me again. Max. Max. It's me. And her. it's us. How you doing, max? Get on outta here! I am not talking to him! Okay. It's okay. What's going on here? His ex-wife used to work here. She quit four years ago. Max Max, you're scaring everybody. I've tried to tell him. We haven't heard from her. Except for that one picture in a christmas card. Picture Max? Max, can I see it? Come on. Give me a chance. Watch this. Okay. She's in a hotel. Probably a resort near a beach. There's sand on the bedspread. A- a resort? Yeah. See? The The card on the gift basket? It's in dutch, so She's probably in st. Martin. St. Martin? She was always talking about that place. Yeah. She's not alone. Two plates on the room service cart. It's probably a man, because the toilet seat is up. You can see it in In the reflection in the mirror A man?! Gaah! Okay, did I Did I say a man? Look, I-I could be wrong. Max, I am not an expert on toilet seats. Did she stand up when she made water? - Look, I could be wrong. - Yeah, he's wrong a lot. I- I don't have to tell you that. I'm nothing without her. Listen to me, max. Listen to me. There are two officers outside, and they are just looking for an excuse to come in here and lock you up again. You don't want that. I don't want that either. But But I can't live without her. I understand. I'm gonna find her. I promise. I'm not gonna quit until I do. They're reopening the case. So we're going back to the original crime scene. They're gonna find the real killer. After 11 years? The trail went pretty cold. No, mr. Monk doesn't need a trail. He's done it lots of times. Oh, good. Go get him. You nail that son of a bitch. I won't let you down, max. You're tracking down his ex-wife? Yeah, and getting him a job. Natalie's father's gonna give him some work on the loading dock there. Why don't you just adopt this guy and make it legal? You don't understand what it's like. I feel so responsible. Yeah It must be tough. I mean, I wasn't involved in the case, but I can certainly appreciate Well, I mean I can imagine what you must be going through. Why don't you just make a t-shirt that says, ""it wasn't me""? Mr. Gelbertson? Captain Stottlemeyer. We spoke on the phone. Good time? Not really. How about now? Oh. Sure. Michael, matthew, these men are from the police. Are they real police? Yes, they're gonna take a look around for a few minutes. Why? Oh, well, because a long time ago, before I was on the force, something happened in this house. Was it scary? I don't know. I wasn't here. It was before my time. What's he doing? Him? He's a detective. Like on tv. Oh, we don't let the boys watch television. It's too violent. Well, yeah, I can't blame you. I got two boys myself. The realtor did mention something when we bought the house Something about a robbery? It's a home invasion. Double homicide. Husband and wife. Tortured. Then killed. Were they drug dealers? No. They were a nice couple. About your age. They sold jewelry. They had a wall safe. It was loaded with merchandise. That's what the guy was after. - I thought you caught him. - Yeah, so did we. It turns out we had the wrong guy. So, um, we've reopened the case. Well, what can you find now? I mean, after 12 years? Actually, 14 years. I've only been on the force for 9. It was 5 years before that. So it's 14 years. The wall safe was here. We found bloody footprints over there. There was a whole trail of blood all the way through here. Splattered all over. I remember we found a piece of the thumb over there. The wife broke free. She crawled across the playroom Out over the patio. Yeah. Yeah, he killed her out there. Right where your sandbox is. Do you guys play outside? You ever found anything unusual out there? Like what? bone fragments No? Nothing like that? Hacksaw blade? No. What do you got? Scratch marks. From a dog. They were there when we moved in. No. Can't be. I don't remember a dog 14 years ago. Well, according to this, the victims did have a dog. It died the day before the murder. The day before? What are the odds of that? Yeah, well They buried it out there. Under a pine tree. Well, let's go find it. We'll dig it up. There's gotta be enough hair, skin, skeletal remains. Enough to test for poison. You boys wanna help dig a hole? - Max? - Hello, pauly. I heard you was out. I was gonna call you. Yeah, sure you were. I understand, brother. You're a taxpayer now. Gotta keep your distance. So, um How you doin'? How you think I'm doin'? I felt terrible, max. But it wasn't my fault, huh? I mean, it was just bad luck. The safe being empty, and And you getting nailed like that. You want a drink? Sure you do. I got some of that nice imported stuff you like so much. - Been lookin' for you, pauly. - Don't worry about me, bro. After all those jobs we pulled together? It's those other jobs I'm worried about. Sorry, pauly. I ain't never going back. Hey. Toxicology report on the davis's dog. Poisoned? Yes, he was. Doberman pinscher 85 pounds. I guess the killer didn't want to have him around. With penzedrine? Yeah they use it during heart operations. It's very rare, which is good news for us. I need you go to back 14 years. I want you to compile a list of anyone who had access. That's, uh, medical supply. - Pharmaceutical companies. - 14 years? looking for somebody with a rap sheet. Somebody who might've missed work the day of the murders. Wasn't my case. Excuse me. What did Did you just say it wasn't your case? No, sir. I said, ""your cousin has a face. "" just get me the names. My cousin has a face. Max? Max? Hey. Hey, how you doing? Here. A comic book, huh? - Great. - Not gonna help you. Well, here's the thing. The foreman called natalie's father. And, uh He said that you haven't been You know, working. Or anything. I know it's your first day My back hurts. Your back? Is, uh You told the foreman you had a headache. It's my back. I think it happened when I got the crap beat out of me. in prison. Maybe I could talk to someone. Maybe there's a clerical position I'm fine. Look, did you take care of that parking ticket? Yes, I did that. No problem. - Talk to the bank? - Yes, I talked to the loan officer. He said you're going to need someone to cosign those papers. Which Of course, I would be more than happy to do. Barton!

I know this is A bad time. Here's the thing I madea terrible mistake. The biggest mistake of my life. Sherry Max barton is an innocent man. If I hadn't screwed up, you two would still be together. We know the whole story. We've been reading about it. No, you don't know the story. The real story is about a man who never gave up. put yourself in his place. Falsely accused. Unjustly convicted. Spending 14 years In that That I'm gonna say it. hell. I sent that man to hell. You know how he survived, sherry? You know what sustained him? You. Even after you stopped coming to visit. Memories of you. Dreams of you. Can we do this later? Later is too late. Sherry, don't make the same mistake I did. Don't lock him away. Again. Sherry! I want you to look at this man. Look into his eyes. This Is a good, good, good man. I I don't know. I think you do know. If you have any feelings for him at all, don't you owe it to yourself to stop, take a day, take a week, look into your heart? Max. Show her. That's you. The dragon? No. No, Next to the dragon. Inside That's a man. No, that's the district attorney. Across from the man, inside the broken heart. What does it say? ""Sherry My love My life. "" Oh, max. Baby! Well, you did it. You happy? Eh - Why not? - I don't know. Something I don't know. I hate you. Join the club. How could you? What are you doing here? This is sarah mcnally. She was the eyewitness 14 years ago. I've been following you. Watching you. You've been helping him. No Max barton has been exonerated. The police found some evidence I don't care about any new evidence. I know what I saw. I saw him leaving that house. He's a monster. Ma'am, a lot of people were wrong about this case. It's not your fault. You were in your house. You were 45, maybe 50 yards away You measured, remember? Your measuring tape broke. You sent Lieutenant culkin to get a new one. Culkin. You You remember his name? I remember everything. It's a curse. You were wearing the exact same thing. Except it was a gray blazer with white buttons. That's right. She's right. Ask me anything. Lieutenant culkin's 3241. You were driving a white chevrolet with one of those green air fresheners. Photographic memory. Like I said, I know what I saw. I heard screaming. I went to the window. And I saw him. Max barton. Leaving that house. I will never forget it. How he walked down the street, his hands in his pocket, like he didn't have a care in the world. His hands were in his pockets? What, what, what, what? The killer used an acetylene torch to break into the safe. We never found it. If the man you saw wasn't carrying anything - There was a second man. - An accomplice. An accomplice That's whose DNA they found. I was right the first time. He was there. I never figured on a second man. Let's call the Captain. It's too late. He's been exonerated. It's called double jeopardy. You can't try a man twice for the same crime. Wait Wait, that's it? He gets away with murder? E we get the other one back? The usual? Captain? okay. Thank you. The blood type matches. I'm sure the DNA does too. He is definitely the guy. Well, the other guy. Thank you, randy. The other guy. - Who was he? - His name was pauly flores. He and barton were pals, high school buddies. We found him this morning hanging from this door by his own belt. - Suicide? - Yep, what they call prison style. I guess he freaked out when he heard that his pal had been released. Guilt, flashbacks I guess we'll never know. And he had access to that drug? Penzedrine. That's affirmative. He worked as a security guard at lavallee pharmaceuticals for 15 years. That's how we found him. Computer spit out his name this morning. You know, we figure he and barton were in on it together. They poisoned the family dog, broke in the next day. Looks like you were right the first time. Half right. Didn't know about him. I spoke to the d. A.'S office. They said there's nothing they can do. Double jeopardy. They've closed the case. He's gonna walk. Can you live with that? Could you? Wait - Wait. - what? We got him. - We got who? - Barton. Max barton. - We can nail him. - No, it's double jeopardy. You can't Not for the first thing. For this. We got him on this. Can we prove it? I think so. - Randy, find him. - I know where he is. He told a couple of guys in my dad's loading dock. - Well, let's pick him up. - Where is he? You're not gonna believe it. As some of you may rember, the rings that sherry and max are about to receive are perfect circles, symbols of the sun and the moon, peace, and, um True faith. True faith. Max. Sherry. Marriage is an act as ancient as the history of the human race. Help me, lord, it's the same guy. Sherry! Thank you again. Excuse me. Sorry. Hello again. Sorry, sorry. Sorry! Sorry. This This'll only take a minute. What do you want, Monk? Sherry, you can't marry this man. No, he is a very, very dangerous man. He's killed three people. That we know of. - But you said - I know. I know, but this time, I'm positive. I want you to look at this man. Look into his eyes. This is a bad, bad, bad man. Sherry, I made a mistake, and then I compounded the mistake. Don't you make the same mistake by compounding My other Mistake My first Sherry, they were right about max 14 years ago. What we didn't know is he had an accomplice named pauly flores. It was pauly's DNA we found at the crime scene. Pauly. I remember him. I haven't seen that guy since high school! I swear to god. Anybody got a bible? Did he confess? Pauly's dead. We found him this morning in his apartment, hanging from a belt. Sherry. Baby. This is our day. Our moment. If pauly decided to hang himself with his own belt, well, that's his problem. Actually, max, he didn't use his own belt. Lieutenant? This is the belt we found. This is your belt, isn't it, max? I was there when you were being released. You said you'd lost some weight, rember? That you needed to punch another hole into it. What does that prove? A lot of people punch holes in their belt. Nobody's gonna believe you anyway, Monk. Not after last time. This guy is still out to get me. I mean, he's obsessed or something, I-I You're right, max, there's no way we can prove that this is your belt. But we can prove that the belt you're wearing belonged to pauly flores. The man you killed. You strangled him with your own belt. You hang him from the door to make it look like suicide. But then you made a mistake. Where's pauly's belt? Because we can't find it. It's not in his apartment, and we just checked your room. What are you talking about? A belt's a belt. You can't prove any of this anyway. Well, we caught a little bit of a break there, mr. Barton. Pauly's belt's part of his uniform. It's company issue. Their logo's stamped on the inside. Sir, remove your belt. What are you, crazy? I'm not taking off this belt. Can you believe this? Take off the belt, max. Max barton, you're under arrest for the murder of paul flores. We all make mistakes, max. Just means you're human. Justin! Randy. - Yes, sir? - That was judge heller's office. She's not giving us a search warrant on that chinatown thing. She said she never got the coroner's report. Oh. That, uh I'm sorry. It's my bad. I brought it I brought it home last night, and I was gonna I forgot. I forgot. I'm gonna go get it. You're too late. She's gone. She's gone on vacation for two weeks. What? Aw Captain, I'm sorry. If there's anything I can do. I'm gonna call the coroner. - We can get a hold. - Just to be clear, this was you. You screwed this up. Yes, sir, and I feel terrible about it. Wasn't me. Wasn't Monk. - Wasn't you and it wasn't Monk. - It was It was me. It was you. I promise it won't happen again. God's in his heaven, all's right with the world."

Mr. Lee says that he's not an undercover cop, and he's never been to the - bay street cafe. - Well He also says he's never been shot four times. - He's lying. - About what, Monk? In my experience, a person that's been shot four times is pretty forthcoming about it. Monk, I called it in, he checks out. I saw you. Mister, whatever you think you saw, it wasn't me. Now, can I go? Yes, sir, absolutely, you can go. Thank you very much. Sorry to bother you. - ""Sorry to bother you""? - Monk, it's late. All right, we gotta follow this guy. Follow him where?

Uh, well, we have an eye witness who's usually very reliable when he gets enough sleep, who says that, uh, he saw an undercover cop get shot. - Cop? - Yeah. Do I need a lawyer? - You sure do. - No. I'm sure it was probably just a misunderstanding. In fact, we just left the victim at the train station. He was alive and well, waiting for a train to port - He's alive? - yeah. - I don't understand. - You know, to tell you the truth, I don't understand either. Sorry to have bothered you.

It's on harrison street. Called the bay city cafe. You mind telling us what's going on? Gully was right. It's a different city after dark. Who's gully? He's the guy who stole my wallet. I learned a lot from him. Here's what happened. Nothing I saw was real. It was all a con game. There were three of them. Grifters looking for an easy mark. And they found one. A coin dealer named jacob posner. Posner thought he was buying drugs. But it was all a show for his benefit. They wanted posner to think that he was in serious trouble. They told posner they could cover it up and make it all go away for a price. They were all on it. The drug dealer, the so-called cop, and the waitress, Zeena Davis. They only had a few minutes, but it was enough time to clean up all the blood before I got back. Posner thought he was paying them hush money. He gave them dozens of coins. Rare coins, they must've been worth a fortune. He had no idea he'd been conned until later When we showed up. We mentioned that the dead cop was, in fact, alive and well and we just had seen him at the train station. Posner realized he'd been conned. He didn't take it very well. That's a hell of a story. I guess I'll be reading all about it tomorrow night. Here we are. Can you go around back? Come on, come on. Hey, relax, man. You'll get your coins. You're damn right I will. Just keep walking. Nice shot. Going somewhere? Excuse me! Somebody owes me $10. Maria! Do I know you? I've been looking for you all night. For me? why? I don't know why. I mean I don't know. ""12-14-97"" It was the day my wife died. That's the day I was reborn. At least that's how it felt. I had a disease. Retinitis pigmentosa. I was going blind. - And then - And you had a cornea transplant. From Trudy? That's right. Trudy Monk. - My wife? - I have her corneas. Trudy's eyes. I am so sorry. Hello? Mr. Monk? Mr. Monk? See? Told ya. A little fresh air. Works every time."
"This is terrible. It's like the traffic jams. It's true, Mr. Monk, it is very similar to a traffic jam. I'll never make it. Doctor Kruger charges me for the sessions I miss. - Well, you can't blame it on me. - I do that anyway. Hey, that's Macmillan Museum. I was just went there on a field trip. And in the next session, all we're gonna talk about, is how much I resent being charged for the last session will take me five sessions to recover. You guys should have checked it out. - They have this big diamond from Egypt, - Julie. Called the star of Bethlehem, it's like Julie, your mom and I are very upset. We can't talk right now. - I hate Christmas. - You now like Christmas. You wouldn't like it either if you hated it as much as I did. But it's so joyful. Don't get me started on joy. When you're older, you'll understand. Joy is a trick, a diversion, it doesn't last forever. It breaks your heart every time. Damn joy! We really gotta get to the doctor Kruger. What was that? What's going on? We gotta call it in. Call what in? Over here! Santa Klaus! You can't keep that. Give me that, that's evidence. - Of what? - He's breaking the law. Natalie He's creating a nuisance. A public nuisance, which is the worst kind of nuisance there is. - What are you doing? - Going up there. - Mr. Monk's going to the roof? - He hates heights. Is it okay? Trudy died ten years ago this week. It's been really tough. I mean tougher than usual. Who wants this? Who wants a Teddy Bear? Merry christmas! Are you on drugs? It's all right. Just spreading a little christmas cheer, that's all. Merry christmas! Merry christmas! Excuse me! Mr. Kringle! There are city ordinances against this kind of thing. Littering trespassing Mr. Monk!

Yeah, I know, it's the worst. How's he doing? He took one in the shoulder. He's gonna make it. That's good, I guess. We were in the car and he was talking about how much he hated christmas and how he didn't like Joy. Joy? Yeah, and then he saw Santa Claus and he got really, really mad and. He, Sweetie, why don't you go wait in the car and I'll be right there? Natalie, we're gonna have to talk to her. Not today you don't. I. I didn't have a choice. - He was coming at am. - Whoa whoa whoa, Monk. Don't say anything. I don't want to hear it. I'm calling for your good friend garret price. - He'll be here in a minute. - Garret Price? You think I need a lawyer? My god! Santa Claus! We love you, santa! That's him. That's the guy! Why. Why did you do it? Just trying to spread a little joy, a little christmas cheer. This guy's nuts! You're nuts! Yeah, I think you might need a lawyer. Wipes. No, you can't wipe your hands. We need to check 'em for gunshot residue. - Yeah, I. I understand. - You know the drill. What did I just say? - You can't wipe your hands. - Okay, yeah, fine. All right, I'm sorry. I understand. Where's Santa Claus? There he is. Jerry, get a shot of the fat man. Make sure you get the blood. The more blood, the better. Hell. It's Brandy Barber. Who's that? She's a vampire with a press pass. Just stay away from her. Do not talk to her. Don't even nod. Get him out of here. Now get the kids. Make sure they're crying. They're not crying. I am sorry about Santa Claus. I'm sorry he got shot. I hope he's okay. I hope he doesn't die. You're gonna make a wonderful mom. Just get the shot. Captain, nice to see you again. Gee, I wish I could say the same thing. That the shooter? - My god, it's Adrian Monk. - Not gonna happen. He is off limits. I just want to hear his side of it. Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus. People are gonna want to know why. And they will. Just not today. He's a criminal! Murder! Look, can you give the guy a break? He wore a badge for 14 years. I think he deserves the benefit of the doubt. Captain, that hurts my feelings. Look, I'm a journalist. I'm a professional. I'm not here to rip anybody apart. Tonight, crazy cop caps kris kringle. Brandy Barber reporting. This city has seen its share of shocking crimes. But for the children of San Francisco, what happened this morning on that rooftop. Was the crime of the century. The victim, Michael Kenworthy, a doting grandfather, a retired parole officer. His neighbors call him the nicest man they ever met. The facts are these. Mr. Kenworthy, in the spirit of christmas, bought some toys to give away to the neighborhood children. He was on that roof tossing Candy Canes and stuffed animals down to the street, when this man, Adrian Monk, a disgruntled former homicide detective, who was kicked off the force on a psychiatric discharge, ran up to the roof and shot Mr. Kenworthy for no apparent reason. I'm the grinch. That's what they're calling me. The whole city hates me. I think we're going to be okay. I've been thinking about this. It's San Francisco. It's a godless town. Everybody knows that. That's why they visit. Hippies and heathens despise christmas. All need is a couple of witches on the jury, home free. - That's your strategy? - That's just the beginning. How's it going, Randy? Almost done. We recovered these on the street and these were from the toy bag. We've got 24 dolls, one rubber snake, five frisbees, one walkie talkie, and 37 stuffed animals. I don't know whether to count the bunny or not. - It's got blood all over it. - Gray. Blood on the Bunny. That's not good. Most heathens love Bunnies. I'll have to find one that doesn't. Okay, finish it later. All right pal, it's the moment of truth. Have a seat. It is December 19th, 3:45 pm. I am interviewing Adrian Monk. Garret Price for Mr. Monk and I have 3:46 pm. Go. What happened on the roof? When I got up there, that guy. Santa Claus. - Mr. Kenworthy. - Kenworthy. He was standing near the edge. He was throwing the toys off the roof. I asked him to stop. He told me to leave him alone. He said my head was made of B.M. Right. Go on. As I was about to leave, a gun fell out of his belt. I asked him about it. Did he have a permit? He went nuts. He grab a pipe. He came at me. I told him to stop Don't. Don't try it! He just kept coming. How many shots? Two. And is this the gun? You're sure? I remember the broken handle. Mr. Kenworthy said it's not his gun. He said that you went nuts and that you started yelling, cursing. Then you pulled out this gun. You started shooting. - Can you explain that? - Yes, I can. He's lying. We got your prints off the weapon, Monk, not his. He was wearing gloves. Santa Claus gloves. If I may, what about the bomb? What bomb? You remember. You told me there was a bomb. That Mr. Kenworthy had a bomb. He had a bomb. - He didn't have a bomb. - Go along with it. He was waving something around. You thought it was a bomb. It looked like a bomb. He thought it was a bomb. That's why you shot him! He's a hero. You're a hero. Yeah, there was no bomb. Therewasa bomb. There was no bomb. Why are you protecting him? May I speak with my client for a moment? By all means. First you don't like hippies. Now you don't like bombs. Juries love bombs. Just try it out. Just see how it feels. It was a gun. Everybody today likes bombs. No jury will acquit you if there's a bomb. Pending further investigation, we are not certain there was a bomb but we're pretty sure. What? I'm gonna talk to your client. I don't think that's a good idea. But I understand that it's procedure. Monk, I just spoke to Natalie. I know you've been under lot of stress. - Leland. - I know it's been ten years. It's the anniversary of Trudy. And we both know that you black out sometimes. - But I did not black out. - Look, I have to be sure here. Do you understand my position here? It's your word against Santa Claus. Leland, it was his gun. It was self defense. I'll speak to you later today. Think about the bomb. Tomorrow I want to go to nursery schools, kindergartens, and talk to some kids. ""What do you think, Timmy? Will christmas ever be the same?"" Maybe they're having nightmares. Wouldn't that be great? I thought we were doing that museum piece. That diamond from Egypt. We can do the Museum anytime, Jerry. This is the story. Cop shoots Santa Claus. I feel like I won the damn lottery. Brandy, line two. I'm not here. He said it's about that cop, Adrian Monk. - Brandy Barber. - How you doing? - I saw your story tonight on the news. - Great, thanks for watching. Anyway, I thought you might be interested. I live near that crazy cop Monk, the one that shot Santa. Terrible thing. I don't know what the world's coming to. Yes, sir. It's a real shame. What can I do for you? I just saw him. Monk. He was in the yard behind our building. I could tell he was nervous. He was pacing around. He had a shovel. Shovel? That's Monk's building. The guy said at the blue doorway go 20 feet to the right. In front of the bench. - Fresh dirt. - Dig. Dig. It's a piece of a gun handle? No, it's not. It'sthepiece of the gun handle. We got him. Please don't put your fingerprints on the tape. That's. That piece of tape has your fingerprint on it. Don't touch the sticky part. Here we go, 16"" collar, 33"" long. For your boyfriend? No, my boss. Do you have any ""inspected by number 8""? We're kidding, right? No, we're not. - I wish we were. - You now. No no, the tape-- - Now that tape. That tape. - I know. I know.

You're doing a great job, except for the other side. It's the man who shot Santa Claus. He's right over there. He shot Santa Claus. You know, I think it's The snowflakes are all even in the bow. It's right the middle. You call that the middle? What I would like is for you to twist the ribbon to the left. Thank you, I'm in a hurry. - The left side of the bow. You're not. - Yes sir. - We're going. We're going. - We're almost done here. Now the bow's completely lopsided. Yeah, the bow's perfect. We gotta go. Hello. Why'd you do it, mister? Why'd you shoot Santa Claus? No-no-no, sweetie. It wasn't like that. The grand jury is about to convene. You know what a grand jury is? Sweetie, here. - He doesn't know. - I got a tissue.

Did you see their faces? - They hate me. - No, Mr. Monk, they don't hate you. Not really. That's definitely the guy. I now it! Let's keep walking. I think one of 'em had a rope. I can't live like this. The trial could be a year away. I have to tell them my side of the story. No, Mr. Monk. I've heard your side of the story and I love you, and I don't think it's a good idea. This is just a P.R. Problem. When your dad sold that tainted toothpaste from China, what did he do? He went on the news and he told his side of the story. He took the offensive. I can be as offensive as your father. I'm sure you can. You know, that woman Brandy Barber, she's, she's Been calling me. She wants me to do her show. I think I'm gonna do it. No no, Mr. Monk. I've seen her show. She's not a real journalist. She'll rip you apart! Natalie. You're forgetting one thing. The truth. See, I have the truth on my side. My god. Merry christmas.

That would be Trudy. She died ten years ago, didn't she? And you still haven't opened it. That's very unusual behavior, wouldn't you say? Would you like some cookies? - Yeah, so - Would you like some? We made some cookies this morning. - Festive christmas cookies. - No, thank you. You received a psychological discharge from the police department, didn't you? Yes. Yes. Mr. Monk, how does it feel to be the most reviled man in California? Bad. Have you seen these? I. - I don't think ""santacide"" is a word. - It's not. It is now, thanks to you. We've all heard Mr. Kenworthy's side of the story. He rented a Santa costume and was on that roof trying to give toys away in the true spirit of christmas. Merry christmas. You can stop saying that now. Mr. Kenworthy said you went up to that roof and just started shooting. That's not what happened. Why don't you tell us your side of the story? Thank you. Well, first off, I want to say to any children watching I did not shoot Santa Claus. That man, was not Santa Claus. There's no such thing as Santa Claus. No, that can't be good. You knew that, right? Here's the thing. That was not my gun. That was his gun. He dropped it. Then he attacked me. Is this the gun you're referring to? Where did. Where did you get that? I'm a reporter, Mr. Monk. I have my sources. It's a rather distinctive weapon, isn't it? A snub-nose.38 with an antique ivory handle. As you can see, part of the handle is missing. - Yes, it's broken. - Which brings me to my final question. We received an anonymous phone call from one of your neighbors. Which one? He didn't say. It was anonymous. He did say he saw you burying something behind your building last night. Burying something? My producer and I came by and dug it up. I have it right here. We wanted to show it to you before we turn it over to the authorities. Do you recognize it? It's a perfect fit. Do you still say it wasn't your gun? Mr. Kenworthy. It's Leland Stottlemeyer. Randy Disher. - We spoke at the hospital. - Yes, of course. - Come in. Thank you. - We thought you might want these back. So this is the north pole? It's not exactly like I pictured it. It's not the taj mahal, but it's all I need. Everything's there. Except for one rubber snake. It's for my nephew. I didn't think you'd mind. He doesn't have a nephew. - I have nephew. - He doesn't have a nephew. Benjamin. His name's Benjamin. He's nine years old. See. How's the wing? I'll live. Guess it could've been worse? Yep. I see you're still in touch with some of your old parolees. Thought you retired. Well, I call 'em when I can. - They're good guys. - Yeah, I know some of these good guys. Burglary, Grand Theft Auto Attempted murder. I help 'em out when I can. What can I say? Everybody deserves a second chance, right? What? What were you doing up there Michael, on that roof? Givin' away some toys. What can I say? I love christmas! Come on, Buddy. There's nobody here. It's just you and me. - And me. - And him. Is that why you're here? To accuse me of something? Why don't you take a hike? Both of you! That gun was found in your friend's back yard, not mine. Yeah, that may be true. But here's the problem, Kris Kringle. Either you're lying or Adrian Monk is lying. Merry christmas. Merry christmas. Merry christmas. Thank god! That man has a knife! Yeah, I know. Well, apparently she did not go gentle into that good night. We found this can of pepper spray under her body. Witnesses? Couple of neighbors said they heard some screaming. One said she heard a clanging sound. - Clanging? - That's the guy! That's Adrian Monk! Crawl back under your rock! It's all right. Just ignore them. Just pretend like they're not there. Why did you shoot Santa Claus? Hey, Monk, how many reindeer you kill today? Okay, her name is Alice Dubois. She's 64, retired teacher, she lived here in apartment b17 with a beagle and some house plants. She worked part time in the macmillan Museum in the gift shop. Hey! Hey, gimme a break! - I didn't shoot anyone! - Randy. Randy, what are you doing? They're lumping us all together. So what do you think? Wrong place, wrong time? I don't think so. No, he was waiting. Waiting for her. These cigarette butts He was camped out here for probably 48 minutes. - 48 minutes? - Yeah, look. The ends are all smooshed in. I only see one match. He was chain-smoking. Eight cigarettes. Figure six minutes per cigarette. - 48 minutes. - Yeah. How do you live with yourself, monster! Hey. Hey, who threw that? - Who threw that egg? - Oh, my god! It's okay. I'm all right. I got it right here on my sleeve. - Who threw the egg? And right here. - Yeah. And here. And then I got some here. Is that gonna come out? Is that gonna come out! Is that gonna come out. Who would bring an egg to a crime scene? You two wait across the street. Wait across the street. Cover them, protect 'em. God. Hey, those are my wipes. You can use them if you want to. What? - Brian. - Mr. M? Do you have a cause of death? It's unofficial. It looks like blunt trauma. Eight, maybe nine hits. - From what? - You tell me. Something sharp and heavy. - Curved edge. - Weird, huh? - Maybe a frying pan? - Or a bell. A bell? - What is it? - She was hit on the right side. So that means the attacker was left-handed, right? Or his right arm was in a sling. A sling. Look, there's Candy Canes on the ground. There's three impressions like from a tripod. One of those charity collection pots. - Mr. Monk, what are you saying? - I think I know who did this. Who? Santa Claus. - Who? - Santa Claus! No, not again! No! No! No! No! No, Mr. Monk, please no. All right, ladies. Let's do it again. From the top. How's the arm? We'll find a doctor when we get to ecuador. Were supposed to be in ecuador four days ago, sippin margaritas on the beach. We caught a bad break, a minor setback. I thought that was your job, Mr. Mastermind. To anticipate minor setbacks. Well how was he supposed to know that cop Adrian Monk was gonna be there? Would you forget about Monk? It was a fluke. But the plan is solid. Thorn and me took care of the old lady. Yeah, she won't be coming to work tomorrow. She had a death in the family. Carl, did you call your boss at the museum? No problem. I'll be working the gift shop 2:00 to 6:00. That's it then, we go tomorrow. Closing time, 6:00. Okay, I made a list. Did you check it twice? Adrian, you've got to stop blaming yourself. What happened on that roof is not your fault. If the man attacked you, then it's self defense. Nobody believes me. My word against Santa Claus. But you think it was the same man, this Mr. Kenworthy, who killed the woman in pacific heights last night. But you haven't told the authorities. I will. I. I will. Soon as I'm sure. What? Are those toys? Yeah, I've been seeing a lot of children this week ever since. Ever since I went on television and said there is no Santa Claus. How are they doing, the kids? The kids are fine. Children are very resilient, Adrian. Although I might ask you to leave by the side door today. I understand. They hate me. Everybody hates me. I thought I was alone before. I didn't know what alone meant. This is alone! Now I get it. Well, where's Natalie? She's at Randy Disher's christmas party with everybody else. - You weren't invited? - I was invited. I just don't want to see anyone. Adrian, I know how difficult this is for you. I was worried about you even Even before all this happened. I know it's ten years since Trudy. Trudy. Trudy loved christmas. Yeah, you mentioned that. Every christmas morning, she'd set the alarm. We'd go outside and watch the sun come up. Trudy used to say Christmas made the whole world seem softer. Softer. I like that. What about before Trudy? What was christmas like when you were growing up? Dark, desperate. The pain was unrelenting, thank you for asking. Adrian, they can't all have been that bad. Pick a year. '64, good choice. mom was sick. Dad was. Dad was dad. Ambrose locked himself in the basement. He's no fool. Christmas morning, I got one gift. A walkie talkie. Well those can be fun. - I had a pair of those. - Not a. Not a pair. Dad said I only need one because I didn't have any friends. Just onewalkie One walkie talkie. What? I think I know why Kenworthy was on that roof. I have to go. I have to call Natalie. I'll. I'll see you tuesday morning. Merry christmas! Adrian, no, not, not that - Door. - Bobby, it's him. It's the bad man. He killed Santa Claus! What are we doing here? - I Hate that man! I don't get it. What does this all have to do with a pair of walkie talkies? Not a pair. Not a pair. One walkie talkie. See, that's the key. I remember when Disher was going through that big toy bag. There was one walkie talkie, but it wasn't one of the toys. Kenworthy was using it! He was talking to somebody! So he was a lookout? No, no, not a lookout. He was dressed like Santa and throwing stuff off the roof. A lookout is usually a little more discrete. - Well, what, then? - He was a diversion. He was stopping traffic. He was blocking that intersection down there so the cops couldn't get through. Look. Oh my god, - the macmillan museum! - It's three blocks away. They were robbing it, or at least they were about to. The star of Bethlehem. - But I didn't hear about any Robbery. - That's because there wasn't a Robbery. I interrupted them, so they called it off. But I think they're gonna try it again. How do you know? Alice Dubois, the woman who was killed. She worked at that museum, remember? It's just a truck. Somebody must've broken down. Oh, my god. Mr. Monk, he's using a walkie talkie! Call the captain. They're trying it again. We're rolling in five, four, three This is Brandy Barber at the macmillan museum. There's still time to see the star of Bethlehem, the second largest diamond in the known world. But you Better Hurry. It'll be leaving San Francisco tomorrow night and heading back to its permanent home in cairo, Egypt. Many consider the stone a holy relic because it was discovered 120 years ago on christmas morning. That's great. We got it. Thank you. Merry christmas! That's him. That's the bad Santa. Merry christmas! He's got the diamond. Call the Captain! Call him back. Tell him to stop the orange truck. - Where, where are you going? - I'm going after Santa. No, no, not again! Wait, Mr. Monk! Are you sure? I mean 100,000% sure? It's hard on me too! Come on, Jerry! Stop him! Stop him! Stop that Santa Claus! That guy has a lot of issues with christmas.

What's this thing worth? About $30 million. The star of Bethlehem diamond You should hold it. A symbol of hope and peace to millions of people, would've been lost to the world forever had it not been for the bravery of one man, former detective Adrian Monk. Mr. Monk, Adrian.

"What's the big surprise? I'm finally going to do it. I'm gonna take the plunge. Oh my God! You're going to buy a cell phone? No, beeper. A beeper? - It's all you need. - No, Mr. Monk uses beeper anymore. - They are former history. - Dr. Kruger has one. Well, except for doctors. Doctors use them because they work anywhere - They are more reliable. - Reliable is good. That's what we want. So when you are out with Julie, or you are on a date, - I can beep you. - Hold on, hold on! The beeper's for me? Yeah, it's only $29 a month, you can afford it. And you want me to pay for it? That's your big surprise. Are you. Are you surprised? You know what's kinda sad? I'm not. Sorry. Over there, Mr. Monk. That couple over there. He's been on the news all week, their daughter was murdered. Mr. Monk, they're staring at you. I think they want to hire you. They want you to solve the case. No, thank you. Mr. Monk, you can't say no. This was their daughter. You know how busy I am. I'm doing my tags, I'm rotating the coach, cushions, I'm just going to tell them I can't do it. They are gonna start crying, right? Probably. They are gonna show me pictures of their daughter, pictures of her when she was a kid, pulling a little red wagon. Probably a dog in the wagon, there's always a dog. Then, they going to start begging, offering me all the money they have, and they just get to go on, and on, and on police can't do anything, you're the only one who could help us. The crying and the weeping and the pleading. Okay, fine. Fine, you win! I'll take the case. Saison 6 - Episode 11 Mr Monk Joins a Cult. So she was killed over there. Yeah. Under that tree, on that picnic table. I've got the case file in the car. It's full of not-very-pretty pictures. - How long ago? - Wednesday night. So five days. I figured you'd wanna talk to the guy that found her. This is Donovan. - Captain? - Yeah. - You remember tom Donovan? - I do. Mr. Donovan, thank you for coming. This is Natalie Teeger, and Adrian Monk. Mr. Monk has been hired by the Clark family to look into the case, if you wouldn't mind. Yeah, I feel like a broken record. It was about 1:00 a.m. I was coming back home from Sacramento. Tom and his wife own a restaurant supply company in Rockaway. He travels a lot. That's right. I pulled in here to use facilities. Was a long drive he was drinking lots of coffee, and the facilities. Randy Mr. Donovan came all this way. He's doing us a favor. I think we ought to let him tell the story. I was just filling in the gaps. Go on. I got a good look a them in my headlights, there five or six of them. One was clearly the leader. They call him ""father."" Go on. They were holding her down on that. That picnic table over there. They were stabbing her. She was screaming. They carved a Symbol of the sun into her chest. I mean, it was like their logo. They saw me, they ran to their van, and drove away. Big silver van. Which is what they always drive. Go on. She was still breathing. I put her in my car. Drove her to the hospital. At least I tried to. She died before we got there. Did she say anything before she died? Unfortunately no. - Yes. - Yes. She whispered something. She said ""he found me, father found me."" Thank you very much, mr. Donovan. You're welcome. Would you give us a minute? Yes, sir. Does all that check out? Yeah, so far. We, found hair on the picnic table, and a lot of blood. - Hers? - Yeah. We had a lineup yesterday. Brought in the father, Donovan picked him out. Positive I.D. What do we know about this ""father""? Well, his real name is Ralph Roberts, he used to sell used cars. Can you believe it? Before he went into the son of god business. Nice work if you can get it. God, just the name creeps me out. Siblings of the sun. Yeah. Though we've been talking to Amanda Clark's parents, and their daughter left the cult about a year ago. ""Escaped"" is more like it. Apparently father got pissed off. He doesn't like it when people start thinking for themselves. The parents said she was scared to death. She was sure he was gonna try to find her. Well, that checks out, cause she changed her name, she moved to north beach, rented a basement apartment, and started working off the books. Doing what? She became a member of the world's oldest profession. Stone mason? No, prostitute. So what else do you need? A little something called evidence. I'm guessing father had an alibi. Father has a hundred alibis. We've been talking to his so-called children, and every one of them swears that he never left the compound on wednesday night. Send somebody in. I wish I could, but the commissioner won't sign off on it. These people have, like, and they love suing cops. Wait, so that's it? You're just giving up. I'll do it. I'll go undercover. Forget it, Monk. It's a cult. You wouldn't last 20 minutes. This guy Roberts is a Svengali. He brainwashes people. I think I can handle myself. Don't take this personally Monk, but you're about the most Gullible person I know. Gullible? Gulli-- ? Come on. Well, it's not just my opinion. I was talking to Joey Heatherton, and she agrees with me. Joey Heatherton, the singer? Joey Joey Heatherton, can you believe it? Joey Heatherton. Okay, I'll do it. Thank you. Well, there they are. My new family. I might not see you for a while, are you gonna be okay? You're going undercover, and you're worried about me? Yes, I am. You have a point. I'm gonna need food. No, already stocked up. There's plenty of food. Beverages. I need beverages. There's 50 bottles of water under the sink. I asked the captain to check on you every day. Okay, then. - I think we're ready. - Okay. - Hello. - Hello. Do you live around here? Yeah. What is all this? We're a community of brothers and sisters, working to make the world a better place. Would you like a Pamphlet? A Pamphlet. How much are they? It's free. Go ahead, go ahead. She loves Pamphlets. Why don't you read it. The siblings of the sun. - What's your name? - Natalie. And do you have any family in the area, Natalie? No, it's just me. - He's nobody. - I'm nobody. Just an old friend. I literally just bumped into him. - Crashed. - Yeah. It's tough, isn't it? Without loved ones nearby. You must feel so disconnected. It's really funny. We were just talking about that. About how she feels disconnected, remember? - Exactly. - Would you like questionnaire? We could do it here, or you could come with us. We have our own ranch up the coast. I think you'd really enjoy it. My gosh. Your own ranch? I've never been to a real ranch. ""World's Greatest mom.""

Bring the van. What are you doing? This was supposed to be me. Well, they don't want you. This is plan B. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I got them right where I want them. They think i'm some kind of boob. Adrian! Time to go. Can I sit up front? I always sit up front. - Of course you can sit up front. - Yeah. Whatever you want, Adrian. Whatever makes you happy.

We make extra money selling flowers in town. They seem happy. Of course they're happy. It's easy to be happy, Adrian. All you have to do is let yourself go. You know, I used to be like you. My whole life was stress. Numbers, and money, I was depressed all the time. I was living on the street, like an animal. What happened? We found father. It was that simple. - Praise be he. - Praise be he. So everybody here is happy? There he is. He sure doesn't seem worried. About what? By the girl who was killed. - According to the newspapers. - The devil rags. That's what I meant, thank you, the devil rags. The police think he might have been involved. Does he ever talk about the case? Not to us. Did you know her well, the girl who died? Sister Clark betrayed us all. Amanda Clark didn't die last week. As far as we're concerned, she's been dead for over a year. She died the day she left. And that's the new dining hall. Are you hungry?

And you were there all night, right? I never left. You're sure. You could see him. Well, no, but I heard him. I heard him talking. To. To who? Well, talking to god. Yeah.

Read it. The more you read it, the more you know. The more you know The less you don't know. - The more you know, the. - The less you don't know. Ted. Hello, brother Ted, i'm talking to you. I could book you for obstruction right now. Are you listening to me? Lieutenant, are you listening to yourself? Meditate on this, we know Amanda Clark was one of father's favorites, one of the chosen children. They lived together for a year and a half. That was her choice. Plus we have an eye witness who saw father at that rest stop, that night. - Impossible. - He was stabbing her, Ted. An he's been positively identified. Father hasn't left the ranch in three weeks. How do you know that? He never leaves for harvest season. Really? Never. What if he gets sick, and he has to go to the hospital? Father doesn't get sick. He's never even had a headache. He's going to live forever. He is the eternal one. The nurturing light. The nurturing light. What if he got hit by a bus? I bet would put his nurturing light out pretty quick wouldn't it? There are no buses on the ranch. What if a bus careens off the highway, you know smashes through the fence rolls onto the farm, runs him over? The highway is seven miles away. What if it careens seven miles? It can't careen seven miles. I've seen vehicles Careen a pretty long way. - Not seven miles. - It's possible. I once saw a truck lose his breaks on route 15, near Avalon Mountain, it's started careening in full spee. Hey! Hey, you listening to me, Ted? Philipsburg, careening in Philipsburg. Do you know where Philipsburg is, Ted? Natalie, where is Monk? Change of plans. It was a last-minute thing, but Mr. Monk joined the cult. - He what? - I couldn't help it. They wanted him. Of course they wanted him, Natalie. He's like play-doh to them. No, no, no. He seemed okay. He waved like he was okay as he got into the van. - He did. - He waved like. Come here, Natalie. Look at this guy. He was considered a genius. Now he's a complete basket case. Can you imagine what they're doing to Monk? Don't underestimate mr. Monk. He's a lot stronger than you think. Okay. As you people know, I have never been sick a day in my life. - People ask me - Yes. How do I do it. What is my secret? Is there some sort of special prescription? Some sort of New age medicine? No, the only medication I've been taking is four milligrams of the light! To be taken as needed. We have a new member of the family. I want you to welcome him. Brother Adrian, I am sensing fear.

I'm free. - Randy, hang up the phone. - I'm on hold, just waiting - to get one of the representatives. - I don't care. - I found him. - Mr. Monk? Yeah. - Thank god. Is he okay? - I don't know. It's complicated. - Where is he? - He's at the airport. He sold me this. I barely recognized him. He was wearing one of those yellow shirts, and he was smiling. - Did you talk to him about the case? - Yeah I tried. I took him aside. I said, ""did you learn anything?"" - What did he say? - He said, ""Leland, I've learned everything."" That's not good. And he kept smiling. That's not good. They all have ten petals. Ten petals. Beautifully done. Well done. Monsoon. Make sure they're all diagonally cut. Brother Zack. Brother Zack what are you doing? You're mixing the Gloriosa lies with the calathiums. Sorry. We cannot afford any mistakes. I promised father we'd sell a thousand of these by the end of the week. Don't worry. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. I like you, Zack. I like your enthusiasm. You remind me of myself when I first got here. You've only been here. I'm gonna tell father how well you're doing. Brother Adrian! Sister Sally, brother Ted, it's a beautiful day in paradise. Father wants to see you. Adrian, come in. Would you like some tea? I have five cups a day. It's my only vice. No, no, no. Thank you. You should be honored. Most of my children never set foot in here. It's charming. How did it go at the airport? Nine hundred dollars. Excellent. And the train station? Not so good. 70, maybe 75. Brother Zack, he's meek. They say the meek shall inherit the earth. They say many things. That is why we cleanse. It's not boiling. You're unplugged. That's all. Hold on. I'll do it. Please, let me. You dropped this? Must have fallen off a pen. Adrian. Is there something you wanna tell me? Sister Gina has a radio. No. About yourself. I am not an idiot. I read the papers. I know the name Adrian Monk. The police sent you, didn't they? I'm sorry about what happened to Amanda Clark. I was angry when she left, and hurt, I don't deny that. I might have said some Intemperate things, but I did not kill that girl. I did not have her killed. Go back to your Captain Stottlemeyer, and you tell him he's making a mistake. You tell him to look some place else. I can't, I can't, I I can't leave. I can't leave. Father, please. It's true. When I came here, I was working on the case. But that isn't me. Not anymore. I can see that now. I belong here with all of you. I love it here. I love Not thinking. Cause I'm so tired of thinking. Please Just, please. Okay. You can stay. It's okay. You don't have to think. Thank you. I'm so thankful. I'm gonna make you prove that. - Is this all you have? - I wish I had more. - What about your brother? - Ambrose? - Doesn't he own his own house? - Yeah, I could talk to him, but. Natalie? - Mr. Monk, it's for your own good. - What are you? Hey, wait! What are you doing? You can't do this! Brother Adrian! Believe in father, father will set you free! Brother Adrian! Hello. Mr. Monk, are you hungry? You can't keep me here. It's against the law. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. We didn't know what else to do. Father warned us this would happen. Here. You haven't eaten all day. What is it? Chicken pot pie. It's your favorite. I don't eat anything I haven't grown myself. You don't know me At all. Yes, I do. I'm here because you don't know you. Natalie If you let me go now, I won't press charges. I promise. Please, just eat something. Please, just eat. I'll get a wipe. He wouldn't eat. He'll eat. Eventually. He acted like I was trying to poison him. I feel like the mother in ""the exorcist."" Leland, why don't you go in and talk to him. But, leave your watch here so that he doesn't know what time it is. We want to keep him disoriented. That shouldn't be too hard. How you doin'? What's the matter? Father got your tongue? I brought you a gift. You remember the Amanda Clark case. Remember her parents? And the promise that you made? Maybe you remember this. What was done to her. It wasn't him. Look, we've got an eyewitness. He was seen attacking her. She was 22 years old. It couldn't have been him. As father says, we don't hate our enemies, we pity them. Well, it looks like your father pitied this poor girl to death. I pity you, Leland. Father please protect me. Father please - Hey, Monk. - Father please protect me. Father please Monk! Guess I'm up. Let's do it. Hey, Monk, how's it going'? Hello, Randy. Listen, I just Have a couple of things to say about this so-called father of yours I think the guy's a joke. I mean, have you read this? Have you? - Father please correct me. - God, he's singing again. That's not Monk. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Father please mend me. - Father please correct me. - Randy? - Randy? - Father please correct me. Randy! Thank you, randy. We'll meet you back in the living room. Thank you, really. Nice, nice job. Good work. Thank you, Randy. Thanks for coming. I Should go to the bank. Someone wanna keep an eye on Randy? - I'm not afraid of you. - Good. No reason to be. Can I sit down? The siblings of the sun. You know, I had some dealings with them. About three years ago, they tried to recruit Harold Krenshaw, but Harold was too smart for them. Nice try, doc. I know all your tricks. Psychiatry was invented by the devil. Really? - See, I, i didn't know that. - That is not just my opinion. - That's a fact. - A fact? Like, like all the facts in this book. Likeoh, ""money begets envy. Envy is the root of all evil. "" you believe that? If it's in the book. Cause the father doesn't believe it. He's worth 20 million bucks. He lives in a cabin. He has seven other houses. Adrian They did a An expose on him last year. See, now, this here is a little shack in the Cayman Islands. He owns parking lots, karate schools, a cable news channel. Looks like your messiah's been a pretty busy guy. He's using you, Adrian. That's what he does. That's all he does. I love him. He's taught me what love really means. That's funny. That's what you used to say about Trudy. I wonder what she would say if she were here. She's not here. Father's here. Well, then I guess we can just throw this out, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Trudy. Welcome back. Your beeper. Yeah, sorry. Doctors have to carry them. You're all right? I think I just solved the case. Mr. Donovan. Hello, again. Captain Stottlemeyer. Sorry to bother you, sir. I'm not. I'm not sorry at all. W, what's going on? Is there any news? You remember Adrian Monk? He just spent five days with Ralph Roberts at the sibling ranch. Good. What did you learn? Two things, people don't like being stopped at the airport, and you're hiding something. You killed her. Didn't you? John? Is everything all right? I'm not sure. My wife Susan. These men are with the police. They just accused me of murdering that poor girl. What? You must be joking. Everyone knows who killed her. It was that wack-job. - That cult leader. - I thought so too, ma'am. We all did, but that wack-job was definitely 140 miles away in his cabin on the night of the murder. We know that father was there, because he wasn't alone. I remembered something. One of the cult kids, brother Zack, said he was sitting outside the cabin all night. He said he heard a microwave beeping from inside. What the hell are you talking about? I was in that cabin. There are a couple of lamps. There's a hot plate. - There is no microwave oven. - What the boy heard was a beeper. It belonged to a doctor, making a house call. Father has trouble bending down and that explains the plastic cap it was from a syringe. Father has a bad back. It's a big secret, of course. He's supposed to be the eternal one, who never gets sick. He even built a secret door in the wall so that doctors could go in and out without being noticed. I remember seeing a ridge in a dirt behind his cabin. We found the doctor. He's an osteopathic surgeon named Wesserman. He goes to the ranch once a week to give father a cortisone shot. See, father has a beautiful alibi that he can't tell anybody. Okay, so maybe it isn't this man, this this father person. That doesn't mean that tom was involved. Your husband swore that he saw father at that rest stop. He picked father out of a lineup twice. Now, if father wasn't there, that means your Husband is lying - and I like to know why. - Okay, this is ludicrous. My Husband is a hero. He tried to save that woman. He drove her to the hospital. Look, look. This just came in the mail. I can prove it. It's a traffic ticket. He must have run a red light. They have one of those automatic cameras. That's him and that's the girl. That proves it, right? Yes, ma'am. I'm afraid it does. Where's the car? This is the car you were driving? It hasn't been cleaned or anything? It's been here all week. It's a company car. We were gonna have it cleaned and reupholstered on monday. Oh, my god. That poor girl. - Could I have that back, please? - I'm afraid not. This picture is material evidence in a homicide. In fact, I think this is the key to the whole case. This is the motive. This is why you killed her. Here's what I think happened. - Amanda Clark was a sex prostitute. - A what? A sex prostitute. As opposed to what? Monk, just keep going. You were with her that night. You drove through that intersection. You saw a camera flash. You knew your picture had just been taken. A picture of you and her. As you said, it's a company car, which meant they'd be sending the ticket here to the office, which meant your wife would see it, and she would not be happy. You got that right. Somehow, you were gonna have to explain this photograph. Amanda must have told you about her past, about her life in the cult. You realized you could kill her and blame it on the whacked-out cult leader. He was the perfect fall guy. Everybody knew Amanda was afraid of him. That's it? That's just a story. Where is your proof? This isn't proof. It's not even a good picture. It's all dark, it's all grainy. - You can't see anything. - You can see the seatbelt. She was wearing a seatbelt. So what? She was dying. I put her in my car, I buckled her seatbelt. You're saying this photograph was taken on the way to the hospital after she was attacked? That's right. This woman was stabbed ten times. She was bleeding all over the seat. That's right. So this seatbelt, the seatbelt she was wearing in this photograph, should be covered in blood, am I right? That's gonna be hard to explain. - I'd say impossible. - Mr. Donovan, you're under arrest. Come with me, please, sir. Be careful with the bags. You're crushing everything. - Don't squeeze too hard. - Mr. Monk, they're heavy. Well, why didn't you make two trips? Brother Adrian! It's okay. I just wanted to thank you in person. You cleared my name, brother. You answered my prayers, you lifted my burden like the Angel Gabriel. I have some sherbet here. It's gonna melt. Would you like to come home? No, th, No thank you. Well, just think about it. In the meantime, if there is anything I can do for you. Anything at all. Just say the word. There is something. - Name it. Anything. - Your shoelace is untied. My shoelace? I'd like you to bend down and tie your shoe. Right now, in front of your children, I want you to bend down, and tie your shoe. Can you do that for me? Maybe a little cortisone shot would help. Or we could call dr. Wesserman, right? Dr. Seth Wesserman of Sausalito. He's been treating father for years. Call him. The more you know, the less you don't know. Isn't that right? So long, pops. - We sure showed him. - We sure did. You did good, boss. Oh, my god! Did you stop that check? Yeah, I already called the bank. We sure showed him? We sure did. You did good. You did really, really good."
"They got nerve. Right in front of the sign.  Looks like the city just made an easy $85.  What are you doing?  This place got held up yesterday.  I remember.

Look!  Mr. Monk, it's a fire hazard.  Natalie, I've had that toaster for 27 years.  I'll just call a repairman.  No, no, no, there's no such thing, Mr. Monk. Nobody fixes toasters anymore.  You can buy a new one for $30.  $30?  $30?  Or you could see your house burn down around you.  Well, I am renting, so  Let's see what kind of year we have.  Sharon, I've just been talking with police officials.  According to a department spokesperson, a Masked Gunman  forced his way into this branch  of the west bay trust here on vinton street.  Mr. Monk, isn't that your bank? Just as they were opening for the day.  That Gunman then shot one bank teller, and forced the other employees  to break open the safety deposit boxes.  Natalie, that's my bank!  As we get additional details, we'll bring them to you live right here.  Hang in there, okay?  Don't worry about a thing.  Take good care of that girl.  I'm sorry. I thought this was a crime scene.  Take it outside.  - How's the teller doing? - Stabilized through and through.  She's a lucky girl.  Hello!  I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer. How you folks doing?  I could use a drink.  I'm sure you could.  - We'll try not to keep you too long. - How's Jasmine?  Jasmine. Is that the teller?  She's gonna be fine.  Whatever they're paying her, it ain't enough.  That's for sure.  So I'm gonna have to get a statement from each of you individually.  Now?  Why aren't you out there trying to find that son of a bitch?  - She's right! - The guy's crazy!  He shot her. How could he shoot her? She was giving him all the money.  Well, look, we're gonna do the best that we can.  But it starts with you,  okay? I'm gonna need your help.  You the Manager?  Yes.  I'll start with you. Can I use your office?  So,  where do I start?  Well, the Gunman came in at 9:05. Let's start at 9:04.  I just unlocked the door.  I was flipping the open sign when this guy pushed right.  Can you describe?  A white guy. Large.  He must have been six foot.  - What was he wearing? - A green hooded sweatshirt and a mask.  He made me lock the door and pull the shade.  He had his gun pointed at Mr. Crawley the whole time.  And he made us empty all the drawers.  I'll never forget his voice.  He had an accent. Definitely russian. Very thick.  Just off the boat.  He had a big bag. We were filling it.  I saw Jasmine reach for the silent alarm.  He must have seen her.  It all happened so fast.  Then what did you do?  He made us all lie down on the floor.  Even Jasmine.  She was still bleeding.  And crying.  He had a drill and he was breaking open the deposit boxes.  It seemed like forever.  I thought I was gonna give birth right there.  He told us not to move for five minutes, and then he left out the back.  But we were too worried about jasmine.  As soon as he was gone, mr. Crawley pulled the alarm.  Okay,  thank you very much.  Is that it?  Yep.  Unless you can think of something else.  If we think of anything, we'll call you.  Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?  It's a boy.  Good for you. Got names picked out?  We haven't decided yet.  What's your name?  Leland.  We haven't decided yet.  Okay, thank you very much.  Okay.  So you didn't see anything?  I told you, I didn't even get here until 10:30.  Excuse me, Lieutenant Disher, SFPD.  You got a pretty good view the bank from here. We're investigating a Robbery  that took place earlier this morning.  Sir?  Sir, this is official police business. It'll just take a minute.  If you're not too busy.  All right, I know you can hear me.  Look, I just saw you blink. You blinked.  I get it.  Normally we don't pay for information.  So what time did you arrive at the park this morning, sir?  Okay, you know what, pal?  I can get crane down here in 20 minutes, lift you up and drag you downtown.  - It's my break. - Thank you. That's more like it.  This is my job.  I mean, how would you like it if I came down to your office and got all  in your face?  Was I here?  Yeah, I was here.  I've been here all day. I'm here every morning.  Even sundays.  Good, did you see anything unusual around 9:00?  Yeah, I saw a guy. About 5'10"", green hoodie.  He was hanging out, pacing around.  Looked kind of nervous.  And then he went inside. Good, did you get a look at his face?  He had his hood up, sorry.  Okay, hood up. And then what happened?  About ten minutes later the alarm went off and I saw  what are you doing?  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, don't. Don't do that.  Hey, we're not done here.  What did you see?  Captain, what are you doing here?  The Robbery squad was shorthanded, so Randy and I took the call.  No dead bodies. It's nice.  Sir, I'm sorry. The bank isn't open.  I heard about the Robbery. Is the Manager here, mr. Crawley?  Mr. Crawley is busy right now.  - If you come back tomorrow - Mr. Crawley!  Peter. Yes, Mr. Monk.  I heard about the Robbery. It must have been terrible for you.  It was terrible. Awful. Did you hear about Jasmine Dadlani?  He shot her in the arm.  - I was - Is this gonna be a long story, Peter?  No, I guess I'm done.  Kind of worried about my safe deposit box.  Box number 100. Number 1-00.  We haven't done a full inventory yet.  Why don't we take a look?  No.  Trudy's bracelet.  Is was her grandmother's. She wore it all the time.  - Do you have insurance? - No, I  didn't need insurance. I put it in the bank.  Is god as my witness  I'm getting it back.  What do you say.  Randy, give it a rest.  We must have put 80 bucks in that can.  For three hours work, tax free?  The guy makes more money than I do.  Just doing nothing. Standing there.  I can do that.  Yes, you can.  Well, I'm gonna do it.  After work. Do it part time.  Pick up a couple of bucks.  You're gonna be a living statue?  Yes, I am.  Good for you.  But how are we supposed to know what job you're doing?  I'll be painted silver.  How hard can this be?  Captain, Mr. Monk wants to show you something.  - And where is Mr. Monk? - In your office.  I hate it when he does that. I told him not to go in there without me.  I don't know why he gets so upset.  It's not like he's gonna mess up anything.  Randy.  What are you doing?  Hello? Are you all right?  My gosh. Tickle tickle tickle.  All right.  I'm taking these two pencils and I'm gonna stick 'em up your nose.  That's number one.  And number two.  Our tax dollars at work.  Lieutenant.  Come in.  Why don't you just make yourself at home?  - Natalie said you wouldn't mind. - What the hell does  Doesn't matter, leland, take a breath.  Yeah, you know how to work this? It's stuck.  Yes, I do.  Yeah, good. Have you seen this?  Only about 20 times. It's useless.  Can't see anything a plant's in the way.  Exactly! Leland,  that's my bank! I know that lobby.  That fichus tree has been sitting in the corner for ten years.  It's never been moved until today.  This morning, before the gunmen came in.  Somebody moved it in front of the surveillance camera.  Before the Robbery?  Also, the Russian went out the back door and the alarm didn't sound.  So somebody disconnected it.  Yeah, that one we caught.  And there is a gate out back at the end of the alley.  It was unlocked. Somebody unlocked it.  So the Russian's not alone. He's got an inside man.  If I can find the inside man, he'll lead me to the Russian.  And the Russian leads me to Trudy's bracelet.  Trudy's bracelet.  I should have known.  Well, I gotta get into that bank. I gotta have a look around.  Well, Monk, you just can't go hang out at a bank.  It's a place of business. People don't like it  if you just go and hang out in their office.  Maybe they need a security guard.  You know, after today, I bet they do.  Looks like you're gonna get to wear a badge again.  - Good morning. - Morning.  Gloria, would you call downtown and check the rates on this?  - Mr. Monk. - Ma'am.  How are you doing?  Can't complain.  I wanna thank you again for helping us out.  It's just for a day or two.  Well, it means a lot to us.  After what happened yesterday,  I feel a lot safer with you here.  You do.  Of course I do.  Who wouldn't?  That's a good question.  One of you doesn't want me here.  But which one?  Who is the inside man?  Excuse me, could you use this pen?  Why?  That one's not working.  What are you talking about? It's working fine.  Please, Please, Please.  You're making me very nervous.  Where did they find you?  It's my first day.  Where were you yesterday, when they need you?  That's a nice car, Peter. Is that what you drive?  I wish.  I can barely afford the model.  - I'm depositing this. - No problem.  $98. I'll just be a second.  $98?  That's right.  What's this?  Make it an even hundred.  Well, that's what I call service.  - Are you allowed to do that? - Sure.  He can.  I'd like to cash this.  $496.  - 500. - Thank you.  Next in line!  Next in line.  I'm waiting for her.  That's it. I'm broke.  Mr. Monk!  - Hello. - Look at you!  A man in uniform. You look great!  - Look at you! - Okay.  Look at you!  - Natalie, stop it. - Look at you!  Don't make me shoot you.  How's it going?  I'm down $400. Do you have any cash? I didn't have a chance to get to the bank.  No, did you find the accomplice? The inside man?  Maybe.  Well, who is it?  Wait, don't tell me. Let me figure it out.  Next in line!  Her. The pregnant woman.  It's always the ones you least expect.  Gloria morales.  Good guess, but wrong.  No, she's not strong enough.  The inside man had to move this ficus tree to block that security camera.  What about Madge?  Same problem. She couldn't move the tree. She's got a bad back.  What about him? He looks pretty strong.  That's Leon Harrison.  He could probably move the tree, but he's too short.  Too short? Yeah.  The inside man had to trip the breaker to disengage the alarm.  He goes to the back door  The junction box is behind this cabinet, which is bolted to the floor.  I tried, but  I just can't reach it.  So the inside man has to be taller than me.  What about her? She's Pretty Tall.  Tiffany Preston.  It's her, isn't it? God, kids today.  - I blame the parents, really. - No no, Natalie, it's not her.  She is tall enough.  But the inside man also had to unlock the back gate.  Tiffany just started working here, so she doesn't have that key.  But that's everybody. There's no one left.  Not quite.  Mr. M. Anybody Miss me?  I didn't think so.  You remember Peter Crawley. The branch Manager.  Three and a half hours. That is a long lunch break.  Natalie.  You see that blue ticket? That's from a parking garage.  Why would he use a parking garage? He has a private space right out front.  Oh, my god. The back of his neck.  It's sunburned.  So?  He just bought a car.  A convertible.  A car he didn't want anybody else to see.  He's strong enough.  He's tall enough.  - He has a key to the gate. - He's the guy!  You're the guy. Look at you!  Mr. Monk!  That's enough.  Screwdrivers, gloves.  Rough wrench.  Extra scroll, saw blade, glass cover. Here's the plan.  When he leaves the house,  we're gonna break in the back door. Have a look around.  Just hope he hasn't sold that  bracelet. I don't what I'd do if I lost it.  - Mr. Monk, have you been working out? - Ow, no.  You think they'll let you keep the uniform?  I don't know.  You should ask them. It looks good on you.  I used to make mitch wear his all the time.  - He'd walk out and he'd look so shiny. - What are you talking about?  Are you bantering?  Am I. I don't know, I guess a little.  I don't banter.  We were right about the new car, Jaguar.  How can you tell?  It's the Same Shape as the toy on his desk.  Well, I hope he has a good warranty because it's leaking oil.  That's not oil.  Is it blood?  Yeah.  Don't look, don't look, don't look!  - I have to look, i'm a detective. - I'm talking to myself.  Don't look, don't look.  How's it going?  Well, it's definitely the bank manager. Shot twice in the head.  - 22 caliber. - A.22, just like the teller.  Just like the teller, only she's not dead.  Looks like our russian friend never learned how to share.  Anybody ever tell you you look really sharp in that uniform?  Really, you think so? I love a clip-on.  So any sign of the Jewelry or the cash?  No, nothing yet.  Monk, I know how much that bracelet means to you.  I got two shifts of guys in there. We're ripping the house apart.  We'll be here all night if we have to be.  I appreciate that.  Well, I guess we'll be going then.  You're leaving?  It looks like you've got it covered. You don't really need me.  Since when?  I don't know, it's been a long day. I guess I'm just tired.  Call me if you find anything.  Okay.  Wait up, wait up, wait.  - Okay, what is going on? - What do you mean?  You know what I mean. What are we doing?  Trudy's bracelet could be in there.  It's a pawn ticket.  I found it in crawley's pocket.  He pawned something yesterday three hours after the Robbery. See?  - You didn't tell the Captain? - I will, I promise.  - But after we check it out. - No, no, no, no.  Natalie.  If they find that bracelet first,  it'll get locked away in some evidence room for about ten years.  Okay, go. Go.  Thank you.  Here we go!  How long was that?  How long was what?  I thought you were timing me.  I was practicing. Didn't you notice?  Nope, sorry.  Hey look, why don't you do it again?  This time I'll clock you.  Go for it. Really go for it.  See if you can't break the world's record.  - You think I can? - Absolutely.  Okay.  - Hold on. - Okay.  You ready?  And go.  I heard you the first time.  I only rang it once.  Doesn't matter, I was just closing up. Come back tomorrow.  Tomorrow's too late. Please? It's very important.  Rent-a-cop? I'm not afraid of you.  No, I'm not.  We're just here, look  We wanna redeem this.  You're not the same guy.  No, sir, the same guy is dead.  - Dead? - Deceased.  - Deceased? - He was a bank Robber.  Or at least an accomplice.  Yeah, the merchandise he sold you was probably stolen.  He said this stuff belonged to his grandmother.  - And you believed him? - I believe everybody. Store policy.  Stay here.  Mr. Monk, look, look, look!  A toaster! It's in perfect condition!  No. No, thank you.  Look, it's five dollars. Please, I'll pay for it.  Natalie, it's used. I'm not gonna make food in somebody else's toaster.  Unless I'm wrong, that's how the bubonic plague got started.  - That's not true. - I said, unless I'm wrong.  No.  No, it's not here.  Is this all he had?  Look  We're looking for a bracelet.  You see?  Nice piece.  I like the bracelet too.  Sorry.  He did say there was more where this came from.  Said he still had half a box full of stuff back in San Francisco.  Half a box?  - That's an unusual phrase. - That's what the man said.  A box.  Half a box.  What are you doing here?  You said meet us at the bank. We're meeting you at the bank.  Inside. I said inside the bank.  They just closed at 7:00.  No.  No, no, no, no, no. We gotta get in there.  There's somebody There's somebody inside.  It's Madge. Madge!  Madge.  - Madge! - Madge! Hey, it's me. Madge!  Madge!  I just heard about Peter Crawley.  I couldn't believe it. None of us could.  I worked with him for seven years.  I guess you never know anybody. Not really.  Not really.  Madge, I think Trudy's bracelet is still here in the bank.  - Still here. - Yeah. Yes.  Crawley told a Pawn Broker in Brisbane that he still had a half a box  - full of Jewelry somewhere in his - A pawn Broker in Brisbane?  I guess my cell phone was off the hook?  - Here's the thing. - Yeah, we just weren't sure.  We know how busy you are it's a big job.  It's okay.  Just a little lead. Natalie didn't think we should bother you.  It's okay. We'll talk about it later.  I don't understand.  Half a boxful. It's an unusual phrase.  Then I rembered. There are six extra large deposit boxes in that vault.  But during the Robbery the Russian only opened five.  Well, he ran out of time. He was in a hurry.  But it wasn't the last one.  The one he skipped was in the middle.  - Box 503. - The money never left the bank.  It's brilliant when you think about it. It's the last place anybody would look.  Come on, box 503.  503. 55-0  Hold on, here it is. 503.  J. A. Guar.  Jaguar. Very cute.  So this is definitely the guy. Good work.  We'll come back tomorrow with a court order.  No.  Why don't we just look right now?  Come on, we're already here. Crawley's dead. He's not gonna mind.  I don't know.  Please, just a look.  Just to see if it's in there.  Please.  It'll just take a minute.  Well,  I'll go get the master key.  You can wait in here.  Thanks, Madge.  So any sign of the Russian?  Nope.  No, we're checking the phone records,  but it's still a dead end.  What is it?  Six toothpicks.  Why six?  Looks like someone got the short end of the straw?  Oh, my god.  We gotta get out of here.  No, hey!  - Hey! - Madge!  It's pretty quiet.  My pen's out of ink.  Use mine.  Forget it.  Let's just grab some chili.  It's funny.  Whoever owns that car has no idea.  Tonight was their lucky night.  Help! Hey!  Hey, somebody!  Hey, somebody!  It's no use.  It's no use. They're not coming.  They're not coming.  - I'm gonna die right here. - No, you are not.  You're right. You're right.  You're right.  I'm gonna die over there.  I call this spot.  You can die over there.  That's it.  Monk is no longer the morale Officer.  Still no signal.  Phone lines must go through here.  Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk.  Come on, you have to  Come on, you gotta pull yourself together.  Look at me. Look at me.  We just have to make it until 9:00 am.  When the bank opens, they'll open the vault.  No, they won't.  Sure they will. Somebody will.  You don't get it.  It wasn't just Peter Crawley.  Yeah, well, obviously we know now that Madge was in on it too.  - And the Russian. - No, no, you still don't get it.  It was all of them. They were all in on it. Look,  six toothpicks!  Madge, Crawley, Jasmine, Harrison, Tiffany, Gloria.  The whole staff! They planned it together.  Here's what happened.  It was like they were putting on a play.  They must have rehearsed it for weeks.  One of them had to play the Russian. It was probably madge.  She was about the right height.  I didn't see her on the surveillance tape.  But what did the toothpicks mean?  One of them had to get shot. To make it look good.  So they were drawing straws.  I don't get it. Why did they kill the Manager?  Well, they probably had an agreement  not to spend any of the money, but Crawley couldn't resist.  Of course  We'll never know for sure.  Because we're gonna die.  You're doing great, Mr. Monk. I'm proud of you.  Julie,  must be worried sick about you.  She's at dance camp, thank god.  How's she doing?  She loves it.  She wants to be a counselor next year.  Bingo.  You were right. It never left the bank.  Okay, this is what I'm looking for.  I believe you've been looking for that.  That's really beautiful mr. Monk.  Hey, at least we'll die rich.  I don't understand.  How does a big vault like that get broken?  It's the lock, mrs. Van de camp. It's the mechanism or something.  I'm sure everything will be back to normal on monday.  Damn it, it can't do the steel.  Thank god I finished recording my demo.  I'm gonna live forever through my music.  How much longer?  Without air? Nine, maybe ten hours.  There's no air. Turned it off.  Whatever you do, don't open box 444.  Or the one directly below it.  Monk,  that bracelet's the right shape.  The diamonds might cut through the lock.  But  it's  I know, it's Trudy's bracelet. But there might be a phone line in there.  It's our only chance.  Get that necktie.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  No phone lines.  No, maybe not, but there's the next best thing.  No.  There's nobody out there.  No.  Wait.  No, there is somebody out there.  And I know he's watching.  I can feel it, you son of a bitch.  He's looking right at this thing.  I hate this guy.  Yeah, I'm here at vincent place.  In front of the bank.  I think you better get down here.  As you can imagine, Mr. Monk, it's been a public relations nightmare.  It's almost unthinkable.  Six employees, the entire branch planning something like that.  Anyway, there's anything that we can do for you, anything at all, please.  - No. - Well,  he could use a new toaster.  Yes, of course!  Of course.  Please.  Take it. Use it in good health.  It's the least we can do.  You just moved.  I saw you.  Did not.  Get off of my corner.  Okay. Come over here and make me.  You come over here.  You come here.  - You come over here. - You come over here. You come  Sucker.  I hate you. I hate you so much.  (From DSR sub)"
"Can i eat these now? Cause nobody wants crumbs on the seat. - New car? - Yep They finally signed off on her last night. After about three years of begging and pleading and weeping openly. What do you think of that color? You like it? I love that color. It's black, isn't it? No, it's Midnight Onyx. Yeah, it's got satellite radio. Eight speakers. Randy, what the hell are you doing? You're getting salt all over the hood. - Does he remind you of anybody? - No. You, you missed a spot there. You have the warrant? Right here. Okay, we're looking for a nine millimeter. Automatic, Monk thinks it's somewhere in the building. We're gonna tear the place apart top to bottom. Let's do it. Natalie, hang on to that radio. We'll call you when the place is secure. Captain? - Yeah, hang on a minute. - Captain, we need to do this. Is that a scratch? - A little dirt? - No big deal. Here, keep on eye on her for me, will ya? Speaking of cars, guess where Julie is today. - Yeah? - Driver's ed. She's taking her test tomorrow. Can you believe it? She wants me to get her a used car, but I don't know what to do. Just say no. You obviously can't afford it. Have you ever tried saying no to a teenager? - How hard can it be? - It's impossible. They're like a force of nature. It's like walking into a hurricane. Female caucasian, Julie Teeger. Repeat, all units, possible 187. The victim's name. Repeat the victim's name. Julie Teeger. Oh, my god. Oh, my god, what's a 187? Mr. Monk, what's a 187? - Homicide. - Oh my god! Just a second, Natalie what are you doing Call a cab! Wait! Wait for the cabtain. Hey, just listen to me. Natalie! Just a second. Saison 6- Episode 13 Mr. Monk and the Three Julies. Julie, honey. Honey, it's me again. - Where are you? Just pick up, pick up! - Sorry, I cannot let you go in there. I'm natalie teeger. I have to get in there. No, I might be her mother. Oh, my god. Natalie. It's not her. It's not julie. Thank god. Another Julie Teeger. What are the odds of that? Yeah, sorry about that. It's only a mirror. It's just the mirror. Leland, I'm so sorry. I heard the name, and I just thought Julie Natalie, any parent would have done the same thing. Captain, Lieutenant Frank's inside. He's the primary. He was wondering, as long as we're here Yeah, as long as we're here. I'm just gonna meet you inside. I wanna hear Julie's voice. - I don't even use my side mirrors. - Shut up. And you live right next door? That's right. I was taking a bath. My window was open. Cap. I heard screaming. It sounded like Julie. That's the victim, mrs. Teeger. Did you hear anything else? Just her screaming. Then maybe a car. I think I heard a car driving away. Okay, screaming and then a car screeching off. - What then? - Then I ran. - I came over here as soon as I could. - How did you get in? The door was open. I knew there was something wrong. Sometimes you can just tell. I found her in the foyer with that knife. Yeah, a steak knife from a rack in the kitchen. Steak knife? We-we-we gave her those knives. For christmas. Sir, would you like to sit down? Hold on, let me Let me move this stuff here. Look at the size of that handkerchief. Monk, that's not a handkerchief. That's somebody's underwear. Hey hey hey hey! - Hey hey! - He hates underwear? Yes. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. Julie! Julie! - Oh, my god, no! - Hey hey hey! Just calm down! This is a crime scene. Just calm down. A crime scene? That's my wife! What happened? We're not sure. We think maybe she interrupted a Burglary. A Burglary? In broad daylight? Who did this? You find out who did this. I will. You have my word. It's me again. Please, I need to hear your voice. Call me when you get this. Tentative id on the victim is Julie Teeger. Unit nine, could you repeat the name of the victim? Julie teeger. That's t for thomas. Teeger. Nine, this has gotta be a mix-up. We're at the teeger scene on bose street. I don't know what to tell you, buddy. I'm looking at her I.D. Right now. Julie Teeger. The picture matches. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Natalie! Natalie! What the hell's her problem? It's not her. It's not her. - Another Julie Teeger? - It's impossible. - Very nearly. - But this one is totally different. It was an accident. She was a graduate student. She was on her bike. Probably riding home. And some guy hit her and just kept on going. But her name-her name is definitely Julie Teeger, spelled the same? Actually, these kind of things happen all the time. I once took this course in statistics. There was this woman in Michigan. She won the lottery. Next day she got bit by a Shark. And what does that prove? I don't know. I ended up dropping the class. What the hell happened? It was only two miles. I took a short cut. I cut across the creek. There's no bridge across the creek. I know. There's no bridge across the creek. Yes, I know. There's no bridge across the creek. Captain, I am sorry. I will pay for everything. No, it's okay. It's insured. Yeah, remember, sir, you did say that any parent would have done the same thing. I think I need to be alone. Here. What is it? Her bike. She has all the safety features. Flashers, two mirrors. She was obviously very careful. So? So what was she doing on the wrong side of the road? Monk. Check this out. What is it? This bruise, it's square. It's from a trailer hitch. Cap. He chased her Across the park. He hit her. And then he backed up to finish the her off. He backed up? He ran her over. This was no accident. They're two homicides. Same name on the Same day. Is somebody killing Julie Teegers? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Mss Teegers, what are you doing? Turning. I could have sworn we just passed a stop sign. But I must have been imagining things. Just pull over. Sorry, I didn't see it. I can understand that. They hid it so cleverly. On top of that big post. All right, Miss teeger, let's be adventurous. Let's try a three point turn. Now, what's the first thing you do? Pray. I'm, i'm, just kidding. That was a joke. You might want to save all your prayers for your driving test tomorrow. Okay. The tree pointer Hold it! What'd you forget? Your blinker. Well Is that a big deal? I mean there's nobody around. Okay, okay. I'm using my blinker! My blinker is on! Thank god, Julie. Honey honey! You have to come with us right now! - What's going on? - Sorry, sorry. Oh, my god! It was just a blinker! She's okay. She's fine. Natalie just picked her up. She's heading home. I want a car outside of her house 24/7. Make it two cars. And a uniform at her back door. Course she's gonna feel sorry for him and invite him in. Tell him to stay outside and to stay sharp. How many Julie Teegers do you think there could be? I have no idea. We're checking the phone directories. What about children? They wouldn't all be listed. That's true. Check the schools, public and private, and birth records. The whole country? Start in California. Work your way up the coast What about women who are married who changed their names? He's right. Call social security. - You got it. When you do want it? - How about now? How about tonight? How about you get busy? Any ideas? I don't know. I don't know. All right, okay, maybe a hit man was paid to kill julie teeger. But he doesn't know what she looks like. And he's killing all of them? Monk, that doesn't track. The m. o. 's are so different. The housewife was stabbed and the graduate student was run down. I know. It doesn't make any sense. Okay, forget it. - Captain? - Yeah. Hey, Monk, I've got two ideas. - Two ideas? - Yeah, which one do you want first? The one that'll make me less pissed off. Theory a. I remembered this old case, Matthew Teeger. Guy's been committed twice for acute schizophrenia and delusions. - Any arrests? - Yeah. Assault three years ago. He attacked his stepfather. He said he was defending his mother. Apparently he's obsessed with her. Guess what her name is? Juliet Teeger. A history of violence and a mother of a psycho - I like it. - I like it too, we'll talk to this guy. What about the other idea? Said you had two. Yeah, it's just a long shot. The Terminator? Yeah, just brainstorming, you know? You think he might be a robot assassin sent from the future? Well, he was killing women with the same names. Forget it. Sarah connor, come with me if you want to live. That was T.2. Maybe we could lure him to a smelting plant on the outskirts of town. - Can I have that back, please? - And things of this nature. What is that dump? But you can tell it used to be beautilful. How could something like this happen? I don't know, maybe Natalie drove it sometimes. Hello? Mrs. Teeger? You all right? We're with the police department, ma'am. We've been trying to reach you. We have reason to believe you may be in some danger! Hello? Mrs. Teeger? Taxidermy. It's nice to have a hobby. Can't imagine growing up in a house like this. I can. All right, let's spread out. Randy, check out back. Check the basement. Monk, you check upstairs. Mrs. Teeger? Juliet? Don't be afraid. I'm with the, I'm with the police. We think young matthew might be involved something. Do you know where he is, m'am? We just want to talk to him. M'am. Have you Excuse me? Are you Are you ok? Are you? Are you dad? Please be alive. Please be alive. Please be alive. Please Please don't be one of those skeleton ladies. Please be alive. Please be alive. Please be dead. Please be dead. I just wanna thank you again for seeing me on such short notice. Were you sleeping? No, not no. Happy to do it. Your wife wasn't too happy. I could hear her in the background No, Madeline is spying, part of the job, and she knows that. Does she have tourette's syndrome? Yes. Yes, she does. So, a glass eyeball? The mother died three months ago. The son never reported it. Wait, did the son kill the mother? The doctors say no. It was a heart aneurysm. Her son, Matthew, is an amateur taxidermist. He stuffed her body. Carried her from room to room like nothing happened. Yeah, I have heard of cases like that. See, he couldn't function without her. They call it Radical cognitive bonding. At least I never dug Trudy up and had her stuffed and mounted, right? Yes, and I've always been very proud of you for that. Thank you. So, the son. Where is the son? That's the problem. He just disappeared. Do you think he's tracking down women who have the same name as his mother, - Julie Teeger? - Is that possible? Yes, Adrian, anything is possible, unfortunately. You know, Natalie must be scared to death. I brought his file with me. Hoping you could take a look at it. Adrian, remember, this isn't a patient of mine. I have never met this man. So I could only make an educated guess. We'll take it. I know. They have been parked out front all night. And lieutenant Disher is in our living room. I feel like i'm in a Spy movie. Julie, what are you doing? Talking to Katie. I told you to stay away from the window. This is not a game. Katie, I better go. My mom is having an anxiety attack. - I'll talk to you tomorrow. - And no headphones. - Why not? - I want you to be able to hear me if something happens. Mom, I really think you're overreacting. Well, that's my job. So let me just do my job. Wh-what's this? Oh, it's your homework. I had the officers pick it up from school. What? I can't go to school? So now I'm a prisoner in my own house. Why? I didn't do anything wrong. It's not fair. I know, honey. It's not Well, for how long? I don't know. Just until they catch this guy. Mr. Monk and the whole department are out there looking for him. Well, what about my driver's test? Well, we might have to reschedule that, okay? No. No no no. I have been waiting my whole life to get my license. Honey, I don't think you appreciate how serious this situation is. I don't think you appreciate this. I am taking that test tomorrow with or without your permission. How's she doing? There are two dead women named Julie Teeger and all she cares about is her driver's test. Well, maybe it's healthy. - She's living her life. - Yeah, meanwhile I'm a wreck. Vanilla fudge, my favorite. Yeah, I know. I got it from your freezer. Randy, I need to ask you a favor. - The answer is yes. - I need a gun. - The answer is no. - I know how to use it. When we lived on the base, mitch took me to the firing range all the time. So apply for a permit. No, I cannot wait two weeks. I need something now. I need something in my hand. I just feel so helpless sitting here waiting. Well, she's gonna be okay. I mean, I'm right here, so Nothing's gonna happen. She asleep? - No, not yet. - Good, let's pack her up. There's a room at the police station, with a couple of beds. The tv and you'll have her own bathroom. - What happened? - Nothing I'm being careful, that's all. Captain, something happened, you have to tell me. I'm her mother. All right. I thought it was a fairly common name. I thought there'd be a hundred others. We checked Nevada, Oregon. - Went as far east as Colorado. - And? And she's the only Julie Teeger within a thousand miles. You mean the only one left. Tape is rolling. Could you hand me a kleenex? Kills 99.9% of cold and flu viruses. Only 99.9. Randy, what are you doing? My bra's itching. How do they walk around in this stuff? This is a new low. Actually, it's not a new low. That's the sad part. He's never gonna buy this. Dr. Kroger thinks he will. Matthew Teeger has suffered a pure psychotic break. He's in complete denial. His mother never died. Not to him. The important thing is that we keep him talking. What if he has a knife? He's right. We need a code, a phrase, in case he's in trouble. How about mother of god, he has a knife? No, it needs to be covert. It needs to be conversational. Sound natural. How about, ""i wish there were ten of them""? - Ten of what? - Anything. Well, you see, Monk, I don't think anybody else would actually say that. I've heard people say that. Okay, look, here's the code. Better late than never. Yep, got it. You want to write it down? No no, I'm good. Okay, what is it? It's - Better Late than never. - Yeah, I got it, no problem. The suspect is approaching the house. He's entering through the back door. - All right, everybody wait for my signal. Hi, mama. I'm sorry I'm late. I came by earlier, there were policemen everywhere. Yes, they were looking for you, Matthew. Have burnt out again. - I'll get another one. - No no no no no, leave it, leave it. How the light hurts my eyes. Are you okay, mama? I've been crying. Crying about you, Matthew. The police, said that you've been a bad boy. Have you been doing something you shouldn't? I don't wanna talk about it. - They said that you've hurt some. - I said I don't wanna talk about it! I try to be good, mama. I do. But it's so hard. I need some sugar. - Well, you could chek the kitchen. - I need some sugar, mama. Give me some sugar. Sugar? - What are you doing? I have a cold. - Don't Hold me. Please just hold me. - There there. - I've been a bad boy. First come, first served. Out of sight, out of mind. There there. Blood is thicker than water. What are you doing? - nothing. Mommy's just trying to remember something, dear. I wish there were ten of them. Repeat, I wish there were ten of them. That's close enough. Let's go. Please, just hold me. I've been a bad boy! Clean spoon. It's a miracle. Harriet Teeger, Holda Teeger? I like Holda. It's Scandinavian. It means lovable. Wait, you want to change your name? Wouldn't you? Well, honey, i want you to be safe. That's what's most important. But I don't want this creep to change who we are or how we live. It's just a name. You know, naming you Julie was your dad's idea. I know. Aunt Julie. Yeah, but she wasn't just his favorite aunt. She was an amazing person. She was one of the first female war correspondents. She was in Vietnam. She was fearless. Plus, she practically raised your dad. I think it's a beautiful name. It suits you. Come on, let's keep it. Okay. Okay. Besides, Holda Teeger? It's all over. We got him. Thank god! They're bringing him in right now. - See? - Is that him? That's him. And that's his mother. You said they caught him, I could take my driver's test. No, I said maybe. Mom. Okay, let's just leave it up to Mr. Monk. If he says it's okay, you can go. No no, don't drag me into this. As you may recall, I have enough problems of my own. Well, now you have another one. All right, I gotta go call my parents. - They've been worried sick. - Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, please. I'm begging you. Mr. Monk, I am begging you. Julie, look, he's just a suspect. Listen to me, we haven't even question end him yet. Mr. Monk, he's the guy. When you came in, you said it was all over. Well, it sounded good. I wanted to make a big entrance. Look, let me think about it, okay? Mr. Monk, he's in jail. He can't do anything now. Yeah, you know, I'm busy. I got a lot of things to do. I got all these yellow pencils. Everybody's driving. All of my friends. I think you were a kid once, weren't you? Very briefly. Then you remember what it's like. I'm just trying to fit in, Mr. Monk. I just wanna be normal. Why don't you talk to the captain? No, not my jurisdiction. Mr. Monk, the DMV is four blocks away on Vinton street. And if I leave now, I still might make it. Please, Mr. Monk, look into your heart. I am begging you. Are you Julie Teeger? That's my mother's name. - Hey, get him the hell out of here. - You better be careful, Julie Teeger. Are you okay? Oh, my god. He is so the guy. That was, like, a confession. So So I can go now, right? Mr. Monk, - say yes. Say yes. Say yes. - Julie, how are you gonna get there? Your mother can't just leave. I could drive her over. She could drive me over. Yeah, fine. Okay, good, yeah. Thank you so much! Thank you so much, Mr. Monk. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Okay, good. - Thank you, thank you. But! Thank you. Where's the girl? The one I was talking to. I think she's in trouble. Matthew, listen to me. You've got other things to worry about right now. You told my partner you'd been a bad boy. We have it on tape. I was talking to some girls in the park. That's what I meant. Mama doesn't like when I talk to girls. You were more than talking. You hurt them, didn't you? There were two women had the same name as your mother. No, I wouldn't hurt anybody. Talk to my mother. She'll tell you. Where is she? What did you do with her? So you love your mother. Yes. - I don't think so. - Yes, I do. No, I think you hate your mother. - No, I don't. You hate your mother. - You hate your mother so much you've been running around town killing and over again! No you're making me sound crazy. I'm not crazy! Where's my mother? Where's my mother? Where's my mother? I want my mother. Whatcha got there? My rabbit's foot. It protects me. Right, well, you're gonna need it. You drive a Nissan pickup truck, don't you? It has a trailer hitch, right? - I don't know. I guess so. - Yeah. And I believe this is your knife. We found it in your boot. Yeah. I always wear that. I've had it my whole life. I used to get teased a lot. - Really? - Yeah. If you don't believe me - Ask my mother. - Ask your mother. He had a knife? Strapped to his leg. Randy, victim Victim one was killed with a steak knife. I don't know. I mean, he's a knife freak. Didn't wanna get his own knife dirty. I mean, Monk, the guy's certifiable. Thought I was his mother. He's crazier than you. Grant. Hugh Grant. You know him. That actor? The crazy actor. Four weddings and a funeral. Morning, Miss Teeger. Mr. Carlson. Do you have your permit? There you go. That was something, wasn't it? I'm not usually a fan of the insanity defense, but in this case It's just creepy the way he talked to Julie. Get down. Stay down! He's gone, Captain. We were leading him out. He grabbed Hartman's weapon. - Who's gone? - Your guy. - Teeger. - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Pick up. Pick up, Julie. Pick up. - Yeah, - He stop a Pick up. He stole a pizza delivery truck. He's heading west towards the plaza. I'm leaving with Natalie right now. We gotta make sure her kid's okay. Hey, my car's right out front. - I'll drive. - I don't think so. Where the hell is Monk? Julie Teeger? She was probably one of the best tenants I ever had. Who would do a thing like that? Run over a girl on her bicycle and just keep going? I don't know, ma'am. You were told to turn that off. It's my mother. Okay. Okay, okay. I'm turning it off. A lot of packages. She got deliveries all the time. From the ebay. There's a box missing. A yellow one. Excuse me. Disher. Did she get a delivery on thursday? The day she passed? Now that you mention it, I think she did. Monk, Matthew Teeger just bolted. We gotta roll. - Julie Teeger! - Oh, my god. No! - What are you doing now? - I'm sorry. Sorry. - Julie Teeger! Miss teeger. - Julie teeger! - Miss Teeger Stop. That's not good. He's trying to kill me! Miss teeger, they're just made of cardboard. Sorry. sorry. Please. Please Julie teeger! Julie! Stop car. What is that? A three point turn? Julie, no! Just stop a car. God! Fine, fine. Julie! No! Say the word. Captain! Take the shot. - He's not the guy. - He's not the guy? No, he's just trying to warn her. Julie, it's ok. This will protect you. But be careful. There's a crazed killer on the loose. Of course. So if he's not the guy, who's the guy? I remember this box was here in your living room the day your wife was killed. And I found this piece in the other Julie's townhouse. It's a perfect fit. I don't understand. What does that prove? It proves that you killed both women, Mr. Teeger. First your wife, then the other Julie. You were having an extra-marital a sex affair. That don't deny it, Mr. Teeger. We already talked to her. Her name's Maria Hamilton. You've been seeing her for three years. She said you got in a fight last week. She wanted to teach you a lesson. She was a woman scorned. You left a bunch of things at her place, she decided to mail them to your wife. But the mailing label was torn. The post office couldn't read the address. They delivered the package to Julie Teeger.

Well Congratulations. It used to make me feel great. But today, all I could think was, so what? This creep's going away. There's ten other creeps out there ready to take his place. What good am I doing? I'm sure the families of the victim appreciate your work, and the people of San Francisco. All right, all right, Adrian. Adrian. I understand. - Now, you're feeling unfulfilled. - It's all the same. Crime scene, witness, suspect, question, answer. Okay, this-this is perfectly normal, Adrian. No job can completely satisfy anyone. There is more to life than just working. - I know that. - Let me finish. Or cleaning. Maybe you should take up a hobby. Hobby? Yeah. Outside of work. A creative outlet to express yourself. - Hobby? - Yes, a hobby. It's great therapy. You know, I recently took up ballroom dancing. Good for you. Yeah, well. Unfortunately, Madeline.

Kroger. - No. No, Adrian, I am not suggesting. - I can't dance with you, dr. Kroger. I didn't ask you to dance with me, Adrian. I was talking about a different hobby. - Not dancing. - Not dancing!

Two tours of duty in Vietnam, special forces, counter-insurgency. - He's an expert in Booby Traps. - Booby Traps. Yeah, he's got an assistant named, Hector, Something. He set these traps every night, so they're all over the yard. Don't touch anything. Yeah, don't worry, I won't. So who is he? So far, he's a nobody. No ID, no wallet. He cut through the fence around 5:00 a.m. Well Which car was his? No car. Well, not that we found. So he breaks in, he steps on this -  tripwire. - Right, which was tied to the shotgun, - took both barrels. - Wait, is that legal? That's not for me to decide.

I'll tell you what, give me 20 bucks, we'll forget the whole thing. Not paying for it. What was he doing here, mr. Wentworth? What do you think he was after? I don't know. Maybe he needed a carburetor. People need carburetors. He was wearing a $2,000 suit. And those are Italian shoes. I think he could afford a carburetor. Maybe he stole the suit. That's possible, isn't it? Maybe he stole the shoes! Maybe he was on a spree! Suit, shoes, and a carburetor. What kind of spree is that? I don't know. An eclectic spree. Do you have any enemies? None that I can think of. Except for this guy, the bicycle thief. Ten bucks. - No. - Okay, five bucks. Final offer. - Randy, give him five bucks. - Fine. I wonder what happened to his partner. What partner? It's a dirt road out there. Very little dust on his shoes. Somebody must have dropped him off. Maybe they took off when they heard the gunshots. Secure the road.

I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name. - Adrian. - Adrian. - Who told you you could draw? - Natalie. - What are those? - Clouds. That's how I see it. Well, you're seeing it wrong. You said there was no right or wrong. Well Never say that again. This feels familiar. Monk! Miss Teeger. Welcome back. But you never thought you'd see this place again. - It's like a bad dream. - It is, isn't it? The Body's over there. I told them not to move the Body until you got here. - Where have you been? - Art class. Right, your hobby. How's that going? Mr. Monk drew a beautiful landscape today. Did he now? Did you put it up on the refrigerator, mommy? Well, the teacher said it was odious. Odious. That doesn't sound good. I love it. I think he has real talent. I believe in him. Oh, my god.

What are the odds, right? Same Junkyard, two victims, two nights running? This is wrong. I don't think he died here. It's 12 inches, right? Yeah. The knife's 48 inches off the ground. Right. That's 54 inches. It doesn't match. He was stabbed somewhere else. He was killed here. Then moved over there to the Booby Trap to make it look like an accident. Maybe the guy who drove off last night came back. For what? What the hell are they after? I don't know. There's something here. Something worth dying for, - or killing for. - Here? Hey, what do you got? The log book. Looks like everything He picked up, and everything he sold. Look. The last page is missing. - Who found the Body? - We got an anonymous call.

I am an enthusiast. And each and every day, I look for new talent. Today, I was at the college, and what did I see? I saw this fantastic landscape you have done. Magnificent! It's a wonderful example of outsider art. Outsider art? You see, every great moment in history like Cubism, surrealism, they all began as outsider art. Is this some of your work? Do you mind if i, Please? I love this. Well Yeah. Actually It's a banana. It's a flat, - It's a flat banana. - Yes. I had my assistant flatten it, straighten it. A flat banana. I get it. I love it.

Gentlemen. It was a pleasure. Yeah. Truly. Is this real? What do you think? Adrian, we only have an hour. Don't move. It's almost done. You know, while we have a moment, my assistant said that you did not bring a check today. This should take care of it. That oughta cover us till June. Yes, well, thank you for this. I, I hope you're not insulted, but I think I'd rather have the check. Really? You know I could sell that piece tonight for $3,000. And I-and I think that's great, i'm really proud of you, Adrian. But, you know, when I suggested that you take up a hobby, - I never expected. - Me to succeed. No, no, no. That is not what I meant. Trudy always said I had the soul of an artist. And I agree with Trudy. See, I always felt that your detective work was your art, the way you analyze a crime scene. I did too, I did too. But now, I've sold these paintings. Something that I created is out there on somebody's wall being admired. I'm invigor. I feel invigorated. I'm invigorated. Who knows what else I can do? You sold five paintings? That's right. That's right. But all-all to the same man, this Mr. Lovak. What-what do you know about him? He's from a little town called Rostov, which is near Moscow. His family owns an oil refinery. But petya is more interested in collecting fine art. If you'd like to meet him There's an exhibit at my art school this very afternoon. Sorry, I, Maybe another time. But you know what? Our time is up. And I am afraid i'm going to have to ask you for that check. Are you sure? El martes en la manana, paramos aqul. Encontramos una mesa y tres sillas. Las pusimos en El Carro. Tuesday morning, he said he was here with Bennie, They found a table and a delicious bamboo salad. A bamboo salad. I think he's hiding something too. I think you're hiding something. And where did you go- Where did he go next? Adonde. Adonde, adonde usted. - Adonde usted. - Where do we go next? Adonde. Can you show me? - Si, vamos. - Okay. God. It's a very common name. How are we doing? Look at them. Sad, really. Don't know who they're all trying to impress. It's pathetic. They're pathetic. But we shouldn't laugh. No, Mr. Monk, it's you, look at you. Where did you get this? Oh, my gosh. And a beret? Now-now it's crooked, I can feel it. No, Mr. Monk, it's supposed to be crooked, here. - Stop it. That goes this way. - Just a little. - Stop it, you're embarrassing me. - Just a little. Petya must be running late. Yeah, Mr. Monk, I've been doing a little research on your friend Pety a I googled him. At least I tried to, and there's no record of him anywhere. Natalie, people like Petya. Important people, wealthy people. They are un-google-able. No, Mr. Monk, it doesn't work like that. It's not like an unlisted phone number. Un-google-able! End of discussion. Adrian Monk. My star student. Ms. Benson. This is my friend, Natalie Teeger. Natalie was very supportive of me when I was Still struggling. Before - I sold anything. - Yes, yes. Well, we've all heard about your success. It's the talk of the school. It's. Quite extraordinary, yes, I know. Excuse me, here he is. Petya! Petya. I'm so glad you could make it. Mr. Monk, I wouldn't have missed it for all the world. I'm sure you don't remember. The alluring Miss teeger. Have you reconsidered your decision, About selling your portrait? - I'm afraid not. - What a pity! My collection of Monk will always be incomplete. And this is my instructor, ms. Benson. You must be so proud of your disciple here. I think astonished would be a more accurate word. Thank you. I know you came here to see Adrian, but there's so much interesting work being done at the school. For example, over there. And, well, look. Here's one example. This is mine. I call it marriage. No, no, I'm sorry, not even close. The lines are all squiggly. You have to make them straighter. Try using a ruler. A ruler? You told me you had two new paintings. Well, on this side, right over here. - Stop! - Snowman. What is this? There's, like, tiny punctures here in the middle. Yeah, I used a compass. Yes. Of course. And I love it. I must have it. And I will take this too. It's an egg in a nest. Of course, it is an egg in a nest. So, together $4,000. - Okay. - Anything else? - Yes, I have some sketches. - No no. I'm more interested in your paintings. That's where your genius lies. I agree. My van is outside, do you think someone can help me with the paintings? I'll do it. Careful. Careful. I haven't given up on your portrait. Art supplies. My uncle died suddenly about three weeks ago. Heart attack. I've been cleaning out his house and I put a bunch of his stuff by the curb monday night. What kind of art supplies? Some paints, a few blank canvases, and one of my uncle's paintings that he never finished. Blank canvases. Miss larson, can we take a look inside? Thank you. Over here. Careful. I'll take it from here. Thank you. - Are-are those all my Paintings? - I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. I have one more stop, and then i'm heading for the airport. You're leaving, really? - Please- - Maybe, Maybe we should wrap them up. You know. I could find a sheet. - They'll be fine. Don't worry about it. - Good-bye. Good-bye, good-bye. - I'm saying good-bye to my paintings. - Seriously Mr. Monk hurry. When you Hang them, make sure they're straight. Use a level. Yes, yes. Sorry. Das Vidhanya. Was your uncle a professional painter? No, it was just a hobby. He took it up late in life just a few years ago. Was he any good? I didn't think so, to be honest. But he did sell a lot of his paintings. To a collector from Russia. From Russia? Do you remember his name? I never met him. But I think he bought all of them. Except for the last one. The one uncle Scott was working on when he died. That's the one you put out by the curb. - Is this your uncle? - Yeah. What does he have to do with carson paper? He worked there for 30 years. What's Carson paper? Carson paper has a contract with the US Treasury. They make Money. Or at least the paper it's printed on. Adrian! Congratulations. I must be honest. At first, I didn't appreciate your style but I see it now. You are deconstructing the aesthetic orthodoxy that most artists, myself included. - Where's Natalie? - She went home. She took her portrait with her, which I love, by the way. Just took me a while to get it. Are you all right? There was another painting in that van. I've seen it somewhere before. In the Junkyard. It was there On thursday, and the next day, it was gone. God. These are awful. Monk. - I'm terrible. - Adrian monk. Monk. Where's your friend, the Russian? What, what. He just left. What's going on? I just spoke with the secret service. Lovak is with the Russian mob. They've been counterfeiting US Currency using real paper. Yeah, a guy named Scott Larson. He used to work at the US Mint. He's been smuggling paper out of the factory for years. Guess how they're getting it past customs. Canvases? And they're not real canvases. It's eight or nine layers of Currency paper. Larson used acrylic paint, which peels right off. They were worth a fortune. So, it was all about the Canvases? He didn't care what was on them. I knew it had to be something. He really does suck! - Monk, did he take all the Canvases? - Except for one. Natalie. Miss Teeger. Mr. Lovak, I already told you. I'm not interested. You know what I like about you? You are a tough cookie. My final offer. An additional thousand dollars. All together, What do you say? Look, I can't. It was a gift from my boss. I can't. Well, obviously, you don't care about it. You have it hiding in the corner behind a big bush. I understand, you're embarrassed about it. Right? So let me help you take it off of your shoulders. Look, I can't. It would hurt his feelings. Look here, Miss Teeger. I'm going to take that painting Whether you sell it to me or not. You really like it. I hate it. It is an abomination. It's horrible. Nonetheless, I'm gonna leave with that painting. And you're gonna stand there very still. Petya Lovak! I know you're in there! Monk! You can't come in here. I've got your little friend. I've got something of yours too. Hey! What are you doing? It's all over, Petya! Let her go! No no! Those are. Those are your own paintings. You wouldn't do that. - You're an artist. - Too late. I stink and I know it. No no no no! No! What are you doing? No! You're crazy! They are worth a fortune! No! Get him, Captain. Get him down! Give me your hands! Gimme the hands! Come on. Petya Lovak, you are under arrest for capital murder, conspiracy to counterfeit. Hope you got a good lawyer. Alright, see you shortly. Nathalie, what are you doing? What are you doing?! It's evidence! Secret Service are on their way. It's the only painting we have left. - It's gonna be exibit A. - Exibit A? Yeah. It's big news, Nathalie. It's gonna be one of the famous painting in the world. You're right. You're right, I am sorry. - Burn it! Burn it! - Give me that! - Grab that painting. - Burn it! Who is the first victim? The guy in the Junkyard. A russian goom named Kenni Stasia, he's one of Petya's lap dogs He was trying to steal the Canvases? Your friend Patrick came back the following night, but it was too late. You already had the canvases and you were already painting. - And all that money he gave me? - Conterfeit. We're gonna need it back. What was I thinking? I'm no artist. You're no artist? Adrian Monk, you're a grand master. Leonardo de Vinci, or - Pablo Picaso. - Just not with a paint brush. Not with a paint brush, that's for damn sure Hey, how about stamp collector? That's a nice hoby. You get a little book, you put on the stamps in there, you line them all up. - Could arrange them by color it close. - Yes, you could. You could arrange them any way you'd like. It's a hobby, after all. - They're all the same size? - If that's important to you, yes."
"It's a good show, Mr. Monk. Very old-fashioned. No sex or anything. - I. I think you'd like it. - No, thank you. - Why, because it's on channel 11? - That's right. But you'd watch it if was on channel 10. That's right. Okay, well, let's just say that you're flipping through the channels, and you see a show that you really like, and it just happens to be on channel 23. Why would I be flipping channels? If it's a good show, it's on channel 10. Well, yeah, I mean Okay okay. Yeah, here they come. Yeah, i'll let you know. Thank you, Doctor. - Who was that? - Nobody. You just said, ""thank you, Doctor."" - No, I didn't. - It was Dr. Kroger. The crime scene boys found something inside that might upset you. That's why we called. We figured you might want to talk to him, so he said he'd stay up and wait for you. Did somebody die? - Somebody we know? - It's not homicide. Nobody was hurt. It's a straight-up Burglary. Monk, it's pretty intense. If you don't think you can handle it, maybe you should just go home. I understand. Wait, wait, wait. Come on. No, come on, come on, come on. We have to see. We found this by the front door. It was, folded up. The guy who broke in must have dropped it. ""To force heaven, mars shall have a new angel."" Some kind of code. Is that it? That's just an appetizer. Apparently this guy had a grocery list. He took a couple of cell phones, a flashlight bulb, some waterproof sealant, and some braided copper wire. Okay he's making a bomb, - remote control. - I'm not done. He also took ten 20-volt magnesium batteries. one other bomb like that. Trudy? He used this to pry open the door. It's just a crowbar.

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Turn to your right. Victim, Frank Nunn. Frank? Nunn. We found his passport. Been in Brazil for the last eight years. Just got back a week ago. Yeah, look, I didn't do it. - I, I didn't shoot him. - You didn't shoot him? Buddy, I was there, remember? I was looking for the guy who hired him. He was the only lead I had. I'd have to be crazy. Yeah, well, if ""i' have to be crazy"" was a viable defense, we could rent our jails out for birthday parties. Step over here and let's get you fingerprinted. Index finger. Yeahokay. Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Relax, Adrian, it's not gonna hurt. It's just a little ink. Waityeah, okay, wait.

Wipe. - Just take a couple of these. - Not guilty, your Honor. The state moves for the prisoner to be remanded until trial without bail. Your Honor, my client is not a flight risk. He's a former Police Officer. He served the city of San Francisco honorably for 14 years. He still has friends in the department, some of whom are here today. I should also point out that, even if he wanted to flee, my client doesn't drive. He also has an obsessive fear of airplanes And boats. And trucks. And trains. He's not going anywhere. Your honor, on tuesday night, mr. Monk somehow overcame his fears to board a bus and travel 95 miles to angel county. His record of service is impressive. But even more impressive is the mountain of evidence against him. Mr. Monk's motive is clear. He was obsessed with the victim Frank Nunn. - That's not good. - Furthermore, mr. Monk has admitted under oath that he owned the gun. That he took the gun from his house. That he carried it to the crime scene. - And that it never left his possession. - That's not good. And we will introduce ballistic evidence which will prove that Mr. Monk's gun. The gun that came from this house, the gun that never left his hand. Is the same weapon that fired the fatal bullet. It's all circumstantial. The bullet definitely came from his gun. It's been tested by two different laboratories. Bail is set at $900,000. With the court's permission, could you make it an even million? Oh, my god. What do you think? - What do you think? - What do you think? Right now, i'm afraid to think. He can't go to prison. He can barely survive out here. Okay, there's gonna be a trial. I mean, if he gets a good lawyer, right? But all the evidence. You heard the Judge. The bullet came from his gun. Monk said he didn't do it. That's funny. This is the kind of case Monk always solves. You know, not funny, ""ha ha"" funny. You know, more like Not funny at all funny. Monk It wasn't me. Cap, it wasn't me. Sheriff, excuse us. Thank you. I thought about it. I almost did it. But I didn't pull the trigger. You believe me, right? We'll worry about that later. Right now, we gotta get you out of here. Now, your bail's been set at a million, even. We need 10% of that. Now, I can mortgage my town house. I could sell my car. I'm leasing, so - Let's go. Van's downstairs. - One second. Can I say good-bye? Don't Don't worry about me. Okay? I mean I'll be okay. All right. Let's not get all conjugal here. We got a long ride ahead of us. Whew. Well, I guess we better go too. Where is my pass? Watch your head. Cold like that, you should have stayed home. Can't, I used up all my sick days. You know how many sick days I've used last ten years? Zero. Nada. Well, - You're superman. I just take care of myself is all. Don't smoke, on the treadmill every morning. Drink a quart of juice every day. O.j., apple, pomegranate. I plan to live forever. It'll just seem like forever. What the That's this? All units, we are on foot in pursuit. Mile marker 42, heading west. I need a detailed map of the area. Make sure it's up to date. Satellite photos if you got 'em. All right, listen up, 'cause I'm not repeating myself. Adrian Monk is a homicide suspect with a history of mental illness. He's 5'10"" tall. When last seen, he was handcuffed and on foot. I want roadblocks at I-17 and Chester avenue. I want you to stop everything. I mean every truck, every car, every tricycle that tries to get through. Understand? Don't say anything, just nod. I need a helicopter. - Ten minutes. - Make it five. - Where are my dogs? - Dogs are on their way. Red. Don't need red. Orange, where's orange? Orange. Hey! What are you doin'? Here you go, boy. Right here. Come on. Come on, take a good sniff. - Come on, that's right. - What's the problem? He's not getting a scent. I can't figure it. These his? That's a first. A human being with no smell at all? Maybe he boiled his clothes in case he had to hoof it. Yeah, he's got it now. Every tree? Yes, sir, it's as if he stopped and touched every single tree. - We lost him. - All right, he may be hurt. Fax an I.D. To every local hospital. Jackson, call the Marshall's office. I want checkpoints here, here, and here. Captain. Lieutenant, nice of you to join us. - What the hell happened? - Monk jimmied the lock on the van. When we slowed for a yellow, he jumped out. He jumped out? - Don't believe it. - Well, either that or aliens came down and beamed your boy up. You don't need all these guns. He's not gonna hurt anybody. Ms. Teeger, your boss is a murder suspect. Right now, he's acting like a very guilty murder suspect. You know him. You work with him. Where would he go? It's not a difficult question. Are you cops or not? Sheriff, he's been spotted. About three miles west. Scared a couple campers. He was going through their campsite. Good work. You get a clean shot, bring him down. Hey! What are you doing? Hey! What are you do? Well a No! Stop! What are you doing? Hey! So he drove around in a circle? I keep the steering wheel locked. It's called the club. So he drove around in a circle, got out, ran away. Well, more of an oval, really. Like a Like an elliptical. Circle's fine. - Just say circle. - Which way did he go? South. He's heading home.

Where did you get that coat? From a hobo. - I traded him. - For what? I can't tell you. Don't make me tell you. Okay. I need to get these off. What? - Maybe I should call the captain. - You can't. You can't call the captain. - He'd have to bring me in. - No, not necessarily. Nat, it's his job, Natalie. Look, I didn't shoot that man. - Somebody set me up. - But the bullet, It came from your gun. I don't know how they did it or who's behind it. But I think that note, that coded message, was left for me. It was bait. They knew I'd decipher it. They staged the electronics store break-in to lure me to angel. If I can get back there, look around that sculpture garden, maybe I can figure it out. Please Natalie I'm sorry. Of course I believe you. Of course I believe you. What can I do to help? I need a file. A file. Here. Here. A bigger file! Bigger file. I have some tools upstairs. And some non-hobo clothes. Right, I will get that. You just stay put. Stay right there. Hello? Hello? Natalie? It's Randy. You know, your front door was open. Do you wanna take a bath? Bath? No, thanks. You greet all your guests that way? I'm surprised you're not a lot more popular. No so guests this, Rollins figures Monk is heading back here. He thinks he's gonna try and get in contact with you. So, I'm supposed to be staking out the place. You haven't heard from him, have you? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. You know, I tried to tell Rollins Monk is too smart to come back here. But nobody listens to me. Hey, what's this? Mitch's old uniform. I was giving it to the salvation army. I figure it's time to move on. Well, good for you. I've been saying that for three years, but What's with the drill?

'cause, I'm a hero. All the kids, the recruits, they wanna meet me, photo op Normally, we don't let people poke around back here. Especially now we had a break-in last week. - Really? - A guy got shot. - No kidding. - Right over there. It was like the o.k. Corral. Why don't you look around. You see anything you like, talk to me. I'll take care of you. Aim high, fly high. Am I right? Ab, absolutely. Aiming and flying. That's what we do. Maybe, maybe I will just take a look around then. Okay You be him. And You be me. Sorry. Bang. Bang. - Anything on those credit cards? - No, sir. Make sure the hotel rooms are covered. Double-team the bus stations and the airport. But he's not going to the airport. Monk's afraid to fly. Well, maybe he figures we assume he won't fly, so he heads to the airport. Yeah, or maybe he knows we assume that he thinks he. He thinks he knows what, he's. He knows that we're. No, wait I'll write it down. Natalie Teeger. - We're intercepting her mail. - On whose authority? Stottlemeyer. Leland, it's me. - Monk, thank god. Are you okay? - Leland, I know who set me up. - It was that Sheriff. - Rollins? Why? I don't know why. I can't figure that out. But I know how. Okay, okay, how? How is good. Let's start with how. Okay i had some orange juice in my refrigerator. Okay. Somebody drank from it. I thought it was Natalie. Monk, we haven't got a lot of time here. I'm talking about Rollins. It was him. He's always drinking juice. I heard him talking about it. Leland Here's what happened. He broke into my house the day before the shooting. And raided your refrigerator? That's right. Then he drank some orange juice. About four ounces. Then he found my handgun. He switched guns? Not the whole gun, just the barrel. My gun's a lane & westing. The barrels are interchangeable. Right, he used the six-fingered man's prints and the note to lure me to the sculpture garden. He was hiding there, about 50 feet behind me. He waited for me to pull my gun, and then he took the shot. I need you face down on that floor. He told me to lie on the ground face down. That's probably when he did it. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. He switched them back. So when the lab said the bullet came from your gun They were right. It was my gun. Ateast part of it. Okay, can you prove it? Do you have anything else? Okay. Leland, are you sitting down? I have a plastic tab from a juice container. D- do you have any fingerprints? Fingerprints? No. No. - That's not enough, is it? - No, it's not enough! You okay? Who was that? That was Adrian Monk. You're kidding. Nope. I'm gonna meet him tonight. I just set it up. He wants me to bring him some food. Good work, Captain. Call the Tac Squad. He said I should come alone. Yeah, I'm sure he did. Can I come? Yeah, sure. Leland? Hey, buddy! I brought you some chicken pot pies. Did you hear that? Relax, we're okay. I told you to come alone. Are you setting me up, Leland? Monk, I swear. I told you, I can't go to prison. I, I can't go! You know I wouldn't survive it. Just put the gun away. Monk! Monk! Monk! Monk, please drop the gun!"

I was highly motivated. What should I do now? You Don't do anything. You're a dead man. You disappear. I'm gonna poke around a bit and see if I can't figure out what's going on. Whatever it is, it's big. Scary big. - You think I can. - No, you cannot call Natalie. You cannot call Dr. Kroger. How could you call them if you don't exist? Monk, they want to lock you away, and they have the evidence to do it. And after this little stunt, they could put me away too. You better get going. There is a bus stop behind the gas station up on silvertree. Hey, thanks. Thanks for killing me. Hey, that's what friends are for. Saeson 6 - Episode 16 Mr. Monk Is On The Run. (partie 2) Natalie. Hey. How are you doing? I don't know. About the same. These were out front. From Sharona. They're beautiful. Why don't you put them over there. She and Benjy are gonna fly in for the service. It's funny. When he was alive, he always said he didn't have any friends. Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song for the service? Yeah, Randy, that would be wonderful. He would've liked that. Mr. Monk was a big, big, big. He knew how much you really love music. Great. Look, I found one of him smiling. Didn't see that very often. Listen, Natalie, the Captain's out front. He'd really like to come in. No. Natalie, he didn't have a choice. - Monk fired the first shot. - Don't tell me that. There's always a choice. - He could have fired a warning shot. - That's not trained. You know what? How about shot him in the leg or not fired at all? God, I can't believe it. - I'm sorry. - I can't believe he's gone. I'm so sorry. Hey, the door was open. Is there anything i can do? I understand. I'll catch you later. Wait, no, Captain. I'm sorry. This must be harder on you than anybody. Please, come, come in. Thanks. Pretty flowers. - So have they found his. - No, not yet. The coast guard says they might never find him. It just depends on the currents. Yep. It's just that i'm planning the service, and it's just hard without closure. I appreciate that. I Randy told me that you rented out the legion of honor. Yeah. And he also said that you took out a loan to cover the costs? - Yeah, that's right. - It's just I don't think you need to be so extravagant. - You don't? - No. In fact, i remember once, Monk told me, he said that if anything ever happened to him, he Wouldn't want anybody to go into debt. I cannot believe you're saying that. He was your friend. - Nat, i'm just trying to honor what he. - No, no, no, no, no. He loved you. I mean, he really loved you, and you sit here I changed my mind. I want you out of here. I'm going to ask you to leave, please. Look, - Natalie, you don't understand. - Yeah, I don't. I'm sorry, Captain. Good-bye.

The coast guard just fished him out of avalon bay. Is that a tattoo? Yes, sir. It's not him. Of course it isn't him. I've been telling you, Monk is alive. You can't be sure. That's true, I can't. You can. He's out there. He's somewhere. Find him! Does everybody have them? You have yours? Good. Hey, captain. Are you okay? Yeah, i'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine? No reason.

To make it even. - Make 'em even. Monk. Hello, Sheriff Rollins. Make yourself at home. You read the paper today? I did. I read the sports page. I did the jumble. Not the jumble. This, page five. Male, caucasian, Late 40s. - Is it Monk? - No. It's not Monk. I was at the morgue last night. The guy had a tattoo and red hair. I thought it was strange. - What was strange? - Well, i'll tell you what was strange. You weren't there. A bulletin was sent in. It was in the daily log. You must have read it. You guys won't mind if I hang around a few more days, see if anything else washes up? Knock yourself out. We can use all the help we can get. - We all got to suffer. - Yeah. - I'll see you boys around the Campus. - Bye-bye. What? It's a good question. - Why didn't you check it out? - Because I was busy.

He's got two offshore bank accounts on a Sheriff's salary. Randy, this guy is dirty. I can smell him. What is it? This one's been repainted. Recently. It useto be silver. They're looking for a silver suv. Are you okay? What are you doing? Well, at least make it look like you're working. I need you to look under the car. What? Just, behind this fender. Inside, tell me what you see. Check the axle. You're gonna get us both fired. Right, right behind this front wheel. What are these? A highway worker was killed. And so these are gonna go to his brother Ambrose's house, and those will go to my garage. All these books. What was he, a professor? No, a Detective. An amazing Detective. He could look at a room or a person and see things that nobody else could see. Like the car wash guy. Yeah. What car wash guy? The guy in Nevada. I was just reading about him. Here. It's in today's paper. They call him the ""car wash Columbo."" He solved a big hit-and-run case single-handedly. Yeah. Sounds like a real character. His boss says it takes him a whole hour to wipe down every car. Won't even use the same rag twice. Can I see that? Yeah. There's no picture. I guess he's modest too. Leland Rodriguez. His name is Leland? Captain Stottlemeyer. Where is he? - I don't know. - Where is he? It's not mine. It matches the set in your mother's kitchen. How do you explain that? My mom's not the only one. - I have to talk to you. - what are you doing? Is this him? It's him, isn't it? He's the ""car wash Columbo."" CAR WASH COLUMBO - Reginald, we need to take a break. - Cool, i'll wait outside. Nice try, kid. Jackson, could you baby-sit my young friend here for a minute? It's him, isn't it? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - Why didn't you tell me? - Natalie, Natalie, Natalie, Natalie. I am so sorry. You're sorry?! But how? Bulletproof vest. We couldn't tell anybody. ""Leland rodriguez""? - That's his name. - Well, that's just stupid. What's he doing in Nevada? He's supposed to be avoiding attention, staying off the radar. He's all alone? Natalie, you can't tell anybody. You can't tell randy. You can't even tell Julie. Randy doesn't know? No. I'm trying to protect him. - From what? - I'm not sure. There's something going on here. That Sheriff Rollins, he framed Monk for shooting the six-fingered man. You were there. They were gonna send Monk away forever. And it's not just Rollins. Rollins is working for somebody, maybe somebody in the governor's office. My god. It might go higher than that, i'm not sure. I'm still working on it. I just need a little more time. - I have to see him. - Natalie, no. Leave him alone. He's safe where he is. You have to promise me you're not gonna do anything. Promise me. Okay. Okay, I promise. - Make me happy. - She's on the move. It looks like a real road trip. Took her daughter to a neighbor's, packed a suitcase. Stay with her. She'll lead you right to him. What do I do when I find him? Do you really have to ask? No, sir, I do not. Tru, Trudy Trudy okay, okay, i'm gonna, just give you a little heads up before the service. It's, uh, it's kind of a protest song. It's gonna be pretty controversial, especially the tenth verse, where I talk about the actual shooting. I mean, I don't mention you by name. I just, I call you ""the man."" The tenth verse? Randy, how many verses are there in total? Good. Why tell me why did a good man have to die?

We know all about how you set mr. Monk up and switched the gun barrels. If anybody's going to prison, it is you. Thanks for stopping by, Natalie. Let me tell you about the real world, Natalie. It's never about what happened. It's always, can you prove what happened? All right, Adrian, we've done this before. On the ground, face down. - What was that? - It was supposed to. It was supposed to go faster. Come on out, buddy. Don't make me do something i'm not gonna regret. You too, Natalie. Aiding and abetting. I gotta call the big man. He's not paying me enough for this crap. The big man? This way. Over there. What are you doing? We're taking his car so he can't follow us! - Come on! - Go, go, go, go, go, go! You got anything else?

Yeah, which is controlled by the blue Danube Foundation, - Danube Foundation. - Which is owned by Oh, my god. Who's dale biederbeck? Not too hard. The new skin is the most tender. That's it, right there. I dreamt about you last night. Do you ever dream about me? Sometimes. I wonder if we're having the same dream. I doubt it. Biederbeck. You have a visitor. You have ten minutes. The eager miss Teeger! You took a big chance coming here. The photos i've seen don't do you justice. Althena, we'll have to continue this tomorrow. Remember where we left off. Do you mind? Watching Althena walk away is the only exercise I get. You get a manicure every day? A computer, your own telephone. - It doesn't look like you're suffering. - Believe me, Natalie, i suffer. Remember the day you got the news about Mitch? - That's where I live. - How do you know about. About your dead husband? You work for Adrian Monk, Natalie. That makes you and your family my business. Is that the Governor? I'm a big fan. Didn't he just refuse to commute your sentence? Turn it off, please. - Turn what off? - The video recorder in your purse. I won't be confessing to anything today, Natalie. We don't have to play games. I know Adrian Monk is alive. I never believed his oldest friend Leland Stottlemeyer would actually shoot him. Did you? Really? To tell the truth, i'm so relieved. I don't want Monk dead. Ever since he put me here, my dream has been to trade places with the man. I want Monk here! In this hellhole, Rotting away, slowly, slowly, slowly. What about Sheriff Rollins? - What about him? - We know he's on your payroll. Is he really? He used to work here as a prison guard. Is that where you met him? And we know you hired Frank Nunn. You brought him back from south America. You're planning something. Whatever it is, mr. Biederbeck, you can forget about it it's not going to happen. I'm afraid you're too late, Natalie. Wheels are in motion. - It was nice meeting you. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before you go, turn on your little machine. I want to say hello to your boss. Hello, Adrian. How's my favorite Desperado? So nice meeting Natalie. We had a wonderful chat. She hardly seemed repulsed by me at all. In fact, I think i might offer her a job you're in here - and i'm out there. - He kept saying that. He kept talking about trading places with you. He thinks he's getting out. If he's thinking of squeezing through the bars, he's got 400 pounds to go. What is that behind him? And you go as final, that was there Dale. - It's a computer. - It's a weather report. Riverton, California. Riverton. Don't screw with me, man. I held up my end. I just got back from Riverton. It's all set up. We're good to go. Riverton. The Governor? They're gonna kill him. Where is he? - Do you see him? - Where is he? Mr. Biederbeck, can you talk? You're missing a beautiful parade. - Lots of balloons. - I was hoping for some fireworks. I think they're saving that for the end. - Here, here. - Hey, hey. Excuse me, excuse me, this man's a Detective. - Former. Former Detective. - You have to stop the parade. We think there's a bomb in the Governor's car. It's dale Biederbeck, dale the whale. Have you heard of him? - It's okay. I didn't either. - He's a killer. He's in san quentin. He's been serving two consecutive. Consecutive life terms. The Governor refused to commute sentence but the lieutenant governor will. He's got the Lieutenant Governor in his pocket. That's what this whole thing has been about. If he kills the Governor, he gets out of jail. They hired a hitman named Frank Nunn. He has six fingers. It doesn't matter. Yeah, see, Nunn was here in Riverton a week ago. We think he planted a bomb in the Governor's car. Didn't need him anymore. Nunn a loose end, so they killed him. It was a two-fer. They killed Nunn, and they tried to frame me for it. Biederbeck hates me. He wants to trade places with me. By here. There he is! Go! Go! See that guy? He's wanted for murder. Get your men. Get after him. Now! Let's go! How's he gonna do it? Remote control? No, no-no, they would've set it off already. It must be on some kind of timer or What's wrong, boy? Eureka. Excuse me? - Natalie, I just solved the case. - Eureka? No, no, no. I mean Eureka's a dog. She was wearing one of those shock collars with a little receiver. Look. There, there. There's a battery. It's wired to a transmitter that runs through that banner. The bomb must be hooked to one of those dog collars. Oh, my god. So when the car goes by the banner Hey, stop this parade! Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD. Stop the parade. The Governor's in danger. Okay! Stop the parade. Make it all stop! - Stop! Hey! Hey! Hey! - Hold up! Make it all stop. Natalie, what are you doing? I'm a police officer. I need for you to stop the parade now. Now! Stop this parade! Nat, Natalie, what are you doing? What's wrong with you. Stop the parade! - No, no. - Drag her down. Get her down here. John Rollins, you're under arrest for murder and conspiracy to commit. We know you're working for Biederbeck. We know you framed Monk. - Me? - You're under arrest. Obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting. Arrest him! No! I'm a Captain of the San Francisco Police Department! Arrest him! He's out of his jurisdiction. Arrest him! Captain, the trigger is in the banner! Wait! Trudy! No! No! Wait, stop! Stop! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! There's a bomb! Don't move the vehicle! There's a bomb, i'm telling you. Hold on! Look at this! Clear these people out of here! Everybody clear! Call the bomb squad. We don't have one. It, it's in the budget for next year. I don't think we can wait that long. Could you take your hands off my friend, please. He's had a long day. You have right to remain silent. Yeah, I know all that stuff. Let's just get the hell out of here. Good job. Good job. Hello, Dale. Adrian Monk. Why am I not surprised? I tried to call, but apparently your phone's been disconnected. Yes, I should've done it years ago. Fewer distractions. I see they took your bed and your computer. They were cluttering up the room. You know me, Monk. I've always been a simple man of philosophic joys. And they're making you eat in the cafeteria now. That can't be fun. At least you won't be eating alone. Your little friend Sheriff Rollins will be joing you soon. He's talking to the D.A. Right now, telling him everything about how you hired frank nunn to plant that bomb and then killed Nunn and tried to frame me for it. Might want to save a seat for the Lieutenant Governor too. Are you having fun? No. But it's as close as i'm ever gonna get. What did you win, Monk? Nothing! We're both back where we started. Not exactly. The police in dourados found something in Frank Nunn's apartment. Some old letters. He talked about killing Trudy. He mentioned the man who hired him. You have a name! Yeah, not quite. Nunn called him ""the Judge."" The judge. - I can't help you, Adrian. - Can't Or won't? A little lead. How exciting. That should keep you off the street for a while. The important thing is that you're off the street. You really think these bars can hold me? Yeah. They seem pretty strong. Have a good life, Dale. It's true, Adrian Monk! I'm in prison, but you're in a worse prison! You're trapped! Trapped by your own demons! You're in your own private hell! I wouldn't trade places with you for a billion dollars! I mean, another billion dollars! You hear me? Come back here! I'm Not Done! Yes, you are."

He would've told everyone. - I really didn't have a choice. - I know. - So how's the new house? - I don't want to talk about it. Don't want to think about it. Every 20 minutes it's something else.

Are you ready for some good news? Yes, please. Thank you. Ramone is getting married. His old lady said yes. Ramone? No what about the house? You know, i'm glad you mentioned it. Ramone. Ramone. Ramone! Siesta. Sientate. We found some mold. - Mold? - It probably started in the bathroom and spread from there. So what we gotta do is we gotta go in and we gotta get the mold out. No, no, no. Please, Honest Jake. I am begging you Okay, okay. Don't it's fine. If you wanna live, you know, with the spores. The fungus. The bacteria living. Spreading. Eating your house from the inside out. It's your decision. It's your house. Go put this back. Just remind me. Why did you move again? Yeah, that's right. Your last place was too noisy. I found this in the attic. Where you want it? You can just leave it here. ""Fire hydrants to be painted."" Look at this. ""More rain expected thursday."" ""Garden club to meet."" It's so boring. Why would you save all this? Well, maybe I have no idea. It was before my time, but my father told me all about it. He was in his office right up there when it happened. 1968, the day before Christmas. Yeah, I was just a kid, but I remember everybody talking about that. - Is that the gate? - Yes, sir. Three gunmen. Stolen milk truck. Rammed it through that gate. They shot two guards and walked away with $4 million. This was back when $4 million was considered a lot of money. Just go on. All I know is, we never recovered a nickel. Until today. - From the robbery? - Yep. Serial numbers match. - We got $4,200. - A woman named Cassie Drake was murdered last night. We found this in her closet. Where's the rest of it? We're working on that. I was reading the file. They caught two of the three. Career bad guys. They died in prison without ratting out their partner. - I guess he wasn't a big spender. - Or he was scared or dead. Well, the woman who died, she was a private nurse. Her last patient was a man named Joseph Moody. Ring a bell? I can check him out. The employment records are in the basement. - Take me ten minutes. - Good deal. Mr. Monk. I got a confession to make. They really don't call me honest jake. They're looking for the money, aren't they? The old man robbed those armored cars. He hid the money somewhere in this house. Dementia sets in. He starts babbling about it to his private nurse. She killed him before he could start blabbing about it to somebody else. And she tells her friend, not-so-Honest Jake. Yeah. They were probably more than friends. They were probably sex lovers. That's what he's been doing here the whole time, - looking for the money. - You're not gonna believe this. He's still not the worst contractor I've ever seen. Natalie. Can you Can you reach that hammer? I'll try. All right, now pull. Come on! Pull! There. Okay. Now what? Nothing. That nail was driving me crazy. - God. - What? He still hasn't fixed that light. Oh, my god. What? Oh, my god. ""Oh, my god,"" what? What do you see? What do you see? What do you see?! Something in here? This is a false wall. There's a reason that light wasn't centered. Because this is a false wall! Come on. Move the furniture. Move this furniture. Move it. It's in here. Here? Yup. Take it down. Jake, jake. What are you gonna do with your share of the money? Same thing I'm gonna do with your share. Spend it. What? What? This way. This way. Almost. Easy. Is he dead? - Are you dead? - He's not dead. - He's not dead. He's still breathing. - God. - He's gonna wake up any minute. - Help! - Somebody help us! - Forget it, forget it. It's no use. Nobody's gonna hear you. The door. The front door. Go. Go, go! Go. Pull. Just pull. Okay. Yeah. Go pull. Good. We got it. We got it. Pull! Yes. Once more. Nice. God, this rug.

Hand me those rags. Right there. What what for? Calling for help. Pull. Pull the tub closer. Pull it. Pull. What what are you Come on, come on, come on. You were right. Joseph Moody. Worked here nine years. Retired six weeks after the robbery. What a surprise. Actually, he lived right around the corner on beech street. Yeah, we know. A friend of ours just bought that house. What the hell? Looks like a signal. Dot, dot, - dot - ""S."" Is that a dash? ""O."" S-O. S-O. Soda! Somebody's selling soda. It's Natalie. She's in trouble. Come on. If you like my work, tell your friends. All about word of mouth, my business. On second thought Gonna retire. Drop the gun! On the ground. On the ground. Hands. Let me see your hands. Take it easy. You okay? Get up. Get up. Good luck, okay? Got it? Holy moly, what happened here? I should never have bought this house. I should've waited for something better to come along. Like death. What about your father? What's what's your happiest memory of him? My father Well, he took me to a football game once. - Sounds like fun. - Well, every time the team went into a huddle, he turned to me and said, - ""they're talking about you."" - Talking about you? They weren't. Were they? No, that seems pretty unlikely. I don't know why he would say that. Because one player kept looking up at me and I thought I saw him laughing. I'm pretty sure they were talking about the game and what play to run next. He was looking right at me. - Well - I meanrightat me. Our time is up. Next session, let's pick it up right here, all right? What's What's What's good for you? How's 3:00? All right, 3:00. What day? You know, today. Today? That's That's in two hours. You mean - you want to come back? - Unless you have something sooner. No, it's completely booked up. What's tomorrow look like?"
"""Payable to Natali Teeger."" My four favorite words. Thank you. Thank you very much. Excuse me. Where's the rest of it? I worked tuesday night, remember? That was overtime. I thought you were just hanging out. No, Mr. Monk, I wasn't just hanging out. I spent seven hours reorganizing the utensil drawer. - That was work. - But you said it was fun. I distinctly remember that. I said, ""Isn't this fun?"" And you said, ""uh-huh."" So You mean unless i'm Complaining, you're not going to pay me? Is that the new rule? Even if I wanted to, I've already torn it out of the checkbook. Yeah, so you just void it out. Void. Write ""void."" And then you just write another one. I can't do that. I wish I could. - If it were up to me. - Of course it's up to you. - I need you to use your inside voice. - What. Oh, my god! God! I'm a little short of cash right now, okay? But I'm good for it. You know I'm good for it. Just keep track. Yeah, I have been keeping track. It's over $1,800, mr. Monk. I'm sorry, the door was open. - I thought I heard screaming. - No, that's just me. I scream every payday. Can I help you? My name is Linda Kloster. - My husband is Patrick Kloster. - Patrick. - The chess player. - I was just reading about him. He's some sort of super genius, like off the charts. Yes, Patrick has an IQ. Of 180. Four points higher than albert einstein's. What can I do for you? Well, it's my husband. He's gonna kill someone. - How do you know? - He told me. He talks about it all the time. He says he has a perfect plan. He says it's foolproof. And that he'll never get caught. Did he say who he's going to kill? Yes. It's me. He's gonna kill me. -= Monk 7x02 =- -= Mr. Monk and the Genius. =- Sub by: -= ¤Aka¤  &  ¤YaYa¤ =- [Sub-way.fr.] Can I get you something to drink? We have some wine. No, thank you. I'm three years sober. Three years and two months. - Congratulations. - Mrs. Kloster, isn't it possible that you misunderstood your husband? Patrick is not an ambiguous man. He said he's gonna kill me. In fact, he tells me every day. As I'm going to bed he'll say, ""good night, sweetheart. It won't be long now."" Well, why don't you just go to the police? I can't prove anything, and he knows it. It'll be his word against mine. - Well, can't you leave, go someplace? - You mean hide from patrick? Impossible. I mean, he'd find me in two minutes. He's a chess grandmaster, the best in the world. He can anticipate my every move. Murdering me is gonna make him a fortune. He's taken out a $10 million insurance policy on my life. Did he say when he. No, but it'll be soon. When he left this morning, the way he kissed me, it was different. You know, the way he smiled. - It's definitely coming. - Where is he now? He's playing a tournament in Vancouver. I've been following it. That's right. He's in canada until tuesday. At least you're safe until then. Am i? Mrs. Kloster, I have friends at the department. I really appreciate that, mr. Monk. But the police can't protect me. Patrick is smarter than all of them put together. My husband's gonna murder me. I'm already dead. And there's nothing you or anyone can do about it. Here's a check for $5,000. I'm a little confused. If, if you don't think he can be stopped. I'm hiring you to catch him. - You mean after? - That's right. After he's killed me. You are the only man smart enough in this world to make him pay for what he did. Or, rather, what he's gonna do. I can't. I can't. I don't know what to say. Say yes, mr. Monk. Promise me. Promise me you won't let him get away with it. I promise. Once again, kloster is on the attack. His dynamic style of play has certainly been on display today. Your sister called again. She's worried about you. Frankly, so am i. Looks like he's winning again. I'm sure he is. - Is the house alarm on? - Yes, I set it myself. You'll check it again before you leave? I always do. And don't open the door for anyone. Make sure michael knows. Let me make you some lunch. No, I think I'm just gonna take a bath and maybe lie down. I'm going to make you a sandwich. I'll be right back. How does she look? Scared to death. Of what? The son of a bitch is in Canada. I don't blame her. What she needs is a good therapist. They both do. I'm happy i'm not a genius. It screws with your head. You wanna do her a favor? Put a little scotch in there. And it's another victory for Patrick Kloster. We didn't have any green tea. But I found some earl grey. Kevin, it's a restraining order. You issue 30 of them a day. No, he hasn't hit her. Yes, she's still in the house. Because Adrian Monk told me, that's how I know. Fine, good. You do that. You sleep on it. Good. How'd, how'd that go? Forget about him. Look, just get a cruiser out there. Park it out front until further notice. You can't arrest him for anything? Well, apparently there's no law against giving your wife the willies. Captain, we just got a call. Okay. - You better put down the cup. - Just tell me who called. Just put the cup down, or finish it, or drink half of it. Why? Because you're probably gonna drop it. I'm gonna have to clean it up. Just have a sip. How'bout a sip? Linda kloster's dead. Her housekeeper just found her. - What happened? - I don't know. Let's go. - Mr. Monk. - Let's go! - We gotta get over there. - Let's go, Randy. Hey, the calvary's here. Could I have the room, please? You heard the man. He wants the room. Let's go. Thank you very much. - Mr. Monk. - Not now. Not now. You can't blame yourself. Yes, I can. What did the paramedics say? Probable heart attack. He killed her. He said he would kill her, and he did it. Okay. Okay, there was no alarm. There was no one in the house, just the housekeeper and the cook. No signs of trauma or suffocation. Poison. No, housekeeper said she hadn't eaten all day, breakfast, lunch. So how did he do it? I don't know. I don't know. Is he here? His plane just landed. What did you get? You're not gonna like it. The M.E said natural causes, severe cardiac arrest. - What? - He's already released the body. What. What about a complete toxicology workup? He won't do it, Monk. Not without probable cause. She was 42 years old. What about the water? The tap - water in the bathroom? - Checked. Well, how'bout her lipstick. We checked that too. I mean, toothpaste, even her eyedrops, everything in the house, it's all clean. He killed her. He poisoned her. But how? There he is. You can ask him yourself. Mr. Kloster, how do you feel? How do I feel? I'm still in shock. Linda was my reason for living. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death, gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth. Where is that from? - Look it up. - Patrick Kloster, i'm Leland Stottlemeyer, SFPD. This is Lieutenant Disher. Are you surprised to see us, sir? Yes, I am. I mean, I'm surprised to see you here. I expected you in Vancouver. Well, we couldn't afford it. We're sorry for your loss, sir. This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger. Of course. The legendary Mr. Monk. I was hoping to see you here. Well, hello. Sir, we were wondering if you wouldn't come downtown, give us a statement. I'm afraid my schedule is rather tight, but I did take the opportunity of phoning ahead and reserving a room here at the airport security offices. It's nothing extravagant, but it does have a table and five chairs. How did you know there'd be five of us? Please, Miss Teeger, don't insult me. According to the vancouver police, they interrupted the match at - To inform you that your wife had died. - That's right. They said you kept playing, that you finished the match. Of course I did. That's what linda would have wanted. That's funny. I would have been too upset to concentrate. I was upset, aptain. That's why it took me 44 moves to win. Your wife came to see me this morning, mr. Kloster. Did she? She told me that you had been planning to kill her. - My wife was an unstable woman. - She didn't seem unstable to me. I'm sure she didn't. What did the medical examiner say? Heart attack. She didn't look sick to me. And what medical school did you attend, Miss Teeger? My wife suffered from high blood pressure. And for most of her life, she was an alcoholic and a heavy smoker. She was also quite depressed. And there was a $10 million life insurance policy. The policy was linda's idea. I'm insured for the same amount. What do you know about poison, Mr. Kloster? Not much. More than you, i'm sure, but not much. Although I am an expert on the poisoned pawn. - Poison. - That is a chess move, Lieutenant Disher. I'd be glad to teach it to you if you'd like. Well, as you can imagine, I have a number of arrangements to make. Do you play chess, mr. Monk? A little. We should play a game sometime. We already are. Okay, I found somebody. He's a Grandmaster International Champion. And he beat Patrick kloster? Almost. They played last year. It was a tie. - Where is he? - He's over there. His name is Eric Tovila. I can't believe you're working on a saturday. Well, he's not paying me, so it's not really work. Mr. Tovila. - Do you have a minute? - I'm a little busy at the moment. You're Tovila? I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Patrick Kloster. You know, i'm working here. You want to talk, you gotta play me. It's 20 bucks. Yeah, yeah, I don't. I don't. I don't think that I have $20. I don't. I don't have $20. I don't. Do you. Do you have. I don't have 20. I have $8. And an IOU. For $1,800 from my boss. Who's next?! I could play. - $5, right? I'm under 18. - Yeah. You play chess? I was in the chess club for two semesters. Two semesters. Well, that's gonna impress the vassar dean of admissions. It's your move. The bird opening. I've only seen that five times today. I understand that you almost beat Patrick Kloster. I'll get him next time. What kind of player is he, would you say? Kloster's a behaviorist. He studies you, not the game. He crawls inside your head, and it's Kinda Spooky. Yeah, what is a poisoned pawn? Well, the poisoned pawn is a trap. He dangles a pawn in the middle of the board. And, you know, most people can't resist it. And then he swoops in ande crushes you. It can't resist it. That's checkmate. Thank you, Vassar. That was fun. A trap. A trap she couldn't resist. What? What? I know that look. You did it, didn't you? You figured it out. Who's the real genius now? Who just outsmarted the smartest guy in the whole world? - Tell me ""you."" - I did. It was you. This is a funeral home, mr. Monk. My wife has just passed. I find that grin on your face rather inappropriate. I know how you did it. You still think I murdered my wife? You set a trap. Like the poisoned pawn. You've been chatting with some chess masters. Good for you. When I was in your bedroom on wednesday, I noticed a few things. I just didn't put it all together until today. The glass that had recently been washed, some breath mints, some eyedrops. And what did they tell you? That your wife had started drinking again. Married to you, I don't blame her. She kept it secret, of course. At least, she tried to. How long did it take you to find her secret stash, a day, a week? On wednesday morning before you left for Canada, you poisoned her bottle then put it back where you found it. Later that day, Linda took a drink. Of poisoned pawn. Then she put the bottle back as you knew she would. It really was brilliant. You didn't have to hide the poison. She would drink it and hide it herself. - Natalie, call the Captain. - Yes, sir. And did you find this bottle And did you find this bottle or this hidden stash of poison? No, of course not. It was long gone. You had four days to get rid of it. But there are still traces of it in here, in her body. We're gonna run every toxicology test in the book, and we're going to find it. I'm afraid you can't touch that. I'm sorry. She was our niece. Well, I'm a former police officer. And I'm afraid we have to borrow your niece, - her remains, for a couple of days. - Borrow her? Yes, we have to run some toxicology tests on the body. - My goodness. - No, no, we do it all the time. We're going to cut her open Just Just a little bit. And slice off a Teeny Tiny, Tiny piece of her liver and her stomach, and maybe take a little, Tiny, nearly imperceptible bit of fluid from her eyeball. Like on tv. Who likes tv? But why? The fact is we think she may have been poisoned. But how did the poison get in the cable car? - What cable car? - The cable car that hit her. That's how Marjorie was killed. - M m m - Mr. Monk, that's not my wife. My wife is right here. I had her cremated two hours ago. As you can see, I have anticipated your every move. Cremated? Yes, I don't think your toxicology tests are gonna do much good, but you are welcome to try. I know that look. I've seen it quite often. That's how my opponents look when they know they've been beaten. Your move, Mr. Monk. ""In chess, as in life, ""creative strategies ""executed with daring and precision"" will allow you to overwhelm your opponent ""and achieve your goal."" The end. And may I say, thank god. - Keep reading. Here's the next one. - Mr. Monk, come on. We've been reading his books all day. What good are they doing? I'm getting into his head. He's in my head. I have to be in his head, so we're in each other's heads. ""Chess domination by Patrick Kloster."" Well, this will be the opposite of fun. - ""For my queen, Tatiana."" - You don't have to read the dedication. Fine, sorry. What's this? Linda Kloster's check. - You didn't deposit this? - I'll never deposit it. But, Mr. Monk, she wanted you to cash it. Mr. Monk, if you deposit this check, then you can pay your staff. And when I say ""staff,"" I mean me. But she came to me. I didn't protect her. Mr. Monk, you did everything you could. What about the promise I made that he wouldn't get away with it? - You made a promise to me too. - There he is. - What? - My God He's coming. What do we do? We should kiss. No! I didn't say that. I wasn't thinking. I never said that. Good morning. I thought you might be thirsty. Well, this is for you, Natalie. It's lemonade. And, Mr. Monk, I believe this is your brand. My books. - I could autograph one for you. - No, thank you. No. Very well. I'll leave you two alone. Enjoy your little stakeout. Well, you have to admit, he's pretty good. What? He was right. I was thirsty. What? How do you feel? I feel fine. What? It just occurred to me. If there's poison in that lemonade, we could go to the DA, and we'd have all the evidence we need. It just occurred to you, and you didn't say anything? Mr. Monk, I have never seen you like this. How do you feel now? I hate to disappoint you, but I feel fine. - Try the water. - God! That is it. We are going home. Wait. - Stop the car. - What? What are you doing? Just stop, stop the car. - Wait. What are you do. - Stop. - Where are you going? - His garden. His garden? - Oleander. - It's from his garden. It's poisonous. Very poisonous. You dry the sap, you grind it into a powder. A quarter of a gram is enough to kill an adult. - Did look like she had a heart attack. - Did look like she had a heart attack. This is how he did it. So you were in his garden on his property? You said you wanted evidence, hard evidence. Here it is. Monk, a million people have this flower in their garden. I used to have some. Let's let the DA. Decide. Monk, I'm not going to the DA. Waving a shrub. Look, you don't seem to understand. This Patrick Kloster thing is a big, bad headline just waiting to happen. Now I know that you're upset. I know that this case is very important to you. But we need real hard evidence. Maybe if you found some powder already ground up in a little bottle inside his house. Maybe then. In a bottle? Right, we wouldn't even need his fingerprints. We could just say he wore gloves. What'd you say? Nothing. Nothing. Can I talk to you for a minute? Come here, I want to show you something. What is it? Down the hall there's a sign I think is a little crooked. I want your opinion. Crooked. I'll be right back. Come on. How crooked is it? It's very crooked. You're not gonna believe it. Why do you need me? - 'cause I'm not sure if it is crooked. - You just said it's very crooked. Look, I don't know, Monk. It's, is anybody else in there? It's in here. There's nothing crooked in here. I hope not. Don't do it. Don't do what? Break my heart. You're thinking about planting evidence in kloster's house. Monk, I've been a cop for 30 years. I've had this conversation nine times. I never thought that I'd be having it with you. There's a line. You step across it, and you're gone for good. There's no going back. - You don't understand. - I do understand. I've been there. I've had cases like this, cases you couldn't shake. Sometimes you have to let it go. Let it go? We have to move on. There's a city, a city full of people, other people that need our help right now. When Trudy was dying, I got there late, almost too late. - I was there. - She was slipping away. She couldn't speak. All she could do was reach out. She. She grabbed me with both hands. Like this. feel it. When I promised Linda Kloster, when I gave her my solemn word that her husband would pay, she grabbed my hand the exact same way. I'm not letting this one go. I'm not moving on. That's an illegal move, mr. Monk. Something I'd expect from a much weaker player. The truth is, I have been waiting for you all night. - I'd almost given up. - You were waiting for me? Ever since I noticed a branch missing from an Oleander Bush in my garden. You don't really think that window was left unlocked by accident, do you, Mr. Monk? Breaking and entering. I believe that is a Felony. Don't worry. I'm not a litigious man. I prefer to settle my problems out of court, as you well know. I am replaying a match of mine from 1995. Boris spassky was playing white. Where would we be without our little games, hey, Mr. Monk? An island of order in a chaotic world. This is where I beat him, right There. This is a wedding gift. You dedicated one of your books to ""my Queen Tatiana."" You were married before. Very good, Mr. Monk. Divorced? My wife died. - She must have been quite young. - Yes, she was. Let me guess, heart attack? Mr. Kloster, the district attorney's office and Captain Stottlemeyer would like to exhume the body of your first wife. I've read their application. They've listed a number of similarities between the two cases. Your first wife, tatiana bay kloster, was in her 30s, Apparently healthy, and died from a sudden and severe cardiac event. She too was heavily insured. Captain Stottlemeyer and Mr. Monk have been to pacifica. They've spoken to some of your old neighbors. And a few of them remember you had oleander plants in your garden 15 years ago. I'm convinced there's a clear and unique pattern of behavior. I am going to grant this petition. Your first wife's body will be exhumed first thing tomorrow. And let me warn you. If in fact there are traces of this poison in her body, you can expect the district attorney's office to bring two counts of murder. Thank you. Section 261. There. Here. Here it is. Harry, over here! You're making a big mistake. You made the mistake, Kloster. You should have had your first wife cremated too. Sorry for the delay. We know how important this is, so we wanted to make sure. There was no poison in the body. We didn't find a thing. Impossible. The woman died of natural causes. We're sure of it. Thank you, Mr. Monk. What for? Our little game. To be honest with you, i'm sorry it's over. - Excuse us. - Very good. - Gonna need you, young man. - Excuse us. Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for your generous support. We're gonna begin the exhibition in just a few minutes. International grandmaster Patrick Kloster will be playing simultaneous matches against four of the highest ranked players in California. It should prove to be very exciting. There's that kid from the park. What a geep. What's a geep? Well, it's a geek who's a little creepy. All right Mr. Monk, I have to be honest. I'm still not quite sure why we're here. He won't talk to you. He won't return your phone calls. - What can we do? - I don't know. But I can't just quit. To me, quitting would be like giving up. If I was playing against him, he'd have to talk to me, right? Okay, wait here. What's she doing? She's, she's flirting. - She's good at it. - Shut up. She's definitely done this before. Okay. - Yeah, she's got it down. - Thank you. Mom, you rember my friend Eric. I told him about the case. And about how you think mr. Kloster killed his wife. I believe it too. Congratulations. You're player number one. You mean I can play in the tournament? You're my proxy. It's in the bylaws. I can designate someone to take my place. Thank you. Don't bring out your queen too early. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome International Grandmaster Patrick Kloster. Well, well, well, the tenacious mr. Monk. Your threshold for pain must be extraordinary. - It's your move. - Yes, I know. Linda must have truly despised me to have brought you into my life. Mr. Monk. That's my piece, mr. Monk. I'm just centering it. You'll thank me later. Mr. Monk. Mr. Monk, please. I pass. You can't pass. For the love of god, why don't you just resign? - How'bout this. - If I win this game, you have to tell me how you poisoned your wives. What are you talking about? I am not agreeing to that. How'bout this, if we play to a draw, you come with me to police headquarters. Mr. Monk, I'm not negotiating with you. When are you going to realize that it is over? You're castling? Yes, the rook and the King switch places. They switch places. Yes, it's the best way I know to get oneself out of trouble. This is it. You came here that night before we exhumed your wife's body. And you switched headstones. That's why we didn't find any poison. We dug up the wrong body. Very good, mr. Monk. - You play a brilliant endgame. - Right. Can I tell you something? I am sick and tired of you talking like this, all these chess metaphors. Two women are dead. They're not chess pieces, Patrick. They're human beings. I think they deserve better. Although, if you insist, checkmate. What? Nothing. I was just thinking about the case and how you solved it. - You really are amazing. - Well, - thank you. - No, you really are my Hero. Okay. I know this sounds crazy, mr. Monk, but - could I have your autograph? - No please. Please, just to have it for myself, like a keepsake. Come on, it'll just take a second. All right, if it really means something to you. Okay. - Thank you. - That's Linda Kloster's check. Which just endorsed. I'll be right back. I going to the bank. - You can't deposit that. - Why not? You solved the case. You kept your promise. Besides I need the money. Natalie, let go. Just give it back. - I think those books are out of order. - Where? - Nat. - Dah! Oh, my god, they really are out of order."
"And the final number is Making tonight's gold rush numbers and 44. This is your gold rush girl Marissa Kessler wishing everyone a lucky Lotto day. Somebody help me! Help! Help me! No! No! No, no, please, don't! No. - = Monk 703 =- Sub VO : ¤Aka¤ & ¤YaYa¤ [Sub-Way.fr.] There's something wrong here. This is wrong. This is very wrong. This is very, very Wrong? This was no random mugging. This was all about her. He was - after her. - Took her Purse and some Jewelry. He wanted us to think Robbery. She was stabbed six times. That's right. Two in the neck, four in the back. Or was stabbed three times. Look at the pattern. Two, two, and two. Three times With a pair of scissors. Yes, that's possible. Who brings scissors to a mugging? Scissors say what? - Spur of the moment, not planned. - Plus The mud on her shoes. There's a mud puddle near the exit. But there's a light right there. If she was walking, she would've seen that. So she was running when she left the building. Whatever happened started inside. There was some kind of fight. He grabbed some scissors and chased her out here. Find me the station manager. I want a list of every employee that was here last night. Make that every employee, period. Yes, sir. Any idea on motive? I guess you can say that there were 12 million people with a motive, myself included. This was the Lotto girl. She broke my heart three times a week. What is that? What's what? On her fingertips. Is that paint? Yeah, looks like it. Hey, Gabby! - Take a sample from her left fingers, - Left hand. Excuse me, Mr. Monk? I have a nephew. He's ten years old. He's your biggest fan. He clips articles. He thinks you're cooler than Spider-man. Really? Kids! If I could get your autograph, he'd think i'm some kind of hero. Sorry, Mr. Monk is working. Maybe when he's finished. - I'm sorry. - Anything else? Clues, clues, scanning, scanning. No, that's it, all done. You said something about an autograph? That would be great. Thank you so much. I got. Would you mind? Would you mind? Perpendicular. Put your head down. Your hair's in the way. Head down, head down. Are you okay? - She's fine. - She looks mad. No, that's just her look. What's that? - ""It looks like her number came up."" - It's a zinger. She's a lotto girl. Her number came up. Get it? You remember last year sergeant Beecham shoved that junkie into a lamp post, and he said, ""i'll keep you posted."" - I heard about that. - Everybody heard about it. I mean, people were repeating it. It was famous. This is even better. - This is a classic. - If you say so. Yeah, I just need to find the right moment. Captain, if you're ready to release the body, I can take her downtown. I still don't get it. Who'd want to kill the Lotto girl? I guess her number came up. - Hey, what are you doing? - Hey, what are you doing? - That was my line, man. - What are you talking about? I just said the exact same thing two seconds Ask the captain. - This is a crime scene, for god sakes. - No, you heard me. You know what? He must've heard me. It's okay, look. It's written in my notebook right here. See that? ""It looks like her number came up."" Let's see your notebook. I didn't write it down. I just thought of it. Please, come on! Can you believe this guy? You know what? I'm gonna have your badge, officer Kil. Come on, Shecky, let's walk it off. Excuse me. I'm Stan Lawrence. I'm the station manager. - Here's that list you wanted. - Great, great. I'll make sure they get it. How long did she work here? Not long. Just a few weeks. I still can't believe it. I should've put more lights back here. No, you can't blame yourself. It was after midnight. The parking lot was empty. More lights wouldn't have made a difference. Thank you, officer. That's very nice of you to say. I'm not an officer. I work with Mr. Monk. Is that Adrian Monk? I've heard of him. He's a genius, right? And you're his partner. Partner/ babysitter/assistant/ babysitter. - What's your name? - Natalie Teeger. Ms. Teeger, I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting? Me? - No! - Well, here's my problem. We've got another show tomorrow night, and I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers. You mean on Tv? I think you're a natural. - No, I don't think so. - Here you go. I was just talking to his nephew on the phone. He couldn't even believe it was really me. Felt like felt like fats Domino. Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence. He's the station manager. He just asked me to be the new Lotto girl. Only for one night. We can hold a regular audition over the weekend. What do you think? I don't know. What do you think? - I think it sounds like fun. - I know, but here's the thing. Tomorrow is wednesday. - We already made plans. - What plans? Me making dinner while you vacuum the rug? Exactly. And here's the other thing. If I let you take a night off, I have to let everybody take a night off. Who's everybody? What are you talking about? It's just me. Mr. Monk, come on. It's one night. Well, then I'll guess i'll just have to say no Kay. No kay. No kay. Which is it? ""No"" or ""okay?"" Nokay. Noookay. He's trying to say okay. That's as close as he's ever gonna get. No kay. - Nokay. - I'll do it. Nokay. - She looks nervous. - I don't care, as long as she's lucky. - Is it too much? - You look great. Excuse me, new girl. New girl, you're off your mark. - My mark? - Yeah, the big ""X"" on the floor. - Look where i'm pointing. - 90 seconds! I don't have a script. Excuse me, I never got a script. There is no script. This is the lottery. For the love of god, f there was script, we'd all be rich. Amateurs. Captain, Lieutenant. How's the investigation going? Well, we're just getting started. Spoke to the staff, the camera crew. Everybody said they left the building after the show. They usually do. Well, somebody was here. The girl didn't stab herself. You wanted to know if Marissa received any fan mail. Some of them are pretty dicey. You know, personal. I put them on top. I need quiet, everyone! New girl. New girl, you're on in five, four, three, two, and you're on. Good evening people. Welcome to the big gold rush pick 6. I'm Natalie Teeger. Are you ready to play? Then let's play the lottery. And the first number is Turn it on! - Turn it on! - Oh, my god! And the first number is My mother's birthday. The next number cards in a deck. The next number is The seven dwarves. Seven dwarves. And Crap. Apparently not everybody's favorite. And the final number is 17. My daughter's age. Hi, Julie! Once again, the gold rush numbers are and 17, so that's it for now. Keep playing Lotto. You'll thank me later. You'll thank me later. That's my line. I say that. Hurts, doesn't it? You know, I might as well flush God! I was terrible. Wasn't I terrible? - Yes. - You were great. God, I don't know what happened. I just got so nervous. - You were great. - It's like a tax on the stupid. Come on, Randy. We're parked out front. Good job. Well, thank you, mr. Monk. - It was fun. - Yeah. I'm glad you did it. What a fun thing to do only one time and never try it again or mention it again. Natalie, where you going? Mr. Lawrence, I told you I wasn't an actor. I'm so sorry. Sorry about what? That you did such a terrific job? The phones are lighting up like crazy. They love you. And those little ad lib things you did. You were wonderful. Wasn't she wonderful? So what do you say? - About what? - About doing it full-time. It's just three nights a week. I promise it won't interfere with your day job. I mean, I don't know. You really thought I was good? I told you when I met you you're a natural. Mr. Monk? Well, why - Why don't we think about it? - Okay, I will. I just did. I want to do it! I'm so sorry, but I could really use the money, - and I think it could be fun. - There you go. A star is born! D-d-don't worry. It's not gonna change a thing. My job with you always comes first, I promise. Come on, we've got a million things to do. We gotta talk to the publicity people and set up a photo shoot. I hope your afternoon is free Natalie. I hate that picture! I like the other one better. The one on the trolley cars. What do you think? I don't know. My god, it's so weird seein myself on a bus like that. I mean, I can't believe it's really me up there. I can't believe this is really happening. I can't believe it either. I hate to bring this up, but we have work to do. Remember, your predecessor, Marissa Kessler. Murder victim. Multiple stab wounds. Does that ring a bell? Sorry, sorry. All right, Randy and the Captain are probably already there. Should be just around the corner. It's number 24. - 24. - Are you done? Sorry, let's do this. What's the guy name? Her who was it? - Her ex-boyfriend? - No! No, the ex-boyfriend had an alibi and he checked God. That's right, you weren't at the meeting this morning. But I had to shop for a dress. I can't wear the same thing every show. I had to wear the same blouse three times last week. Three! Three. Three, tres, three. - Hello. - Sorry. Just remind me. All right, his name is Malcolm O'dwyer. He's some kind of lottery fanatic. Wrote a bunch of fan letters to Marissa before she was killed. Hey! I'm a big fan! - Thank you very much. - Not you. The Lotto girl. You'll thank me later! That's not actually my line. Mr. Monk said it first! I thought that was you. It's you, right? Yeah, yes, it is. - Yeah. - Natalie Teeger. Oh, my god. I hate to bother you. Would you mind? - Really do have to. - Sure. - We should we should head up. - Mr. Monk, do you mind? - Captain's probably. - Mr. Monk. Bend. Bend a little. Bend, please. Bend. I never know what to say. I know what to say. I write those letters? Of course I wrote the letters. My name's on them. I'm not gonna Deny that. - Did you bother reading them? - Yes, sir, I have. Then you know I didn't threaten anybody. I offered the producers and the lottery commissioner some constructive criticism. I know why they don't listen to me. I know more about this lottery system than any living American. - I'm sure you do, Mr. O'dwyer. - It's not just a game. Not to me. - I can see that. - Where were you a week ago monday, sir? A week ago monday. That would be 4, 7, - Excuse me? - I was here. Like always watching a drawing. Three prime numbers! I did not see that one coming. - Do own a pair of scissors Mr. O'dwyer? - Of course I do. Who doesn't? May I see them, please. - How about some metallic paint? - Paint? Yeah, a shade called titanium black. Do you think I killed Melissa Kessler? You do have her picture up all over the wall? I've got everybody's picture up on the wall. I mean, these are the past lottery girls. The jackpot winners. People who work there. Secretaries, gaffers. They all know me. I'm a freelance journalist. I, publish a newsletter. Lotto bulletin. Yeah, I've seen that. What's this? These are some numbers i'm thinking of playing. No, Malcolm, don't worry. Nobody's gonna steal your numbers. You'd be a fool not to. These six numbers aren't just chosen at random. They're my own algorithm based on probability, emerging number patterns the theories of sir Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton. Really? There's just six numbers. You only buy one ticket a week? That's all I need. How many do you buy? Well, it depends. You're just shotgunning it? Rookie move. Well, how much have you won? How much ever or how much this year? Let's say ever. Zero. - It's not just about winning or losing. - It's the lottery! It's all about winning. What else is there? The journey, Captain! It's how you get there. I'd rather lose my way then win a $20 million jackpot your way. Okay. I think we're through here. You think you're pretty clever, don't you, Mr. Lottery expert? I've got news for you. We've got your number. - Mother of Mercy. - Yeah, we were just leaving. I don't blame you. Who is this guy? A very colorful dead end. Where's Natalie? She's downstairs. She's signing autographs. You hate this, don't you? - What? - Natalie getting all the attention. - No, I'm happy for her. - Sure you are. It's good for her. She deserves it. - It's long overdue. - It's driving you crazy. I can tell. You used to be the superstar. Now you're Garfunkel. I'm not Garfunkel. You're Garfunkel, and you can't stand it. I'm not Garfunkel. I'm not Garfunkel. Congratulations to all your winners. We'll see you monday night for the biggest super jackpot in Lotto history. $212 million. I'm Natalie Teeger reminding everybody to try your luck. You'll thank me later. And we're out. Eddie, you did it again. Please don't cue the music until I'm waving good-bye. - Sorry. - It's not rocket science. - There you are. Did you get my email? - About? My new idea. About all the fan letters I've been getting. I thought - I could read a few of them on the air. - I don't really think we have time. Sure we have time. I'll just pick the Lotto numbers faster. You see, Natalie, the show's about the numbers. That's why people are watching. It's not really about you really. Really? Is that what you're hearing? Because that's not what I'm hearing. Why don't we discuss this later? I'll see you monday. Jeez! Excuse me. Do these cables have to be right here? Yes, they do. Because they Carry your voice from this microphone to that soundboard. Can't you put them someplace else? I almost broke my neck. Almost doesn't count. Fine, I'll do it. Okay, what are you doing? Are you mental? Put it down, put it down. - Let it go. Put it down. - I'm taking care of it. I got it. Put it down! - What the hell are you doing? - I can't work with this guy. You can't work with me? Who do you think you are, lady? I've been here for eight years, and you're just another untalented pretty face. - Billy, calm down. - Untalented? The ratings keep going up every night. How do you explain that? The ratings go up when the jackpot goes up! It has nothing to do with you, you moron! Billy, I've warned you before about your attitude. That's it. You're out of here. You're fired. Somebody call security! What? No, no, fired? Wait, no, don't fire him. Look, see, I'm moving it. I'm moving the cable. Get him out of here. - Stan, don't do this. Please, not now? - Come on, I'm sorry. - It's too late, Billy. - I'm apologizing! Has been terminated. I don't want him back in the building. You make sure you get his security pass and keys. Get him out of here! Stan, listen to me. It was my fault too. I tripped over the cable, I. This is not about you. I've been warning this guy all summer. Come on, people. Let's get that stage reset and make it look good. Big, big jackpot on monday. - Garfunkel? - Yeah, I'm probably the biggest garfunkel who ever lived. I mean, after all I've done for her. You know, I give her money almost every week. But doesn't she work for you? That's not the point exactly. Natalie's a human being. Now all this attention can throw a person off-balance, especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly. I once wrote a book on body language, and it it spent all of three minutes on the best seller list. Now I was very young, and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva. - I didn't like myself very much. - So now you're on her side. The question is why aren't you on her side? Why aren't you happy for her? Natalie's your friend. Maybe you're afraid She doesn't need you anymore. Maybe you're afraid of losing her. - Maybe I just feel insulted. - Insulted? What I do is hard. I am out there. I am sweating out every clue. I'm putting killers behind bars. What does she do? What does she do?! Number 91! Number 91. I mean, how hard is that? A talking monkey could do her job. - It's embarrassing. - Actually, that's 16. You're holding it upside down. It's confusing. There's usually a little line under the nine. It goes under the six. The line goes under the six. - I'm pretty sure it's the nine. - It's no big deal. - I've seen it my whole life. - I've never seen it under the six. Why don't we ask Natalie then? She's the expert. Okay, okay. But I see your point. About the monkey. Look, all I'm trying to say is it's not the same Natalie. If you knew her, you wouldn't know her. Last night after the show, she got somebody fired. - Really? - One of the crew, the sound guy. There were some wires on the floor. She was like complaining and I mean, I met the guy when I was. He was a nice kid. Now what's he gonna do? What's he gonna do? Wait. Don't tell me. Sound engineer billy logan, right? My what are you doing here? My god, come in, come in! I can't believe this. You've been taking pictures of me. Yeah, I thought I saw you. I hope you don't mind. There was nothing on the web site, so I took a few candids. They're for the next issue. Cast and crew after-hours, behind the scenes. While I have you here, I have, well, a couple of questions. It's not your lucky day. What a shame. Just a kid. At least he didn't hit anybody when he jumped. Are we sure he jumped? ""Tired of losing."" Not much of a note. Brevity, the soul of wit. But he was a writer. Look at all these letters. No, there's something weird about this. Monk, look around you. That note's probably the least weird thing in the whole apartment. This is the birthplace of weird. But why today? This guy was a lottery nut. Isn't tomorrow night the big jackpot? Yeah. Yeah, he probably knew he'd never win, which makes him a whole lot smarter than me. What do you got? Contact lens case. With only one lens. Fluid! It's fluid! I need a wipe. I don't have a wipe. G-give me a wipe. Just I need a wipe. Where's Natalie? I'm your biggest fan. I never Miss a show. Thank you. That means a lot. Natalie, what's your favorite number? My gosh, there's so many. - Mine's 19. - That's a good one. Do you think it's gonna come up on the show tomorrow? I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. I got a little distracted. Is the cadaver in your way? We could. We could move it across the street if you like. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. So how did it go upstairs? Fine. That your boyfriend? No, this is my boss. This is Adrian Monk, who's a hugely famous detective. He solves huge. - Natalie, who does your hair? - God. Well, you take your time, okay. I'll just be over here at the crime scene if anybody's interested. Natalie, my mom's in the hospital, and it would mean so much to her if you would take a picture of me. - Please? - Okay. Thanks. Murder! Or suicide. Or murder. It's a tough call. Yeah, this is a tough one. In many ways this reminds me of the killer astronaut case I solved last year. You probably read about it. Hey, Monk, look at this. Hello! It's the other lens. Looks like you were right. Nobody jumps after putting in one contact lens. Want me to put it in this evidence bag? Bag number 32! Hey, Thirrrtyyy-two! Mr. Monk, are you mocking me in public? - I don't make fun of your job. - That's because I have a real job. I'm solving a homicide here. I have a real job too. I'm changing people's lives. I'm making them rich. You are not making them rich. You're not giving them financial advice. You're just reading little numbers off little white ping pong balls. And if it wasn't you, they'd just hire some other bim Some other what? ""Bim"" what? - Bimportant person. - Mr. Monk, do you think i'm a bimbo? Look, I know what I do isn't the most bimportant job on the earth, but what do I do for you? Hand you wipes all day long. Pick up your laundry. You know, people admire me now, and I admit it, I am enjoying the attention. - I guess I needed it. - Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but I can't work like this. So you're gonna have to choose. All right, then I guess I quit. Thank god! Call the station manager. - Tell him to find somebody else. - No, I quit you. I quit us. Monk, stop crying. I don't know where she is. It's gonna be okay. No, no, I can't, Monk. I'm at the gym. No, you don't want to come down here, believe me. There are naked people here. Look, I tell you what. I gotta work late tonight. Why don't you come by the office. Good, okay. See you then. Hello, everybody. I'm Natalie Teeger. Who's ready to make lotto history? Our super jackpot is worth $212 million. Why did I make her choose? Of course she'd choose to leave. Everybody leaves. First my father. - Monk, don't do this now. - Then trudy. - Trudy didn't leave you. - Sharona and Dr. Kroger. I can't blame Natalie for leaving. I'd leave me too if I had the chance. I am the king of garfunkel. I am oozing garfunkel. She'll be back Monk. She just needs time to cool off. That's right. She probably feels worse than you do. She looks pretty happy to me. Would you just turn it off? Please, this is too painful. No, no, wait, did she just say 15? I got four numbers here. Our next number is 33. 3-3, so nice they named it twice. My god. Okay, all right, I can't stand it anymore, all right? And our final number for $212 million is 54! Making tonight's final gold rush numbers 25, 62, 12, 15, 33, and 54, 15, 33 and 54. My dear lord! - All day I had this feeling. - Congratulations. Are you gonna quit? What? You kidding? I quit 30 seconds ago when the 54 ball popped out of the drum. Come here, you big beautiful no longer hypothetical boat! Randy, do you still have those student loans? Yeah, I got eight more years. - Not anymore! - No way. No way, I love you! Yes, thank you! - Thank you. - I don't believe it. Wait, 200 what? $212 million! I gotta call my kids. I gotta find a good accountant. Hey, I can buy a good accountant. I can buy 20 good accountants! - I hit the jackpot! - Captain just won the lottery! My god. Everybody leaves. Mr. Monk, I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go. What happened? Are you okay? - You haven't heard? - What? What time is it? Turn on the news. Wh-what channel? Any channel. A major scandal involving the gold rush lottery. As we told you this morning, there were two winners last night's jackpot giveaway. Eugene Maddox, a truck driver from rockaway township, and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated officer with the San Francisco Police. Now according to the rules, these two men would split the $212 million Grand Prize. - What do you do for a living? - Yesterday I was unemployed. - Today, I guess I'm retired. - That makes two of us, brother. But in a stunning development this morning, the lottery commissioner suspended all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer has known and worked with Natalie Teeger, the newly-hired Lotto ball girl. There is a news conference They said we cheated. Why? Just because you know the Captain? I mean, it looks bad, but it's not impossible. No, it's not just that. They said they have proof. They checked the equipment. There was something wrong with the machine. It was rigged. Rigged. They said i'm going to jail. Mr. Monk, I sorry I said I quit I'm sorry. Okay, - okay. - You have to help me. Good morning, Ms. Teeger. Captain. You and your friend Mr. Monk wantes to see what evidence we had. Here it is. Before we begin, is there anything you want to say to the lottery commissioner? Yep. I'm not a cheater. Neither is Natalie. That's all I have to say. Well, I'm afraid we can prove otherwise, Captain Stottlemeyer. After the drawing, we received a phone call. An anonymous tip. I asked Mr. Lawrence to check it out. I reviewed the tape from monday night's show. I didn't see anything suspicious, so we examined the machine itself. We examined the balls. We measured them. We weighed them. We were bouncing them, and everything seemed perfectly normal. - So what's the problem? - This is the problem. - The same numbers? - The same numbers. - But that's not possible. - That's what we thought. - So we tried again. - And again. And again. And the same six numbers kept popping up. Not always in the same order, but they very same numbers. How did that happen? They're very lucky numbers. Metallic paint. Very good, Mr. Monk. We took a closer look. The numbers on these six balls, and only these six balls, were painted with metal-based paint. - All the others are acrylic-based. - There's a magnet in the microphone. - Right again, Mr. Monk. - An electromagnet, battery-operated. Strong enough to pull these six balls and only these balls up the chute. We didn't put that there. Ms. Teeger, please. Don't insult us. You started working here two weeks ago. You had access to the equipment. Suddenly your friend wins what? $106 million. I suggest you both get good lawyers. What? Hey, Monk, you got anything? There were two winners. What happened to the other man? The truck driver. Eugene Maddox. We've already talked to his lawyers. He's agreed not to sue us in exchange for a rather generous settlement. I'm sure he did. Waiter, yo! There's something wrong with my glass. It's empty! You know what? Hell, just bring the whole bottle - and charge it to the room. - I'm afraid you can't afford it, Billy. Think you guys won the jackpot? We got news for you, Billy. We got your numbers. Number Number we got your number. Num numbers? Will you girls excuse us for a minute? So you guys are old friends? No, no. We just met at the bar. I recognized him from Tv. I went over and said hello. What your name again? Billy, don't bother. We've already checked. You've guys have known each other for years. You've worked on five movies together. I knew I'd seen this logo somewhere before. At the press conference. It was on your friend's jacket. That's the clue that capped the case. That's not even a real phrase. It's all over, Billy. We know why you killed Marissa Kessler. The paint we found on her fingertips told the whole story. That night after the show, she must've caught you rigging the equipment. Looks like you painted yourself into a corner. You think I rigged the super jackpot? That's right. It's okay, if I rigged the lottery, if if I'm so smart, why would I let this hammerhead win half the money? You didn't want to, you didn't plan on it, but you got fired. Because of her. There were cables on the floor. Somebody could've gotten killed. They were duct taped down. Nobody was tripping on it. Okay, okay. - I told you about her. - Can we focus here? Your plan was already in motion. You put the Gizmo in the microphone, but getting fired ruined everything. They escorted you out of the studio. They took your security pass, and you couldn't get back in. You had a problem, Billy. - A real dilemma. - Is that right? Yeah, you knew the six numbers that were going to hit. But then what? You were locked out of the building. You couldn't just turn the magnet off. You knew the same numbers were gonna keep coming up night after night. After four or five times, somebody would've noticed. They'd find the magnet. You'd be the first and only suspect, so you framed us. Do you have any idea what you did to this man? This man has nothing. His wife left him. His girlfriend is in Jail, and he's been living in a ratty little condo. - Thank you. - He's been looking at a sad little picture or a boat on a wall for 11 years, and you gave him hope, and then you ripped his heart out. For that, you're gonna burn in hell. - That and a homicide. - Actually, two homicides. Don't forget the lottery fanatic who had a picture of them both together. I think we're done here. You two are under arrest. Stand up. Mr. Max arrest. Thank you. Glad you like numbers, 'cause you're gonna be wearing - some numbers on your shirt. - Is that right? - They're not gonna be Lotto numbers. - I get it. - Because you're going to prison. - I get it. - You have the right to remain silent. - I will if you will. You Miss it, don't you? More than you know. No, I have the best job in the world right here. I'm proud to be your garfunkel, Mr. Monk. You know, we can be garfunkels. A couple of garfunkels. Yeah, maybe. There's no law against it. - Do you know who Garfunkel is? - Sure, - he's a Cartoon cat. He hates mondays. - No, that's Garfield. - This is Garfunkel. - Garfunkel right. That the thing my grandmother had on her neck. No, he's a singer. Simon and Garfunkel. - Right! The Chipmunks. - No, not the chipmunks. Bridge over troubled water. Mrs. Robinson. - What are you talking about? - Their songs. Feelin'groovy. - So they're hippies. - Yeah, I guess so. - Cartoon hippies. - No, not cartoon hippies. Mr. Monk!"
"All right, home sweet home. Hey, new poster. - What do you think? - He looks mad, don't he? Yeah, 'cause he knows you're going home with the championship belt. That's why he's mad. Well, let's get started? Get the heart going. Hey, Eddie, what the hell are you doing here? - You been here all night? - I must have fallen asleep back there. Jesus. I hope to hell he didn't heave. I'm not cleaning it up. Hey, lay off Eddie. He's my good luck charm. Wasn't much luck five years ago. That's ancient history, Eddie. Here, man. Here's ten bucks. Why don't you grab yourself some breakfast. Something on a plate. Not in a bottle. - Thanks, champ, put it on my tab. - I ain't the champ yet. Yeah, well, you will be. And I wouldn't worry too much about that fight next week. He'll be sucking Canvass. I guarantee it. You just gotta remember two things. Lean into him. Stay in his face. And number two -= Monk 704 =- Sub VO : ¤Aka  &  YaYa¤ [Sub-Way.fr.] Thank you for coming. - You redecorating? - It's stolen art. There's a rumor some guy in the city has been buying it all up. We're supposed to keep an eye out for it. Have a seat. - Is that why you're calling us in? - I wish. You used to be on the track team in high school, right? You still run? - Sometimes. - How often? Never. - That's not very often. - No. What's going on? There is a private detective in San Diego named Rafferty. He works with the homicide squad down there as a consultant. A couple of weeks ago, they were chasing down some creep and Rafferty had a heart attack. Creep gets away. Now Rafferty's suing the city. The city's suing rafferty. It's a train wreck. Okay. So what does this have to do with, you know, me? This is from Sacramento. It is a statewide directive. Effective a week from monday, any civilian crime scene field consultant must pass a mandatory fitness test. Fitness test? The California physical agility test. The candidate must run a half a mile in four minutes then climb ten flights of stairs, do 20 pull-ups, and then scale a six-foot high wall. - Or? - There is no ""Or."" There's no ""Or"" on this page, Monk. Either you pass this fitness test or you can't work here anymore. Where'd you get that suit? Kevin Dorfman, it was a birthday gift. I never thought I'd get the chance to wear it. What's so funny? What's so funny? That girl over there, she's just doing a funny dance. Which one? In the green sweater. She stopped now. What kind of dance? I don't know. Like, a Cowboy dance, a funny Cowboy dance. A Cowboy dance? Yeah, like Yeah, that's not a Cowboy dance. That's more like a happy prospector. Yeah, I guess you're right. - Why was she dancing like a prospector? - I don't know, Mr. Monk. - She's from a ranch probably. - Can we just forget that now and get back to this? All right, come on, I have to run a half mile in four minutes, then I gotta climb that fence, do some pull-ups and then hit those stairs, right? Right. Okay, all right. Here we go. Here we go. On your mark. Get set. Go. Oh, god. Are you okay? - Don't stop the clock. - Are you okay? - I can do this. Don't stop it. - Just stay there. Don't get up. Just stay there. God. Hello. Yeah, no, we're at the track. My god. Oh, my god. We're on our way. Wait, wait, Mr. Monk, there's been a bombing downtown. We have to go now, okay? So give me your hand. Come on, come on. Here, here, here. One, two, three. Okay. Well, we found the detonator. It's called a tumbler switch. It's what they use in airbags. It's motion sensitive. It's actually pretty sophisticated. - The bomb was meant for me. - Yes, sir. Your schedule's well-known. You're always the first one here. The killer figured you'd be the one hitting that bag. Mister Regis, Ray, Machine, do you have any enemies? Or have you received any threats lately? Not lately. Five years ago when I lost the title, it seemed like everybody wanted my head. That was a tough night. I thought you had him in the fifth. Yeah. It wasn't my night. It's a tough racket. I do a little boxing myself. - Light middleweight. - When did you box? Remember the benefit for the police athlete league? Took sergeant mulroney in nine rounds. TKO. Left uppercut. Stan mulroney, he retired 12 years ago. We called him ""pops."" That's right. He was older than me. He was experienced. - Wiley. - He had a cane. - And he used it. - Captain. Yeah. Anything? A whole lot of nothing. He wore gloves and slippers. This guy is a ghost. - This the bag? - What's left of it. The thread. Sir? When the killer put the bomb back in the bag, he sewed it up, and he licked that thread. You see it's all twisted up. There should be DNA all over that. I'll check it out. - Can we start packing up? - No, let's wait for Monk. - He should be here in a minute. - All right. Adrian Monk, the detective? He's supposed to be the best. Best of the best. He's Kinda like a superhero. He's good, but I wouldn't call him a superhero. - I guess I stand corrected. - Looks like a big plum. - How'd it go? - It went good. You know, it was our first day. So we're just warming up, - but he's gonna do great. - I went about 30 yards. - Did you hit a wall? - I wish I had. It woulda knocked me unconscious. Adrian Monk, Ray ""The Machine"" Regis. - This is his manager, Louie Flynn. - Mr. Monk, it's an honor. When I heard you were coming, I said to myself, okay, we're gonna be okay. We're in good hands. 'cause this guy Monk will find Eddie's killer. He's like me. He's a fighter. He'll never give up. This is my last case. - This is not your last case. - You weren't there. He look like a big, sad plum. A half mile in four minutes. No, no, no. That's part of it. And it can't be done. Yeah, people do it every day. - Not people my age. - That's not true. Not people my age with my body. I knew I was getting old, but when did I get too old? Adrian, I think you're being a little too hard on yourself. I mean, you haven't run in In what, 30 years? It doesn't matter. I can't do it. Last night, I made a decision. I quit. It's over. I just I'm giving up. Just like that? You're giving up being a detective? And any chance you'll ever have of being reinstated? Adrian, we haven't known each other very long. But I'm a pretty good judge of character. And I know one thing for sure. - You're no quitter. - Then how do you explain this? I quit. All right, what would you do? How would you pay the rent? Welfare. Welfare? That's your plan? What about Natalie? She's been depending on you. - What would she do? - Welfare. We can be welfare buddies. Adrian. Quitting is a terrible habit. It's like a drug. Once you start, it's almost impossible to stop. I'm not even sure you're eligible for welfare. You have to meet certain criteria. You don't have to run half a mile in four minutes? - No. - Then I'll be fine. Here you go. Great! - It's a nice mug. - Yeah, it's from my daughter. But that mug is a lie. I wasn't the world's greatest dad. She was the world's greatest daughter, you know. Rebecca. She died five years ago. - I'm sorry. - Yeah. Well, life goes on. And on, and on. - Where's your lady friend? - She's picking up her kid. Mr. Flynn? Have you ever seen this man? No. We found some DNA for Charles bach. - Bach? - They call him the iceman. That doesn't sound good. Actually it suits him. He's a professional hitman. The FBI thinks he's killed 14 people. It means that somebody with some very deep pockets has put a contract out on your boy. Now, you said you and Ray don't have any enemies. - Do you want to amend that statement? - No. Nope. You know the Marino family, mr. Flynn? Frankie Marino? - Yeah, just from the newspapers. - Well, the iceman used to work for him. You don't happen to owe Frank Marino or anybody on his crew any money by any chance? Hello, no! We are clean. Ray is the clean machine. You might want to think about that Lou, because this guy's not gonna stop. He's a machine too. We think he's gonna try again. We're thinking friday night. You mean during a fight? It would make sense. We cannot protect him in the ring. Are you telling me to cancel the fight?! Forget about it! We've been fighting five years for another shot at the title. Ray is doing his job. Why the hell can't you do yours? - Monk, do you have anything? - No, I'm good. What's this? Come here a minute. Come here. I just have a couple more questions Over here. Okay. What is this? Application. Monk, you're not going on welfare. If you go on welfare, I will shoot you. Good. I'll get more money, won't i? Why? Because you're out of breath, your knees ache? So that's it? After all these years, you're just gonna walk away. Give up. What would Trudy say? No, let me rephrase that. What is Trudy saying? When I'm in the ring, people expect me to sweat. But here at home, I'm supposed to be cool. And sophisticated. Thank you, hobbs. So I use max deodorant. To give BO. A KO. It's still a little garbled. Let's take that last line again? So I use max deodorant. The KO. On my BO. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. I'm not used to all these words! Usually I let my hands do the talking. - Mr. M, what you doing here? - Ray, we have to talk. He's a little busy right now. This spot has to be on the air by september 1st. This is all Louie's idea. He said we should cash in now while we can. Yeah. It's important. Can you give us a minute? Okay, fine. I guess we need a break anyway. What the heck is going on? I can't believe you're watching this again. This is a busted take. - We kept the camera rolling. - Who's that guy? He owns the house. That's his old lady. She forgot to tell him we were going to shoot there. He came home, went postal. Kept shouting, threatening everybody. I wouldn't want to go Okay, playtime's over. We'll be back in ten. What's this? You threw the fight, Ray. Five years ago, the title fight. Come on, man. You hear stories all the time. I had Natalie's daughter do some research for me, on the world wide internet computer web. Don't worry, I didn't tell her what it was for. - What. - See? There's Louie Flynn. See? And there he is again. - He's always wearing the Same Cross. - Okay, so his. His mother gave him that Cross. He said it was blessed by the pope. And he has a habit. He tucks it under his shirt whenever he's Lying. Here's the title fight. You see, he's tucked it away. Like he's ashamed of himself. That doesn't prove anything. - Does it? - No. But this does. This is from what they call a website. It's from a swiss medical journal. Right after the title fight, Louie's daughter flew to geneva to have a series of experimental operations. Cost over $2 million. So where did he get all that money, Ray? 'cause your share of the purse wouldn't have covered it. You and Louie bet against yourselves. And then you threw the fight. Right? She was dying. This was her only chance. She was so young. The mob must have lost a fortune on that fight. If I could figure this out, it's possible that they did too. - And that's why they tried to kill you. - This is all my fault. What happened to Eddie. I was just hoping this friday if I won that I'd prove something. At least to myself. They won't let me fight now, right? - So my life is over. - Maybe not. I still haven't told anyone about this, not even Natalie. - Why not? - I thought about it. You've been punishing yourself for five years. Maybe that's punishment enough. Thank you, Mr. Monk. You're like an angel. If there's anything I can do for you, Now that you mention it there is something. Don't tell me to relax. He's supposed to be dead by now. He is dead. He just doesn't know it. You understand? The clock is ticking on this. I told you it's under control. He won't finish the fight. Just make sure my money's ready. Don't wait, - What? - Hello, Mr. Monk, it's time. Ray? - Are you all right? - You wanted my help, remember. Quid pro quo! - Quid what what what? - Pro quo! I owe you, brother. You gave me a second chance. Now I'm giving you one. You're gonna pass that physical next week. I guarantee it. No, no. I didn't mean. Here's the thing. This is my first quid pro quo. - I didn't know they started this early. - It ain't early. It's 5:00 a. M. Took the whole day off. Told louie I had to clear my head. You know, after everything that's happened. Drink up. - What is it? - Don't ask. - Okay, but what is it? - It's called go juice. Louie invented it 20 years ago. It's got every juice and herb you can think of all mixed together. Makes you go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! You're giving me a laxative? When I say go, I mean like the wind. Like the beast you were. And will be again. You're a beast. What are you? - A beast. - What are you?! - I'm a beast. - Let's do this! Take it. Yeah. Yeah. Hurts so good. That's it. That's it. Like a beast. Come up. The clap it. You have this. Let's get up there. Let's get there. Pick it up. All right, baby, you can do it. There you go. Where you at? There you go. Where you at? That's it. Keep your balance. I got you, I got you, there you go. There you go. Do it. Do it. Let me see the beast. The beast. Bring it faster. Faster, boy. Come on now. I know you got it. You gotta dig deep. Do you want it? Do you want it? Yes. Do you want it? Let me see how. There it is. Let me see you work. Yeah! Looking good. The beast is in you. Let me see that beast. Where's the beast at? Is that the beast fangs? Look at the beast fangs. You're a bad man. You're a bad man. Hello. - I'm looking for Frankie. - You are who? Johnny, it's okay. The captain and I are old friends. Friends is a funny word. I'm looking for Charles Bach. - Bach? - The iceman? He was on your payroll for ten years? You wearing a wire, lieutenant? - How about you? - No. Okay. - Let's talk. - Why did I just get undressed? I don't know, Randy. Everyone in the room is wondering the same thing. I haven't seen Charles in three years. Not since my trial. I heard he went freelance. Is this about the fireworks at Louie's gym? That's right. There's a contract out on Ray Regis. There was a lot of money in play the last time he fought. Some of it yours. Frankie, you've been known to hold a grudge. Not this time. There was some talk on the street the fight might end prematurely. We moved some money around. Adjusted the odds. It was actually one of the biggest paydays we ever had. - I got no beef with Ray Regis. - I am trying to save the kid's life. I don't know very much. Somebody was shopping a contract. I don't know who, but it was serious. He wanted it done by the end of the month. By the end of the month? The fight's on friday. That's the 25th. Why by the end of the month? - Weird? - Yeah, weird. Very weird. Get dressed, Randy. Yeah! Hey. - How did I do? - You finished. That was the main thing. You ran that whole half mile. Yeah, but how long? How long? Adrian, it was just a test run. It don't really count. Because it felt like five minutes, maybe maybe six. Between five and six. - Well. - 27 minutes?! That's not possible. It's not. This thing is broken. You kept rearranging the hurdles and touching everything. That stuff adds up. - I'll never do it. - Hey. Never say never. Never say never. That's the worst swear word there is. You can do it and you will do it. The beast is in you. You'll do it when you have to do it. When it's crunch time, you will reach down, deep down, and you will find it. You're gonna find it. And hopefully, I will too. Hello boxing fans and welcome to the main event 5 years in a making, Ray ""The Machine"" rageous looks to settle the score in a re-match with the Champion Carlos Hiraldo. It's all on the line tonight. - Mr. Monk, are you okay? - No. This guy's a contract killer. We think he might already be in the building. He's here because somebody wants Ray Regis dead by the end of the month. The end of the month? Why. Why not tonight? I asked myself the same question. I'm just telling you what I know. Keep your eyes open. If you see him if you think you see him, do not be a Cowboy, call it in. This guy's a pro. He's not going easily. Let's go. Hey, Bobby. Take a break, will ya? How ya doin'?

You can't be in there. Get back. Punch him! That's what you're here for! Is he okay? He's sweating like a pig. - He's supposed to sweat. - All right, hold on. Now what the hell are you doing? Stay here. Stay here. - Stay here? - Natalie, do you have any deodorant? Deodorant? For Regis. It's a perspiration problem. - No, Mr. Monk. Who cares? - Hurry up! Just get. Hurry up! The bell's about to ring. Connie, they want us upstairs. Skybox number five didn't get their food. Here. Natalie. - What? - There. Oh, my god. We have to stop the fight. No, no.

You got up here in only 90 seconds. - That's impossible. - Oh, my god! - Still need this? - God. It was him or us. The sad thing is that we'll never know who hired him. So I use Max deodorant. No, it's stolen art. There's a rumor some guy in the city's been buying it all up. We're supposed to keep an eye out for it. Are you filming this!? Come on, get. Get out of here! Turn everything off right now and get the hell out of my house! This spot has to be on the air by september 1st. He is here because somebody wants Ray Regis dead by the end of the month. We got him. - We got who? - The guy who wanted Regis dead. Remember the art gallery you had on your wall? Yeah. They're authentic. One was stolen nine years ago from a gallery in Madrid. And two are from a Museum in Venice. He was worried that somebody would see the artwork on Tv and recognize it. But he knew that if Ray Regis were dead, they would never run the ad. So he hired that terrible, terrible man. Hey, nice collection, Daniel. Too bad none of it's yours. You should just kept it all in your basement. It's fine art, lieutenant. It's meant to be savored. I never imagined my bride would invite a Tv crew into my house - while I was out of the country. - You didn't tell her it was stolen. In hindsight, maybe that's something I should have mentioned. Yeah. Get him outta here. Guy went through a lotta trouble for nothing. I mean, nobody even watches commercials anymore. - Is that right? - It's called tivo, Mr. Monk. People just zap right past it to get to the good stuff. That makes sense. - Yeah! - All right! All right! - Gotta go. - Hey, whatcha doin', taking a break? You think winning that championship belt means you can slack off? Winning the gold belt was the easy part. Keepin'it is what's hard. Okay, I love you too, Louie. Mr. M! how'd it go? If there was ever any doubt, I am the beast. - I am the beast! - He did everything. The wall, the pull-ups, the run. All under seven minutes. And that includes touching three mailboxes! I am the champion of the world. I am the champion. Looks like you got some competition, Ray. Absolutely. I see. Absolutely. You make have met your match, machine. Come on, let's do this. I ain't afraid of you. Mr. Monk, you are afraid. You're afraid of everything! Not today! Come on, champ! Let's see what you're made of. - Try and tag me. - I don't want to tag you. - Why don't you let me buy you a drink. - A drink? A drink? I'll give you a drink of this. Mr. Monk, please. Natalie, would you help me out? My god. Mr. Monk, are you okay? Don't worry. He's gonna be all right. Let's get him home. My car's outside. Come on, beast. Come on, come on, big man. - I ain't afraid of you. - I know you're not. - I'm the beast. - Yeah you're the beast. Watch your head, now. Watch your head, beast."

Actually, Mr. Monk, you're the real reason i'm here. - Yeah. - I've heard a lot about you. I've got a problem. Here, sit down. I don't know how to begin. I've never actually spoken to a detective before. Well, you can speak to Mr. Monk the same way you speak to a normal person. A close friend of mine, Jason Pierce, died last week. I'm sorry. He was the XO The second in command on our boat. They said he committed suicide. They said he'd been drinking. They found a bottle of vodka in his cabin and there was alcohol in his blood. But you don't believe it? No, sir, I don't. Jason had been sober for nine years. He had a physical three weeks ago, which I administered. I'm the ship's medical Officer. There was no alcohol in his blood. Well, people do have relapses. You know, they fall off the wagon. Not Jason. I don't believe it. Sorry, go on. There was one other thing. I saw him the night before. We made plans to go to a Giants game while we were here. He seemed fine. I assume there was an investigation. Yes, of course. NCIS ruled it a suicide. Mr. Monk, I know you're a busy man. We're only in port for one day. I wonder if you could come down to the boat and take a look around. I just I wanna know if I'm crazy. Well, of course we can. I'll get my purse. Well, you mean now, today? I can't today. Why not? Here's the thing. It it's a boat, - and I really don't do boats. - Mr. Monk, I've been on these boats. These boats are so big they don't even feel like boats. They're like islands. You've been on Islands before, right? You like Islands. - No. - It's like Hawaii. Think of it like that. We're goin'to Hawaii. I believe you are the devil. - Nice belt. - Thanks. Julie made it for mother's day. It's supposed to be good luck. Nobody shaking hands. Everybody's saluting. Maybe I should enlist. No, Mr. Monk. Please don't enlist. Don't even joke about it. - Why not? - Because I love America. Here she is. My God! - Where's the rest of her? - That's it. - Is she sinking? - No, sir. That's the USS Seattle. She's a class-four submarine. Are you okay? Submarine. You said boat. You distinctly said boat. Natalie, you were there. - We call her a boat. - It's not a boat, It's the opposite of a boat. You familiar with the word ""float""? Mr. Monk, we're already here. How about this? Three minutes, we just go on board and look around. What could happen in 3 minutes? Asphyxiation, cerebral hypoxia, - gas embolism, epstein-barr. - You know about this stuff than I do. Why can't I do it from here? I'll just look in a window. It's a submarine. There are no windows. Please, I'm saying please. He's Mitch's oldest friend. Three minutes. Three minutes, Do you have a stopwatch? Yes, sir. You got it. Just two more steps. There you go. Sir, you don't have to hold your breath. There's plenty of air. - How much time? - 15 seconds. - I'm pretty sure he killed himself. - How do you know? I've been on board 15 seconds and I'm suicidal. It's down here. How much time? - Mr. Monk, be brave. - Why, what's in it for me? It happened in here. This is just how we found him. They still haven't fixed the lock. - You're not even looking. - Yes, I am. I'm squinting so I can see better. - Mr. Monk. - Okay, all right. Commander Whitaker called a surprise drill. The XO didn't report. Commander and I came down here to find him. - When we got here, we heard a gunshot. - A gunshot From inside the room. The locked room. Yes, sir. Commander Whitaker kicked down the door. Jason was over there on the floor. Where were the keys to the cabin? - In his pocket. - And who else had a copy? No one. Okay. Look, I'm sorry, Lieutenant. I really I really am. But I just I just don't see anything here that would suggest Tweezers. Tweezers. What is that? Plastic. Looks like it has some adhesive on it. Maybe from duct tape. - Gunpowder. - What does it mean?

And this is Natalie Teeger, my former assistant. Lieutenant, what the hell's going on here? - That's an excellent question. - Sir, as I mentioned, I had some questions about lt. Commander Pierce's death. Mr. Monk is a highly decorated detective. I thought while we were here in San Francisco that Commander, sir. - May I say something? - No, you may not. What the hell are they doing on my ship in the middle of a fleet-wide exercise? I have that same question. I wanted them to see the crime scene, sir. There isn't a crime scene. Lieutenant, I sent you a copy of the NCIS report. Apparently you haven't had a chance to read it. - Commander, sir? - Yes. You're obviously very busy turning knobs and up-periscoping. Why don't you just drop us off and we will be out of your hair. How about Right there, seal beach? - Right there? We could take a taxi. - No, actually, Fisherman's wharf It's a little bit closer. If it's not out of your way. - We could turn back around this way - We are not turning around for anything. This is a fleet-wide attack-submarine-warfare exercise. For all intents and purposes, this ship is at war. Do you understand that? Yes, okay. I Yes, I get How much do you want? She'll pay 'cause her father is loaded. You've heard of Davenport toothpaste? That's the one with the girl who I've finished talking. You are now the guests of the united States Navy until the completion of this exercise. - Thank you. - Four, maybe five days. D days? Comin'about! - Blinker, blinker! - What's he doing? Comin'about! Blinker, blinker, blinker. That's the sonar. - You're turning the sonar tower. - Okay, I didn't wanna bring this up, but I am a taxpayer and that means that you, sir, work for me, and I am ordering you to turn around and take us home! Okay, I'm not ordering, i'm asking. Please, please, you don't know him. Sir, he can't handle this. Confined quarters like this underwater? He's gonna crack any second. I'm surprised he's even hanging on a little bit. Lieutenant, why don't you take your friends to the Officers'ward room? You and I can talk later. Mr. Monk, it's okay. Baby steps Left, right, left I'm sorry. It doesn't feel like a man-made boat or a submarine. Feels like a living thing. Like a beast. And I'm in In the lungs or the stomach. It's like it's swallowed me whole. I feel like it's digesting me. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do if you weren't here. Yes, it's quite fortuitous. I heard you were on a submarine, and I thought you could use my help. So I climbed on board just as the ship was going underwater. What do we do now? We're gonna take it one day at a time. One hour at a time. We're gonna get through this together. I've been observing you, Adrian. You're doing very well in spite of your condition. - Your acute claustrophobia. - Well I'd even say you're being rather heroic. I have to be brave for Natalie's sake. She's just a girl. She's depending on me. - Well, she's lucky to have you. - That's true. What? Medal of honor? I think that's a bit premature, Dr. Bell. Who's Dr. Bell? His new therapist. It's a coping mechanism. Someone to lean on. Makes sense. It does? The important thing is to stay busy. Focus on the case, all right? Now, tell me about the crime scene. Okay, well, the room was locked from the inside. Everybody's saying suicide, but it doesn't feel right. You know? I found this. Here. Smells like gunpowder. I noticed that too. Hey, we make a pretty good team. Mr. Monk, they're patching you through. Thank you. - This is Disher. - Yeah, Randy, it's me. I need you to I need you to research a possible murder victim. - Yeah, sure, what's the name? - Okay, he's a Lieutenant Commander. Jason Pierce. Talk to his family, see what they think. Maybe he kept a diary or some sort of log. Yeah, I'll get right on it. Where are you? I'm on a submarine. The USS Seattle. Yeah, seriously. We're underwater. Periscope depth. Water temp, 46 degrees. Speed, 50 knots. Relative bearing two-five-niner. You're on a submarine? How you doin'? Fine, I'm fine. I'd be going crazy if Dr. Bell wasn't here. Dr Dr. Bell's there? How did he get on the submarine? Well, hold on. I'll let him tell you. He's right here. It's Disher. Yeah, I work with him. I know, right? Hey, Monk? Can you believe it? That's a true story. Yeah. Is there anyone else there I can talk to? You can stay here. It's the only place on board with any privacy. And believe me, you're gonna want privacy. These guys haven't seen a girl since we left port. - That was three hours ago. - I know. Clean towel, soap, toothpaste Davenport, of course. You think I'm crazy? I mean, about my friend? I don't know, but you knocked on the right door. Mr. Monk will figure it out. Nat, I'm sorry about getting you stuck like this. You don't look like you're sorry. Well, I'm sorry i'm not more sorry. Do you ever wonder what would've happened if you met me first? - I mean, before Mitch. - I did meet you first. Austin, Texas, new years eve, 1989. - You were there? - You were with your fiancee. Caroline? Caroline Shelton. So what happened to her? She sobered up. Realized she could do better. You never married? A submarine's not a coed vessel. It's Kinda hard to meet a woman on this job. Well, it's coed now, isn't it? Yes, it is. - Permission to come aboard. - You're already on board, mr. Monk. Right, I mean, permission to come into your cabin-room-crib. Permission denied. It's me again. How about now? - Come in, Mr. Monk. - Thank you. That's my father. - He was secretary of the Navy. - He must've been very proud of you. You'd think he would have been, wouldn't you? ""NON SIBI SED PATRIAE."" ""Not self, but country."" I like it. You like it. I live it. I thought I told you to stay in the officers'ward. Yes, sir, I know, but my therapist thought I should focus on the case. Your therapist? It doesn't matter. There is no case, detective. Lt. Commander pierce shot himself. It's in the NCIS report. There were two other witnesses. We heard a gunshot. The door was locked from the inside and I had to break it down. So there's no other explanation, is there? I don't know. Well, what you don't know could fill a Super-Tanker. Did you know that Pierce was a recovering alcoholic and had started drinking again? - Had he? - He confided that in me two weeks ago. And that's why I was worried when he didn't show up for the drill. About that drill. That was the second drill of the day, is that right? Is that normal, two drills in one day? No, it's quite unusual. My job My mandate Is to prepare these children for battle. War is not Tidy Mr. Monk. War does not follow any set schedule and neither do I. Is there anything else? You're with us until thursday, Mr. Monk. I'd like very much not to see you again. It's a rather small boat, but with vigilance and patience I believe we can manage to avoid each other. Yes, sir, i'll do my best. It looks like a match. What do you think? Yep, I think you're right. Definitely. You've done it again. Does anyone else on board drink this brand of soda? Only Commander Whitaker. Nobody else can touch it. It's his private stash. I need to borrow your weapon. And, some surgical tape. It's not loaded. Okay. You'll see. Be patient. A silencer. That would explain the gunpowder and the duct tape. Who would use a silencer to kill himself? Okay, Mr. Monk, what are you saying? Are you. Commander Whitaker? What about the locked door and the gunshot? I don't know how he did it. I don't know why. But he's the guy. Where's your lady friend? She's She's staying in the infirmary. Lt. Albright has got her in his sights. The target has been acquired. ""Target."" - What are you doin'? - I'm separating my food. Is there a name for that? I don't know. Why don't you ask him? He's the expert. - You're not hungry? - No, I'm starving. So, tell me about Commander Whitaker. Were he and Lt. Commander Pierce close? You're on a sub, brother. Everybody's close. Pierce and the CO. Went way back. They were in the gulf together. Who ordered vegetarian? Right here. Somebody wanted vegetarian? Here, you can have mine. I already separated it. What was that? Did you feel that? Oh, my god. Oh, my god, we've been hit! We're goin'down! I mean, we're goin'down more! It's okay, brother. It's just a little sea turbulence. Good thing he wasn't with us in january. - What happened in january? - We hit a mountain. You hit a mountain? You didn't see a mountain? - It was an undersea mountain. - There was a mix-up on the bridge. - They were using some old nav charts. - And you hit a mountain? It's nobody's fault. There was a big inquest. CO. Testified. Everybody was cleared. But you have a new chart now, right? - Yes, sir. - We sure about that? - It has all the mountains? - Yes, sir. Not just most of the mountains, it has all the mountains? Wait, you know what? I'm not sure. I'm kidding, sir. We have Yeah, we're gonna be fine. You shouldn't joke about Mountains. It's not funny. I'll just be a second. I left a book in here. Okay. - You talked to Julie? - I did, thank you. She couldn't believe I was calling from a nuclear submarine. She wants me to bring her home a torpedo. I'll have them gift-wrap one for you. I thought it was here. - What's it called? - The art of war. Best book on male-female relationships I ever read. Maybe it's up here. Sorry. Any luck? Just a second. - That's too bad. - What? I found it. I can't. I'm sorry. Is it 'cause of Mitch? 'cause we were friends? God, I don't know. I just keep picturing him. I'm sorry. Well, I understand. You do? Then explain it to me. This is you. Sheets are clean. Does it fold out? Nope, that's it. Does it fold out? No, that's it. Does it fold out? It's actually more comfortable than it looks. It would almost have to be. What about my friend? Do you have room for him? Right Dr. Bell. - He can have Jonesy's rack. - Where's Jonesy? Jonesy Broke his neck. - In january, when we hit the mountain. - How's he doin'? We lost him. He, He died in Bethesda hospital a week ago, tuesday. - Good night, Mr. Monk. - Does it fold out? - That's it. - Okay. It's - Good night, Mr. Monk. - Good night. - I'm just gonna fold it out. - No, you're gonna wanna get in there. A week ago tuesday? That's the same day Commander Pierce died. Right, doc? Monk, you might be right about Lt. Pierce. Spoke to his family, sisters, parents. They all say he would never kill himself. Devout catholic, for one thing. - We still can't prove it. - Well, maybe you can. They gave me his computer. He made an appointment with a criminal attorney. Planning on meeting next week. - Really, why? - I don't know. I called the guy and he wouldn't talk to me. Attorney-client blah, blah. All right, well, thanks, Randy. We'll let you know what happens. Bye. - What are those? - Just some old nav charts. Empty. Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? I bet he is. I've just talked to nav-tech. They're gonna be throwing decoys at us all week. - We better be ready for anything. - Yes, sir, we'll do you proud. Detective Monk. What part of ""confined to quarters"" don't you understand? I thought you'd like to know how the investigation is going. I'm getting closer. Closer? - To what? - To To the truth. I have the ""who."" I have the ""why."" All I need is ""how."" Come here. You have something to say to me? You did it. You killed lt. Commander Pierce and I know why. It was the accident last january. You hit a mountain. I still can't believe it. How do you hit a mountain? But you knew it was a career-ending mistake. You convinced lt. Commander Pierce to help you cover it up. You switched charts so that you could tell everyone that it wasn't your fault. That you'd been given a chart that was out of date. But one sailor A kid named Jonesy had been badly hurt. And when Jonesy died, lt. Commander Pierce had a change of heart. And he told you he wanted to confess. So I killed him to protect my reputation, to save my career, so I wouldn't disappoint dead daddy? Is that your story? Something like that. What about the gunshot from inside the room? There were three witnesses, can you explain that? Not yet. Lt. Commander Pierce's death was a suicide. I'll tell you how I know. Because I said it was! When I'm on land, i'm a decorated Commander in the United States Navy. When I'm on this ship, I am the lord thy god! I am Jehovah! Do you understand? No one questions me! Now, I've asked around. I know all about your problems. Your fears, your claustrophobia. You are having a breakdown, sir. It happens on submarines all the time to men far better than you. You Are delusional. I have my share of problems. I don't deny it. But when it comes to this case, the last thing I am is delusional. Tell him. Does that sound delusional to you? Watch your step. Just talked to the commander. He's definitely the guy. Practically confessed. Went on and on and on how he's god on this ship and Adrian must be delusional. The answer must be in Lt. Pierce's cabin. We've got to get back in there and look around. Let's move out. What's this? This is it. Sorry, it says ""come alone."" - Hello? - Steve? Steve? Hello? Something's wrong. Let's shake some things up today. Chief of boat, make your depth one-five-zero feet. Slow to all ahead two-thirds. Aye, aye, skipper. Depth one-five-zero feet. Standby. We're diving! Natalie, we have other things to worry about! Well, Mr. Monk, we must be in the ballast tank. My god, it's the ocean! Natalie, it's the ocean! It's the pacific ocean! Wait. Dr. Bell, he's right outside. Dr. Bell, open the hatch! - Dr. Bell! - Dr. Bell! - What my saving, Help, somebody, help! - Dr. Bell! Dr. Bell, open the hatch! Help, somebody, help! - Open the hatch! - Help! Dr. Bell! Somebody help! We're in here! Ocean in my shoes. Ocean Ocean in my shoes, dr. Bell! Mr. Monk! It won't do us any good if we both panic. You're right, you're right. We'll take turns. I'll go first. - God! Natalie! - What? Ocean in my pants. Ocean in my pants. Make your depth three-zero-zero feet. Three-zero-zero feet, aye. Natalie I don't know how to swim! I took some lessons once, but Not actually in water. Mr. Monk, I don't think swimming's gonna be a problem. I'm not even sure I know how to drown. Have you seen Mr. Monk and ms. Teeger? Yes, sir, about 20 minutes ago I saw 'em on level B near the stern. Level B? Helm steer zero-nine-five. We're at 400 feet. Leveling off. Who ordered you to level off? Keep diving. Wait. - My belt. My good luck belt. - Yeah. How's that workin'out for you? Can you help me? Get the beads out. Get the beads out. It's hollow. We can make it like a snorkel. It'll buy us some time. Okay. - It works, try it! - I'm fine. - Why, because of germs? Not now! - I'm fine.- I'm fine. Stand back! Gotta surface Surface now! There's two people in the ballast tank. That's ridiculous. Why would they be in there? You tell me. - Surface. - We're surfacing. Surfacing. Stand by for emergency ascent. Detective Monk, ms. Teeger. - I'm glad to see you both in one piece. - Are you? It's all over, Commander. We solved the case. I'm gonna let dr. Bell explain - You do it. - He's sleepy. - It's better if you do it. Good at it. - Okay, fine, I'll do it. I'll do it. We have all the pieces. The ""who,"" the ""why,"" and the ""how."" - Is that right? - This is the how. It's a firecracker. And these ashes are from a cigarette. Found them in the vent behind the door. It happened right here in this room a few minutes before the second drill. You forced Jason Pierce to drink some vodka Then you shot him. You executed your friend in cold blood With a homemade silencer. Nobody heard a thing. You used a cigarette as a fuse, which gave you about five minutes to get back to the bridge. You hid it inside that vent, you figured it was the one place they wouldn't look. It was a perfect alibi. You were in the hallway with witnesses When they heard, what they thought was a gunshot. All you had to do was slip the key into his pocket when no one was looking. We found a thumbprint on the inside of that vent. I could fax it to NCIS. I asked, it would take about a half an hour. That won't be necessary, Lieutenant. In that case, sir, I'm relieving you of your command and confing you to quarters. Congratulations, detective Monk. I hope the rest of the Navy does its job as well as you do yours. Shall we? I'm sorry, after you. They're debriefing me tomorrow. Then I ship out again. - For how long? - December. Well Home for christmas, come on by. I'll make you some cocoa. - With those little marshmallows? - Marshmallows? That's a big step, Lieutenant. You sure we're ready for that? Well, we'll find out. Adrian, i'm so proud of you. I'm I'm just bursting. I mean, you came through like a champ. And under the worst possible circumstances. I couldn't have done it without you. I'll see you around, doc. - You really were on a submarine. - Yeah. - How was that? - It was Was Kinda horrifying. I was scared to death every minute. - Same old, same old? - Pretty much. I'm gonna go check out the sub. Adrian. - How did you do that? - Lieutenant told me what happened. A submarine. I can hardly wait to hear the whole story. I thought we might drive back together. But you were there. Yes Yes, it's true. I was there. But you could remind me of some of the details. But it just happened. Now it's like a blur to you? - Just a little hazy, but - Wow, it's funny how the mind works. - Yes it is. Let's get to the car. - You found a parking spot?"
"Taxi, taxi! Come on. It's freezing. Yeah, it is cold out here. That's all right. We'll get one. I'm good at getting cabs. I'm kinda like the cab whisperer. - That's a nice blazer. - Thank you very much. It's a gift from. Well, from me. I wish I'd taken the lining out of it, though. - Sometimes it gets really hot. - Really? - You're shivering. - You noticed. Well, I notice everything. - Thank you. - That's my job. - I'm a good cop. - There's a taxi! There's one. Right, right. Hey! Taxi, taxi! Thank you. Taxi! Hey, back up. We got it, we got it. Thanks for waiting, man. You're my hero. Do you want your coat back? No, why don't you keep it. I'll get it in the morning. - You're pretty sure of yourself? - Well, I am a cop. I read the situation. It's all in the details. Noticing all those little things that other people miss. For example, you usually wear glasses. I saw you squinting at the menu. - You're pretty good. - Yeah Well, I've been doing it for years. It's second nature by now. We're not moving. Randy, oh my god! -= Monk =- ""Mr. Monk Falls In Love."" Sub VO By : ¤ Aka & YaYa ¤ [Sub-Way.fr.] Let's meet our victim. He was a cab driver named Drazen Mirko. Hey, Randy, does he look familiar? - I was in the backseat. - Mckiernan, what do you got? Not much. He got his hack license About six years ago. Kept to himself, no known family. And we're still trying to track down his immigration papers. The coroner puts the time of death around 9:20. Multiple puncture wounds from an antique hat pin. A hat pin? - Can I see that? - So, we're looking for a woman that's a start. Your ""L"" is a little crooked, there. - No, it's not. - Yes, it is. It really is. It's hanging down on the bottom there. Yeah, it's still a little off. Now it's This is a homicide task force. You want me to run downstairs and get a t-square so all the letters are even? It doesn't have to be you necessarily. You could send Could we move on? So what is this, a family crest? Yeah. Something like that. We're still working on it. Are there any witnesses? Randy was there, so No, there weren't any witnesses. I wasn't in cop mode. I was in date mode. We found this in the cab. It's got a design on it. Could be an invitation or something. And we found this under the backseat. There's blood splatter on it. We think the killer was wearing it. A charm bracelet. Trudy had one of these. Usually, these aren't just decorative. Each one of these little charms could mean something. ""LZ"" Probably her initials. LZ. That's good. There can't be a lot of Zs out there. Ballet slippers. Maybe she's a dancer or used to be. - Yeah, that's good. - There's a man with a beard. Looks like santa claus. Maybe she likes Christmas! I'm not going to write down that she likes Christmas. He is carrying something, could be ST. Christopher. He's the patron Saint of travelers. Okay. Likes to travel. What is that? A lion? Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo Zookeeper! A traveling, dancing zookeeper. This is not a game show, Randy. Well, it could be an astrological sign. So she's a Leo. - A Leo. - What is that? Looks like a Ruby! Rubies, so that's Jewelry. She makes Jewelry. She's a dancing Zookeeper's daughter who makes Jewelry! I'm making an announcement. If our suspect turns out to be a dancing Zookeeper's daughter who makes Jewelry, i'm gonna retire. Well, it could be a birthstone, right? What is Ruby? My mom wears one. A Ruby is July. If she's a leo that was born in July, that narrows it down to nine days between July 23rd and the 31st. Al right, here's what we know. We're looking for a woman whose initials are lZ, maybe she's a dancer. She likes to travel or works with people who travel, and she was born between July 23rd and July 31st. I can't think of anyone. I thought maybe we'd use the computer for this one, Randy. That's a good idea. Sanchez and McKiernan are checking out the woman in Sausalito. The other one works here. Her name is Leyla Zlatavich. You got that DMV photo? These poor people! - They're all refugees From Zemenia. - Are they still fighting over there? They haven't stopped fighting for 600 years. These are the lucky ones, these people got out. Captain, over there. We found you a house. No, no. No room, a house with a backyard and a garden. Your own garden! No, no, no. Everything is paid for. All we have to do now is fill out some residency papers. So you come with me? Please. Please, come. She's beautiful. Like mother Theresa. Only hotter. ""Only hotter""? You're gonna get hit by lightning. She didn't do it. How do you know that? We haven't even talked to her yet. This is Disher. Captain, it's Sanchez. Flag was falling. Falling. That's good! Your english is really good. Keep practicing. You're frightened. I can tell. But you're safe here. Everything will be all right. Do you understand? We'll get you some clothes so you can fit in. No one is going to laugh at you anymore. Would you like that? Would you like some water? I'll be right back. Okay? What did she say? She's not the guy. You keep saying that. But how do you know? Check this out. It's from the collection box. A Zemenian ten dollar bill. That's the piece of paper we found in the cab. Nobody bats a thousand, - That's a perfect match. - What? Perfect? You don't know that it's perfect. Don't you think I'd be the one to know if it's perfect? Well, it's not. Probably. Okay. We'll go to the lab and make sure it's perfect. Are you okay? - You look a little flushed to me. What? You're You're blushing! No, what are What are you talking about? Oh, my god! You like her! What? Stop it! That's crazy talk! - You're staring right at her. - No! I'm looking at Over there. All right, yes. I'm looking at her. Okay, because she fits the profile. But she didn't do it. I'll go wait in the car. And she didn't do it! And that scrap of paper doesn't mean a thing. - You like her. - I don't like her. And don't say that again! I don't like anybody. I'm gonna wait in the car. As you can see, all roads lead to our suspect, Leyla Zlatavich. Monk, you can shake your head all you want to, but you're not going to shake all of this away. All the charms on the bracelet match. Her initials, her birthday She works with travelers, she used to dance. And if that's not enough, and it is, we found this - Zemenian currency at the scene. - It's not enough. - I don't believe this. - Monk, it's more than enough! Look, last year we got that conviction on that guy by virtuz of the air he blew into a beach ball. If we're gonna pick her up, we need to move on her now. - I mean, she could be a flight risk. - Yeah. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Wait. Let me think. Where's the motive? You need a motive. She had the oldest motive in the world. She wanted cash. - But the Cabbie still had his wallet! - She was interrupted By lt. Disher. She didn't realize he was still in date mode. She ran away. What about the other suspect? You said there we two women who fit the profile. We checked. The other woman's been dead for seven years. Come on! Wait, wait. Wait, whoa. Interesting, right? It's fascinating, really. Let's look at this. A woman who's been dead for seven years Hails a taxi, kills the driver, and then She's the guy. - Leyla's the guy. - But she's not the guy. Okay. Let's put it to a vote. All those who think we should bring ms. Zlatavich in? Those opposed? - You cannot vote, Monk! - Why not? Because you obviously have a crush on this woman. What? What? That's insane! How could I like her? I'm a married man. I have not taken this off. In 18 years. I love my wife. Everybody know that! You can all go to You know where. Hell. No, will, it's no problem at all. All right. We'll see you soon. Mr. Monk, don't freak out. - That was Leyla. - Really? She wants to talk to you about the case. She sounded upset. She sounded scared, actually. I don't know. I think she might be innocent. Of course she's innocent. That's what I've been saying. Well, she's just up the street. She's gonna be here in two minutes. Two minutes. She's coming here. In two minutes, she's coming here. Yeah, you just said that. - You're excited. I can tell. - Who's excited? I'm not excited. You're the one who's excited. You obviously can't stop thinking about her. I think you might be obsessed with this woman, the way you keep talking about her. - I'm not talking about her. - You're listening about her. You can't deny that. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. It's no big deal. She's Just another client. Mr. Monk. I'm very sorry to bother you at home. Bother? It's no bother. It only bothers me that it bothers you because you think it bothers me, which it doesn't. You know, - bother me. - Would you like to sit down? - Yes, thank you. - Not you! I feel so foolish. I didn't recognize you when we spoke yesterday at the refugee center. You are the famous detective. Today, some policemen came. They brought me to the police station. They asked me a lot of questions. They think I'm a suspect. They think I killed a taxi driver. How could they think that? I don't understand. They only think that because of all the evidence against you. Some policemen have this thing about evidence. But I didn't kill anyone. I couldn't. I know you couldn't. We We believe you. Tell me what to do. I'd like to hire you, but I don't have much money. Don't worry about money. We don't need money. So you'll help me? Of course, I will help you. You're an angel. Thank you so much. Maybe we can talk about the case tonight? Over dinner? Tonight? Yeah, okay. - You have my address. - Tonight? Okay. Thanks again. I feel much better. Yeah. You didn't wipe it off. - Course I did. - You like her! - Natalie, she's a client. - Mr. Monk, it's okay to like somebody. - Trudy would want you to be happy. - I don't like anybody. Yeah, you keep saying that, but then you act all flustered. - Not flustered. Where's my silverware? - You threw it out. Why would I do that? Okay, fine. Maybe I am a little flustered. You know, I am just not used to being around attractive women. What? - What? - Nothing. Come on. Natalie! You're not A girl. You're Natalie! Natalie. Nat. You're nat. Like natalie, right? Natalie. I made a reservation for 8:00. - It's just up the street. - Sounds good. Sorry. I can't help it. Don't apologize. We all have our little quirks. If we didn't, we would have been exactly the same. And how would that be? Heaven on earth. I have a little quirk. I can't go to sleep without the radio on. That is weird. You're like a freak of nature. You need help, lady. Every time I see the wall, I wanna cry. I know, it's a mess. - No, I mean it's so beautiful. - Exactly. I come here almost every day. A hundred different opinions, different voices. This wall is America. You don't appreciate what you have here. I hope I never take it for granted. This ain't a hotel. Go on, get outta here. What are you doing? You can't treat people like that. - Lady, this is none of your business. - This man is a human being. Barely. I know your kind. I've seen it my whole life. You're a Hooligan. You're a bully! He could've had a heart attack. Lady, get outta my face before I call a cop. Hey, I'll save you the time. I am the cops. Where's your badge? I'm a former cop. You wanna know why they kicked me out? You don't wanna know why they kicked me out. - Why did they kick you out? - Nervous breakdown. Look at that! He's touching it with his hands! Did you see that? Okay, here we go. Did you like this? It was wonderful. It was just It was just wonderful. Thank you for bringing me here. So, where do you wanna eat? No, no, no. We're eating here. This is our food. Hey, I don't think so. Pezni. ""Pezni"" means delicious. - Pezni - What do you think he was doing? I don't know. I thought it was way off-Broadway Cabaret-type thing. It's an old Zemenian tradition. They prepare the food in front of you to whet your appetite. Yeah, but he was juggling the food, I mean, and then it went in his hat. Then it came out of his hat. I mean, I've never seen a recipe that included the word ""hat"". Really. Thank you. You know what? I just rembered. I had Zemenian for lunch. Detective Monk, I don't believe you. Why don't you eat, and I'll just watch? Are you sure? I've never been more sure of anything in my life. Okay. Pizne. I never imagined that such a thing was possible In America. To be sent to prison for something I didn't do. You are not going to prison. All we have to do is figure out what happened. Here. They found this bracelet in the taxicab. All the charms seem to point to you. It has your initials, see. - Yes, the police showed this to me. - Yeah. But it isn't mine. I told them I've never seen it before. Okay. What about your alibi? Where were you monday night? Monday night was my birthday. I went home alone. I turned my telephone off. Lit a candle, made a wish, went to bed early. Pretty exciting life? Is Is that it? That's your alibi. That might be the worst alibi I've ever heard Ever, in my life. Which is good. Because if you were guilty, you would have come up with something better. Right? Did you speak to anyone? Your roommate, or, or your boyfriend, or I live alone. - I don't have a boyfriend. - No? Not everyone The way you talk about Trudy, I can tell you have something very special. Yes, we do. We're very lucky. Very lucky. But back to the case. Could someone be framing you? Framing? I mean, do you have any enemies? Maybe someone back in the old country. No. All I'm trying to do is help my people find shelter, maybe job. This was my favorite song. What is it about? The words mean, ""Foolish child, don't you know, ""the broken heart will never mend. ""A true love story has no end."" That's beautiful. Last time I heard that song, it was on my 23rd birthday. We had a garden party. My father sang it for me. Aw, that's a nice memory. Two weeks later, he was dead, along with my two brothers and my fiance. I didn't know that when I said ""nice memory."" All murdered. He slaughtered half of the village. Who Who did? Who? What! He was an animal. They call him ""Zemenski Morderca."" The ""Butcher of Zemenia."" He's disappeared. The whole world is looking for him. His name is Korston Emerich. Who dares to speak the butcher's name? That name is never to be spoken in my restaurant! When I hear that name I want to spit. Okay. Oh, my god. Call 911. Call Call 911! What are you waiting for? It's an easy number. Okay. Please stay calm. It's gonna be okay. It's just a little spittle. It's a little disgusting Spittle. We're gonna need a 55-gallon drum of boiling water and some Are you all right? What is it? Is that him? The man you called ""The Butcher""? But that's the cab driver. He must've been hiding out here In San Francisco. What does it mean? It means you have a motive If you did it. Which of course you didn't. Let's get started. We have to move on this before the press gets wind of it. Thanks to Monk, we now have the real motive for the attack: revenge, pure and simple. Turns out that our cabbie was a war criminal named Korston Emerich. killed Zlatavich's fiance and most of her family. Can't blame her, really. Well, given the evidence that we have, we should move forward. - There's not enough. - It's enough, Monk. No. She didn't do it. Look at the board. There's a mountain of evidence here. This is MT. Kilimanjaro. - It's time to arrest her. - Wait. Wait! Wait. Let's just Lemme think. Lemme think. According to the driver's log, Emerich picked up his last passenger - at the airport. Right? - So? So, what was she doing at the airport? And How How did she even get to the airport? I don't know. She's your girlfriend, why don't you ask her? Afraid to ask her because she might tell him the truth. She's playing you, man! Can't you see it? But why would she kill him there? Look, the Cabbie was killed on Algonquin avenue, right? - Yep. - Leyla, I mean, Leyla. I mean, Ley Ms. Zladavich Ms. Zladavich Ms. Zladavich lives three miles from there. It doesn't make any sense! It makes perfect sense, Monk. She was at the airport. Who knows why? She hails a cab. She drives into town. It's a red light. She stops. Yeah. He turns around, she recognizes him. ""Oh, my god, it's the butcher of blah blah."" Out comes the hat pin. She does him in the neck, Monk. - I'm buyin'it. - A red light? - You have a problem with that? - Red light, shmed light. What? That That's your argument? ""Red light, shmed light""? It's come down to that? Okay, Monk. It's over. She has no alibi. Alibi, shmalibi. Okay, we're not getting anywhere. I say it's time to go to the shmudge and get a shmarrant. There you are. I didn't see you leaving. Where are you going? - She didn't do it. - I know it's confusing. I like her too. Let's go home. I'll make you some dinner. - I can't go home I have to talk to her. - No, you can't. - I have to. - No, you can't see her any more. Leyla's an official suspect. She's about to be indicted. After you left, detectives Sanchez and Mckiernan were talking. They think you're obstructing the case. Obstructing the case? They're calling the DA. They're filing an official complaint. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. Misha, it's okay. There are no soldiers. It's safe here. Your sponsor will meet you there. They will take good care of you. - Here's all the information. - Thank you. Know how we can thank you! Enjoy your new home. Enjoy your new life. That's how to thank me. Invite me to his wedding. Bus is coming. Adrian! What are you doing here? I just came to tell you that, I can't see you anymore. It's a legal thing, conflict of interests, and so - So - I understand. You could've just called. Why didn't you call? I don't know. I could've just called. Why didn't I just call? It's no big deal. It's no big deal. Your pants will be dry in 20 minutes. I really appreciate this. People in need That's my job. Geraniums, right? Yeah, fresh geraniums every day. Something I learned from my mother. It brightens your darkest night. She was right as usual. - Where is she now? - Back home. She refuses to leave. That's where I get my stubbornness from. - It doesn't fit? - No, it's fine. It's fine. There. Nice and even. Okay. It was my fiance's. He's gone for 15 years. I don't know why I keep it. I do. So, when did you move in? About a month ago. I lov this building. Detective monk, you need to call your wife. She's probably worried. She knows where I am. How? Because She's with me all the time. That explains a lot. That explains everything. - How did she - She was killed. Car bomb. Car bombs. I know them well. I am sorry. Adrian, I have to ask you Everyone is against me All the evidence, all the policemen. Why do you believe me? Becaus you didn't do it. Thank you for that. Tchaikovsky. This is the music that made me want to dance. Tchaikovsky. So whatever happened? I grew out of it. Plus, they burned down the conservatory in my village. I took that as an omen. I used to be able to do this and this. When did I get so old and stiff? I need a partner. Well, it's a little late, but we could call someone. He'd have to live nearby, I guess. Give me your hand. Excuse me. Excuse me. Is something wrong? Do you have anything stronger than steel wool? It's my wedding ring. There's something on it. Adrian, i'm lonely too. - Please stop - Stop what?

No. Excuse me, but Captain. Is this what you were looking for? Randy, let me see that hat pin. That's a perfect match. Ms. Zlatavich What is this design? This is our family crest. Would you like to tell us how your family Crest got on the murder Weapon? That's the murder Weapon? Hold on. She can explain this. Leyla Yes. Yes, yes. I can explain. Go ahead. I did it! Wh What? I killed the taxi man, just like they said. No, you didn't. No, she didn't. I did. Okay. That's your opinion. Everyone's entitled to their opinion! I killed him. I killed the butcher of Zemenia. Turn around. I'm sorry. You were in the taxi. What happened then? Like you said. He was driving, there was a red light. I turned around, - and I recognized him from the village. - You recognized him. It was Emerich. The butcher. - I was sure of it. - And then what? Like you said, I took out my hat pin. I went crazy, and I stabbed him. How many times? Two, three. I don't remember, it was just all like a What's the word? ""Big blur."" She didn't do it. Mr. Monk, she's confessing. Why would anyone confess if they didn't do it? No hard feelings, professor? I guess we learned a lesson here? Sometimes - things are exactly what they seem. - We'll see. We'll see? You can't be serious. Come on, it's over, man. Here's your girlfriend's confession. - Read it and weep. - Hey, you wanna save us a trip? We got her personal effects. How'bout dropping these off downstairs? - Thanks. - You'll get 'em next time. Read it and weep. - What was I thinking? - You weren't thinking, Mr. Monk. You were feeling. And that's a good thing. The past 14 years, I've been sleepwalking. I wanted to wake up. But I was always afraid to wake up. Until you walked into that refugee center. Don't worry. It won't happen again. I learned my lesson. What is it? - It's a letter. - Who's it from? Her mother. How do you know she's here? This is the largest Zemenian community in the country. She was frightened, she was on foot. Where else would she go? Escuse me, sir. - Hello. - Hello.

Wait. - Policia? - No, no. - No, we just want to talk. - No, no police. I'm a former police officer. I was given a psychological discharge.

"In Focus, an unfiltered look at the news, the people behind the news, and the stories behind the headlines. Reporting from San Francisco, James Novak. Good evening, and welcome to in Focus. He is a mass of contradictions. A man afflicted with a disorder so paralyzing that ten years ago he was forced to resign from the San Francisco police department. Since then, as a private consultant, he has solved an astonishing 99 cases. Cases that were considered unsolvable. Tonight on in Focus, we follow Adrian Monk, this modern-day Sherlock Holmes, as he attempts a career milestone. Solving his 100th case for the San Francisco PD. And what a case it is. Perhaps the most challenging of his career. A vicious serial killer is on the loose. Young women are being slaughtered. The town is terrorized. Can Adrian Monk find him and stop him before he kills again? Find out tonight on in Focus. -= Monk 707 =- ""Mr. Monk's 100th Case."" SUB VO BY: ¤ ¤ A ¤ Ak ¤ Aka ¤ AkaZ ¤ AkaZa ¤ AkaZab ¤ AkaZab ¤ [Sub-way.fr.] Find out tonight on: in Focus. Okay, take the shot. Take the shot. Take the shot! Take the foul! Foul! Did you see that? He fouled him. Hey, Captain, have you seen Mr. Monk? I figured he was with you. He usually is. - Did you change the channel? - It's a commercial break. - I'll change it right back. - No, no, no. No, no, it's a Playoff game. It's a five-point game. Where were you? The natives are getting restless. And drinking all the wine. I thought you were getting the Chateau Angelus. We do have Prince Charles coming next week. So I thought I'd save the good stuff for him. Come on, it's a bunch of cops. They're not gonna notice the difference, believe me. Jim. It's a great party. Thanks again. The wine's amazing too. It's the least I could do. After all, you guys let us tag along with you all week long. I hope we didn'T - cramp your style. - No, not at all. It was fun. Jim this is my girlfriend Jillian. - I love your house. - Thank you. You look familiar. Are you an actress? No, she's in the show, in this episode. The reenactment scene near the end, i'm victim number four. Right, of course. What else have you done? Mostly crime shows. Junk like this. No, I don't. Not junk, I mean. Jillian's the queen of reenactments. She's always getting killed or taken hostage. She was bludgeoned to death on dateline two weeks ago. Really? - I'm sorry I Missed that. - She can do anything, yeah. She can be stabbed, or shot, or strangled. Baby, do a stab. Do a stab. You gotta see this. - No, Mr. Novak doesn't want to see. - Well, I've got to see it now. I'm curious. What are you doing? How did you get in here?! Very nice. Very convincing. Good luck to you. Here you are. What are you doing back here? You can't even see the Tv. Which makes it the best seat in the house. You can't sit back here. You're the guest of honor. Come on, at least move up a little. - You said ""a little."" - A little more. Come on. In Focus returns. James Novak reporting. Hey, hey, everybody, it's on. July 18th. For Adrian Monk, the day began like any other. He would vacuum his entire apartment. Then clean the vacuum. Then vacuum again. He have no way of knowing that just 4 blocks away. The body of a young girl was being discovered and that the San Francisco police would soon be requesting his services for the 100th time. Well, that's a real milestone. The fact is he almost didn't make it. Two years ago, they tried to cut Monk from the budget to save a few bucks. I went ballistic. If you go in the commissioner's office, you'll see there's a little dent in the wall about the size of my fist. I got suspended, and Monk got back on the payroll. Case number 100 would be the ultimate test of Adrian Monk's deductive powers. It began with a call to 911. Her name was Cassandre Rank. 27 years old. She worked as a waitress and occasionally an actress. She had been brutally strangled. Apparently, she comes in, checks her mail. Creep's outside. He breaks the glass. He opens the door. He comes in. Strangles her with this. When you're done with that, may I see it, please? How did that start, with your hands? You mean this? Well, I don't remember. Most of the time, I don't even know I'm doing it. It has a zen - quality to it. - It seems to help e focus on the problem. I have to block out the rest of the world. I have to block out any distractions, anything that might upset me. So - you're blocking me out right now? - That's right. I don't know how he does it. Sometimes when Monk's not around, I'll catch the other cops doing it, right, with the hands. Then like, touch that. It doesn't work. Doesn't work for anybody else but him. With Adrian Monk on the scene, the investigation was officially underway. There's one lightbulb up there that's burnt out. Mr. Monk, just let it go. Just focus on something. Escuse me, Officer, can somebody please fix that lightbulb? Sometimes he sees too much. He gets distracted. And that's where you come in? Right, keeping him focused. That's one of my jobs. What else do you do for him? What else do I do? How long is your show? That's a 40 watt. The others are 60. It's 40. Okay? Yeah, whatever. He has some idiosyncrasies. Like what? Fear of heights. Fear of germs. Spiders. Milk. - Crowds, elevators, fire. - Rabbits, tunnels, bridges. - Boats. - Decaffeinated coffee. - Lightning. - The wind. He's afraid of the wind. - Egg whites. - Bad. Naked people. That one is way up there. I think it goes ""naked people"" and then ""death."" Who is detective Adrian Monk? He was born in this modest bay area home 49 years ago, the younger of two brothers. By all accounts, he was an exceptional child. I used to babysit for the boys almost every weekend. What was he like? Adrian? Remarkable child. I tell people this, but they don't believe me. He used to change his own diaper. And then he would crawl across the floor and throw it out. Remarkable. Adrian was in my fourth grade class. He was a brilliant boy. At first, he was probably the most promising student I ever had. - What happened? - Well, his father left. Just took off. After that, everything changed. When Adrian was eight, his father Jack, a frustrated Linen Salesman, told the boys he was heading out to pick up some Chinese food. Adrian would not see or speak to him again for 39 years. Mom didn't leave her room for two years, and I didn't leave my room. So it was all up to Adrian. He kept it all together. The house, the family. I don't know how he did it. He's my hero. You know, ""Fan"" can mean one thing to you, and then, you know, something completely different to, like, say, judge Harriet Waxman of the third district court, you know? And I'll tell you something about judge Waxman. She's never been in love. So she's shooting from that perspective, you know what I mean? - Where did you get all these pictures? - Do you like them? Yeah, yeah, they're. Well, this one is probably my favorite, if I had to pick a favorite. This is actually real. It's not Photoshopped at all. And it's from a case we worked on together, a homicide. It took a lot of clue hugs, but we cracked it. - How'bout that one? - This one? Okay. Yhis one is another case, but this one wasn't - This one wasn't as real. - His Brain's different. I mean, I'm not saying that he's a freak or anything. But it. No, I justyou know, his Brain's different. - Let's just leave it at that. - He hasn't solved For the record, he's still at 99. So let's not get ahead of ourselves. You sound a little competive. Sometimes I am a little too competitive. Yes, I own that. I was just talking about that with my new therapist. Monk and I both have new therapists. Mine's way better. I had Adrian Monk as a passenger from San Francisco to newark. He'd never flown before. I don't think he'd ever been out of his house before. He asked a million questions. He cried for 21/2 hours. He gave half the cabin a nervous breakdown, including me, the co-pilot, and about a dozen passengers. We have a support group now. We meet every month. Really? The last one was in Minneapolis. - I couldn't make it. - Why not? I'm afraid to fly. Back at the scene, detective Monk makes a startling discovery. - Her Lipstick. - Yeah, what about it? It's on the cup. There's some on her lips. But it's not here, and it's not in her purse. What happened to the lipstick? He took her lipstick? I didn't tell the press about the missing Lipstick. I always hold back on a couple of key details so down the road if we do get a confession, we know if it's genuine. He does it a lot. You do it a lot, but you don't always do it, though. Yes, I do. I always do it. I just don't always tell him. This was no random attack. He knew her. She knew him. Look, she comes home. She's checking her mail. - Right. - She sees him through the door. She recognizes him. - She's not afraid. - She sets the cup down and lets him in. He grabs her. Kills her. Then he punches through the door to make it look like he had to break in. The shards of glass from the door, they're on top of her body. They're all around her body. But There's nothing underneath it. Pretty good? Adrian Monk had no way of knowing that Cassandre Rank's murder was just the beginning, and that before the week was out, the killer would be striking again. When in Focus continues. Rebound! Rebound! Get the damn ball! What? Just for a second. Just to check the score. We'll turn it back. What are you, my mother? What did you say? Nothing. Hey, excuse me, Jim. Sorry to bother you. It's no big deal. But when they showed my name on the screen earlier on, it said ""Sergeant."" Actually, I'm a full Lieutenant. I'm sorry. - Well, these things happen. - Yeah, it's no big deal. Do you think we could correct it for the DVD? The DVD? Absolutely. I'll take care of that. - That's great. I appreciate that. - Enjoy the party, Sergeant. Pretty exciting? - What happened? Did somebody hug you? - No, no. There's something wrong. I feel like I missed something. - Something about that case. - What case? What, the Tv Show? Mr. Monk, you already solved that case. It's all over. There's something wrong. - It's starting again, everybody! - In Focus returns. - Here we go. - James Novak reporting. Detective Adrian Monk. Obsessive, peculiar, brilliant. Now in pursuit of his 100th case. A young woman has been brutally strangled. The San Francisco police had no leads and no suspects. Even Adrian Monk, the legendary detective, was at a loss. Then two days later, the case took a disturbing twist. Disher. Captain, we got another girl. A pattern was emerging. The second victim, Barbara Mcfarland, was also a part-time actress and had been found brutally strangled. No, no. Same MO. Strangled from the front. - What about the door? - No forced entry. He either talked his way in or she knew him. Well, another actress. Some local theater and some commercials. - What about her lipstick? - Lipstick? - Looks like he took it. - Lipstick killer. Lipstick assassin. Mr. Lipstick. I've always wanted to name one of these guys. Why? If you can name them, you can catch them. Why? Natalie, do you have that picture, photos? What do you got? Don't step on the girl. Water spots. Monk. You can't do the victim's Dishes. What, you didn't see it. It was filthy. - For god's sake. - Just one cycle. - One cycle. - No. I'll push rinse hold. You'll push nothing. No was. There's been a breakthrough in the case. It's pretty exciting. Don't look back. Why are you looking back? So it turns out, both victims worked at the same restaurant. It's one of those theme restaurants. It's called the morbid cafe. And the captain wants Mr. Monk to go talk to the manager. Can you just pull over? Will you, please? I'm feeling nauseous. Those bus fumes have made me nauseous. All right, did I mention he doesn't like driving? Oh, my god. People actually eat here? Yeah, Julie comes here all the time. She loves it. See all these props? They're from old horror movies. - We should call the board of health. - Welcome. I have been expecting you. You are from the police department, is that correct? That's, that's right. Okay, I'm Adrian Monk. - And this is Natalie Teeger. - Natalie? What a Delicious name. - Why are you talking like that? - I don't know what you mean. But I see we go to the same Tailor. Mr. Gleckson, we'd like to talk to you about a woman named Cassandre Rank. - I believe she used to work here. - Yes, Cassandre Rank. A most delectable young girl. I remember drinking her blood. It was a most exquisite aperitif. She was killed two days ago. Someone strangled her. What? Are you serious? My god, you must have thought that Look, you know that this is just a job, right? I mean, this is not real blood. It's all makeup. Hell, that stuff about drinking her blood. - Crap. - When did she work here? About a year ago. But she was only here for about a month, and then she got a part in a play or something and she split. Nobody stays here that long. There was another woman named Barbara Mcfarland. She worked here too, didn't she? Yes! Barbara Mcfarland. She had a very delectable neck. I'm sure of that. - In fact, I am o-positive. - She was killed too. Come on! Why didn't you just say that? Now I look like a monster, like a real monster, and I'm not. Hell. Yeah, no, i. I knew her a little bit. She was here for three months. But did they know each other, Barbara and Cassandre? I don't think so. I don't think they ever met. No, Cassandre left, like, a year before Barbara showed up. Okay, we're gonna need a list of all of your employees, everyone who worked here when they did. Yeah, sure, that's no problem. And as night falls on San Francisco, Adrian Monk is left alone with the case. Mr. Monk takes all of his cases very seriously. But when a woman is killed, it's different. - It hits him pretty hard. - Because of Trudy? Yeah, because of Trudy. Trudy Monk, the love of Adrian Monk's life and the only case he hasn't been able to solve. They met 28 years ago while they were both attending the University of California. They were married a short time later. Trudy's love was so strong that most of his phobias and personal demons were kept at bay. It would be the happiest time of his life. You wouldn't recognize him. Back in the day, he loved his work. He loved his life. He used to walk in here whistling. He hasn't whistled for a long time. Then, in a flash, she was gone. Two weeks before Christmas, 1997, Trudy Monk was downtown running some errands. She returned to her car in a parking garage on Summerset avenue. Our top story tonight, the wife of a highly decorated San Francisco detective was killed this morning, the victim of an apparent car bombing. Trudy Monk, a 35-year-old freelance journalist died a short time later at Saint Jude's hospital. Her husband, Adrian Monk, was by her side. The police are pursuing several leads but have made no arrests. The case is still open. It has been Adrian Monk's obsession for 11 years. After the hospital, he came back, back home. He just sat in that chair all night. I could see his soul leaving his body. Adrian died too. The bomb was across town, but it killed my brother too. I saw him coming apart like those rockets that hit the atmosphere at the wrong angle. Nothing I could do. Can we talk about Trudy? You didn't leave your house for, what, three years? The psychiatrists said you'd never work again. But here you are 100 cases later. What keeps you going? I can't die until I know. But solving Trudy's murder would have to wait. Three nights later, in a parking lot in Daly City, another girl was strangled. - Bring over that sheet. - Her name was Miranda Terhune. Like the others, she had worked as an actress and was strangled with a small piece of cord. Her Lipstick was missing, so we were pretty sure it was the same guy. - The Lipstick assassin. - Nobody's calling him that, Randy. - I am. - No, you're not. Now, the third girl never worked at the restaurant. So the three girls had virtually nothing in common. - The case was moving sideways on us. - We didn't have any leads. I mean, who or where was Mr. Lipstick? - Could you turn that off for a minute? - The death toll was rising. A sense of urgency swept through the department. Captain Stottlemeyer and his task force were working around the clock. Coffee. Thank you. He has an idea. I can tell. You don't want to Miss this. Zoom in. Go ahead. I love this part. I noticed that all three pictures were taken by the same photographer. There were ten other detectives in that room. You were the only one who noticed it. Well, I was standing closer to the board. He's just being modest. 50 cops could have been locked in that room for a whole year, and nobody would have noticed it. Maybe not a year. Thanks to Adrian Monk, the police finally had a suspect, a local photographer named Douglas Thurman. Was he responsible for three brutal murders? And could he be stopped before he killed again? Find out after these messages. Down by nine. How did that happen? But who played the girl who died in the car? Miranda Terhune. I thought she was terrible. The way she was all sprawled out, nobody dies like that. Actually, she was the real victim. She was really dead. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I said that. Everybody makes mistakes. I even made one myself once. - What was it? - My wife. What's wrong with him? He thinks he might have made a mistake. - What, about coming here? - No, about the case. The one on Tv. He thinks he might have missed something. Really? Well, this could get interesting. - Hey, it's on, everybody. - In Focus. Three women have been brutally strangled. Thanks to Adrian Monk, San Francisco's legendary defective detective, the police now have a suspect. His name is Douglas Thurman, manager of a Local photography studio. Captain Leland Stottlemeyer and lieutenant Randy Disher question their suspect. Thurman denied everything. He wouldn't crack. With no hard evidence, the police were forced to release him. Douglas Thurman was a tough adversary. But Adrian Monk has faced tough adversaries before. In fact, he's faced 99 of them. Almost all of them can be found here in a California State Penitentiary. Do I rember Adrian Monk? That's like asking the Titanic if it rembers the iceberg. He joined the siblings of the sun. - Your cult? - It's not a cult. It's an organization. Like a self-help group. And two months later, i'm sitting here Wearing Blues, eating off tin plates. Adrian Monk, if you're watching this, I want to thank you. Thank you, brother. Because behind these gray walls of prison, I have found complete peace and total serenity. Roberts, time's up! Get back to your cell! Adrian Monk? I have to admit, I have mixed feelings about him. I mean, on the one hand, he sent me to prison. 25 years to life. On the other hand, when they arrested me he stayed after everybody and cleaned my apartment. I got my security deposit back, which was nice. Well, killing my girlfriend was the easy part. The hard part was pretending to be Monk's friend for a week. You ever hear the man try and tell a joke? - It's like verbal root canal. - Excruciating. How did you feel when he arrested you? I actually. I was feeling sorry for him. I felt like he was the village idiot or something. It was humiliating. - Until that there summation thing. - Oh, my god. Summation. I love when people tell me what I've already done. Droned! Just longest four minutes of my life. I mean, I knew what I did. I killed her. I didn't need him to tell me. - I worked on my plan for a month. - Really? My plan was perfect. I had a good plan too. I was very proud of my plan. Check this out. I find a dead Daredevil on the side of the road. I knocked my cousin out, put him in the Daredevil costume, - and threw him off a roof. - That was you? - That was good. - Well, thank you. Any other cop never would have figured it out. - That was brilliant, man. - Thanks. Remind me, didn't you, like, kill a pig and then prop a Jeep up on a Salt Lick or something? It wasn't a Jeep. It was a Pickup Truck. - Still, it's pretty fantastic. - You all had fantastic plans. So what happened? - Yeah, Monk. - Monk happened. The guy is relentless. Pick, pick, pick. Meanwhile, the case against Douglas Thurman took a surprising twist. Douglas Thurman disappeared. He had agreed to take a polygraph test that afternoon, but never showed up. The next morning, a judge issued a search warrant for Thurman's apartment and photo studio. Do you have the Warrant? What? You gotta be kidding. You just had it. You had it in your hand. Where is it? Here it is. It was right behind this CD. I'm in a band. It's the Randy Disher Project. Do a sort of Jazz fusion, Punk, Rap, Kind of Folky. - Randy, just give him the damn CD. - You guys like music? You are gonna love this. Was that a. Is that a scratch? You know what, I should probably put it in to make sure it works. Doug Thurman, SFPD. Clear! Clear! Clear! Captain. Is that Lipstick? Sick enough for you? I guess that clinches it. This guy's definitely the cosmetic assassin. The what? Cosmetic assassin. That's what we're calling him. Maybe you'd like to hear what we're calling you. That probably the low point. 'Cause we had that creep - in handcuffs the day before. - We never should have let him go. But the law is the law. Insufficient evidence. - We put a statewide APB out on him. - But we were too late. Douglas Thurman's reign of terror was not over yet. Three hours after the raid, Kate Kindel, a 24-year-old part-time model, was found dead in her apartment. She had been strangled like the others. And like the others, she had recently posed for Douglas Thurman. Even though he was on the run and the police were closing in, Thurman could not control his homicidal instincts. Behind you! Early that morning, he broke into Kindel's apartment. Her landlady found her on the living room floor three hours later. - Take a bow, Jillian. - Kate Kindel was a girl. Well done, Jillian. Well done. What? Look, I just said two words to her. I just said ""well done."" You know, I was just congratulating her. Like Thousands of other young girls, she moved to California five years earlier to follow her dream. She was 27 years old. She had worked as a Cabaret Singer and had appeared in a number of student films. She had also been found brutally strangled. Took her Lipstick, of course. - It's a little dark. - I could use some light. Thank you. This is Stottlemeyer. It was the news they had all been waiting for. Douglas Thurman had been spotted in san racine 300 miles away in a Cheap motel. One hour later, as a SWAT. Team moved in, Douglas Thurman chose to end the drama himself. With a single bullet to the head, Thurman had claimed his final victim. He has solved his 100th case. Thanks to him, the people of San Francisco will wake up tomorrow in a safer, Brighter city. But for Adrian Monk, perhaps the most successful homicide detective in the world today, ending. The night is never-ending. To Mr. Monk, the man of the hour. Don't be surprised if Hollywood Producers come knocking down your door because you're good, my friend. You're a star. Cheers. San racine is south. Excuse me? Thurman had Mexican currency in his wallet when he killed himself. He was heading for Mexico. So what? So Kate Kindel, the fourth victim, lived 50 miles north. Why would he go out of his way like that? And wasn't she strangled from behind? All the other victims were strangled from the front. You're right, she was strangled from behind. Douglas Thurman did kill victims one, two, and three. We were right about that. But somebody else killed Kate Kindel. Well, the case is over, mr. Monk. I don't think so. Yes! Swish! Nothing but net. What? Mr. Novak do you have a copy of the episode we just saw, maybe on VHS tape? - Well, this is DVR. - That's too bad. If it was on VHS, we could watch it again. DVR is digital. It's better than VHS. Well, then let's do that. If we could rewind the tape or whatever it is back to the photo studio. Natalie. Sorry. It's okay. It's only triple overtime. Only the greatest game in the history of basketball. Okay. Okay, stop right there. Now hit the picture play button. It should say ""play"" either on the button or directly - under the. - Yeah, I got that. Clear! Clear! Clear! - Picture freezer! - What? Hit the picture freezer button. - You mean ""pause""? - Fine, pause, whatever. Now go back. Picture go back. - ""Picture go back."" - Picture go back. Picture freezer! Okay. Look at the table. See, all the film Canisters are on their side. Okay, Natalie, picture go fast. Picture go fast. Right there, picture freezer. See, there's an additional film cister standing up. Where the hell did that come from? That had pictures of Kate Kindel on it, that film. I bagged that myself. Are you saying somebody planted the film? Was it a cop? No, I know every guy on that squad. And every one of them is a righteous guy. Well, there were other people in that room. Okay, Natalie, push picture go fast. - Picture go fast. - Okay. Okay, this is it. Picture go regular. That is so trippy. Took her lipstick, of course. It's a little dark. I could use some light. Picture freezer! Mr. Novak, I asked you to turn on the light. That's right. There are five light switches on that panel. You clicked number four. It was a lamp right next to me. How did you know which one of those switches to hit? - How did I know what? - You knew that apartment. You'd been in that room before. I'm a little confused. Are you accusing me of something? Yes, sir, I am. It all makes sense. - Kate Kindel was your sex mistress. - I knew it. - Sweetheart, he. - What happened? Was she threatening to tell your wife? Did she want money? All we know for sure is that you wanted her gone. Working on this show, on this serial killer story, give you the perfect opportunity. It's true. You had access to everything, all the stuff we kept from the public. - The Killer's MO, the Lipstick. - Here's what happened. You knew the police were planning to raid Thurman's studio in the morning. That night, you went to Kate Kindel's apartment. You told her you wanted to take some pictures. After the photo session, you got down to business. You took her Lipstick, because that's what Douglas Thurman would have done. The Lipstick assassin. The next morning during the raid, you planted the roll of film. It would look like Kate was just another client. Just another victim. It was a perfect plan, framing a serial killer. You should have watched your own show, Mr. Novak. You can't beat the man. Probably didn't even listen to my CD, did you? Okay, first of all, you're a terrible singer. And secondly, you can't go around accusing people. Where's your proof? I think I have proof. - What night was it? - July 25th. I thought so. It was my brother's birthday. There was a party that you missed, of course. He came home at 5:00 Am. And took a shower. I was suspicious. No, I wasn't suspicious. I knew. I went through his pockets. Is this what you need? You can check it for DNA, right? I'll take that, Sergeant. Get down! Jillian. Somebody call an ambulance. Sorry. Force of habit. Force of habit. I'm sorry. You had me. I did? That was great. You totally got me on that. Is everybody all right? ""The case was broken ""by former detective Adrian Monk, ""who ironically had recently been featured"" ""on Mr. Novak's news magazine program in Focus."" - Look, picture. - Very nice. Nice to go out on a high note. - What do you mean ""go out""? - Well, I think it might be time to quit. - It's a nice round number. - Wait, wait. You wanna quit because it's an even number? - Makes sense to me. - That is so stupid. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk, but that is just stupid. You doing? - Rolling up this news paper. - I wonder why. To hit you over the head with it because you're so stupid! Come on, come on. Wait. Wait a minute. When you caught that serial killer, that was number 100. - Right. - Right. So this case with this Tv host, this was a completely different case. Different killer, different case. - Oh, my god. - So you're at 101. Oh, my god. How did this happen? You wanna stop at a nice round number, you have to get to 200. All right, so you better get started. Let's see if anybody's killed anybody today. - This looks good ""suspicious drowning."" - 101, oh, my god. Why didn't you stop me? ""Runaway truck kills two."" ""Socialite killed by giant Pendulum."" That's juicy. - ""Billionaire's mistress disappears."" - ""Woman run over by golf cart."" - That's weird. - Yeah. ""Tv writer found dead after contract dispute."" Creepy."
"- What do you think? - It's very nice. It's too nice. I mean, for us. Sure you don't want to take this to an auction house? Maybe sotheby's? I can't. I don't want any publicity. Well, we might be able to find a buyer. We'll need some time. Maybe a week? A week. Okay, I guess I will call you in a week, then. And if you do find a buyer, let them know that I've got some ther items that I'm looking to sell. A whole house full, actually. Thank you. Do you need an umbrella? Sweetheart, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I thought I saw my husband. I guess I'm just a little jumpy. Thank you again. I'll be in touch. That girl's in trouble. Don't you know who that was? She's very famous. - What's her name? The actress. - What actress? The famous actress. What's her name? She's married to a. A real estate big shot. I was just reading. Sally Larkin, see? Okay. Acrimonious divorce. She's accusing him of physical abuse. Restraining order. -= Monk 708 (Final demi season) =- Mr. Monk Gets Hypnotized. VO By : ¤ ¤ A ¤Ak ¤ Aka ¤AkaZ ¤AkaZa ¤AkaZab ¤AkaZab¤ ¤AkaZab¤ [Sub-way.fr.] Well, it doesn't look good. Driver's side door was open. Found the key on the ground, and we found these. This is a piece of her jacket. And a broken fingernail, it was, in the door well. - Everything but the body? - Yeah, look at. Hey, look! It's a double rainbow. I haven't seen one of those since I was a kid. Look at that. It's okay, Mr. Monk, it stopped raining. - Oh, my god. Look at that. - What is it? It's a double rainbow. I've never seen one before. - Aren't you gonna look? - I believe you. It's a double rainbow. Yeah, that must be her car. - But, Mr. Monk, you have to look. - Why? Because it's beautiful and it's rare. - Don't you have any sense of wonder? - Sure, I do. I wonder where the missing woman went. Mr. Monk, please just turn around. Why, is this your rainbow? Did you commission this rainbow? No, it's your rainbow, at least it should be. Come on. Turn around. - What do you think? - Not really a double rainbow, is it? ""Double"" implies equal. - The top one is 40% smaller. - Don't you see that? Don't you see how beautiful that is? I'm trying. I just wish they were even. - I'm so sorry. - Sorry about what? Sorry for you. You'll never know what you're missing. - Hey, sorry we're late. - Did you guys see the rainbow? Yeah, I didn't get it. What's going on? It could be big. Big and messy. Car belongs to Sally Larkin. You wouldn't know this, but she was in a couple of movies five or ten years ago. I was just reading about her. She's going through a bad divorce. - ""Bad"" doesn't get any worse. - Who's the husband? Aaron Larkin. Guy's a gazillionaire. He owns half the city, including Fisherman's wharf. What was she doing here? She was selling her jewelry. Or she was trying to. She was in this store over here. She goes in, she tells the owners that she thinks she's being followed by her husband. She comes back to her car around 8:30 Pm, - they say they hear a scream. - 8:30 Pm.? I know. Local boys booted it. They didn't file the report until this morning. Hey, buddy! What's goin'on? Natalie? You look fantastic. Well, thank you, Harold. I think. - You get out of bed looking like that? - Harold, what are you doing here? I'm just jogging by, enjoying the day. I love the city after it rains. - It smells like perfume. - Does it? Have you seen the double rainbow? Yeah, yeah, I know. They're not even. Really? I didn't notice. Right, me neither. Look, I don't want to interrupt your work. I know you're busy. It is another murder? You know what, Harold? Maybe. They're lucky to have you. Listen to this man. - He is a genius. - He doesn't mean that. - You don't mean that. - Sure, I do. I do. I don't play that competitive game anymore. That was an emotional dead end. I have a new therapist. - I'm in a whole different place. - You, you have a new guy? He's great. Yeah, my new guy's great too. His first name is neven. It's a palindrome. - I guess it is. - It is. It is. I know that stuff is important to you. I guess I'm just a little more result-oriented these days. His name is Climan. Lawrence Climan. Give him a call. Hypnotherapist? He's a hypnotist? Worked for me. Yeah, i. I guess it did. Anyway, Good luk. See you around campus. I just cannot get over that rainbow! It just makes you feel glad to be alive, doesn't it? I love this song! 16 girls standin'in a row one one says ""hi,"" the other says ""hello"". - I'll tell mr. Larkin you're here. - Thank you. Gum? Yeah, sure. Here, try this. No. No, thank you. What the hell is this? - ""Disher-Mint""? - Yeah, I made it myself. - You made the gum? - Yeah, from a kit. I got it online. In my basement, I'm experimenting with a bunch of different flavors right now. - Guess what this one is. - Tar? No, it's supposed to be diet blueberry. - Not enough citric acid? - Hell. Where'd it go? Hello. Aaron Larkin. I've been expecting you. Hi, I'm Leland Stottlemeyer. This is Lieutenant Disher, Natalie Teeger, and Adrian Monk. Mr. Monk, your reputation precedes you. I'm assuming this is about my wife. She hasn't turned up yet. No, sir. She has not. That's horrible timing, really. If she'd gone missing on our wedding day, might have saved me six years of misery. Mr. Larkin, when was the last time you saw your wife? It was yesterday morning, she was going shopping as usual - Are you okay? - It's driving me crazy. - How did he do it? - Who? Harold! Did you see him? He looked so not unhappy. And he wasn't acting, either. I could tell. Excuse me, i'm sorry to interrupt you. But this guy says that, he never left the house. That he was here all night. He's lying. What if it really works? What? What, hypnotism? Mr. Monk, just because Harold seems to be doing a little better doesn't mean it'll work for you. I mean, everybody's different. Especially you. Excuse me again, sorry. - How do we know he's lying? - The umbrella. Look, maybe it's real. It says ""certified."" What does that mean? Certified by who? - Whom. - Whom. Mr. Monk, I just read this article on hypnotism. It's not even medical. - It's a short cut. - Sorry, excuse me, one more thing. What about the umbrella? The green one on the end. It's monogrammed, it's obviously his. It's still wet from the rain. Right, thank you. What's the matter with short cuts? Short cuts are your friend. They get you where you wanna go. Only faster. Mr. Monk, we need to call Dr. Bell. All Dr. Bell wants to do is talk. There's Dr. Bell. ""Blah, blah. ""Tell me about your mother. Yack, yack, yack. ""How does that make you feel? Words, words, words."" - That's your impression of Dr. Bell? - I'm sick of talking. I've been talking for 11 years. I want to get better. I wanna look at rainbows, and. I know you do, Mr. Monk. I know you do. But this is the thing: we don't know anything about this guy. We don't even know if he's a real doctor. Promise me. Promise me you will not call him until we talk to Dr. Bell. - Promise. - Yeah, all right. Sorry for you. You'll never know what you're missing. I just cannot get over that rainbow! It just makes you feel glad to be alive, doesn't it? Doctor's office. Is this Dr. Climan's office? This is his answering service. I'd like to make an appointment. I need you to relax. Okay. I think you could do better than that. Here, I need you to get comfortable, okay? - Yeah. - I need you to Un-clench. I need you to open every door. Open every door. There. Okay. What are you thinking about? - Harold Krenshaw. - Okay, okay. Forget about Harold Krenshaw. He doesn't exist. - He doesn't exist. - He doesn't. He doesn't exist. I know. I know you have doubts. You're a skeptical man. But you came to me for a reason. You have to make a leap here. Yeah? Leap, and a net will appear. Who's Annette? No, Anet, to catch you. You're safe. Okay? All your doubts, All your fears, are falling away. They're falling away. Can you feel them? Can you feel them falling away? Don't say anything. Just nod your head. I'm nodding my head. But don't say you're nodding your head. Just - nod your head. - I'm nodding my head. No, don't say you're nodding your head. Just nod your head. - I am nodding my head. - Okay, forget the nodding. We are going to take a little trip together. You and i. We are going back in time. Going back before the pain. Before the fear. Before the fear. Good. You're with Trudy now. No. Trudy. I'm gonna lose her again. I'm gonna lose her again! Okay, okay. We're moving on. We're, we're. We're moving back a little further. Now, you're in high school. Third period. It's gym class. They're gonna make me climb that rope. I can't climb that rope. I can't, please don't make me climb that rope. Okay, okay, no, no. We're moving back, moving back. Further back. Way back. Before the fear. Here we go. We are going back. Is that a smile? Are you happy? Where are you? Where are you? Okay, listen up. You know the situation. We've got a missing woman. Her name is Sally Larkin. Her husband is suspect number one. Now, Mr. Lar. Kin owns this house right here, and these seven acres. And we are gonna search that seven acres thoroughly. Let's go. Mr. Monk, it's pretty high up. You might wanna stay in the car. Do I have to? Do you have to? No. You're the boss. It's such a nice day. Might be fun to run around. You wanna run around? There's the Captain. Come on! Terrain's a little rough. Try to stay in formation. Eyes forward and down. We're looking for anything unusual. Signs of a struggle, freshly dug dirt, articles of clothing. - Any questions? - Yeah, what do we win? - What do we win? - If we find the body. You don't win anything. Right? You're going too fast. - Oh, my god. Are you okay? - Never felt better. - Wait, should I get a wipe? - No, don't move. Don't move. - What are you doing? - Do you like butter? Yes. Let's see. Did you did you get enough sleep last night? Did you! Do you dare me to climb that tree? - What? - What about that tree? I bet I could climb that tree and swing over to that tree. You think I could? I don't know. Wow, that tree. That tree! Over here! Hey! Everybody, I got something! - What is it? - Okay, but I saw it first. - You saw it first? Who the hell cares? - I care. That's who. Okay, so you saw it first. What is it? Okay, but here's the rule: you guys can't touch it. I understand. We're all cops here. I can touch it. Natalie can touch it. Just me and natalie, and nobody else. See? I'm gonna. I'm gonna call him hoppy. Because he likes to, you know, hop. Isn't there a shoe box in your car? That could be hoppy's house. Let me go get it. Let me go get it. Let's go. - Hello. - Back again. Yeah, like a bad penny. Is he here? He's just finishing up a phone call. So have a seat and he'll be right out. Thank you. I have a frog. It's in the car. Really? Is it your birthday? - Yes, it is. - Happy birthday. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - How old are you? - Mr. Monk. - Are you over or under 100? - What are you doing? - I'm 57. You look great. - 57, wow, 57. So you're really getting up there. - Well, I wouldn't say that. - I would. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. - So have you heard anything? - Not from your wife. We've spoken to a number of local merchants, however. Apparently she was, trying to sell some jewelry. Well, that's. That's unusual. Normally, she's buying. Guess how old she is. - I think I'm gonna take my break. - Yeah, sure. - Do you have to make? - Make what? Is he drunk? I spoke to a number of sally's friends. They said that sally was afraid for her life. Yeah. Well, she's crazy. I'm hungry. - Yeah, you just had lunch. - So? When I was here Earlier, I asked, for a list of all your properties. Yeah, I got it right here. Emily, could you please bring in the list? This is Emily Carter, my office manager. Emily, these people are from the police. Hello. So these are your current projects? Yeah, I think so. Let's see, these are residential properties. Undeveloped land. These are some condos we're working on up north. We're going to have to search all of these, with your permission, of course. Yeah, sure, be my guest. Whatever you need. You might not believe this, but, I want my wife found as much as you do. I've got nothing to hide. I think you do. I think you have plenty to hide. - He's in love with her. - What? I bet they want to get married, and go on a honeymoon, and, you know, kiss. Who, who is this person? Look at his face. He's turning all red. Just admit it. You want to marry her. It's all over town. - What does that mean? - It's all right, Emily. This is Adrian Monk. He's famous. He's the best detective in California. And yeah, it's true. Emily and I are involved. As a matter of fact, I was with emily the night sally disappeared. Well, if that checks out, it looks like you have an alibi then. Why didn't you tell us before? Well, Captain, it's a little, complicated. I'm technically still married. We've been keeping it secret for three years, But you saw right through it in two minutes, Mr. Monk. Well done. I am curious, though, how did you. What gave us away? Cinchy. I saw you drinking out of her water bottle without wiping it off. You weren't afraid of her cooties. My cooties. Candy machine. I'm gonna talk to him. For a long time. Sold out, sold out. Chocolate Pretzels! Do you have seven Dimes and a Nickel, or three quarters or a hammer? Let's get some Candy Later. Right now, we're gonna go talk to Dr. Bell. You mean Dr. Smell? Mr. Monk, what's going on? Did you take some cold medicine? No, he just talked to me. He didn't give me any medicine. - Who? Who talked to you? - Nobody. Oh, my god. You went to that hypnotist. I need you to look at me. Look at me right now. Look at me, listen to me. - How old are you? - How old are you? I need you to tell me right now. How old are you? That's for me to know, and you to find out. I call shotgun! Stop! You have to call the police. - You like pancakes? - Love 'em! I'll bet you always wanted pancakes like this for breakfast. Always wanted 'em! But my mom never made 'em. Never. Davey palmer. He lived across the street. They had pancakes every day. We never did. So this is like a dream come true. Hoppy likes 'em too! Look at that! Look at hoppy! Listen, I'm gonna talk to your friend for just a minute. I'll be right back. - What do you think? - I think you should have called me. Hypnotism is no substitute for real treatment. I'm aware of this Dr. Climan. I've been cleaning up his messes for years. I told him not to call that guy. I made him promise. Can't you just. You'know. Snap him out of it, doc? It doesn't work like that, Lieutenant. Even if I could I wouldn't recommend it. It might trigger some deeper depressive reaction. He's returned to an earlier ego state. Emotionally, he's about six and a half, seven years old. Is he reliving his childhood? Not at all. No, he's living the childhood he always wanted. You might call it a, wish fulfillment. We're outta syrup! We're outta syrup! He couldn't live like this forever, right? No, of course not. No, not like that. But the good news is, at some deeper level, Adrian knows that too. Eventually, he'll snap himself out of it. Don't worry. He'll come back to us. We have a. A syrup emergency here! Grenade! Hey! Good shot! Disher. When? Yeah, I understand. You're not gonna believe this. This is weird. Weirder than this? They just found Sally Larkin in sonoma county. She's alive. Okay. We gotta go. Thanks, doc. I call shotgun! Listen, young feller. Why don't you just stay here with Natalie and draw us a picture? Look, actually. If he's not in the way, I would consider bringing him along. Treat him as an adult. Just stick to the normal routine. I think that's the best medicine. Okay, you can come. - Can I bring hoppy? - Look, monk, it's a crime scene. You can't bring a frog to a crime scene. - Okay, hoppy can come. - Great. We'll just stop at the store and grab the syrup. Okay, we'll stop at the store and get syrup. I really wish. I know, I know. We should've called you. We don't have all the details, Ken. Here is what we do know: Aaron Larkin, the multimillionaire developer. Is dead. He was killed in this hunting Cabin last night by his estranged wife. According to police, Sally Larkin was chained up in this Cabin like a prisoner of war for three horrifying days. Last night, in a daring escape, she overpowered her husband, beat him to death, then ran up that hill and stopped a passing motorist. Back to you, ken. She's still at the hospital. We haven't got a statement yet. Pretty obvious what happened here, though. - Kept her chained up in the corner. - Oh, my god. - Like an animal. - Yep. Probably drove up here every night, brought her food and water. Hey, hey, hey! It's not a toy. Here Mr. Monk, look, look, look A tractor! Go sit over here. Hey! Hey! So why didn't he just kill her? I'm sure he intended to eventually. All right, well She told some paramedic that she. Loosened one of those baseboards. She pretended to be asleep. When he came back to check on her. Bam. Side of the head. Monk, do you have something you'd like to share with the rest of us? I can see his butt. - Mr. Monk, the man is dead. - Yeah, of embarrassment! Sorry. I've got it. Here's what happened: Tuesday night, Larkin abducted his wife from that parking lot. He overpowered her. Maybe he drugged her. Then, he brought her up here. He kept her prisoner. For three days, he taunted her. He humiliated her. Something about some jewelry. Then  Last night he went a little too far. In all the excitement, his pants fell down. He killed himself. He didn't have a choice. She'd seen his hiney. - I think we're done here. - Great. I always knew aaron was crazy, but I. I never dreamed that he would I mean, three days in that horrible room. You know, you could do this tomorrow, if you'd like. No, thank you, I would just rather get it over with today. Okay, all right. What. What did he say? What did he want? He was just. Acting crazy, asking me about my jewelry. I hid most of it. He just wanted to know where I kept it. And I know that as soon as I told him where it was, he would've killed me. She's a liar. There is no way she spent three days in that cabin. - No way. - Why not? There's no Tv, so it's impossible. She woulda died. I'm sorry, i'll explain later. Could you go on, please? Well, last night, before he came back, I had pried one of the Floorboards loose, and then I pretended to be asleep. When he got closer, I hit him. I didn't mean to. To kill him. Maybe I did. Or maybe I did. Or maybe I did. I didn't mean to kill him. I'm innocent, I tell ya. She's a liar, liar, pants on fire! A girl can't beat up a boy. That's scientifically impossible a. Okay, look. I don't care what Dr. Bell Said, Natalie. One more peep, I want him out of here, understood? One more peep, and I'll Clobber him myself. What's that smell? Keep your arms down. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. How did you get away? Well, I had this shackle on my leg. This big iron thing. After I hit him, I went and got the keychain out of his pocket and unlocked it. Look. I still have the bruise. I can barely walk. Is that gum on your shoe? How much would you give me to eat this? Five bucks. For god's sake! Monk, that's disgusting! Spit it out. Please, spit that out right now. Five bucks. Well, all right. He earned it. Wait a minute. She is a liar, Stottlemeyer. She's a big, fat liar. And I can prove it. - Do I have to listen to this? - No ma'am, you do not. - Natalie, I said one more peep. - But she made the whole thing up. - I can prove it! - Just a minute. Tell me in the car. You are in a lot of trouble, facelift. You are going to Jail. Get him out of here! - You are a bad lady. - You know what? And you're a bad boy. All right? We're gonna go home. You need a time out. Don't you wanna hear how I figured it out? - No, I do not! - All right, fine! I'm not gonna tell ya! Good. I'm not gonna tell any of you, because. Because I hate you. And by the way, you're all stupid. And you don't deserve to know the truth. And also by the way, you're never gonna see me again. Ever. 'cause I'm going to France. Come on, Hoppy. You're not stupid. Sorry. Mr. Monk. Wait, Mr. Monk! Wait, wait! Indecent exposure? There's no such thing. The human body is a beautiful thing! It is beautiful! The whole world is beautiful! You are beautiful. And so are you. Come on, let's all get naked. Let's all get naked! Free yourself! We were born free, just free yourself and let. I'm free. This park is for children. Why don't you go home? Come on, honey. Let's get out of here. She's right, Hoppy. Let's go home. There will be an inquest next week, but it's just a formality. Is there anything else we can do for you? Anyone we can call? No, no thank you, Lieutenant. I think what I need is just some time alone. A nice cup of tea and a good night's sleep. Sounds like a good idea. We'll do what we can do to keep the press away. I appreciate that. Thank you, Captain. Okay, this is it, my friend. Home sweet home. At least one of us will be free. Go ahead. Go on. You can do it. Atta boy. Hello. It's Adrian, right? How did you get here? I took the bus. Good for you. All by yourself? Me and the frog. Right. It's hoppy. Right? Well, are you hungry? I've got some cookies in the house. I know what you did. And I know how you did it. What, do you think I still did something bad? Why? Is it because i'm a girl? Because you're a girl. Who signed a pre-nup and then regretted it. You wanted it all, didn't you? All his money. - You're different. - Here's what happened: your husband never abducted you. No one abducted you. It was a setup from the very beginning. You did spend three days in that cabin, but you weren't a prisoner. You were hiding out. You were waiting. You chained yourself up so the bruises would be real. And you starved yourself. You were an actress, preparing for the biggest performance of your life. Then, last night, you went back to your house. You brought a rug from the cabin and you put it down to the floor. Then, you waited in the shadows. You killed him there, then dragged his body back to the cabin. It was show time. To the world, you were a woman who had escaped from her sadistic husband. You were a hero. A very wealthy hero. Well, that's a very nice little story, detective Monk. It's more than a story. I can prove that you didn't spend three days in that cabin, chained to the floorboards. You made one mistake. While you were missing, we went to your house to question your husband. The captain was chewing some gum. He had some trouble. He ended up spitting it out. Last night, after the murder, you accidentally stepped on the same piece of gum. This piece of gum. The one that was stuck to your shoe. You can't prove that's the same piece of gum. Gum is gum. Not this gum. This is Disher-Mint gum. Diet blueberry. It's homemade. It was on your shoe. You've been chewing that piece of gum for five hours? No. I've been chewing this piece of gum for five and a Half. Oh, my god. Chewing this gum for five and a half hours! Gimme that gum. - Gimme that gum! - Mrs. Larkin, drop it! Drop it! Mrs. Larkin, put it down! God! Somebody wanna tell me what's going on? Just take the gum. Just take the gum. It's material evidence. Take the gum. I'll explain everything later. Just take the gum. Is this my gum? God. Oh my god! Fight over this. I've got a basement full of this stuff. It was in your mouth. And it was on her shoe. And I was chewing it. Are you. I was chewing it! Are you okay? I gotta go home and gargle for a very long time. Oh, my god. Is that mud? Is that. Is that mud?! - Is that mud? - Yes, Monk, it's mud! Welcome back! - I could make you some pancakes. - No, I'm fine. We have that syrup you like. No, I'm good. Thank you. They grow up so fast. - What? - Nothing. Mr. Monk, you have to see this. What is it? There's a nest outside your window with three baby birds! - I'll call the exterminator. - You wouldn't dare. She's feeding them. Mr. Monk, come here, you have to see this. They're so cute! It's the circle of life. Aren't you curious? Yeah, I believe you. Circle of life. I'll get my camera! I don't get it."
"That was pretty damn good. That was better than good. That was sensational. Oh, an empty bottle. The saddest sight in the world. Where's willie? He's always got a little money.

Christmas doesn't mean anything to you? Not anymore. Why don't you believe in anything, mr. Monk? What are you so afraid of? I'll tell you what I think. I think mr. Monk has been afraid of so many things For so many years, he's afraid of not being afraid. What does that mean? Think about it. I'm afraid to. Honey, will you try this? This is chicken soup. It's for the captain. What's wrong with him? Oh, he's very, very sick. It's been three or four weeks now. Yeah, he's got some sort of arthritis. He can barely walk. Mm, it's perfect. He's gonna love it. I'm really worried about him. I mean, I've known him for 15-- Is that my ladle? Is that a problem? No, it's fine. Help yourself. I'll get it. Wait, i--may i? I just thought of something I want for christmas. A new ladle. And a lock for my utensil drawer. Uh, mr. Monk, these men want to talk to you. Hello. Are you mr. Monk, the detective? That's ike. That's reggie. And they call me the professor. We asked around. And they says you was the best. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I'm retired. As of when? As of ""hello, are you mr. Monk?"" He's not retired. He's joking, he's joking. So would you guys li To have a seat? No, no, no! No, that couch doesn't work. None of these chairs-- Hey, I have an idea. Uh, why don't we all stand on some newspaper? Julie, go get some newspaper. Everybody hold it in until we get some newspaper, okay? Hold what in? What do you think we're gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. Just hold it in. Hold it. Can we do anything for you gentlemen? Last night, a friend of ours was killed. And we want to hire mr. Monk to investigate. Did you talk to the police? They didn't really listen, ma'am. They said it was an accident. And that willie-- that's his name-- He climbed into an old refrigerator To stay warm, closed the door, And then suffocated. Accidents. But you don't think so. Last night, he said that someone was after him. Said someone was chasing him. But we didn't believe him. Delusional. We got money. You can redeem these anywhere. It comes to $14. So what you think? Uh, you know, mr. Monk and I are gonna mull that one over, But in the meantime, are you guys hungry? I just made some soup. I have a whole pot. Oh, we'd appreciate it, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Na--ja-- excuse me. Excu-- Stay. Stay. Stay right where you are. Stay! Stay. What are you doing? You're not really gonna feed them. Of course I'm feeding them. They're hungry. Oh, natalie, natalie, I-i can't take this job. Please don't make me take this job. Mr. Monk, you have to help these men. Okay, here it comes. Number one, they have nowhere else to go. Number two, they collected cans and bottles to pay your salary. That's every nickel they have in the world. When was the last time a client offered you Every nickel they had? Excuse me. Throwing this away? You know what, it's all yours. You keep it. Oh, what is this, marble? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. Maybe it is. Okay, okay, okay, fine. Fine, fine, don't, don't, don't touch anything. You know what? Let's take a look at the crime scene. Here we go. Everybody out. Right. Show me the crime scene. Out--outside. We waited for him all night! Never came back! So we were looking for him, you know, Like a search party! Right there! We found his shopping cart right over there! Can you even see from there? I'm fine. Is that the refrigerator? Is that the refrigerator? What? Is that the refrigerator? Yes, sir. And then we noticed a piece of clothing-- Part of his jacket sticking out. Protruding, as it were. So we opened it. He was kinda stuffed in there. Face-first. He was facing away from you? Did you tell that to the police? Yeah, but they don't listen to us, man. We're, like, invisible to them. What'd he say? What? We're like inv-- They don't see us! So then what happened? He fell out! Backwards! Plop! What is it? There's only one handprint. He wasn't clawing around. He wasn't panicking. He was already dead. No, no, no, I'm not signing off on this Till I talk to the d.A. What was the victim's name again? Willie t. That's what they called him. But nobody knew his real name. The medical examiner rubberstamped it, But we just came from the crime scene. Randy, it is all wrong. I think somebody put him in that refrigerator. We talked to his bum friends. His friends. Not his bum friends. The ne'er-do-wells. They're homeless individuals. They said somebody was chasing him last night. Okay. Well, we'll reopen the case. I'll call the m.E. Myself. Just like that? Yeah, just like that. Oh, diaz, diaz, is that the revised affidavit? Uh, I think so. Yeah, let's see. Good, make sure this gets to judge barr, Not judge coleman. Yes, sir. Rookies. Wow, randy, you really are in charge. Yeah, well, when the captain got sick, Somebody had to step up. How's he doing? We've been trying to call him, but he doesn't answer. Well, that's because he's here. He's here? He's downstairs on the front desk. He said he couldn't stand Just sitting around his house. Is he okay? He got here last night, and he won't go home. It's like he's trying to prove something, And it's not just his back. He's in a bad place right now. So, mrs. Parisi Let me get this straight. You filed a complaint 2 1/2 weeks ago, You said somebody vandalized your house. That's right. You said you thought Some teenagers painted this thing On your front door. This is not a thing. It's a fountain. Okay. So some teenagers painted this fountain on your front door And now you want to withdraw the complaint. That's right. It wasn't teenagers. I know that now. It was god. It was a sign from god. God drew a little picture on your front door. It was a miracle. Last summer I couldn't breathe. My lungs were burning. She couldn't breathe. We went to three different doctors. And then I heard on the news About the fountain At the franklin park monastery. They look just like this. It was this fountain. And when she drank from it, I was cured. She's eating again. She can sleep. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. It's a miracle. Write that down. ""it's a miracle. You walk me through this again? One more time. Oh, there he is. How you doing? I feel like I look. Oh, god, back problems are the worst. What did the doctor say? I got five doctors. And they haven't got a clue. They've got me on three different medications. I've tried everything. Even this crap. What is it? I don't know. It's some sort of organic, hippie concoction from hell. My aunt sent me a whole carton of it. Ugh, it tastes like chalk. What's in it? Chalk extract Captain, why don't you just head on home? We got things covered here. Oh, no, I can't go home. Look at all those open cases. Actually, these ones are all cleared. We were nine for nine this week. Nine for nine. Good job. I guess I'll just go home. Not that anybody would notice. You think you'll be okay? I'm fine. Except for the alimony I can't afford, I haven't had a date in two--two years, And my son--my oldest boy jared is not talking to me. He's with his mother. He doesn't even pick up the phone. Merry christmas. Was there a sign on your house? Me too. I was the first one here. I was in a car accident last year. I busted my hip. They said I'd never walk again. Five weeks ago, the sign appeared on my garage door. It said, ""drink."" Drink? Two days later, I was on a tour group with my church. We stopped here. And there it was. So I drank. And The doctor says it's a miracle. I think he's right. I've been telling everyone. I even went on the 6:00 news, you know. To spread the word. You're not a believer. I can tell. Believe me, I was a lot more skeptical than you. We all were. So what do you do? You're selling tickets? You got a gift shop? No. There's no gimmick here, my friend. Nobody's making a nickel on this. In fact, we're losing money. We were planning to build some classrooms Right where we're standing. And now? Well, we can't build here now. This is sacred ground. Are you a man of faith? Um, I was an altar boy, and I thought I wanted to be a priest when I was a kid. It's never too late. It's not a one-way street. You can always go back. Take a leap. $13.85. It was supposed to be $14. I counted $14. These three bottles are from canada. We can't accept them. All set? The bums ripped me off. Canadian bottles. Aw, why don't you just fly up to vancouver? You can redeem 'em there. Fly up to vancouver? You know how much that would cost? I mean, the taxi ride to the airport alone-- I get it. You're joking. Ok, What's this? Flowers for the captain. No, I mean these. Utensils. New plates. Didn't I mention? I invited a few friends to your place for christmas dinner. I don't have any friends. Well, they're not really friends. They're really more clients. Well, I don't have any clients except the bums. I said, I don't have any clients except for the bums. Captain stottlemeyer! Feeling better? Not really. My brother-in-law had a bad back. You know what fixed it? What? Acupuncture. He swears by it. Been there. Done that. I've tried everything. I've tried crystals, acupuncture, This morning, I was at the monastery In franklin park drinking water from the fountain. Oh, yeah, it was on the news. The miracle fountain. Any luck? Not yet. Well, maybe it's a time-release miracle. Yeah, say, Are you a religious man? Can't say that I am. I only ask 'cause I saw the-- Oh, my ex-partner Put that up the day we opened. Real devil dodger. Used to go to church every week for years. Rain or shine. Till the day he embezzled $18,000 From me and disappeared. You got a partner? Yes, I do. Be careful. That's all I can tell you. Okay. You're all set. All right. Merry christmas. Okay, merry christmas. Good morning. Good morning. Sorry I'm late. What's that? I forgot the gravy for monday night, the big dinner. You wasted a trip. They make their own gravy. Who makes their own gravy? Bums. Bums make their own gravy. What does that even mean? You don't wanna know. Heavenly father, as you know, life ain't easy for us. But we know you're always there, Watching over us. And we want to thank you for sending our new friends Mr. Monk, natalie, and julie into our lives. And may we remember our brothers and sisters Less fortunate than ourselves In this season of giving. Amen. Amen. Amen. Mm, this is good. This stuffing is delicious. Oh, thank you, it's my grandmother's recipe. I love this gravy. Usually we make our own, but-- Excuse me, could you repeat that About the gravy? Mm. Usually we make our own. Huh. Isn't that interesting? Natalie, did you hear that? Yes. Yes, I did. Good. Interesting. So, um, why do they you call you the professor? Julie, it's probably because he loves to read And probably because he's curious about the world And other cultures I eat books. Excuse me. I'm just using my napkin to wipe away any food That might be on my face. I'm just wiping my face. It's fun. So how's our case coming? Actually, there's been some progress there. The medical examiner changed the cause of death. It wasn't an accident after all. Your friend was asphyxiated. He was drunk? No, no, no, no, he was suffocated. Probably with a plastic bag. It's good news, actually, Because now they'll reopen the case. Well, thank you for that, mr. Monk. I mean, we really appreciate that. It's the best 14 bucks we ever spent. Yeah, yeah, speaking of money, It wasn't exactly $14. You were a little short. Yeah, this-- They wouldn't redeem these three bottles 'cause they are from guess where? Canada. I mean, it's no big deal. It's 15 cents. It's hardly worth mentioning, but-- Chalk extract. Hey, randy, have you seen the captain? We've been calling him all night. Well, he's not here. Why? What's going on? You remember the homicide I was working? Yeah, homeless guy. Right. His name was willie t. The night he was killed, He was out collecting bottles and cans. Yeah, remember that chalky herbal stuff The captain was drinking? There were three bottles of the same drink In willie's shopping cart. Which means that at some point that night He was in the captain's yard, right? Huh, that's interesting. Yeah, maybe the captain saw something, I mean, something unusual. What is that? What? On your face. On your lip. It looks a little bit like a moustache. Well, I'm in charge. It comes with the job. Okay, you're making me a little uncomfortable. You're making me a little uncomfortable. Anyways, guys, the captain's gone. You're too late. He came in yesterday, he grabbed some stuff, And he just left. For how long? He didn't say. I won't need these anymore. Uh, excuse me, what's going on? The fountain is blessed. Exodus 23. ""and ye shall serve the lord your god. ""and he shall bless thy bread and thy water. And I will take the sickness from amidst thee."" Okay, we're looking for a friend of ours. Uh, they found his car parked out front. I haven't seen him. Sorry. Mr. Monk, look at all these people. They really believe in it. Well, they're people. They'll believe anything. Mr. Monk, you should try it. You should drink from the fountain. You can't be serious. You're in so much pain all the time, you know? What if there's something to it? You know? I mean, anything's possible. That's not exactly true. A lot of things are what we call impossible. It's the opposite of possible. I get it. I'll give you an example. Um, this. Hallelujah. Excuse me, we're looking for a friend of ours. Leland. He was here. He still is. Wow, it's beautiful. Is it? If you say so. Hello. I'm brother andrew. I'm natalie teeger, and this is adrian monk. Mr. Monk and the monk. Sorry. Are you allowed to laugh? We've been known to chuckle.

""i want everyone to know ""i am not running away from anything. ""i'm running toward something-- ""something true and wonderful. ""god bless you all, Brother leland."" And here's his badge. Two years? That's almost three years. Without the captain? What am I supposed to do? It's almost as if he didn't even consider me. Well, maybe he knows what he's doing. Yeah. Maybe we should be happy for him. Okay. Okay. Let me try. No, that's not gonna happen. Mr. Monk, why don't you try it? Try what? Drinking from the fountain. It worked for the captain. I don't think so. Oh, god, mr. Monk, come on. You have to believe in something. I don't know what I'd do If I didn't think I'd see mitch again. You mean in heaven? Of course in heaven! Where'd you think I was going? Well, you know, the drinking, and you kissed a leper. You think I'm going to hell? She kissed a leper. Mr. Monk, seriously.

Where are we going? This can count as my christmas gift. Where are we going? You look thirsty. I think you need a drink. What? Oh, no. Katie? What are you doing here? I told you we can't be seen together. You're going to ruin everything. Are you going somewhere? I-i can't do it anymore, owen. I'm sorry. These people, they're coming from all over now, And some of them are really sick. So what? You're not there. They're--they're throwing their medicine away. They really believe in the fountain. That was the whole idea. I promise I won't tell anyone. I just want to get away. Don't be a child! Nobody's going anywhere. You and I both know what's under that fountain. You're in this now. We're both in it. Understand? Don't worry, darling. It's almost over. I can't do it. Oh, mr. Monk, come on. I can't. Please. Look, there's the captain's cane. Yeah, it's part of the ritual, Because he didn't need it anymore. Please drink. Natelie What? What is it? These pills. Half the bottles-- more than half-- Are from the same pharmacy. There's something wrong here. Just put this in your bag. Let's take some more. What are you doing? I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm afraid you have to stay back. This may be A crime scene. A crime scene? Conspiracy. Probably fraud. It isn't fraud. It was murder. this has gone long enough It wasn't me. I didn't even know him then. Nine years ago, my fiance caught his business partner Stealing money, and killed him. Your fiance? Owen mccloskey. He filled those prescriptions. The pharmacist. Captain. Captain. Captain, you can't go to spain-- Without knowing the truth. It wasn't a miracle. The water, the fountain, it was all a hoax. I'm sorry, captain. It was the pharmacist, owen mccloskey. He killed willie t. Here's what happened Mccloskey killed his partner and buried him here. Nine years later, planning to renovate Body would be discovered he couldn't dig up the body they had built a fountain there he had to stop them from digging he started changing their prescriptions to make his patients sicker that's why you never got better he did it to everyone he painted that sign on your door Willie the bum must have seen him that's why Mccloskey killed him Amen So he was messing with everybody's medication. Making us all sicker. And then he sent us to that fountain. That's it. So after we drank, He'd give us some real medication. Making us all feel better. And it worked. The fountain became a shrine, A sacred place. Which, of course, they would never dig up. Well, so much for miracles. Thank you, mr. Monk. This is the best christmas I can remember. Yeah. I was just doing my job. No, it wasn't just that. Thanks for the caring. Well, the caring part was mostly natalie. We, uh, we wanted to give you something. We made it ourselves. It's gravy.

Randy, when I drank that water, Something happened. It was like a slate inside me was wiped clean And I started over. It felt great. Hey, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna call my son.

"Craig, I'm here at the bayside correctional facility right now where a state-wide manhunt is underway for this man, Joe Endicott.

Hand to god I've never hurt anybody! Ever! I'm a con man. I'm a grifter. I'm a - loveable rogue. - A loveable rogue? People don't call themselves loveable rogues. Loveable rogues do. - This is ridiculous. - Why? Come on, what are you doing? Adrian, no, no, wait! Think about it! I could be halfway to Paraguay right now but I'm not. I'm here. I came to you! What does that tell you? That you're an unstable person and that you belong in prison. No, that I need your help. Come on, I didn't kill that woman! I crawled through the sewer. When I got to the parking lot she was already dead. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back. You crawled through the what-what? I crawled through the sewer. That's how I escaped. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Go back You crawled Through the what? - The sewer? - Wait. Go back. What happened? The shower stopped. - You ran out of hot water. - No, no, no. Keep washing. - I'm freezin'! - Keep, keep washing. Just. Oh, my god! What'd you do? Little camouflage Wrong people might see us working on the case. - What case? - My case! I told you I didn't kill that woman,. We gotta prove it. No, no. There is no case. We're gonna call a lawyer, then you're gonna turn yourself in. No! No, I can't do that. I can't go back to Jail, okay? Not yet. Hey, how is Ambrose? He's he's fine. You know what? We should call him. I would love to say hi to him. I'd rather not involve him. Excuse me. What do you mean, you can't go back yet? Look, that woman, the woman that was killed, lindsey bishop was her name. She was a social worker there. Everybody in the joint loved her. She used to work on letters, help people with their appeals. I mean, look, if I go back there and they. Don't worry, it's perfect. And they think that I killed her I wouldn't last more than ten minutes in there. Look, clear my name. And then I'll go back, I promise. You know, these are all the same. What, you wear the same thing every day? I feel like i'm back in prison. You know, could I have a little bit of privacy, please? Thanks. - Do you have any other kind of mayo? - What are you doing? I'm making a sandwich. I'm starving. Are you ever gonna tell me what happened? After I eat, okay? I have been running all night. - That's mine. - Talk first. Then eat. Look, I can do both. All right? There's not much to tell. It took me two months and 87 spoons to get outta there. - What about your cellmate? - I didn't have one. Made life a lot easier. So last night after lights out, I made my move. Three minutes later, I was in the sewer pipe. Yeah, okay. You can skip that part. The stench was god-awful. It was like crawling through someone's. It's okay. Just skip ahead. Okay, about 3:00AM, I come out the other side, and I saw a car. Looked empty. I figured I got lucky. I thought maybe I could hotwire it. I yank open the door, and there she was. I tried calling 911, but then some guard in the tower spots me, opened fire, and I just. I just took off and never looked back. So let me see if I understand this. If you're telling the truth. - It's hand to god. - Right. Hand to god. This is your story: a homicidal maniac happened to be strolling by the federal prison. He saw the car. He stabs the driver. But he doesn't steal the car. He just runs away. Couple minutes later, Jack Monk, Jr. Crawls out of a manhole a few yards away and finds the body? Thank you. You made this very easy for me. Wait. What are you doin'? Adrian, what are you doin'? No, no, no what is it with you and the phone? Come on, you're treating me like another schlub. This is family! Hey, this is family talkin'here. That's gotta mean something. Not to me. No! Okay, okay! You win. I'll go back to Jail. Straight up, i'll do my time Just do me one favor. Let me call my mother. Your have a mother. Yes, Adrian. I have a mother too. Her name is Darlene Monk. She lives in Amarillo, Texas. I'm sure she's been watching the news, and she must be scared to death, okay? Come on. Just one phone call. For old time's sake? - We don't have any old times. - Sure, we do. Come on, rember? Remember in the hallway, when you hit me over the head with that metal box? - That was a half hour ago. - It's something. I mean, it's a start. Mom, it's Jack. - My baby! Are you okay? - Yeah. On the news, they said you killed a woman. Mom, I didn't kill anybody. You gotta believe me. My baby! I know, I wish I could prove it, but I can't. Go to your brother. Go to Adrian. He has to help you. He's family. Mom, I'm with him right now, and, he wants to turn me in. Why?! Why won't he help us? I don't know, mom. I guess Family doesn't mean anything to him. Adrian Monk! Are you there? We've never met, but I feel like I know you. Your father bragged about you all the time. He did? He said you were the light of his life. He said there's nothing you couldn't do. I am begging you, Adrian. I'm a mother. Help my little boy. I'm on my knees. Help little Jackie! He's no Angel, but he wouldn't hurt anybody. Ma'am? It's okay. I am going to help your son. You are? He's gonna be okay, I promise. I'll, i'll do what I can. - Okay. - God bless you, Adrian! Love you, mom. - Thanks, bro. - Half bro. - Who's your friend? - That's my Pen pal. Pen pal! I didn't know people still did that. Hey, you guys even dress alike. - Where's he from? - Canada. - East canada. - What's his name? Gretzky. Really? Any relation? Why would you say that? We don't. We don't even look alike. No, not to you, to Wayne Gretzky, the hockey player. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm I'm fine. Let's just see what there is to see, and then we can all go home in separate cars. That's it? Kinda scary how easy it was? It's funny, you know, I've known Mr. Monk for four years, and he never mentioned having a pen pal. Well, you know, I shouldn't say anything else. I don't wanna break the pen pal code, so - Okay - Her cell phone? - It wasn't near the car? - Nope. That's right where it was. Captain Stottlemeyer, Adrian Monk. This is Tom Bennett, Dan Reese. - Tom's the Warden here. - Warden. Whatever you need, Captain. Whatever we can do. We appreciate that. We've assembled a task force, working with the sheriff's department. He can't get far. We'll find him. I can't wait to get that son of a bitch back in here. This is personal. Everybody loved that woman. Not just the inmates. Staff too. Dan was on duty last night. He's the one who sounded the alarm. Yeah, what what was she doing here at 3:00 in the morning? Lindsey worked late a lot. Sometimes she'd be here all night. You know, dedicated. Did you actually see him, the escapee, whose name, of course, is Joe Endicott, attack Miss Bishop? No, sir, I can't say I did. I thought I heard something, someone screaming, I hit the lights. He was right there, right by the car. I got off about a dozen shots, but he was gone. And that's the weapon? Is it a fork or a spoon? They can make a knife out of anything. Utensils, toothbrushes. ""Gos"" something. - That's Sterling Silver. - Really? What are you guys doin'up there, having tea parties? That's not standard issue. It must have been smuggled in. Dogs? Those dogs Skinny must be bringing the hounds back in. They must have caught his scent. Hey, we gotta go! We're late. For the thing. - That's Jack, my pen pal. - How ya doin'? We gotta go. Remember? Cap, we gotta go. Natalie's gonna drop us off. Okay, I'll call ya later. I'll fill ya in. Nice to meet you, Jack. - Are you gonna eat? - Not here. Or near here. Or far from here. Yeah, dad said you were peculiar. Avy'aite Roikuaahaguere. Jahoecha Peve. - I knew it. - What was that? It wasn't Spanish. It's Guarani. It's the official language of Paraguay. Do you know that the most beautiful women in the world come from Paraguay? - Do they? - Exhibit a You didn't even look at. What are you human or what? I'm human enough. Okay, sherlock. Where are we? How's the case comin' the victim's cell phone was exactly where you said it would be. And there was blood spatter all over the car, but you didn't have any on your pants. - So? - So there's a more than even chance that you were telling the truth. We're gonna hug soon. I can feel it. No, we're not gonna hug, Jack. You're still a criminal. I can believe you and still not like you. Well, who do you like? I can be anybody. Listen to me. This is serious. Somebody killed Lindsey Bishop and tried to frame you. So who else knew you were planning to escape? - Nobody. - Somebody did. Somebody knew you'd be in that parking lot. Nobody! Hand to god, nobody knew! Nobody! Nobody! Except Shiv. - I have a follow-up question. - Shoot. - Who's Shiv? - He's my cellmate. - You said you didn't have a cellmate. - I don't think so. You must have misconstrued my connotation. Tell me about Shiv. His real name is Norman Logan. It was his cell. It was his plan. Somehow he got a hold of a real chisel, and he dug the tunnel himself. They moved me into his cell yesterday, and, he showed me the tunnel. And I figured if someone was gonna bust out, might as well be me. You said you'd never lie to me. We had a deal. Okay, I know. I did lie about Shiv. But that was before I promised never to lie. So I don't think that should count. - What was that look? - It's called disappointment, Jack. I'm sure it's a look you've seen before. Come on, let's go. Well, where are we going? I'm going back to the prison and talk to your cellmate. No, you. No you can't talk to him. He know that we talked. He know that we're together! All right, I'll have the Captain ask around. - But let's go. - Well, where now? - Plan B. Lindsey Bishop's house. - I'm not. I can't. - Come on. - I'm. I can't believe it! I'm so I still can't believe that she's gone! I'm sorry. I didn't even know she had a brother. We were close, and of course now It's too late to tell her all the things I wanted to tell her! Yeah, I know I'm gonna Miss her too. She was probably my favorite tenant. - Are you family too? - Pen pal. Well I'll let you two boys get to it. Just rember to lock up as you leave. Again, I'm sorry. He was a nice guy. Can't help but notice your fake crying looks a lot like your real crying. Thank you. I love what you do with your hands. You're like one of those pantomime guys? - Okay, what are we looking for? - I'm not sure. I'll know it when I find it. - What. What are you doing? - Believe me, brother, - she's not gonna Miss it. - Put it back. You put it back. Fine. And the rest of it. Okay, Jiminy Cricket. Look, you win! Puttin'it back! - That's weird. - What is it? This picture's out of focus. Look. That one makes her look fat. - These pictures don't make sense. - You're right. They're terrible. She didn't put these up. No one would. I don't understand. They're from this drawer. They're the discards. Someone was in here after she died Removed the real pictures, and replaced'em with these. - Why? - Maybe she was having an affair And he didn't want anyone to know. Dad was right. You're like a wizard. We make a pretty good team, Monk! Come on! Hey, we could be partners! - The Monk brothers. - Don't count on it. - You're going back to prison, rember? - Right. Yeah, I forgot. My enemy seemed immortal, more than a spider. It was every unknown terror in the world, every fear fused into one hideous night black horror. Still, whatever else had happened, my brain was a man's brain, my intelligence still a man's intelligence. An idea came to me. - Did I wake ya up? - No. It wasn't you. It was all the noise You were making. Sorry. This is a real treat for me. You know, I've been in the joint. It's lights out at 9:00. ""Paraguay""? You are obsessed, aren't you? Is thisthe incredible shrinking man? - Dad used to love this one. - He still does, I imagine. Have a seat. Make yourself at home. I knew sooner or later it would come charging down that web, skimming out blackly toward me. You have to do that now? Now we can relax. Popcorn? You put cinnamon on it? I do that too! Was he A good father? Look at us. What do you think? Was he terrible? Look at us. What do you think? We got robbed, brother. Are you still In touch with him? Not since I got busted. I mean He didn't even bail me out and didn't come to court. He really hasn't been the same since mom died. - Since who died? - Since mom died. Her hair. She dyed her hair. It used to be strawberry blonde. Your mother is dead? Who was that woman on the phone? I want an explanation, Jack, and I want the truth. - Okay which one do you want first? - Who is she? Your girlfriend. No Theresa? No. No, she's like a friend with benefits. Okay, brother. Half bro. Half bro. Leland. Leland, it's me. Listen, can you come over right away? Yes, it's extremely urgent. And, cap Bring your handcuffs. You can't do that! You can't send me back. - I'm your brother! - Half brother. Adrian, I know I'm sorry, I lied. I'm sorry. It won't It won't happen again. Hand to god. Put your hand down, and get dressed The Captain's on his way. Wait no! I'm on my knees! Your brother is in your kitchen, and he's on his knees. - Don't scuff up the floor. - You're making a big mistake! I already made a mistake when I agreed to take you in. Actually it was you who took me in. I was in trouble. I was scared. You know what it's hey, you know what it's like being scared. - You of all people! - Just stop talking! - Can you stop talking? - Okay. What is your problem? Are you allergic to the truth? Yes, that's I am, I am! That's it! I'm a cheat, I'm a liar, okay? That's who I am. I am as god made me. But I am not a killer! Wait, wait! Hang on! I didn't kill Lindsey Bishop, and you know that. Now, if I go back to prison, they know I did it, I am dead? You send me back there, you'd be killing your own brother. Half brother. Can you live with that? I live with worse. And stop saying you're family. It doesn't mean anything, especially from you. No, now Shiv is gonna be after me. - I'm sure he is. - Wait, Adrian, Adrian Hey, whatever happens You'll always be my My big brother. What the hell is goin'on? Are you okay? Yeah. Sorry, it was a false alarm. - False alarm. - Yeah. I thought I heard a prowler, and it was just Jack. I forgot he was staying here. Wait. You forgot that you had a houseguest? You? Are you crying? Yeah, a little. I mean How would you feel if your pen pal thought you were a prowler? Okay. I'm going home. If I can get back in bed in 20 minutes, there's a chance I won't remember any of this. The prisoner you were asking about, the cellmate? Shiv Logan? Yeah. You better start knockin'on a different door, because they just now found him dead in the prison rec room. He was stabbed in the neck with a Shiv. Guy should have picked a different nickname. Well, you kids have fun. Nighty night. Hypothetically Let's say somebody was a fugitive from the law And they needed help and they came to you. A fugitive. Like the man who escaped from Bayside correctional? - The one who murdered that woman? - Okay, let's say, hypothetically That it's not hypothetical. He's in my apartment. He's been there for two days. It's my half brother Jack. He's the fugitive. He's been using a fake name. - Did he kill that woman? - No! I don't think he did. But he did escape from Jail. He's guilty of that. But he's going back as soon as I clear his name. All I ever wanted, since I was a boy, was a real family. I used to pray for it. I hate to break the news to you, Adrian, but you already have a real family. In a lot of ways, your situation is typical. I've seen it quite often. There's a four-state dragnet out on my brother. You get that a lot? Now, th-these are fundamental questions. People have been asking them for ages, all the way back to Cain and Abel. ""What do I owe my family? What do I owe my brother? What is my obligation?"" See, sometimes he's not really so bad. Last night, we were watching this old horror movie and talking about our dad and Paraguay - And I was feeling. - Paraguay? Yeah, he's obsessed with Paraguay. He's been reading all about it what? I've been doing some workshops in local prisons, and Paraguay is considered the promised land. Really? Because of their new extradition laws. They won't extradite anyone. Unless he's been indicted for murder. Yeah, you remember. I bought that album. You know that most of that money didn't even go to the children of Africa? But most of this money goes directly to the orphans. It's like only 2% goes to marketing. Which is probably why I never heard of it. Exactly. That's why they call it a word of mouth charity. - Well, I wish I could give you more. - Bless your heart. So I make it out to you? Yeah. It's like a Weird Canadian tax thing. I don't even understand it. Where is he? Liar. You'rea liar! You were never going back to prison. You were going to paraguay. That's why you came to me! You couldn't leave until I cleared your name. - Okay, look, Adrian, I swear. - Just admit it, Jack! Just can you please. Just once. Just for the novelty of it. Wait, I don't understand. He's your pen pal, right? He's my half brother. - He's Jack, Jr. - My god! Jack? Aka Joe Endicott. The fugitive? Oh, my god! So, my god! You killed that woman? No, he's not a killer, but he's practically everything else. - God! I want my check back. - What? What is that? He said he's building an orphanage in Quebec. You know what, I am relieved that this happened. I really am. Let's talk about this. No more BS. No more lies, okay? - Hand to god. - God doesn't wanna see your hand. What is that? What? That watch. I've seen it before. In lindsey bishop's apartment. You stole that watch! They haven't even buried her yet, and you're wearing her watch? - Oh, my god! - Okay, first off, wasn't her watch. So it doesn't count. It's a guy's watch, okay? Here, look. Take it back. It's not even my style. You are the most selfish human being on the planet. You don't care about anyone or anything. - Is he okay? - He just solved the case. Why don't you hang back here? - When were you going to tell me? - What year is it? Natalie, I was harboring a fugitive. I was trying to keep you out of it. Yeah but see, we're partners. You're supposed to trust me. I couldn't trust him. That was the problem. I still don't. Mr. Reese. - My name is Adrian Monk. - I remember you. The consultant. That's right. You remember my assistant Natalie, and, Jack, my pen pal. Yeah, the pen pal. What can I do for you? Well, we think that Lindsey Bishop had a fornication partner. We found this wristwatch in her apartment. - A fornication partner? - Yeah, it's, it's a man's watch, and it's engraved: ""IB. To DR."" It's not mine. Must be a dozen DRS working at the prison. - Only three, actually. - So you got two more to go. Did you ever see Miss Bishop outside of work? No, ma'am, I did not. I have a wife and kid, and i'm trying to hang on to both. How do you know this fornication partner even works at the prison? - We assumed because. - That's that's a good point. We should keep looking. Well, that's it, I guess. Sorry to bother you. Thanks again. He's the guy. Just keep walking. Don't look back. Were there two other names on the No, the spoon in his hand was Sterling Silver. Has the same lettering as the one that killed Lindsey Bishop. - Are you sure? - I'm 80% sure he's the guy. I'm 95% sure! - Oh, god! - Are you okay? - Where's your cell phone? - In my purse. - Thank god! - Which is in the car. Hey, that's my gun! What? Yeah. No, I borrowed it. And be glad I did. Will somebody please tell me what's going on? Reese and Lindsey Bishop were having an affair. They were the fornicators! - Things must have gone bad. - Maybe she threatened to tell his wife. - All we know for sure - god! Is he wanted her gone. It was a setup from the beginning. He was going to kill his mistress and make it look like an inmate did it during an escape. He went to Shiv. It was perfect choice. The guy's a real moron. It worked, Sheev took the bait. Reese told Shiv. How to go, where to go, and most importantly, when to go. It had to be monday night, at 3:00. That night, he killed Lindsey Bishop in the parking lot, then he reported for duty. He took his position in the guard tower and waited. He expected Shiv to be escaping any minute. He didn't know Jack Monk, Jr. Had other plans. It wasn't exactly how Reese planned it, but he didn't care. One patsy's as good as another. - I'm out! - Oh, god. Oh, god, oh, god! He stopped. He stopped. Did you get him? I don't know. - Hold on. - No, Mr. Monk, what are you doing? Quick, go, go! We have to get to my purse! Don't go. I'll go. - No, I'll go! You stay! I wanna do it! - Are you sure? You were wrong about me, brother! Throw me the keys! - Keys. - Oh, god, oh, god! Sorry. He made it! Thank god! He's going! Where's he going? Paraguay. The most beautiful women in the world. Oh, my god! - No, what do we do? - Okay. Okay. - I'm gonna count to three. - Okay. Yes, okay. On three You come up with a great idea. Paraguay Is that way. Beautiful women. Good deal, thank you. That was the DA. He says that Reese is awake and pourin'his heart out. We got him on Lindsey Bishop and Shiv Logan. What about Jack? Well, he did escape, so they're gonna add a little time to his sentence. He wanted to say goodbye. - Figured he was family, right? - Yeah. He's He's family. It was almost worth it hearing you say that. Hey, Bayside correctional is only like an hour away. Maybe you could come out sometime. Yeah, I could do that. Maybe monday. All right, Jack, time to go. Listen, I just wanted to say i'm proud of what you did. And I'm proud - You're my brother. - You mean half brother. I'm rounding up. Excuse me. Sneak in here a minute. Sorry. Thank you. What are you looking for? Think I left my handcuff keys in my other coat."
"What happened, are you okay? What's wrong? I stepped on something. It crackled when I stepped on it. Then it sort of smooshed. Then there was this tiny pop. What is it? What is it? - You mean what was it? Do something. Do something! - All right. I'm taking off your shoe, I'll wipe it off. No, just throw it away. - I'm not going to throw it away. Throw it. Did you see that? - See what? God, are you okay? - What are you doing, Natalie? Well, he might need help. - No, he's fine. I can see it from here. None of our business. Okay, come back here. I command you. Are you okay? - What about me? I must've hit a pothole. - What about me? Are those yours? Are those yours? That's my bolt cutters. I just came from work. They're nice. - Here. Hate this chain. They always fall off. Here, you just snap it back on. Thanks a lot. - There you go. Glad I could help. - I'm lucky you came along. Be careful of the potholes. Hey, somebody stop that guy! Don't let him go! Lady, don't let him go! What did you do? - I Hey, somebody stop that guy! He stole my bike! = 711 = - "" Mr. Monk on Wheels "" VO : ¤AkaZab¤ Subs-Addicts"" [Sub-way. fr.] I feel terrible about what happened. I didn't know he was stealing the bike. Nobody got hurt, that's the main thing. What is all this? - It's a research lab. Agricultural engineering. Dean, Dean Berry founded betavegatech five years ago. So what exactly do you do? - We're saving the world. Good for you. I was getting a little worried about the world. Is that a square tomato?! Yes, it is. It's a pet project of Dean's. The square shape means that farmers can pack 35% more tomatoes per carton. It's cheaper. More efficient. - So that means every slice is exactly the same size? How does it taste? - Who cares? It's a square tomato! You're doing the lord's work. - Literally. Dean? Mr. Berry, I just wanted to say I'm sorry about the bike. We're testing new corn seed. Their genetically engineered to sprout in 20 min. - More or less. What you're seeing is going to revolutionize the agriculture industry as you know - Congratulations on the square tomato. Do you want one? You could take one home. What's our time? - 17:30. Germination complete. That is our best time yet. And that, boys and girls, is how you feed 4 billion people. We're in business. Call our investors. Tell them to bring their checkbooks. I'll set it up for friday. Dean, this is Adrian Monk. And, you remember Natalie Teeger? Yes, of course. The woman who stole my bike. No, I didn't steal your bike. - No, you're right. Aided and abetted. I believe that that is the term. I'm sorry, I have to lock these up. Do you mind turning around? It's just that if somebody else sees this combination, I have to memorize a new one. And I don't want to waste the gray cells. Mr. Berry, look, I want to buy you a new bike. So if you just tell me the make and the model number, i'm happy to do that. That's very kind of you, ms. Teeger. But that's not a bike that can be replaced. It was a gift from a non-profit environmental group, in recognition of my work here. Had my name engraved on it, custom seat, cool lock, eco-friendly hemp basket Okay. Then we'll track it down for you. I promise you. I give you my word that I will find that bike. Mr. Monk here is probably the best detective on the planet. He is? - Yes, sir. And I know lots of other detectives too. San Francisco Police Department. What's going on? You all right? Yeah, we're fine. You said it was an emergency. - Somebody stole his bike. And? - Rode away. And? - Didn't come back. And? Okay, we're all cued up. - Hey, when you have a second I have an idea for a new vegetable. We don't really solicit ideas. It's a hollowed out cumber, with french dressing already inside. You want to know what I call it? - No, I don't. Okay, there he is. And that's me. And this is where she didn't listen to me. What are you saying right there? - I said, ""nice bolt cutters."" ""Nice bolt cutters."" - So what do you think? Well, I think it's clearly a job for the bike squad. I'll radio that in. It's a 487. - I didn't know there was a bike squad. Yeah, we got helicopters. About 800 guys will fan out all around the city. Fine. I'll just do it myself. I can't find it myself, mr. Monk. I don't even know where to begin. Natalie, look at this thing. We've got nature on the run. Finally. Look at that. Look! It's the perfect sandwich! Perfect! There's no overlap. There's no waste. Four 90 degree angles. This will virtually eliminate indigestion. Are you going to help me, or not? You can taste the symmetry! - Please! I can't run around looking for a stolen bicycle. I still have some pride left. Not much. But my dignity tank isn't completely empty. Please, Mr. Monk. You are so brilliant. It wouldn't take you more than a couple of hours. Look, I promised him. It can count as my birthday gift. I didn't plan on buying you a birthday gift. All right. I'm cashing in my chips. What chips? - My karma chips. I've been collecting karma chips every week, every day, every time I do something stupid for you. It's your job. You're paid. Semi-regularly. Yeah, I'm not talking about my job. I'm talking about all the other stuff. I've been babysitting you for five years. I've collected, like, a thousand chips. And I'm cashing them all in. I'm all in. You have to help me find the bike. You'll love this. You'll love it. Yeah, what about him? - No. See he's too tall. You're guy was only 5'71/2"" How do you know? - You're 5'5"". You were wearing 11/2"" heels. And he was one inch taller than you. See. See, you're brilliant. What are you doing here? Triple homicide on a pier? Not exactly. - We're looking for a stolen bicycle. Kidding, right? - Natalie had chips. What about him? You're right. John kuramoto. Two convictions. Auto theft? Why is he stealing bikes? Please tell me this isn't it. Yeah, 322. This is it. Am I going to need a tetanus shot after this? Probably not. Mr. Monk, look, the bolt cutters. Yeah, you're right. Those are nice. Maybe he's riding his bike. I don't see it. He's right in there. I can see him. Playing video games, eating junk food. What are we doing here? - The right thing. Open up It's encyclopedia brown. Sally and I want our blue bike back, and the name of your decorator. You're not in trouble. Nobody's going to press charges. We just want the bike. All right, just do it again. Oh, my god, mr. Monk! Oh, my god, mr. Monk! Help! Help! Mr. Monk, it's me. It's Natalie. How are you feeling? My leg! My legs! They don't match! - I know. I know they don't, mr. Monk. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I feel just terrible. Good. - I talked to the surgeon. And guess what? You have 100 stitches. An even 100. I thought that was nice of him. And, I brought you some new clothes, so you don't have to worry about that. Daisies. Thank you. I can watch them die. And they can do the same for me. Mr. Monk, don't talk like that. You're going to be just fine. Somebody's up. Hello, good evening. I'm doctor Levinson. And you are a very lucky man. Yeah. Is she talking to me? A few inches over, the bullet would have severed your femoral artery. I'd say that's lucky. - You know who I think is lucky? Everybody else in this room. The unshot people. The great unshot. The lead-free. Bulletless. - When can I take him home? Maybe tomorrow if he's up to it. Are you a fighter, mr. Monk? The kid. Kuramoto did they get him? No, he got away. He went out the back door. Looks like he took the bike. It wasn't in the house. The bike. Oh, my god! That stupid bike. What bike? That's why we were there. We were looking for a stolen bike. Shooting someone over a bicycle? What's the world coming to? Mr. Monk, they're going to get him. The captain, and Randy, and every cop in the city are looking for this guy. And the captain, I've never seen him so mad. And that's saying a lot. I'm sorry. You don't know where he is? You were staying at his house, Vince. I'm just crashing at his place for a couple days. He's just my cousin. You know where all your cousins are? Where do you think he is, Vince? I don't know. Tough guy. Look at this. See that? That's a bullet. That's a bullet that got dug out of our very dear friend's leg tonight. That makes your cousin a former cop shooter. Former what? - Former cop shooter. You mean he used to shoot cops? No, he shot someone who used to be a cop. Why didn't you say that? - D I did. It's the same thing. It's not the same thing. For god's sake, what are you two married, or what? I mean look, it's not complicated, Vince. If you know where your cousin is, and you're not telling us, that makes you an accessory after the fact. Aiding and abetting. - For attempted murder. Which is a very, very long good-bye. Let me put it this way, your parole officer he hasn't been born yet. Look You don't know John. You know, he's not a bad guy. Somebody offered him, you know, money to steal a bicycle. Who? I don't know. He met someone at a bar. That's all I know. Someone paid him to steal that bike? - Yeah, $3,000. For a bicycle? Wipe. Wipe. Wipe. Wipe! - Why don't I push? Where do you want to go? Over by that wall. Just planning on staring at it for a couple of weeks. You know what? How about right here? Right in front of this bright, sunny window. Told you to forget about that stupid bike. You never listen to me. Mr. Monk, you're right. I'm so sorry. This is one of the worst weeks of my life. Not exactly a banner week for me either. Let's look on the bright side. - Okay. You go first. The doctor said it was only going to be three weeks. That's not bad. And Your shoes won't get dirty or wet. That's your bright side? My shoes won't get wet? That's not exactly blindingly bright, is it? It's more like a little I bet you're hungry. How about some lunch? How about a BLT? And not just any ol'BLT. I'm going to make you a bl-square-t. No, thank you. You know what I am in the mood for? What? Just tell me. Anything. Some chips. - Chips. Karma chips. I love them. Just a big bowl of karma chips. And guacamole. Mr. Monk, believe me. You have all the chips. You have the whole bank, okay? I talked to Julie. I told her i'm going to be staying here with you tonight, maybe all weekend. And you can forget about paying me overtime. I'll just take the regular salary. - That's right. It's payday, isn't it? I wasn't bringing it up because it's payday. I'm saying you don't have to pay - I'm sorry. My checkbook is up there. On the top shelf. I can't seem to reach it. Hey, How's our patient? You look great. Nice wheels. Does that thing have a motor? I'm the motor. I just feel terrible. This is all my fault. Hey, don't beat yourself up. Let her finish. What were you saying? How sorry I was. That it? - How bad I feel. We got the forensics back on that bullet. It was a 22 caliber. And get this. We picked up Kuramoto's cousin. He says it wasn't random. Kuramoto was after that particular bike. You're kidding. Somebody paid him three grand to boost it. $3,000? Natalie, you got a good look at it. Was there anything unusual about that bike? Like what? - Solid gold basket? No, I don't think it had a solid gold basket. Maybe the frame was hollow and had something inside it. Drugs or cash. That's what I was thinking. I think we need to go talk to Dr. Berry again. We're on our way to his house right now. You want to come? I don't think so. You're going to hang out here feeling sorry for yourself? And complain to Natalie? - That's the plan. Hey, What are you doing?! - Change of plans. Change of plans? What happened to my plan? New plan. Are your hands clean? - Yes, my hands are clean. Come on. Upsy-daisy. - All right, easy now. That's too fast. You're going too fast. This is too fast? - Easy. Okay just step away. I can do it myself. Step away. I can do it. - All right. All right. - I'll do it. I can't do it myself. I can't. Come on. Up you come. - All right, easy now. Okay, one Ready. - Okay! What, what? I can do it! I'll do it. Let me do it. I'll do it. I can't do it. I can't do it myself. Help m Come here. There you go. I can't find the release on this thing. It's the red latch on the handle. - This one? On the handle. The other one. - The red handle. Okay, see? Pull it, pull it. - Just step on the thing. You got to unlock it. Grab that side. Pull. Pull. Just push it down. There you go. - All right. I got you. I got you. Here we go. - Here we go. Easy. - The solar panel. Must be ""off the grid."" - Go slow. Slow. Easy, easy. Slow. Okay, and up. - Easy. I'll get it. Here we go. On three. Easy. - One, two, three. Hang on. God! God, that All right. - Nobody's home. Sorry. I do have one suggestion. Just a thought. Next time we go somewhere Call ahead first. Easy, easy. Go easy. - Easy! I thought you guys were joking about the bike squad. I like that car. - Look at that. Who is it? - Look at that thing. What kind of gas mileage do you get with this? Mileage? I haven't worried about mileage in years. This is aerodynamically perfect. Built-in solar panels. This is the future on wheels. What happened to you? Had chips. We were looking for your stolen bike, and Mr. Monk got shot. Man. What is happening to us? The family of man, we're hurting each other, we're stealing from each other. Family of man's starting to sound like a real family. You know what I'm going to do for you? I am going to adopt ten acres of Brazilian rain forest in your name. - Thank you. I don't have to visit it, do i? Or or water it? Or think about it? Professor Berry Somebody paid that young man to steal your bicycle. Apparently they paid him a lot of money. You're kidding. - We were hoping you could tell us why. Was there anything unusual about your bike? Like what? - A gold basket. Or Or what? - Or anything else. Could some could somethin have been hidden inside the frame? I can't imagine it. The frame was filled with polycarbonate honeycomb for better stability. I understand the bike was a gift? It was. From the visionary project. - I've never heard of them. Neither had I until the bike arrived. Sarah Longson, my assistant, wheeled it in with a big bow, and a very, very complimentary letter. Do you still have the letter? - I shredded it. Repulped it. Recycled it. - Of course you did. That's okay, we can figure out who they are if they do exist. I don't understand. It doesn't make any sense. Well, one thing's for sure, it makes a lot of sense to somebody. Over here. - You scared me. Were you followed? It's cool, it's cool. I did what you said. I took two buses. Sorry about that cop. Okay, I I didn't have a choice. I got two strikes against me already. I couldn't take another hit. Of course, it couldn't be helped. It was him or you, right? It's payday. There's a little extra in there. Travel expenses. You shot a cop. You're going to have to disappear for a while. I don't see a problem with that. If you're ever in Mexico, look me up. You have something for me? Right here. And the gun you shot Adrian Monk with? You better give it to me. It's the only evidence they have against us. I'll get rid of it. Thanks. - So I guess this is good-bye. Couldn't have said it better myself. Sorry, sorry. - Wait, wait, wait. Careful! - Sorry. Well, what are you It's over there. What are you doing? Just easy, would you? Please slow down. I'm sorry. Sorry Mrs. Corren. What are you apologizing to her for? Did you get her shot too? Oh, god. I'm sorry, I'm just you know what? Hold I'm just tired, mr. Monk. I was up all night building that ramp for your back door. Well the ramp was your idea. - I know, and I'm happy to do it. It's just that I haven't been home in three days. And I haven't seen my daughter. I understand. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Really? - Sure. I can make my own dinner. I'll just eat whatever's on the bottom shelf. You know, whatever I can reach. Whatever's in the crisper. Then I'll just hop around for a while, and drag myself into bed. You go have fun. - I'll stay. It's up to you. - How are you? Are you okay? I've been better. - Not you. How are you? I'm fine. We're fine. Just getting a workout with my arms. Is it the guy? - Yes, sir. John Kuramoto, the mystery bike thief. Couple cemetery workers found him about an hour ago. Pretty convenient place to catch it. We found the shell. 32 caliber. Probably from the same gun they used on you. I can't believe he's dead. What is it about that bike? We talked to the visionary project too. They never heard of dean berry. And they never sent anyone a bike. To the left. A little more slowly. Slowly. A little more. That's too far. Back to the right. Slowly, slowly, slowly that's too much! Too much! Why don't you just turn your neck? - Because this the way I want to do it. Keep going to the right. Wait, wait. Okay, wait, Right there. It's a tire track. - Is that from the bike? No, it's not a bike. It was wider. - Was it a car? I can't tell. There's more over there. And some over there. It keeps changing direction. You know? I don't know if I can maybe. I don't is that Is that one right there? Oh, my god, Mr. Monk are you okay? - What did you do? I didn't do anything. - Help me up! Wait, wait. No, wait. I have a better idea. As long I'm down here, would just shovel some dirt over me. Get it over with. Natalie, take a break. - Are you sure? I got him. We'll meet you back at the car. Come here. Come on. There we go. All right. Yeah, we'll take a photograph. Do you got a minute? Do I have a min? I'm in a wheelchair. - Look I know that this is tough, but this is tough on Natalie too. You see this guy here? That's the guy that shot you. The guy in the body bag. And you're madder at her than you are at him. She hasn't said anything. - Of course she hasn't said anything. She blames herself for what happened. She Look, I know you caught a bad break. I'm sorry you're in pain. Sorry you're miserable. Sorry, sorry. But you can't keep taking everything out on her. Listen, detective Monk Be very careful, because you're that close from losing that girl. Ask me how I know. How do you know? - Because you're acting like me. Oh, god. Natalie, do you resent me? Don't be silly. You were shot in the leg. You're seriously injured. That's what I thought. The captain is concerned about you. He doesn't understand our relationship. Pothole! Pothole. - Sorry. Sorry. Where to next? - Let me see. Okay, we have to go up to the mountain view deli. And back down to the valley pharmacy. And then back up to the hilltop dry cleaner. Do you think we could combine the mountain view deli and the hilltop cleaners? Just before we do the valley thing, so we're not going up, and down, and - I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I can't go on. I can't go on like this. I can't keep on apologizing. I'm sorry, I haven't slept in three days. I'm going broke. Your insurance wouldn't cover the wheelchair. I had to rent it myself. Just let me finish, okay? I didn't shoot you, Mr. Monk. You have to forgive people. Say you forgive me. Three little words, that's all I need. Just three little words and it'll just release me. - Natalie, we're braked. You're right, I just got to pick it up. I don't need a break. I don't need a break. Is that it? - Yes, sir. ""For professor Dean Berry in deepest appreciation."" That's the bike. And it was in the dumpster? Yes, sir. We downloaded this unit at approximately 14:30 this afternoon. I read about the stolen bike in the paper, and the officer that was shot over it. I like to read the police blotter. Is that a fact? - I think it's my civic duty. You see, I like to think of the sanitation department as being the eyes and the ears of the city. Captain, this is Ronnie O'dell. He's been very helpful. - Sounds like it. So the bike was just sitting there on top? No sir. It was buried. It was on or beneath, what we like to call the ""nadir,"" see, which is very important to us. Because we know when this unit was last emptied. Which means that we can pinpoint the day, and even approximate the time when the bike was discarded. Which was? - 3:30. Monday afternoon. About 20 minutes after it was stolen. The bike rack is about a 1/2 mile away. So what, the guy steals the bike, he rides a couple of blocks, and then throws it away? Yes, sir. - Apparently. He didn't want the bike. After all of this. What the hell's going on? - We don't know, sir. Frankly, the lieutenant and I We're stymied. We found the basket. Randy, get it over with. Tell me now. Is the basket made of gold? No, it's a basic basket. The he've been through this whole truck, only thing we can't find Is the bell, the cable, and the lock. Wait a second. What do you got? Good, you found the bell. Thank you. You can stop ringing the bell now. - I don't understand. I do not understand. It's not working. I don't understand. Oh, god. Does this look green? - Sorry. What happened? What went wrong? What is missing? These compounds are identical. I checked them twice. I wish I could stay and help, but I'm leaving in ten minutes. My china trip, rember? I forgot. The yangtze river awaits. I'm being so selfish. Of course. I want you to go. And I want you to have fun. Don't worry about me. Oh, my god. You found it! Mr. Berry, I've been waiting all week all week to say this. Where was it? It was in some dumpster up the street. I tried to clean it as best as I could. You didn't need to do that. I owe you an apology. In fact, I owe an apology to the entire family of man. This is just what the doctor ordered. Good. - Especially after today. We had some investors here, and, the seeds didn't work. I'm so sorry. It's still a little dirty right there. - That's okay. But i, you know - God, it's in good shape. It looks like i'm not the only one with a new set of wheels! We had a little accident. With the other wheelchair. She tried to kill me. - So we upgraded. This dang thing is stuck now. Here. - All right. I can do it. Let me do it. I am not a Let me do it. - All right. Natalie, now Look what you made me do. Mr. Monk. Is there a kill switch on that? Stop it! Help, help. Stop it! God. Oh, god. Here you go. - You're okay. You're okay. God. Watch it, watch it. You're hurting me. Do something, no She's fainted down. This goes on. Look what you've done. This death trap is worse than the other death trap. Sorry, Mr. Monk. Are you all right? Is Mr. Monk okay? This girl is dehydrated. Has she not had a steady intake of fluids? I don't know. - Has she been sleeping? I don't know. - Does she eat? Well, I think I don't know. Stay right here. I'm going to get you some juice and some vitamins. Okay, thanks. - You're going to be fine. Dear god. What have I done? Wipe? I've been a fool. I've been a Jerk. I'm so sorry. Here, go like this. Go like this. What are you doing? Those are chips. I'm giving them all back to you. I'm sorry. Leland was right. I have been taking everything out on you. I'm sorry. - Thank you, Mr. Monk. See, was that so hard? - It was pretty hard. Here, drink this. I want you to take three of these, twice a day. It's my personal formula. You're going to be fine. - Thank you. Mr. Monk, we should go. They've had a bad day. Their super seed didn't sprout. We'll be fine. It's back to the drawing board. Back To the gene splicer. Thank you again, for the bike. Just don't leave it unlocked. - It was locked. They never found the lock. - Pardon me? The lock that came with your bike They found the basket, and the bell, but they never found the lock. What did it look like? - The lock? It was kind of a high-tech thing, with a a keypad. Like that one? - Yeah, as a matter of fact. And you could set your own combination? That's right. Eight digits. Are you going somewhere? As a matter of fact, I am. China. For three weeks. Professor berry, I can tell you why your experiment failed today, it was sabotaged. And she did it. You must be joking! You hired John Kuramoto to steal that bike. But it was never really about the bike, was it? You wanted the lock. Here's what happened Those genetically altered seeds were worth a fortune. You could sell them to anyone. Your friends in China, for instance. All you need was the combination. Your plan was simple. You showed up with a new bike, you said it was a gift. It was an ordinary bike, but the lock was something special. You had designed it yourself. It had an eight digit combination. You knew your boss. You knew he'd never memorize a whole new set of numbers. If somebody else sees this combination, I have to memorize a new one, and I don't want to waste the grey cells. She was right. I used the same combination. - Most people do. It's human nature. I use the same password for everything. Kuramoto stole the bike, and more importantly, the lock. That night, you went to work. All you had to do was retrieve the new combination. As you predicted, he had use the same numbers for both. You replaced the genetically altered seeds with a few ordinary ones. You knew you'd be long gone by the time anybody suspected anything. Dean, who is this guy? I don't have to listen to this. You can't prove any of it. - It's true. We'll never find those seeds now. You had five days to hide them. But we can prove that you killed Mr. Kuramoto. Are those your sandals? They're quite unusual. They're made from recycled tires. They're eco-friendly. They may be eco, but they're not friendly. I've seen those tread marks before. In the cemetery, near Kuramoto's body. I thought they were tire tracks. Sarah, tell me the truth. Did you do this? My eyes! I'm fine. Get her! Get her, don't let her get away. I'm fine. Hold on! Don't move. Just stop! Put it down. Put it down. Don't move, I swear to god. I swear to god i'll shoot. Hang on! - It's okay, Mr. Monk. It's all over. I did it! For the love of god. Wipe. You're awake. Yes, Mr. Monk. I'm right here. Chips. - I know, Mr. Monk. Chips. - Mr. Monk, you have all the chips. Chips. - Yes. Mr Monk, I understand every chip there is. Look, on the bright side, these two legs match."

You're supposed to be asleep by now. -= 712 =- "" Mr. Monk and the Lady Next Door "" VO :   ¤Aka & YaYa¤ Subs-Addicts"" [Sub-way. fr.] You like my hair. Yeah. I like your new haircut.

What are you after? I mean You're up to something. You want a day off, is that it? You want tomorrow off. No, maybe I like you. Maybe I'm just being nice. Isn't that possible? You're up to something. You know what? I take it back. I think your haircut looks terrible, okay? Jeez, Mr. Monk, you know? I'm just being nice. There isn't always a catch. All right, the light is broken. I think we should just go. No, it says, ""don't walk."" But we been here for 10 min. The light's broken. It says, ""don't walk."" All right, how about this? You stay here I'm gonna go pick up our checks. - I'll be back in ten minutes. - How about this? We don't do what you said, we both wait here, and we give it a little more time. What are you doing? Are you insane?! It says, ""don't walk. ""What is your problem? Mr. Monk, there's no traffic. There are no cars. Are you coming? All right. You stay here. I'll be back. Morning. - Is that thing broken again? - I don't know. That light is always breaking down. I've called the traffic bureau about it twice. They don't listen to me. To them, I'm just a crazy old coot.

Come on. There. Now, wasn't that fun? Can I carry your bag? Well, sure. I thank you. Sign here. And here. Okay, that's it. All paid up. All right. There he is. You made it. I heard you had a little disagreement with a ""don't walk"" sign? But here you are. I knew you could do it. - Actually, I had a little help. - Hey, don't tell me. Little old lady took you by the arm and helped you across the street. She's not that little. That's her over there. That's Marge. - How perfect is that? - You know her? Know her? Monk, every cop in the precinct knows her. They wish they didn't. She's here all the time complaing. He does it every single night. Boom I mean, loud. You could hear it five blocks away. We've warned him twice. See, he's already been cited. Well, but what am I supposed to do? I can't sleep. I can't read. It never ends. He has a court date. November 17th. If you can wait until then, maybe the judge will issue an injunction. Hi. Hi again. It's Adrian Monk, remember me? - Sure. - Yeah, what's going on? Disturbing the peace. It's no big deal. It's a big deal to me. You know, it's my peace he's disturbing. Yeah, it's her peace. It's a big deal to her. We're talking about my next-door neighbor, mr. Keyes. He bought a set of drums two weeks ago, and I haven't slept in ten days. I'm just desperate and I can't get anybody to do anything about it. I was just explaing to Ms. Johnson here that the department has other priorities. Well, maybe the department does, but I don't. Okay, if. If this happens again, call the dispatcher and have him forward the call to me, Adrian Monk. - I'll take care of it. - Really? - Sure. - Thank you. No, it. You are such a good boy. Yeah, you are. I can tell by your eyes. I can tell a lot of things about people. - I am I am a good boy. - You are. You want a piece of Candy? - Yeah. No. I don't. Okay. - Take it. Excuse me. Is that absolutely necessary? - Is what necessary? - Removing the body. I'm Miles Franklin. I'm the curator here. As you can see, this is a world-record Museum. So I gathered. There was already one victim on the swordfish. That was already pretty impressive. You understand, this is like a godsend for us. We pray for things like this. Sir, the that's a human being. He had a name. - He had a family. - We pray for things like this. This'll be bigger than those twins on the motorcycles. Would you go stand over there, please? What is that? Is that Candy? Where did you get that? A friend. - What friend? - I made a friend. It could happen. It's that lady, isn't it? That sweet old lady, Marge. She gave you Candy! That is so cute. - You're eating her Candy. - That's enough about the Candy. Doesn't look like a Robbery. There was 250 bucks in the cash register. He didn't touch it. What about the exhibits? Anything missing? We haven't done a full inventory yet, but I haven't noticed anything. - Where's togo? - Where's who? Togo the egg-eating robot. He was right here. He's right. I don't know how I missed that. Togo's been here for years. It's a mechanical display. Good work, Randy. How did you know it was missing? I come here every year on my birthday. Kind of like a family tradition. When you were a kid. You meant when you were a kid. Say, ""yes,"" Randy. All right, so they broke in, they killed a security guard, and stole an egg-eating robot. Yeah, could the machine possibly be involved? What'd you say? Well, in science fiction, they sometimes come alive. They become sentient. If this were a movie, you'd believe me. If this were a movie, I could walk out, Randy. What have you got? Tire tracks. - That's hydraulic fluid. - Togo was dripping. Get a sample of this. - We know we're looking for one guy. - How do you figure? Well, if it were two or more, they would have just carried it out. This guy brought in a hand truck, and this sign looks like new. No nicks or scratches. Didn't you say this display has been here for years? We had to replace that plaque. About two months ago, some nut from berkeley spray-painted all over it. He says that he broke the world record and it should be him in the museum. A jealous egg-eater. God help us, we have a motive. Yes, he is. Hold on one minute. It's Marge. Adrian, this is Marge. I'm sorry to bother you, honey, but you did say I could call you anytime. - Is that you? I can barely hear you. - That's him again! That's my neighbor, I tell you I don't know what to do. He's just driving me crazy. I am at my wit's end. I wonder if you could keep it down. You're disturbing the neighbors. I'm practicing. I'm a musician. I understand, but it's so loud. And you've been playing all day, and really? I get it. The crone from next door sent you. She's not a crone. But what are you, her favorite nephew? Look, you tell your auntie that i'm an artist and I'm expressing myself. What, if if Picasso was living next door to her, - would she be complaing about him? - I'm not her nephew. I'm with police. - More or less. - More or less? - Okay what? - No, I was gonna take a break anyway. Okay, then. Well, have a nice quiet day. He stopped? What on earth did you say to him? I told him you were a friend of mine and, he got the message. Just like that, Well, I'm impressed. You're a regular John Wayne. Except, you know, he needed a gun. Anyway, i'm glad I could help. And, don't reckon he'll be bothering you again. - Guess I'll have Natalie pick me up. - Where are you going? I mean, I guess you have to go someplace. Not really. Good, good. Come on in, then. You just have to stay here and tell me all about it. I bet you're hungry, right? Boys are always hungry. - Did you have anything to eat today? - I had that peppermint you gave me. That's not real food. I mean, food. - I don't want to impose. - I was just making lunch. - I love your house. - Do you? Did you grow up in a place like this? I I grew up wishing it was a place like this. Is this you? I always wanted to write a cookbook. Of course, I let it go till I was 65, and then you know what my sister said? She said, ""you can't write a cookbook at 65. Besides, nobody cooks anymore anyway."" She said, ""you're 65. You retire."" So you two aren't close? Well, she means well. - A piano. Do you play? - Just one song. Greensleeves. - My husband theo taught it to me. - I'd love to hear it. Well, that's very sweet of you. But I only play it once a year. On his birthday. - When did he pass? - 12 years ago. By the calendar, 12 years. In here, of course, the day before yesterday. You had a child. - I only see the one photograph. - We lost him, too. Paulie. His name was Paulie. He was just three years old. He'd be about your age. He would. This enough. Time goes on. I know. And it keeps going on. It's relentless. Come on. Let's eat. - What are you doing? - I just thought You haven't even washed your hands. Were you brought up in a barn? - What's so funny? - I forgot to wash my hands. I'm i'm usually pretty good about that kind of stuff. - And use soap. - Yes, ma'am. What does a police consultant do, actually? Well, I do what any regular detective does except I'm not really on the team. - Really? That doesn't sound fair. - They have their reasons. I'm gonna write'em a letter about it. - No, Marge. You don't have to do that. - No, no, I don't worry. I am just gonna tell everybody what a help you were to me with that buddy rich neighbor of mine. - What are you doing? - I'm just separating my No, these are mixed vegetables. They're supposed to be mixed like this, see? You just mix'em all together and then you eat'em all together. You can see I really slaved over this luncheon. So eat. So what do you think that your next project is going to be? Think it's gonna be something important? Well, it's interesting, actually. Somebody killed a security guard last night. Killed him? I haven't figured it out yet. It happened at the guinness Museum. The only thing that was missing was one display a mechanical man. It was, it was a robot, actually. A robot? - An egg-eating robot. - Oh, my word. It's just one insane thing after another, now, isn't it? - Yes, ma'am. - Don't play with your food, honey. Did I write'em? I'm not denying it. But I never hurt anybody. I'm not a maniac. I'm a competitive eater. - Professional. - He's an athlete. - You see all these trophies? - Yes, ma'am, look This isn't a magazine interview. There was a murder last night. A security guard was killed and the man who killed him stole the togo exhibit. You called Mr. Togo a ""sham,"" a ""disgrace,"" and a ""charlatan."" Which he is. It's not slander if it's true. When togo broke that record, he was in Malaysia. The eggs are smaller there. - They're like 12 centimeters. - Everybody knows that. Right. The eggs are smaller in Malaysia. Look, in february, in broad daylight, you defaced the plaque in front of the togo exhibit. I didn't deface it, I mean, I I corrected it. The fact is, my husband is the true world champion. He beat that record two years ago in Mexico city. He ate 54 eggs in six minutes. - No kidding. - Don't touch that. But the guinness people didn't recognize it. They said that the last three weren't down. They were down long enough. Well, I'm sorry I missed that. Mr. Kasinsky, where were you last night between 9:00 and 10:00 pm? Last night we were at the chicken meister. - The chicken meister. - It's a restaurant on Vinton. - They've got an all-you-can-eat buffet. - Or so they claim. - Did you pay with a credit card? - No, but they'll remember me. - They'll remember him. - Take my word for it. - Well, we'll check it out. - Okay, go check it out. Look, it wasn't me, okay? I mean, i'm not angry anymore. I'm past that. I'm gonna compete again. Two weeks. Boston. This time there's gonna be no wondering who the top dog is. It's gonna be right here. He has been training all year. He's up to 80 eggs in six minutes. Really? You don't believe me? Well, I'm sure you're very talented, but, Evan, get the eggs. We'll do this right now. You can be my witnesses, which is perfect, 'cause you're cops. They have to believe you. Good boy. Well, that's one. That was my breakfast. That doesn't count. Here we go. - Are you ready? - Are you ready? - I don't think so. - Not you. Three. Four. Five. Ten. Come in, in through your nose. Come on. That's 20. Right on tempo. Oh my god. I wouldn't do that. Move! - Stones in the bag. - Sure, no problem. Anything you want. And the Diamonds and the Emeralds, too. From there. How'd you know about them? - Come on, just do it now! - John? What are you doing? This is probably all for the best. I can't breathe in this thing anyway. Take everything. Take it all, John. I swear I won't tell anyone. You got that right. Doesn't this look better? - They're not even. - They don't have to be even. It's so warm and cozy. Now you don't have to shout all the way across your room - just to talk to your friends. - Right. What what friends are those? You have friends. And if you didn't before, you do now. Hello! Sorry I'm late. - Good morning. - You look snazzy. I like that outfit. Well, thank you. And Mr. Monk, is that new? It's handmade. She made it. This is gonna keep him warm on those stakeouts. A stakeout scarf. T's lovely. So, what are you doing? Rearranging the living room was Marge's idea. I case, you know, I make a friend. Marge, how did you do it? I've been trying to get him to move these chairs for years! Mr. Monk, I got you the windex and the vacuum cleaner bags you need. Already done. Marge and I went shopping last night and - cleaned the whole place this morning. - Okay, then. Then I'll just make you some breakfast. No, I already ate. Marge made these amazing cranberry nut muffins. Her own recipe from her cookbook. - She writes cookbooks. - Really? They were delicious. I ate the whole batch. And get this they weren't just square like yours. These muffins were cubed. Cube muffin. Like a cube shape. Cube, basically. Honey, are you hungry? I could make you something to eat easily. No, thank you. I ate with Julie, my daughter. She was up a little early. She has a cold. And you're not even there with her. What kind of a boss are you? You go home. Take care of your family. No, I couldn't. I couldn't leave Mr. Monk. Go ahead. I'll be fine. - Really? Marge is here. - I'm fine. We'll come over later and bring you some of my - world-famous tomato soup. - Really? We can always call you if something really horrible happens. Like if another crazy robot disappears. Always with the jokes, Marge. Then. I'm leaving. - Are you sure? - We're fine, right? - I'm leaving. I am taking the day off. - So go! - Okay, I'm really leaving. - See you later. I am at the front door. I have got something for you. I don't want to forget. What what is it? I cut this out of the local paper this morning. ""Contribution of expert consultants such as Adrian Monk."" You're famous. Not famous so much as acclaimed, I think. Mr. Modest. Do you have a a scrapbook? - Well, I'll make one for you. - What? You know, you're an important person, you should have a scrapbook. Sorry to interrupt Whatever it is you're doing. We have been looking for you all morning. - I've been here all day. - Not you. Actually, we've been looking for Marge. - Me? - Yes, ma'am. Do you have a minute? Well, certainly. Certainly. Come in, sit down. Come on in. Sit down. Yep. - What'd you do? You move the furniture? - Yeah, I kind of like it. It's cozy. - I like the scarf. - It's, A mother's touch. I don't understand. Has something happened? A Jewelry store was robbed last night, and the manager, a man named David Elliot, was shot and killed, so we really do need to talk to you. You surely don't think I had anything to do with that. No, ma'am. Of course not. But we do have a pretty good idea of who it was. - It was a man named John Keyes. - That's my neighbor! Yes, ma'am, turns out Mr. Keyes worked at that Jewelry store. He was fired last summer for stealing a necklace. And he has a record. Burglary and assault. - So how does he look? - So we brought him in. He looks good to me. He smells like the guy. But But he has an alibi. He says he was home. That at 10:30, at the time of the Robbery, he was playing his drum set. And it does check out. According to our phone log, you called the station at 10:35 pm. - To complain about the noise. - Yes I did. I didn't want to bother you again, you know. Sit up, darling. - Ms. Johnson. - Marge. Marge, this is very important. Now, are you sure Are you positive that you heard Mr. Keyes at 10:30 playing his drum kit last night? I not only heard it, I saw him. The light was on and I could look right through the window at him. It you know, it was definitely him. Square one. Thank you. Come on. - They liked the, - This is great. - A stakeout scarf? - She knits! She cooks! She writes! She's an amazing person. - She sounds like it. - Oh, my god. I'm gonna bring her to work with me later. The captain said I could bring her along. This woman has become very important to you. Well, I think it's wonderful. It's what we call a ""transformative relationship."" That's exactly what it is. I have been transformed. I feel like I've found a piece of myself I didn't even know was missing. Look look. She she writes me these little notes. Puts 'em in my pockets. ""Adrian, I am so happy you are in my life. Love, Marge."" My other mother only left me one note ever, in my whole life. I found it in my lunchbox. It said, ""your father is driving me crazy."" - Your other mother? - Excuse me? You just called your real mother your ""other mother."" You're right. Sorry. Wait a minute. No, I'm not. I'm not sorry. Why should I be sorry? Marge is a better mother to me than the woman who raised me. She supports me. She she's proud of me. - She loves you. - She loves me. Unconditionally. It doesn't get better than that. - No, It does not. - You're a lucky man. - Talk to me. Come on. - What's the catch? With what? With Marge. What do you suppose she's after? Are Adrian Every time somebody wants to be my friend, it turns out they're after something. - They have an angle. - No, not necessarily. How could somebody How could anybody love me unconditionally? I mean, come on. You've met me. Adrian, I know you've been burned in the past, but you have to trust people. - See, there's not always a catch. - Then how do you explain this? There's always a catch. He's so serious when he works, isn't he? Yes, ma'am. I think he's looking for the clue. Yes, ma'am, he is. I think he found one. - We're making a scrapbook. - Really? Can't wait to see that. - The body was where? - Behind the desk. We figured the killer came in the door here. Two rounds, 45 caliber. - I'm sorry, honey. - Excuse me. So the victim, David Elliot, was working here for about a year. Found this in the corner and about 1,000 fingerprints. Well, they won't be the shooter's. Look at that. Latex rubber. He wore gloves. That's wonderful. We can put that in our scrapbook. Excuse me. We're working here. All right. It looks like it's an inside job. Security tapes are missing, and the store gets re-supplied the first tuesday of every month. And that was yesterday, so he was plugged in somehow. We're putting together some names, going back ten years, everybody that's ever worked here. You don't have to go back ten years. The manager only worked here for a year. The killer wore a ski mask, Ergo, the killer was afraid he'd be recognized, Ergo, the killer must have worked here recently. ""Ergo"" the killer? What's that, hungarian? His name isn't ""Ergo,"" Randy. Excuse me, Marge. Don't touch that. This is a crime scene. I know, i'm sorry, honey. But this is amazing. You see this brooch? I have this brooch. My husband gave it to me on our 10th anniversary. It's in this picture. Here. Look. - Isn't that the same? - Yes, it is. Who is that? - That's my husband. - No. No. The other picture. This one. That's Paulie. That was taken just before his passing. He has a birthmark. I've seen it before. - On John Keyes. - Mr. Keyes? You're right. He has a a mole. Right on the same cheek as Paulie. - What do you know? - I'll tell you what I know. - John Keyes is your son. - What?! No, it makes perfect sense. They've been in it together, planning it together from the very beginning. Here's what happened They knew that once they robbed this store, John would be the number one suspect. He needed an airtight alibi. That's where you came in. Adrian, you're scaring me. Your son got himself a phony ID. And rented the house next door. Then you started complaing about his drumming. You were the perfect alibi. Who would ever question the little old lady who lived next door? And I was your perfect patsy. You befriended me, you led me on, you made e love you - so that I would vouch for you. - Buddy, are you sure about this? Adrian, I I hardly know the man. He's a neighbor. He's your son. - No, he's my neighbor. - He's your son. - He's my neighbor. - He's your neighbor and your son. If that is, in fact, your name. Let's try this again. Where are the Jewels? - I don't know. - Tell me where they are. I'll talk to the DA. Maybe he'll cut you a deal. - Why are you doing this? - ""Why are you doing this?"" Look, your son is just down the hall. Stottlemeyer and Disher are with him now. It's just a question of which one of you talks first. Don't you call that man my son. My son is dead, and you know it. Lying liar! You're worse than my own mother. At least she never pretended to love me. And by the way, your stupid scarf itches. Not now! Not now. I'll tell you something else Your kitchen smells. Okay, your whole house smells. It smells like mold. And for the record, I was onto your little act from the very beginning. I was acting, too. John Keyes just made bail. He went home. His mother picked him up. His real mother. All right, thank you. That was Randy. He's at the department of records. He said they're not related at all. She lost her son just like she said. - So there really was no - There was no catch. - What do I say? - Just speak from your heart. Here, here, here. Any other ideas? Quick! Anything? It's me. I am so - Sorry. - Sorry. I i'm sorry for - Everything. - Everything. I accused you of things, and I said things I thought there was a catch. Whenever something not horrific happens to me, I don't trust it. And I I brought you these. Just Put them there. Can we just go back to what we had, Marge? I have no son. Again. ""Speak from your heart""? What kind of advice is that? Just give her a little time, Mr. Monk. She'll Miss you eventually. - She'll come around. - But why? What would she Miss about me? My accusing her of murder, dragging her to the police station, and interrogating her? For the love of god, what is wrong with me? Are you really asking, or is that a rhetorical? Rhetorical. Is this Keyes'house? What is it? Call the captain. Where's Randy? He's on his way. He's meeting us here. - What have you got? - Take a look. - Hydraulic fluid. Just like - Just like the museum. All right. So what are we looking for? We're looking for this. What is it? It's the egg-eating robot from the Museum. - He re-dressed it. - It's his alibi. Here's what happened I mean, here's what really happened. When Keyes started playing drums a few weeks ago, he wanted the neighbors to complain. That was the key to the whole plan. Last night, the machine must have been on a timer. It kicked on at 10:30 while Keyes was across town robbing the Jewelry store. Officer. It's Marge Johnson. He's doing it again. Marge didn't see anybody drumming last night. What she saw was a machine. Very clever, mr. Monk. I'll take that gun, captain. Hey, Keyes, you don't want to do this. You don't want to kill a cop. - Or a ex-cop. - Or a ex-cop's assistant. You, blondie. Gimme your car keys. Come on! You're not gonna need'em. All right. Down on your knees. Do it! Captain, get down! Togo! Down, now! Now! Now! Move! Togo, drop it! Togo, no! I knew it. I knew it. He's sentient. He's alive! You guys okay? Science fiction, They were in it together. Him and the, robot. Well, that explains almost nothing. You did what you had to do, lieutenant. Be careful with that, will you, please? That was a gift from my husband. - Marge, we heard you were leaving. - It's because of me, isn't it? No, Adrian. Please don't think that. I have a sister in Seattle. We're gonna buy a townhouse together. - Your sister? - She's lonely, too. We're just gonna try to be a little less lonely. Listen, Marge, I just want to explain The things I said I'm sorry, too. Now, let's just forget it. Wait. It's a mighty cold world out there, Adrian. - You stay warm. - Yes, ma'am. Just rember. You're a pirate. Yes, ma'am. - Good-bye, Natalie. - Bye, Marge. Thank you. - Pirate? - It's more fun to be a pirate. That's good advice. Come on, boss. I'll make you some lunch. - What are we having? - Chicken pot pie with a little Jolly Roger flag on top and a bottle of rum. - You don't have to beat it to death. - Shiver me timbers, you look hungry - How is that funny? - It's funny."
"Oh, my god, David Gitelson! David, David, over here! We're goin'all the way! All the way to the championship! - Kill the Wildcats! - You can bet on that! What time is it? Don't ask me. I don't even know what day it is. What's this I am sitting on? I told you, I came straight from practice. ""Classified."" - What are you, a spy? - That is top secret. You can't touch this Unless you're wearing one of these. - Mr. Gitelson, are we going home? - No, I wanna go to the other club, to the after-party. Let's do it. Let's do it! To the after-party. Hey, it's me. I got the playbook. Yep, lookin'at it right now. Listen, we gotta move fast. We got one hour to do this. Don't worry about that. Just have the money ready. It's all there. You know, normally i'd say good luck. But you're not gonna need it now. - What's going on? - What the hell'd you do? Did you sell me out? What are you talking about? No, don't lie to me, man. You know what? I'm callin'the cops. - You gonna call the police on me? - Listen, you could cost me the game! Get up! Get up right now, 'cause i'm gonna call the police The Condors have been there. Those guys have all been to the playoffs. The cats are gonna choke. Richardson's the best running back in the league. - I heard richardson was hurt. - Yeah, he tweaked his knee! Mr. Monk said something very interesting today about the game. - No, I didn't. I didn't say anything. - Yes, you did. What was it again? It's just that I saw a photo the team in a newspaper, and it was kind of interesting. And I noticed that, if you added up all their uniform numbers, it adds up to 1,000. Exactly 1,000. Anybody else notice that? That's gotta be a good omen, right? I didn't say it was a good omen. Hey, everybody's comin'on sunday. I got a brand-new 52-inch plasma Tv. We're gonna fire up the grill, watch the Condors kick butt. Printed out some directions. Here ya go. Wait. What about Mr. Monk? Sure. Sorry, I didn't think - Here you go. - Thank you. Wait, no, wait. You're talking about this sunday? I can't make it, sorry. I'm, i'm gonna be at Summit stadium. Wait a minute. You're gonna be at the stadium? - Why? You going to the game? - Since when? I have to go. I promised Bob. You know, Costas. - You know Bob Costas? - I didn't mention that? I helped him out of a little Jam about ten years ago. I never mentioned this? - Bob Costas? No. - Yeah. Anyway He, he sent me this ticket, and I promised I might show up. It's not even a good seat. It's I have to sit in a box. - Sit in a box. - A press box. A press box with Bob Costas. Look at this. An all-access pass in here. You can go into the locker room with that. Why would I want to go in the locker room? Hang on. Oh, my goodness. - Monk, there are two tickets here. - Yeah. Who you gonna take? Can I talk to you for one second? Don't worry I'm not gonna charge you for the ticket. Here you go. Mr. Monk, you should take the captain. He really wants to go. It'll be fun, you and Leland at the big game, hangin'out, couple of guys. You'll have some male bonding time. I think I'd be more comfortable having male bonding time with you. He's gonna want to go in the locker room. Thank you. I'm coming over to the next. - We're goin'all the way! - Yeah, you better believe it! Come on, right here. Help yourself! Don't mind if I do, brother. That's right, Condors! There you are. Pretty sweet? Who are all these people, and where are their parents? It's a tailgate party, Monk. People get here early, and they start to party and they get all pumped up for the game. But they're they're not actually playing in the game. It doesn't make any sense if you think about it. The trick is not to think about it. You just gotta turn your mind off. - You do have an off switch, right? - I don't think so. Well, here. You can borrow mine. - Beer. Nature's off switch. - No, thanks. I think I'll pass. Hey! Look at this guy. Pace yourself, buddy. It isn't even kickoff yet! Yeah. Get a job. Hippie. 'Scuse me, sir. Could I ask you a question? - I'm taking a little survey. - Of course. Do you have Condor fever? - I do now. Thank you. - Because we've got the fever! Hey, Natalie, yeah. Listen, I can't talk right now. I'm watching the game. No. No, no, it's just me. Yeah. No, it's great. It's better than being there. Can I talk to you later? Think I'm watchin'the game. Hey, pops! Ya feelin'it? I said are you feeling it?! Yeah, I'm feelin'it. I'm feelin'it. Feelin'it? I'm feelin'it! Did you enjoy civilization, Leland? I sure did. It was a hell of a run. Championship game! Great seats. Perfect weather. - It doesn't get any better than this. - You said it! Tickets. - This is better than sex. - Well, what isn't? Tickets. Tickets. Tickets. This will just take a minute. I wanna thank you in advance for your patience. What'd you do? You sealed the envelope? Almost, almost there. All right, let's fire up the grill! For god's sake, Monk, it's almost kick-off time. Just tear it open. Gimme that. - Easy with that stuff. - All right, all right, you big baby. - You're like a child. - I'm not I'm not a child. Why don't you just take someone else? I know you want to. Come here. I don't wanna take anybody else, Monk, okay? I'm here with you. I'm having fun with you. Here we go. You're gonna have a great time. What was that? - What was that? - I don't know. Give him the tickets. No, really, we should. We should go check that out. - Don't you think? - We should check what out? So the playoffs get under way at Summit stadium. It's the Wildcats and the Condors. The Condors heavily favored, and you can see why. That pass combination of Dick blaylock to scott sidell You're a lucky man. If you were standing any closer, you might have been killed. - Better get you to a hospital. - No, no, not today, pal! I've never missed a Condors game in my life! How's this for a bandage? Good as new. Better than new! I guess I'm done here. What was that? That was the opening kickoff. We're officially missing the game. Why am I not surprised? Monk, what are you doing? With the hands what It's just a charcoal grill. It doesn't make any sense. Why would it just explode? Monk, it makes perfect sense. These things blow up all the time. First off, the kid was plastered. He dumps a half a gallon of lighter fluid on the son of a bitch, dropped a match, and kaboom! First play of the game, and we're already behind. That's not lighter fluid. Good, good. Good field position. That's gasoline. You son of a bitch. - I didn't do it. - Well, at least quit smiling. Man, this is better than the grill. This is authentic. This is how the pioneers used to eat. Cap? - What? - We're on duty. I'm not on duty. - This is a horror show! - Defense is killin'us, man. - They gotta get landau outta there! - They don't have anyone else. Gitelson didn't show up today. They were just talkin'about it. - He's MIA. Nobody knows where he's at. - What hell is goin'on? Our backup quarterback doesn't even show up. No, no, wait! Davy Gitelson. He's definitely here. I saw him this morning. I asked him for his autograph. He blew me off. - I think it was him. - 'Scuse me. It's chet, right? We're the police, wondering if we could ask couple of questions about the fire. - Sure. - I found this Condors water bottle. Yes, that's absolutely correct. There was some gasoline in it. See? Did you notice anybody tampering with your grill? I figured. It's no big mystery. Everybody knows who did it. - They do? - Yeah, this guy named Cory something. He drives up from lA, him and his moron loser friends. Legally, we can't stop him from parkin'here. Believe me, we checked. Why would they wanna sabotage your grill? That's a good question. I'll tell you why. Because the Wildcats suck! You're goin'down, losers, down! Wildcats suck! We're wildcat fans, Monk. It's a big rivalry. Two years ago, they put a bag of bees in my car. Yeah, then his mom spat on my mom. Then we flipped his RV. God, I love football! - I told you it was just a fan. - I just wanna make sure. I wish we had some lab equipment. We could dust for prints. You know what I wish? I wish there was two of me so one of me could be out here wasting my life with you, the other one could be in there watching the football game with bob costas. We come in peace. - Lookin'for a fellow named Cory? - 'Scuse me. - Can we help you? - Yes, sir, I hope so. We're with the San Francisco police department. We're investigating an arson fire that took place over in section That can't be a real badge? Pardon me? No self-respecting police department in America would let Leland ""hound dog"" Stottlemeyer carry a loaded weapon! Butterman! Cory butterman! Fred! Fred! These are my buddies from high school! This is How you doin'? - What happened to you? - What? You move up here, suddenly you're a Condor fan? I haven't lived in Los Angeles for 30 years, and as far as I'm concerned, lA. Still doesn't have a football team. You ugly, dumb son of a bitch! This man is a friend of mine. You wanna make fun of him, you have to make fun of me first. Monk, they're just fooling. It's okay. They're just. It's just guy talk. Yeah, I know. I know. That's what I was doing. I was that's what I was doing. What is up with those yellow teeth? Don't you know how to brush? And you hey. The moon called It wants all its craters back. From your skin. 'cause you got bad skin. So, hey, what's going on? You guys married? Oh, yeah, man. Read 'em and weep. The party's over. - What about you, man? - He was married, and he got divorced. And then his last girlfriend Got arrested for murder. Right, you ugly, dumb, sad, lonely Stupid, sad son of a Right? - Are you really a cop? - Yeah. Can you take care of this? - I mean, for old time's sake. - What, a speeding ticket? Hey, that. That's 2:40 pm. Today. That's only That's only 35 minutes ago. Yeah, well, I'll see what I can do. So, what's all this about a fire? If it was my kids, i'll kill'em. They've been butting heads with these Condor fans for years. Actually, this ticket means that you and your boys are off the hook. It happened before you got here, so - this is what we call an alibi. - In that case, let's play some ball! Let's see if you still got that Stottlemeyer touch! Hike it up, hike it up, hike it up! Go long! Go long, long, long, long! Still got it Stottlemeyer touch. Go, Condors. Somebody order some pizza? Out of bounds. That's out of bounds. God, you're blind! - What's the score? - Down by 9. - Wait no, 6. - Can you hold this? Pizza! Condors heavily favored, and you can see why. That passing combination of dick blaylock to scott sidell Is that blood? Yeah. It's from the evidence room, so don't touch it. I won't touch it. Disturbing. Thank you. I wish we had bendy straws. I can't believe I used to run with those guys. We all got suspended one time. We had this new vice principal. The important thing is, though, that they have an alibi. Speeding ticket, right? Jesus, Monk, you back on that? Give it a rest! No, I think we should pack up that grill. It was just a prank. Yeah, but what if it wasn't? You heard the paramedic. That guy could have been killed. No, something is goin'on here. Feels more like attempted murder. You want this to be attempted murder! You do. Yeah, admit it! You need this to be a real case, because that's all you know. Snoopin'around, sniffin'around. Maybe you're right about the grill. You probably are. But it can wait. It can wait. We can lock the scene down. Nobody's goin'anywhere. Tickets here. Who needs two, who needs two? Hey, isn't that illegal? That's illegal. It's a football game, Monk! Come on, use the off switch. Everybody has an off switch, right? He's probably selling them for twice what they're worth. Maybe not. All right, Leland, wait. Wait a second! All right, look You're right. Maybe I am overthinking it. I always do. Let's just lock down the scene, and then we'll go to the game. The off switch? Click. Click. Changed your mind? A woman's prerogative. - Press box, level three. - Press box, level three! Two tickets to paradise, buddy. That ring - What? - This ring. - Yeah, that's the championship ring. - Yeah, the ring. They won last year. See that? See the stripes? - On the band. - What about 'em? What? What? Hey, that's a real ring. This must be the player they were talking about, - the one who didn't show up. - David Gitelson, number 18. Captain, he's cold. - Hey, was that really Davy Gitelson? - Yes, sir. Didn't you say you were talking to him this morning, - and you asked him for an autograph? - I did? I don't think so! There goes your star witness. Backup quarterback? They're not gonna say anything till after the game. - That makes sense. - So what do you think? - Drug deal or steroids? - I don't know. Maybe. Here, look at this. He was sittin'on it. - The playbook! - Playbook? Every player gets one. The whole game plan's in here. - Keep an eye on that. - Yeah, captain, this is Sean Metzger, David Gitelson's personal driver. He was the last person to see Gitelson alive. Like I told the lieutenant, I dropped him off this morning, just like any game day. He went into the stadium, and that was it. I never saw him again. Did he say anything? Did he seem worried about anything? No, sir, he was excited, up for the game. You have a You have a smudge there. - What happened there? - What happened? I don't know. Do you rember every little smudge you ever got on your clothing? Yes, I do. - I had a beer. Is that a crime? - No. No, it isn't. Is that it? Can I go? This whole thing is Kinda freaking me out. I'd like to get home and try to shake it off. Sure, you can go, but make sure the lieutenant knows where you are. - Why are you letting him go? - Because, I can't hold him. He's just a witness. That was a charcoal smudge on his jacket and - the smell of gasoline on his lapel. - You're still on the grill. What grill? Somebody's barbecue grill caught fire right before kickoff. - So what does have to do with Gitelson? - Good question. I think somehow they're connected. Okay, look. It's your day off. There's nothing more you can do here. You two go and enjoy the game. I'll take care of this. - Really? - Turns out it's not our case anyway. Chief Brenner just called, and he's sending a squad down. I'm supposed to stick around and bring him up to speed. Did you hear that? It's not our case. Let's go. Enjoy the game! Tell bob costas Randy Disher says hi. Does he know you? Well, then, wouldn't that just confuse him? Only one way to find out. Come on. - Let's go. - Go, Condors! - Hell. - I'm sorry, I I can't do it. Of course you can. What happened to the off switch? - Come on, clickety-click, click. - It's not working. - For the love of god. - I think we should talk to that guy again, that chet walsh with the funny foamy finger. Remember? He had this big, foamy finger. - I know who you mean, Monk. - He said he saw Gitelson this morning! Look, Monk It's out of our jurisdiction. It's not our case. We'll just be in the way okay? Come on, every good cop knows you can't be in it 24/7. Even god took a day off. And what day did he take off? It was sunday. Why did he take off sunday? I tell you why sunday. So he could watch football! Come on! You used to be a fun guy. - I don't think so. - Yeah. No, I remember. I remember the time when you graduated, right? We stole that rowboat, you, me, and trudy. And the lake patrol stopped us, and you started speaking spanish. Now, that was funny! That was funny! Where's that guy? Trudy died. Yes, Trudy died, but you didn't die. You're alive. Alive is a funny word. Could I have my ticket, please? Wait a second. 'cause I'm goin'in there with or without you. Hey, what's your problem? Move the car! Move it, I'm trying to get out! It's called reverse. You can't Miss it. It's a big ""R""! - You again. - Yes, sir. Me again. You're missing the game. Maybe the real game is out here in the parking lot. Have you been siphoning gas? From my own car? Why would I do that? - I don't know. You tell me. - No. - You tell me. - No you tell me. I don't know what you're talkin'about? They said I could leave, so I'm leaving. We had an explosion here today. The guy was burned. Name was chet walsh. - Never heard of him. - Football Jersey. Big Condors fan. Drunk, yelling all the time. It's a tailgate party. You're describing everybody here. I'm pretty sure you know this guy 'cause you tried to kill him about an hour ago. - Why would I do that? - I don't know. You don't know much, do you? Would you move away from the car, please? I'm going home. Sean Metzger! You can try and leave this stadium. You can drive away But you're not really going anywhere. The wheels of justice may turn slowly, but Sooner or later They always Wind up What was the question again? You said you were here about 6:30 this morning. You saw Davy Gitelson coming through that door Right. And you asked him for an autograph, but he ignored you. - Right. - Right. You said he was upset about something. Right! He kept repeating something over and over. Right! What was he yelling? - Chet! - Out of order! ""It's out of order."" That's what he kept sayin'. - What was out of order? - I don't know! Musta been somethin'! Something. That's a big help. Thank you. It's not the phone. Something is out of order. It's out of order. Must be inside. It's an all-access pass. Come on. Dude! You're like my best friend. You wanna hear something sad? You're my best friend too. So the Wildcats take yet another time out, and with the score still tied, we'll be back right after this. - So he was murdered? - Yeah. I still can't believe it! You know, these things happen every day. Yeah, but it's heartbreaking. Where's Adrian? He's outside. He's workin'the case. He can't give it up. That's just like him. The monomaniacal Mr. Monk. - Did he ever tell you how we met? - No, not really. He mentioned something about a demented cat salesman. No, that's not it exactly. There's a distinction here, and it's really. It's fascinating. The cat salesman was not demented. He sold demented cats. No, no, but really, understand. He had a siamese who was manic-depressive. He had a paranoid persian. The guy tried to sell me a calico kitten who was completely psychotic evil! I mean, it tried to kill me. The kitten tried to kill me. Okay, nice game though? It's a great game. He had a burmese. Multiple personalities. One of which was a dog. That's how weird it was. I'm not really a cat person. Well, it's. These are the facts. I'm just tellin'ya. - This one works? - They all work. So what was out of order? I don't know. It's like a mystery. This is chet! What are they offering? Don't kid yourself. 55 million means 70 million. We don't counter till they hit the number. I'll call ya later. Who are you? Hedge fund manager. But not today. All right, here's the snap. Wildcats blitzing. And it's picked off again! That's the third Condor turnover. The defensive coordinator of the Wildcats, Brian Binsack, has been one step ahead of the Condors all game long. It's almost as if he's reading their minds. You know, with head coach Kent Mcfarland scheduled to retire at the end of the year for the Wildcats, I'd say the way things are going, binsack is a shoe in to get the job. I got it! I know who killed Davy Gitelson. It wasn't a vending machine. I can't help but wonder what we're talkin'about. Something was out of order, right? But it wasn't any machine. It was the playbook. The team playbook! I remember now. I saw the book. Some of the pages were mixed up. Here's what happened. His limo driver, sean Metzger, was in a perfect position to steal the Condors'playbook. He probably only had a few minutes. He made a quick copy, and at some point, the pages must have gotten mixed up. He sold the xeroxed copy to that coach from the Wildcats. He made a few bucks. He probably thought that was the end of it. But this morning, after he got dropped off, Gitelson realized something was wrong. It's out of order! It's all out of order! What? Will you sign that? No, look, i'm looking for somebody. He figured out what happened. He went looking for the driver. - Did you sell me out? - What are you talking about? You gonna call the police on me? The fight must have escalated. Metzger panicked. But the gates had already opened. Fans were just starting to show up. Metger was racing the clock, he was improvising. He had to hide the body in plain sight. That's why Metzger was trying to kill you. He saw you two talking. He thought you knew too much. Hedge fund manager. Yeah, that makes sense. - What do we do now, call the cops? - No. There's not enough time. If he destroys that playbook, we don't have a case. It's probably in the locker room. What? Well, this morning, the Condors were favored by 12, but the wildcat defense has played a nearly flawless first two quarters of football, and as we send you back to the studio for the halftime show, it's all tied up 10 to 10. Monk'd love that? All right, everybody settle down! Settle down! Eyes up front. That was a good first half. But we have a long way to go. The key is to maintain control. Stay focused. They're gonna try to change some things up on us in the second half. Look for the triple option Out of the wishbone formation. Triple option? Coach, I haven't seen that since college. Well, you're gonna see it today you count on it. Probably on their first possession. All right, dante, take us home. Okay, guys, let's take a knee. Lord, let your light continue to shine on this team today. Give us the wisdom and the strength to accept whatever fortune befalls this team today. Give us the power to devour the other team. Give us the strength and the discipline to remain calm in all hard times. Help us dominate the other side, lord. Give us the power to just totally annihilate the other team. - Amen. - Amen. - Hey, that's our playbook! - No, no, this is not your playbook! This is stolen property. I'm a former police officer. Here's the thing - Wildcats suck! - Security, get that playbook! Security! Get that book! - Yeah. - I gotta go. - Now? It's only halftime. - Yeah, I know. You've been great. - Thank you. - No problem. But my best friend, great guy, an amazing guy, I left him downstairs alone, and he deserves better. Sure. Understand. Is he with Monk? Security! Get that book! Get him! Get the book! Is the game over? Who won? We did. Back at Summit stadium, where the Condors have come from behind and defeated the Wildcats 27-24 in one of the greatest playoff games ever. Meanwhile, there was plenty of drama away from the field, and here to tell us about it is captain Leland Stottlemeyer of the San Francisco police along with former detective. Captain, we just saw the defensive coach of the Wildcats led away from the stadium in handcuffs. - What can you tell us? - Well, Mr. Binsack has been arrested and charged with receipt of stolen property. And, I can also tell you that Davy Gitelson's personal driver has also been arrested in marin county. Bob. Well, I'd say from the standpoint of law enforcement, you and Mr. Monk are the MVPS today. You know, for those who don't know, Adrian Monk is a legend in San Francisco, and on a personal note, a few years back, this man literally saved my life. No, I wouldn't say that. The truth. How can you say that? You were there! The cat tried to kill me! You weren't really in any danger. It was a little calico cat. It was about this big. Wait a minute you proved it. You solved the case. The cat planned the whole thing out. She was gonna kill me with that squeeze toy. Yeah the truth is I just wanted to get out of the house. Yeah. Look, I think we're done here. Bob, Cut to a commercial. I guess that does it. From summit stadium, again the final. The Condors 27, the Wildcats 24. I'm Bob Costas saying so long. And one last time The Cab was definitely trying to kill me. Dwight is right, it is better than being there."
"Right. That's great. No, I'm sure he'll be glad to see you. Okay, so what's the cross street? I do know where that is. Across from the wells fargo building. Great. 1:00. We'll see you there. No, thank you. Who was that? Remember how we were talking about karma? No, I don't. Remember when I said if you put good energy out into the world good things will come back. Well it worked. That was a real client with a real job. - The drought is over. - Great, great. So what's the case? He wouldn't say. We're gonna meet him tomorrow. His name is Roderick Brody. - I used to know someone. - No that's the guy. He said you went to school with him. - Roderick Brody. - Yeah, he said you were old friends. What's happening? - Hello, Roger. - Washing your hands again? - What is this the, tenth time today? - What a freak. You know, his hands are clean but his hair looks a little dirty. What do you think? And is that watch right? Oh, man, it's 2:25. - Swirly time. - No, not swirly time. Not again. Actually that watch is two minutes fast. - Go grab the door. - Roger, wait. How about this? I'll give you my bike for keeps and all my lunch money every day and I'll do your homework for the whole year. Okay. It's a deal. But first, swirly time. My hand hurts. Mr. Monk where is your oven mitt? Come here, come here, come you okay? What were you doing? He's back. -= 714 =- "" Mr. Monk and the Bully "" VO :   ¤Aka & YaYa¤ Subs-Addicts"" [Sub-way. fr.] - Thank you again for squeezing me in. - I'm happy to do it, Adrian. Just something I still don't understand. We already had an appointment for 3:00. You remember Roderick Brody? That's the bully from middle school who used to, you know. In the lavatory. Swirlies. They're called swirlies. He called yesterday. I'm supposed to meet with him this afternoon. What does he want? What do you think he wants? He wants to pick up where he left off. I don't think a 50-year-old man is calling you back after all this time just to - To give you another swirly. - You don't? - No, I don't. - Okay, look. Roderick Brody changed my life. Maybe as much as Trudy did. He ruined everything. It was childhood's end really. You know I had a Bully in school too. He would wait for me every morning outside the bicycle rack. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. You went to your father for advice and he told you to face upto the Bully and the Bully backed down. - Yes, more or less, yes. - What a wonderful anecdote. It'll give me something to think about at 1:00 - when my head is in the man's toilet. - Why don't you just cancel? - Just say you're busy. - Natalie won't let me! It's the first paying customer we've had in three weeks. Look, what I need is a note, okay? A note from you. Something I can show Natalie to get me out of this. - I'm not gonna write you a note. - You don't have to write it. It's already written. All you have to do is sign it. Adrian, this isn't gym class. Now you've been talking about this Roderick Brody since the first session. And as I recall, you're still having nightmares about him. I think this meeting today is a gift. - It's an opportunity. - Maybe you right. Let's sign the note. It's an opportunity to confront your deepest and most troubling fears. To finally resolve them. Put them all behind you. Not many people get this chance. I see your point. I never looked at it like that. - Can I have the note back? - Sure. Wait a you're not planning to forge my signature? God. Let's just hear what he has to say. If you're not comfortable, we'll leave. - I promise. - Really? - I'm not comfortable. - Come on. - Not comfortable. - Mr. Monk, we haven't even said hello. Wait. Wait. Okay wait!Okay, wait, wait. What is that? Is that a shower cap? Sometimes he'd let me wear one. Mr. Monk, I don't think we're gonna be needing that. And you must be Natalie. Marilyn Brody. Roderick is so looking forward to this. - I'm sure he is. - Come in. Please. What a beautiful home. Thank you. You are very sweet. Really, it's a work in progress. We're redoing all the bathrooms upstairs. Which reminds me I need to call the contractor. - We're having a party in three weeks. - Did you get married here? Yes, there was no reason to rent a big hall. I don't have much family. I was adopted. Just one aunt in Texas. She didn't even make it. Well I had a small wedding too. I think they're the best. He's obviously busy. So it's too bad we missed him. But we should go, Natalie. We missed him. No, you can't go. He's right upstairs. I'll tell him you're here. - It was so nice to meet you. - You too. She seems nice. How bad could her husband be? Doesn't always work like that. Eva Braun took in stray puppies for god's sake. At least we know his checks won't bounce. Look at that thing. That is hideous. God. He's warming up. Shower cap. - No. - Shower cap! Give it. You don't need it. Phil, shut up and listen, okay? It's not a complicated thing. It's not his money. It's my money. You tell him this. Screwing with me on this is a career decision. He'll get the message. Look at you. You haven't changed at all. You still got that germ thing? He was always afraid of touching people. Natalie Teeger, designated hand-shaker. We were just admiring your beautiful home. Yeah, gets the job done. If you don't mind my asking, is this an original? - Well it better be, what I paid for it. - Yeah, it's beautiful. Thanks, yeah. Marilyn picked it up on our honeymoon. It's porcelain. I don't gotta tell you about porcelain. Do i, swirly? It was a little nickname we had for him back in the day. Remember those shenanigans in the boys'room? Good times. I got a study back here. We can, talk in private? Shenanigans. Want a drink? Well I got plenty here if you change your mind. Listen, Adrian, I gotta be honest. I've heard stories. I heard you went a little crazy since we graduated. Now I just need to know, is it funny crazy or sad crazy? - Funny crazy. - Sad crazy. Excuse me. There's something that I have to say. ""You stole something from me. ""You stole my childhood. ""The boy that you tormented has grown ""into a broken man. ""I am now damaged goods. ""I will never recover from the wounds ""that you inflicted on me. ""I will never forget you. And I will never forgive you."" So it's sad crazy. No, I think Mr. Monk is talking about what you did to him in the seventh grade. You tortured him. Kids. What are you gonna do? Let's have a seat? I really appreciate your coming, Adrian. I know that Marilyn thinks this is about some union business at the landfill. But the fact is this is a personal matter. I need your help, Adrian. I hear you're a big shot detective now. No surprise there. I always knew you had it upstairs. This is hard for me. It's probably hard for any guy. I think Marilyn's been stepping out. - Really? - Yeah, I didn't believe it either. Me and Marilyn, we've always been, you know, rock solid. At least that's what I thought. Last week she told me she was going out of town with some girlfriends, but she never left. I saw her. - Well where was this? - Lafayette square two days ago. It was just a random thing. I was in a cab. There was a red light. And there she was Crossing the street. She was meeting someone. I could tell the way she was walking. The way she was dressed. It's been eating me up. I gotta know where was she going. - It's a good question. - Mr. Brody, I'm sorry. We don't take on matrimonial cases. We could give you the name of a private. Hold on, Natalie. I've known rod for years. Well He's one of my Oldest friends. I think we can make an exception. I'll take the case. What was that about? - She's cheating on him. - We don't know that. Of course we do. It has to be true. It's always true. And I get to tell him, Natalie. This is gonna kill him! - Mr. Monk, you can't enjoying this. - I am loving it. Look, it's a beautiful day. I think the sun's coming out. Oh, my god. This is better than a swirly. I win. Do you understand? After 40 years, i win. Okay, he said he lost track of her right here. Which way did she go? - That way. - I don't think so. She was wearing high heels. That's a cobblestone street and it's all uphill. So west? No, there's nothing between here and the pier. All right, well that leaves north or south. - That way. - Why that way? I feel Lucky! Isn't this a great case? Isn't this the best case ever? I've never seen you like this. I never knew revenge could be so sweet. And what makes it even sweeter? Give up? Roderick Brody is paying for it. He is footing the Bill for his own comeuppance. And that is the best kind of comeuppance there is. Excuse me, kind sir. Have you seen this woman? She's cheating on a guy who used to put my head in a toilet bowl. Mr. Monk, don't you feel bad even a little? I mean if you're right, this could destroy their marriage. You're the one who's always talking about karma. What goes around comes around. Isn't that what you said? - That isn't what I meant. - Of course it is. Of course it is. That looks promising. Come on. Hi, excuse me. Hi, we're looking for this woman. You a cop? - Just an old friend. - Haven't seen her. Maybe General Washington can refresh your memory. Is that a dollar? Okay, I get it. Who knows? Maybe there are Two General Washingtons. Where are you going? Where's he going? Got to admire the guy. He's incorruptible. She's right over there. - Oh, my god. It's true. - Oh, my god. This is going to kill him. - He's actually kind of cute. - Even better. All right, I get to tell him. That's the deal. I can't wait to see his face. What is that? Is that your camera? Where did you get that? - It was a birthday gift. - From who? Thomas Edison? It was from my nana. - Wait, is there actual film in it? - Of course there's film in it. I have three pictures left. There's not enough light. So - Is that a flash cube? - Bingo. Hold this. Hold it. What are you doing? It's an old private eye trick. Hold that. I'm gonna use it as a mirror. - Hurry up. Take the picture. Take it. - That way's too much. You like that soon? Sir, would you mind taking our picture? Madame, I would be honored. Thank you. Here you go. It's ready to go. I got the same model myself. A gift from my nana. Okay, sir, if you wouldn't mind standing right There. Okay, can you see us? - I gotcha. - Okay, if you could stand right there. Right? And on the count of three. One. Two. And three. Well you're right. His name is Douglas Fendle. - Do you know him? - Fendle? No. Are you sure? Young, strapping, good-looking guy. Viral. You don't know him? She met him at a bar on Vinton street, had a couple of drinks, and - he left first. - Yeah, the viral guy left first. We followed him to the Avalon hotel on Jackson place. - Roderick, I'm really sorry. - Yeah, we're really, really sorry. I don't see anything. Well that film expired about that's her. If you want to cry, go ahead. We understand. I can't see anything. This doesn't prove anything. You know it's her. Right? Because you saw her on the street. That's why you hired us. You know, to tell you the truth, I'm not so sure about that anymore. The woman I saw, maybe she wasn't Marilyn. My eyes aren't so great. - I could've been wrong. - No, no, no. You weren't wrong. It was her. I'm just, I'm not convinced. I need some real proof. You know last night was our anniversary and Marilyn surprised me. She bought us tickets. We're going on a cruise. Like a second honeymoon thing. I think we're in a good place. No, no. You're in a bad place. You're in heartbreak hotel. Look at the next one. - Is that a spoon? - Yeah, look closer. See the reflection? See, that's them. That's your wife. That's your beloved wife. This is killing you. - I don't see it. - No, it's eating you up. You know what? You're probably right. It the bar was dark. She was across the room. We probably have the wrong girl. - Mr. Monk, we made a mistake. - Zip it. Zip it. This is the worst day of your life, right? - Are you crying? - A little bit? Adrian, i'm still gonna pay you. If that's what you're worried about. What? The gun? Don't worry about that. I got a permit. We live in uncertain times. For your troubles. All right, how about this? I'll keep digging. I'll get a better camera. I'll get a digital computer camera. So there won't be any doubt. Adrian, I appreciate it. But just forget about it, all right? It's over. You're off the clock. Great. Great. Great. It took you long enough. Did you get it? Is it a good one? - Looks good. She looks happy with it. - Yes, she does. - And she's very hard to please. - Where's the telescope thing. It has a automatic zoom, so it's built-in. Built-in? Excellent. Mr. Monk, it's not heart surgery. If we leave right away, we can be at her house by 8:00. We can follow her all day. Yeah, look, Mr. Monk, I have to tell you something. I made a decision. If you want to keep following mrs. Brody, I suppose that's your right. Although it really isn't. - But I can't help you anymore. - Why not? I'm just not comfortable. Her husband fired us. It's what they call pro bono. No, pro bono is for lawyers. This is stalking. No, this is comeuppance. Pro bono comeuppance. No, that is just crazy talk. - It's not crazy talk. - Pro bono comeuppance? It's craziest talk there is. You heard what he said. He wants you to quit. I wanted him to quit! I begged him to quit 40 years ago in stall number three. Yes, he is right here. The avalon? Sure, we know it. We were just there. Wait, what's his name? - Oh, my god. - What happened? His name is Douglas J. Fendle. Or, rather it was Douglas J. Fendle. I guess still is. But doesn't matter. Let's move on. He was 37, unmarried, from Chicago. Mr. Fendle was an attorney. He worked at a small law firm. Shellman, Reznick, and Link. Mostly family Law. Wills, adoptions. - Hey, you okay? - Dynamite. Are you gonna, you know, take a look around? - Yeah, right. - Good. Look, I talked to his boss. She said he was on vacation. She didn't even know he was here. - Interesting. - According to the clerk, he checked in three days ago. Kept to himself. Housekeeping found the body this morning. Doctor tee puts the time of death at 8:00 or 9:00 pm last night. - He was stabbed three times. - Ouch. There was money still in his wallet, so it wasn't a Robbery. - Wasn't a Robbery. - Yeah, and there was no forced entry. He let the guy in. I think he knew him. I think he did too! - I think you're right. - Excuse me. Let me talk to you for a minute please. Do you think Roderick Brody did this? - Well he said he didn't believe us. - Apparently he reconsidered. - Well that's horrible. A man is dead. - Yeah, I know. And that's a murder in the first degree. And you know what that means? Prison Swirlies. Prison Swir. You don't even want to know about prison Swirlies. They're not even technically real swirlies. You were right about karma. It is fantastic. Thanks for coming. I was downstairs doing a little dumpster diving. Can't find the murder weapon. There's a steak knife missing from that service tray. I guess he took it with him. So, what do you What do you think? You okay? - Are you happy? - I love my work. Is that a crime? - I think they knew the guy. - Know wha - What? You know this guy? - Don't. Don't - Technically. - know him. - Never met him face-to-face. - Never formally introduced. Sort of. - We've been following him. - Right. You were following him? I wonder why. Well he was seeing a woman. A married woman. And - we were following her. - You were following the woman. - I wonder why. - Her husband hired us. Until you hear different, I wonder why? What? What are you doing? You're doing divorce work now? No, he was just doing a favor. He was an old friend of Mr. Monk's. Wouldn't exactly say he was a friend. More of an acquaintance actually. He beat me up every week for three years. And that would explain the stupid grin on your face. - You think you're getting even. - I know I'm getting even. So your pal, you told him about the affair. And you told him that Fendle was gonna be here. I think your pal just made the top of my to-do list. What's his name? Actually we can't tell you that. Technically he's a client so it's privileged information. We could contact a lawyer or a third party. B-R-O. That looks like an A. B-R-O-D-Y. - Roderick Brody. - Well let's go talk to him. Prison Swirlies. Didn't have to drag me down here. I could've talked to you at my office. Well I'm more comfortable here. I got my own coffee mug. I got the AC set just the way I like it. Yeah, well can I at least call my wife? We've already called her. She's on her way. So let's start at the beginning. You knew Mr. Monk from the neighborhood. You hired him to follow your wife. He told you about Mr. Fendle. Told you about Fendle at the hotel. Yeah, but it wasn't my wife. The woman you saw in that bar. It wasn't Marilyn. Couldn't have been. I told you about your wife and Mr. Fendle. And then two hours later, Fendle was dead. It looks pretty bad, Roddy. - Skipping ahead. 8:00 last night? - I told you. I was home with Marilyn. We rented a movie. What's the matter, Roddy? You look a little flushed. - Get it? - No. - Neither do i. - Flushed? He gets it. Trust me. He gets it. We'll take it from here, okay? Thank you. I bet the room is just swirling around you right now, isn't it? It's swirling all around. Your whole life is about to go down the drain. Wait, I have more. - Your thoughts are overflowing. - Just wait for Marilyn. When she gets here she tell you. We were together all night. - I never left her side. - I'm sorry, baby. Thank god. Marilyn, you gotta tell these guys about what we did last night. I know, I know. What you want me to say but I I can't lie for you after what you did. - What? - The truth is that I I was in love with Doug Fendle. Last night, I told Roderick the truth. I tried to. - What are you talking about, Marilyn? - Mr. Brody, let her talk. - What happened? - He got furious. He said he was gonna kill Doug. And then he left. What are you doing. What time was this? He left for about, I don't know, two hours. And when he came back, he was Bloody. This is ridiculous! I don't know why she's saying this. - Sit down! - What are you doing? It's okay. Go on. When I came downstairs, Roderick was by the fireplace. He was burning his clothes. That is totally insane! She's lying to you! - Sit down. - He gave me this. Told me to get rid of it. I'm going to step outside for a moment. A little fresh air. There you are. What are you doing? Listen. You hear that? Birds. They're singing. - Is that a lark? - I don't know. You know how I feel? Liberated. I should've confronted that SO. You-know-what years ago. B. I still can't believe I won. Yeah, I don't think anybody really won anything. You're right of course. You're right. - Except me. I won big time. - Are you gonna start singing? I could! I almost could. You know what I am gonna do though? I'm gonna do a Cartwheel. I'm gonna do a Cartwheel right here. You might want to stand back. It's my first Cartwheel. That's perfect. Plenty of room there. Great. I'm gonna do it right here. What am I doing? A man's been killed, right? A man was stabbed to death. Yeah, that's what I've been saying. This is no time for Cartwheels. - Why don't I listen to you? - I don't know. On the other hand, I have been waiting 40 years for this. I mean this is a moment to savor. It may never happen again. I'm doing the Cartwheel. I am doing it. I can't do it. It's ghoulish! I mean One man dead, another man going to jail. Am I a ghoul? - No, you're not a ghoul. - What is a ghoul? - I don't know. - I don't care! That is my arch enemy! One Cartwheel. I gotta do it. I can't do it. - Natalie, do the Cartwheel. - What? Come on, it's a good compromise. Cartwheel by proxy. And don't forget to say ""wee."" Gotta say ""wee!"" What happened? He had a gun. And I'm sorry, i'm so bad with names. Sorry to bother you. Something's come up. Honestly this isn't a great time for me. I'm in the middle of so me business. - It'll just take a minute. - Okay. I'll be right with you. Mrs. Brody, we're all set here. It'll take me a couple days to open the new account. Thank you so much for helping out, Eric. Especially on such short notice. It's your money too, Marilyn. I'll have someone from the grand cayman branch call you, okay? Afternoon. Well, it certainly does seem that Roderick could be going to prison for quite some time. I never should've told him about Douglas. Well I I knew what he was capable of and anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Monk. Can I help you with something? You had a question. Yes, right. You mentioned last night your husband was upset. - He stormed out of the house. - That's right. What car was he driving? What car? His car. Right, so here's my problem, mrs. Brody. Your husband keeps a handgun in his glove compartment. I saw it. So why a steak knife? How did he even know the steak knife would be in the hotel room? Maybe he took the handgun with him and then realized at the last moment it was too loud. He changed his mind. Maybe. Maybe. I'm so sorry I can't be more helpful, Mr. Monk. - Are you gonna be okay? - Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. My aunt is flying in tomorrow. I just have to take this one day at a time. That's the way to do it. Sorry to bother you. I have some papers for you to sign. - Where is my husband? You've got other things to worry about. Believe me. You know, if you don't want to sign them, you don't have to. My signature. Close enough. A cop named Monk stopped by today. He was smart. Too smart. We are gonna have to accelerate our schedule. Which is too bad, because we were just getting to know each other. It's fun having a sister, isn't it? - You okay? - Am I okay? I don't know. I guess I'm everything. Angry. Confused. Scared. I can't get my head around this. - You think you need a lawyer? - I got ten lawyers. Just I never thought i'd need 'em for this. Well, I have some news. I've decided to help you. - I thought you were helping me. - Well, I've decided to really help you. Until now I've sort of been faking it. The truth is I was hoping that your wife was cheating on you. I was sort of glad when you got arrested. You were glad. Well figured - it was payback. - For what? For what? For for what? For seventh grade! For ruining my life! Weren't. Weren't you listening? Are you talking about the swirlies? You used to terrorize me. - You gave as good as you got? - What are you talking about? You didn't just roll over like a lot of those kids. I remember. You called me names. You hurt my feelings. - And you splashed me. - I splashed you? But I don't dwell on it. What am I gonna do? Hold a grudge for 30 years? - I figure we're even. - Don't believe this. I I cannot believe this. You mean, you never even do you have any idea okay, all right, okay let's move on. Okay, let's just - talk about your wife. - Okay. I think she might've been lying about last night. I know she's lying. I just can't figure out why. I've been sitting here for two hours - Wrecking my brain. - Racking your brain. Here's what I know, okay? I know I didn't do it. And I know she didn't do it cause I was with her all night. Where did she get the knife. I don't know. Where did she get the knife? I can't figure it. Something's going on here but I are you okay? - That's me. - Yeah. - It's a mirror. - Oh, my god. - She did it. - Who did what? Marilyn. Your wife. Last night she was at the hotel. She killed Doug Fendle. I feel like I'm in eighth grade geometry class here I don't understand. I told you I was with her. Was she with me or was she at the hotel? And no. She was with you and she was at the hotel. She was both. Twins. Hey, sis. How you feeling? Those are some pretty strong tranquilizers I gave you. You know, I didn't even know I had a sister until that. That lawyer Doug Fendle came knocking. His firm represented our adoption And now you're worth what? $9-10 million? I never even had a savings account. Doesn't really seem fair, does it? You were right. She has a twin sister. A patrice Gesner. They were adopted by different families 35 years ago in Milwaukee. Papers were sealed. They never knew each other. - I think they both in there. - Look around? Not yet. Rodriquez is getting a warrant. He'll be here soon. So identical twins? That's one for the books. - Yeah, I'm pretty sure I said twins. - Randy, you always say twins. You've been depressed. And you've been drinking. They're gonna find your body in the bay near the bridge. The bay is salt water so I have to add this. - So how did you know? - Little things. They began to add up. When I first met her, she mentioned her aunt in Texas. Just one aunt in Texas. She didn't even make it. She pronounced it ""ant."" This morning, she said: My aunt is flying in tomorrow. And the fingernails. Two days ago, she was biting them. This morning they were long and perfectly manicured. It's time for your bath, sis. This might hurt a little. I wonder if I'll feel it. Probably not. It's not like you felt my pain for the last 35 years. Roderick's wife wasn't cheating on him. The woman saw last week was her sister. Yeah, we weren't following Marilyn. We were following her twin. This morning while we were all at the police station, the sister was here. She was switching places. She was gonna Kill Roderick too to get him out of the way until we arrested him. We just made her job easier. Arrested? I'll be right there. - Okay, why did she kill Fendle? - Fendle was her partner in all this. - But she didn't want to cut him in. - There was a banker here this morning. She's been moving Roderick's money to offshore accounts. Funny thing is you probably don't even know my name. It's Patrice. I think she's planning to kill Marilyn and then disappear. Patrice, I beg you. I'm begging you. Please, no! It could be going down right now. Where the heck is the warrant? Help! - What was that? - Probable cause! Help! Somebody help! Step away from her now! Now! It's okay. It's okay. How do we tell'em apart? Say aunt. Let's arrest the one that wasn't drowning. Yeah. Yeah, that works too. - Hope he has the right sister. - I can't look. This is the worst comeuppance ever. You lied to me. - About what? - Karma. You're blaming me for this? Yes, I am. I just want to say thanks. You saved my family. Saved my life. Glad I could help. Yeah, and hey, about this swirly thing. No hard feelings, right? All right. I'll see you around. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. What's a swirly? We used to fool around back in the day. You know, horseplay after school. He was a funny kid. He used to wash his hands, like, ten times a day. Listen. Do you hear that? - What? The birds? - Not the birds. Don't you hear that? The toilet tank refilling. Toilet tank of life. Come on, Mr. Monk. I'll drive you home. It's what plato called the great cosmic swirly. - There's no escaping it. - Plato said that? I'm paraphrasing. I'm gonna need that shower cap back."

If you wanna take a step back, go home, - everybody here would understand. - I'm here. Let's do it. He was, asphyxiated. Strangled. Probably from behind. The killer used a ligature, something thing and strong. Probably piano wire. - Can I see it? - We haven't found it yet. Or he took it with him. We don't know. The killer It's a magician. - What is that? - Black paint. They paint their wires so they can't be seen. Magician. That's good. You were the first one back here. Did you see anybody? Well, there was a maintenance man. Maybe he saw something. The maintenance crew doesn't work on saturdays. Oh, my god. I saw him. - You saw him. - I saw the guy. He was the nicest kid I ever knew. I mean, last summer after the hurricane, he came over and cleaned out all my gutters. Except for the garage. But we didn't have gutters in the garage. We have them now. We didn't have them Then. I put them in three weeks ago. Yeah, actually, I had to redo the whole roof. That's a nice picture. I took that picture. Took me two hours. I wanted to get one where he wasn't talking. - Well, you did it. Right. - Actually, I had to photoshop it. - You must be Adrian Monk. - That's right. And Natalie. I'm Kevin's aunt SheIla. - We're so sorry for your loss. - Thank you, dear. I just feel like I know you folks! He talked about you all the time. - God bless him. - We had a little tradition. He would call me every sunday and tell me all about his week. We never missed a sunday. I think that's What I'm gonna miss most of all Our sunday night chats. Yes, ma'am. He was very special. Wait! I tell a lie. We did Miss one sunday, 121/2 years ago. That was the summer I traveled to italy with my mah-jongg group. But we made up for it when I got back. We spoke twice that week Friday and sunday. - Imagine that. - That's great. Then there was the time my telephone service was interrupted. No, wait. That was a tuesday. So that really would not have affected our I'm sorry. I just rembered. I'm - thirsty. - You forgot you were thirsty? I've just been So busy. So nice to meet you. - So it's hereditary? - Apparently, it's a dominant trait. You know what, I really am thirsty. Excuse me. Where did you get that? It's in the lobby just down the hall. 'scuse me, I'm looking for the dressing rooms. - Who was that man? - That's Torini. - That's Kevin's friend. - He's the magician. The best in the world. That's what they say. I'm sorry. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Adrian Monk. This is Natalie Teeger. Yes, of course. The famous detective. Karl Torini. My assistant, Tanya Adams. Were you a friend of Kevin's, or are you working on the case? - Both. Both. - How's it going? There's nothing to report. At least not yet. - You worked with Kevin, didn't you? - Well, I didn't really know him. I'm a featured performer. He was usually in the back room, crunching numbers. He was filling in for you on saturday night, wasn't he? Yes. That's right. It was a last-minute thing. I took Tanya to Reno. We got engaged. - Congratulations. - You're not wearing a ring. I know, You know, it just happened so fast As you can imagine, after what happened We were so distraught that suddenly a ring just didn't seem so important. Of course. Well, if you'll excuse us, we'd like to pay our respects. Good luck, Mr. Monk. He's the guy. - Because of the ring? - Because he's the guy. I saw him. I recognize him. He was there. - He's the guy. - Monk, Karl Torini was in Reno, as in Reno, Nevada, and he can prove it. - He's the guy. - Maybe he hired someone. I sawhim. He was there dressed as a maintenance man. Captain, he killed Kevin. He called the theater from Nevada just before the show. - Maybe he called from someplace else. - Nope. We already checked. Got the phone records right here. ""Call was placed from the sands regency hotel in Reno ""at 9:55 pm. ""It was made from his hotel room. It was a direct call. It was not rerouted."" Besides, he put the damn phone call on the speakerphone. There were ten people that heard it. We got statements from every one of them. Monk, if you were the DA, what would you say? Look, you want me to dig, i'll grab a Shovel. I'll dig for ya. But you gotta tell me what to look for. I don't know. I don't know. How long have you two been together? Six years. See, Karl was in Toronto. I was in the audience, believe it or not. He needed someone to levitate. I raised my hand. - And now you're family. - That's right! We bought it last night. - It's official. - Congratulations again. Look! Bunnies. Sweeties. - Don't touch! - No, it's okay. She can pet them. No, she can't. There are Karl's other assistants. We breed them here. It's cheaper than buying them. They're they're breeding in the In the house? We'll be outside. No, we won't be outside. We're staying. We're not leaving. So did you know him very well? Kevin, I mean. He lived in Mr. Monk's building. He was a neighbor. Did he have any children? - Thank god for that. - Don't ever cover them up? Leave'em out in the open, so close to the kitchen? Tanya, you know, if you know anything about what happened, you can talk to us. You could call us anytime. I don't know anything. I was just, you know, asking. I'll go see if Karl's ready. Mr. Monk, did you hear that? I think she knows something. What are you doing? Just trying to figure out how it works. No! I don't wanna know. It ruins the effect! This one might be real. Don't play with this one. - I won't. - What's that? It's called a zig-zag cabinet. I designed it myself. Please step away from the cabinet, Mr. Monk. Secrets of the trade, you understand. God! - How'd you do that? - Misdirection, Miss Teeger. The secret to every illusion Making the audience look where they shouldn't be looking. For example Did you see that? Watch closely. If it goes here, then it can't be over here. If I take it in left hand and put it over there it can't be back over here, can it? It's hard to follow. Sometimes people think he coin is too small. I can make it bigger. Tough room. I'm sensing a little hostility. The night Kevin was killed, you werein the theater. I saw you backstage. What? Really? You were dressed as a maintenance man - Weren't you? - Either you're mistaken Or you're bluffing. I was 300 miles away. And I can prove it. Why did you have Kevin work for you that night? Well, as I explained to the police, I was leaving town, I need someone to fill in, i'd seen Kevin before and I thought he was - Quite wonderful. - You know We saw Kevin's act. He was dreadful. God rest his soul. You're wasting your time, Mr. Monk! You know, I called the club just five minutes before Kevin went onstage. It was a direct call From Reno, Nevada. I'm sure you checked with the phone company. Looks like it's gonna rain. You killed him. I know you did. Why would I harm the boy? You don't have the why, and you don't have the how. I love this part. The look on their face When they can't figure it out. This isn't some trick, Mr. Torini. This isn't a show. Kevin was our friend. He was a good man who never hurt anybody. He was the sweetest, shyest person I ever met, and he was 34, and his life was just getting started. This is the most brilliant detective in the world. He's gonna figure out how you did it, and he's gonna prove it Aren't you? Aren't you? Well, if you're gonna catch me anyway, I suppose I - May as well just confess. - What? - What do you mean? - In fact, I'll even put it in writing. I hereby confess To the murder of Kevin - Dorfman. - Dorfman. Thank you. Signed Here you go. Congratulations. - Where are you putting the trash? - I'm not! - I can't seem to throw anything out. - Me neither. I have to tell you something. I mean, I have to tell someone. - I feel terrible. - What is it? He drove me insane. He wouldn't shut up! The man would not shut up! One time He had a sore throat. He talked for 21/2 hours about how much it hurt him to talk. Honest, god forgive me, sometimes I'd hear him coming down the stairs. I'd turn off all the lights, pretend I wasn't home. It's okay. Don't feel bad. Everybody does that! Sometimes late at night when you call me and I see your name on the caller ID, I just Just don't feel bad. - Where's my phone? - Are you gonna answer that? Where's I hear it. - Where'd you put it? - Must have put it right here. What did you It's Randy. - Tell him to hold on. - Randy, hold on. Set the phone down. - What? - Secret compartment. Torini the magician. All that equipment There must be secret compartments in everything. How can his equipment weigh more on his return trips than when he left? - Randy, it's Adrian. Are you there? - I think so. - I think you just solved the case. - Glad I could help. Ladies and gentlemen, don't panic. I'm a professional. There you go. All right, here we go. I never know what to do with the walking cane after that trick. I say we just get rid of it. You guys have met the beautiful Tanya. She looks fabulous in black, doesn't she? I think she'd look even better in blue. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the zig-zag cabinet. Now, you may have seen other magicians perform this illusion. They usually have their assistant get into the cabinet, but I just don't want to lose this one, so I'm going to do the very same trick with a complete stranger. I need a volunteer. Can we have the house lights up, please? Thank you. Someone's amazing how everyone just looks the other way. Volunteer, volunteer, volunteer. The eager Miss Teeger. You're volunteering? Really? Actually, I'd rather have your boss up here. No, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a celebrity in the audience tonight Adrian Monk, the world-famous detective. Now, I've been reading a lot about Mr. Monk. No one has ever outwitted him. Tonight i'd like to give that a try. What do you think? - I can't do it. - You have to do it. Come on! It's kind of perfect, really. I wanted a stranger, and there's really no one stranger than Adrian Monk. I had more. Not working with a full deck, Mr. Monk? Thank you. Mr. Monk. Let's bring him up. Come up. Are you nervous? Are you? Let's really scramble his brains. Stand here, please. Zig-zag cabinet. In you go. I forgot. You're just a little bit claustrophobic, aren't you? Well, if you'd rather not give it a try Tanya would like to help Mr. Monk with his jacket. She's very good. That's why I'm marrying her. Perfect. In you go, Mr. Monk. In you go. How you doing in there, detective? - Not not not. Not so well. - Yes, fabulous. Lovely. Ladies and gentlemen, Tanya and I have performed this illusion over the world. Do it for Kevin. - I accidentally cut a woman in half. - Do it for Kevin. It's okay she's not living happily in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Comfy? Solid steel blades! Are you ready for this? Solid steel! Let's cut Mr. Monk in too. Check that out, Mr. Monk. One more! Watch. And that's it! How are you doing in there, detective? - I got you. - I beg your pardon? The real money is on the road. Isn't that what you said? And what is that? That is a chemical test strip. Your zig-zag cabinet just tested positive for heroin. You've been using your props to smuggle drugs into the country. - Here's what happened. - Yes, well, thank you. I almost forgot to mention sometimes the cabinet drives people completely batty. I think we need to de-scramble him. Let's go. Adrian Monk, ladies and gentlemen. He's gone. What do you mean, you don't know! You're the damn magician! - What happened to him? - I know what more to tell you. It's not supposed to be a vanishing act. It's a simple prop gag. Look, the sections move back and forth like this, and that's it, that's the whole gag! I'm as mystified as you are. Yeah, you'd better get un-mystified, and fast. Where's your assistant? Probably backstage. You can scream all you want. No one ever comes down here. I'm gonna die In this room. You're right. He's gonna kill you, and then he's gonna burn your body in that furnace. I was talking about the soot. But what you say is worse. It's much, much worse. Any luck? He could be anywhere. There must be 300 rooms in this place. Gentlemen as much as I would love to stay, I have two shows tomorrow. So if you want to talk to me again call my lawyer. He's a better magician than I am. Are you okay? I fall through trap doors all the time. I know it hurts. And look, I just want you to know this wasn't my idea, and I'm really sorry. Sorry enough to to let me go? - You're not gonna answer that? - No. It's just an extension. Pipe tobacco. Clever. - What is? - How you killed my friend. Misdirection, right? The secret to every illusion. You and Torini went to Reno that weekend. You checked in. He made sure he was seen. That afternoon, he snuck out of the hotel and drove back here. He was down here in the basement. He was hiding and waiting. At 9:55 exactly, you called the theater. The phone records were right. The call did originate from Reno. - Magic castle. - Torini was on the extension phone. Everyone assumed he was calling from Nevada. - Am I on speakerphone? - Yes, sir. Go ahead, we're all here. Tanya and I have some great news. We wanted everyone to know. Tanya, do you wanna tell them? - No, you go ahead. - Nobody knew. Nobody could tell. The killer was already in the building. Karl, he knows! He knows, and I didn't tell him. I swear I didn't tell him. - He just figured it out! - He did? So what do you think, Mr. Monk? You have to admit, the best tricks are the simplest? - What are we gonna do? - Like I told you onstage. Make him disappear. Hold still! Tanya, get down here and hold his legs! I don't think I can go through with this. All right. All right. You're right. I'm sorry. You know what? Let me do it. - You hold his legs. - All right. Good-bye, Mr. Monk. I'm sorry it had to end like this. Looks like I'm gonna need a new assistant starting now! - Please, don't! - Wait! Let her go! Let her go! Put your hands up. Hands up! Turn around! - You too. You too! - Mr. Monk, are you okay? Let me help you abraca-Dorfman, you son of a bitch. Are you okay? My name is Kevin Dorfman, and this is what they call a video will. Which means, sadly, if you're watching this, I am deceased. Unless you're me, and I am watching it to see how I look. Or i might have put it in the wrong case and lent it to you by accident. That's also a possibility. Or maybe you're Phil, the technician at the production company who's editing this video. Or Phil is sick, possibly, and you're his assistant Craig. Not Craig. Greg. I remember now. - Craig left two years ago. - Should I fast-forward? Greg, I'm sorry for screwing up your name like that. - No. - Craig went back to school - Let it play. - To get his real estate license. It wasn't real estate. But it was a license. What other licenses are there? It's the license, or a license."
"Jimmy, we finally have some good news to report. I'm downtown on the corner of summerset and geraldi street, In front of one of the oldest and ugliest parking garages in the city. But last month, city council voted to tear down this eyesore, And replace it with a beautiful playground And park for the children of this neighborhood. Uh, hold on, jimmy, something's happening. - Somebody's still in the garage? - Something is happening here. There may be someone still inside the garage. Who's this guy? What the hell you think you're doing? I don't know if you heard the news, buddy, But we gotta tear this whole place down. - You can't do that. - I can't do that? I got two bulldozers outside says i can. I'm not leaving! All right, pal, look. I don't know what your story is, all right? But you're going home. Where's the key to the lock? Give it to me. You gotta be kidding me. Cheese and crackers, we're tearing down a parking garage here. All right, this is a good thing. All right, we're gonna build a playground here for the kids. What's the matter, you don't like kids? My wife died here. Right over there. Her name was trudy. She died here. You can't tear it down. Monk s07ep16 sync:frs@Éá²»µÃmonkµÄÓîÒâ Mr. Monk, mr. Monk? Mr. Monk. - Natalie, thank god. - God, are you okay? You're all over the news. I couldn't believe it. They were gonna tear it down. Look, you gotta help me. You gotta. Come on. Hell, no, we won't go! Hell, no-- Come on. Mr. Monk, i'm not gonna chant with you. You have to, otherwise the ""we"" part doesn't make any sense. None of this makes any sense. Why didn't you call me? You would have tried to talk me out of it. All right everybody, let's just calm down, okay? Let's just settle down, all right? Hi. Hello, adrian. I'm eileen hill. I'm on the city council. This parking garage is slated for demolition. We voted on it last week. I know. I was there. Why can't we just drag this bozo out of here? Excuse me, do you know who this man is? This is adrian monk. He was a decorated police officer, Who's been serving this city officially and unofficially for 20 years. Well, he sure isn't serving the city today. Adrian, i understand you lost your wife here. Where did it happen? It was right-- It was right over there. I'm so sorry for your loss. I really am. But you can appreciate our situation. There are hundreds of children in this community-- Councilwoman, this is a crime scene. This is hallowed ground. Trudy's case is still open. There could still be clues here. Something i missed. If you tear this place down, they'll be gone forever. I didn't consider that. You could be letting a killer go free for a swing set or a sandbox. - What's your name? - Robert. - Can i call you bob? - Sure. - Bob, go home. - What? I believe our decision here was premature. As i recall, our vote was four to three. And when the margin is that close, Any member can ask for a second vote. A second-- A second vote? Yes, it's called the confirmation vote. It's called the confirmation vote! We're gonna tap the brakes on this, Conduct a public hearing, and vote on it again. Fine, it's your call. Yes, it is. All right, guys, pack it up, let's go home. Councilwoman hill, i-- I can't thank you enough. I'm not making any promises, adrian. I can't even tell you how i'm going to vote. But i do appreciate your service to the city, And i think you deserve the benefit of the doubt. See you next week at city hall? Yes. Natalie, I feel this tingling in my chest and in my face. Yeah, you're happy, mr. Monk. I can't believe it. You did it. I did it. You just stopped a children's playground from being built, And saved a parking garage. So the system works. Let's get out of here. All right, where's the key? Well, it's not in the sewer. You don't have to worry about that. I'm kidding. It's in the sewer. Looks like a married couple. (Four days later) - Some swimmers found them. - Swimmers? Yeah, you know, the polar bear club? They were stabbed. Two and three times. She got it twice. Detective monk, are we keeping you from something? City council. They're voting again today. Right, the parking garage thing. Good luck on that. Mr. Monk, we have plenty of time. We should leave early, though. Just to be safe. It's only a ten-Minute drive. Look, look. You can see it from here. We should leave early, just to be sure. Okay, well, they were tourists. Probably german. Really? Why do you say that? Because they were german. Uh, from berlin. Mr. And mrs. Erhard helmrich. Uh, we found their wallets and passports in their pockets. I, uh, talked to a clerk at a hotel. They were staying downtown at the best western. He said that they were a pretty quiet couple. Yeah, they look pretty quiet. Yeah, but they weren't this quiet. I mean, before last night. They were just regular quiet, Like, when they checked in to the hotel. Yeah, randy, i know what you mean. I was trying to be wry. Oh, sorry, my bad. Do you want to say it again? What do you got there, a bracelet? No, it's not a bracelet. It's a strap. See, it's torn. She had a camera. Did you find a camera? No. Then he must have taken it. He left her jewelry. This guy had a wallet? Was there still money in it? Yeah, dollars and euros. I'm thinking they were walking down here last night, To get a view of the skyline, maybe, See the moonlight on the water. They saw something else. And they got killed for it. What was it? Must have been pretty terrible. Something inhuman. Something so horrific-- Is that the time? We gotta go, we gotta go. Natalie! Wait, we want you to look at some tire tracks. Yeah, take some pictures. Just get a lot of pictures. We gotta go. Come on! All right, so where do they hold these council meetings? I don't know, we'll have to ask someone. Adrian monk. And you must be natalie. Paul crawford. San francisco dispatch. Yeah, hello, excuse me for just one second, sir! So you're a reporter? I am the reporter. I've been following this story. I'm thinking about doing a story on adrian monk and his parking garage. ""Man versus playground."" Yeah, i can see it now, you'd make him out to be a monster. On the contrary, ms. Teeger, please don't repeat this to anybody, But, uh, i'm on your side. Hope you pull it off. Wow, that's very sympathetic. Lady, sympathy's got nothing to do with it. Parking's a bitch in that neighborhood. Call me. Mr. Monk. Okay, it's just upstairs. We're five minutes early. - Ooh. - Oh. Hello, adrian, natalie. Hello, harold. I heard about your little temper-Tantrum downtown. It wasn't a temper-Tantrum. Mm-Hmm, whatever it was, it apparently worked. I have today's agenda here, And it looks like we'll be voting on your parking garage again. That's right. You know, i voted against you last time. Yes, yes, i know that. But i've been thinking about it, And i could be persuaded to change my mind. - Really? - Oh, yes. - ???? - How shall i vote? Aye or nay? Up or down? Hmm, i don't know. It all depends on my mood. And my mood depends on how i feel. What does that mean? Your mood depends on how you feel? You know what it means. I really, really don't. Do you have any idea what he is talking about? I'm lost. I'm talking about your new therapist. The mystery doctor. The genius you're always raving about. Who is he? Just tell me his name. I can't tell you. It's privileged information. No, it's not. What happens in the sessions is privileged. His name isn't privileged. People recommend therapists every day. Am i right, natalie? I don't know, harold, i'm just waiting for the conversation to be over. Okay, fine, fine. His name Is doctor Door. Doctor door? Is that the best you could do? I suppose if we were standing over there by that alarm, You woulda said doctor bell? - Oh, god, harold. I'm so sorry! - Don't touch me! Don't touch me! - Sorry, i'm sorry. - Oh. Oh, no. You see, the truth is, harold, i really don't need your vote. I spoke to councilwoman hill over the weekend, And she's on my side now. - She's switching her vote? - Well, that's right. So now the vote is four to three in my favor. And i believe they call that a ""majority."" Oh, monk, hey, natalie-- Harold, you're all wet. You know, the councilwoman, eileen hill, The one you've been talking about? Yeah, yeah. Did something happen? We're not sure. We just talked to her sister. She's gone missing. Councilwoman hill's office, Can you hold, please? Councilwoman hill's office, may i put you on hold? Hello? Hello, my name is-- I can't talk to you right now, okay? The councilwoman is missing. It's a madhouse in here. - Thank god it's friday. - It's not friday. Who told you that? - Well, no one told me. - Councilwoman hill's office, Can you hold? Hello? They hung up. I-- I think you disconnected them. - Why would i do that? - I don't know. I'm natalie teeger, this is adrian monk. We're working with the police. We're looking for councilwoman hill. You should have called first. I tried. We tried. - But you kept putting us on hold, and then - Councilwoman hill's office, Hello? Can i help-- Hello? Hanging up on us. Look, i already talked to the police. A sergeant or something. I don't remember his name. He just had a big scar on his face. Just like yours. - I don't have a scar. - Sure, you do. It's on your cheek. It's right there. You both do. I think you have a scratch on your glasses. Is there someone else here i could talk to? You could talk to her. I mean someone who works here. Well, you could try janet grote. She's a legislative assistant. - Thank god. Where is she? - She's not in. Here's the thing. I'm conducting my own investigation. It's kind of personal. I need to speak with the councilwoman. There's a vote that's very important to me, And they've just postponed it until next week. When was the last time you saw ms. Hill? Yesterday morning. She same in for about an hour. And then she had to leave. She had an appointment. Great. With whom? I don't know. I'd have to check her calendar. Could you do that, please? I don't like you. There it is. That's her schedule for the whole week. Oh, great, can you print that out for us, please? How am i supposed to get you a copy? There's a printer right behind you. Yeah, there's no print button. Yeah, it's right here. It says ""p-N-T."" - Pint? - It's abbreviated. Print, printing, printer. Print. I'm new here. Really? I never would have guessed that. - Are you patronizing me? - No, i'm insulting you. Great. Thank god it's friday. Take your time. I hope my water doesn't break. Chivalry is dead. I don't like you at all. So she disappeared. Her last appointment was The reporter. - Paul crawford. - Yeah. Good morning. I'm captain leland stottlemeyer. This is lieutenant disher. You know adrian monk, natalie teeger. You're a hard man to find, mr. Crawford. We were leaving messages at your house. My apologies, lieutenant. I was out all night. Working on a series of articles about police corruption. Confidential, hush-Hush. You understand. Yeah, i look forward to not reading that. - Nice car. - Yes, it is. All it takes is hard work, a modicum of natural talent, And marrying a billionaire's only daughter. And i'm late as usual. Can we walk and talk? Sure. What about your crusade, mr. Monk? How did the vote go? Well, actually, there was no vote. It's been postponed. That why you're here? In a way. Councilwoman hill has officially disappeared. She's missing? Since monday. Did you check her apartment? I think she lived with her sister. We were there last night. There were no signs of a struggle, nothing unusual. What about her car? It was parked out front, But her wallet and her keys were gone. Not a good sign, is it? No, sir, it's not. According to her schedule, uh, she was with you monday morning. That's true; eileen met me here at the office. I have known eileen for years. She read an article of mine, and, uh, had a few questions. - Did she seem depressed? - No. Had she been drinking? No, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now. What was the article about? The one she was interested in? It was about the food industry. Hot dog vendors. I read that. I haven't had a hot dog since. Oh, god, the pictures. I take that as a compliment. That's actually a talent of mine. I can take almost anything as a compliment. Eileen read the article too. Became sort of a pet project of hers. She said that she wanted to shut all the vendors down. In fact, she said she was meeting a man named george gianopolous. The hot dog czar? Yeah, when she left, she said that's where she was going. - Anything else? - No, sir, that's it. If we need anything, we'll call you. Look forward to it. Oh, god. You missed a couple. - I was buried alive once. - Yeah, i remember. I was in a box. I was underground for three hours. And that box is now The second-Most frightening place i've ever been. Hey! - Can i help you? - Yeah, are you mr. Gianopolous? You health inspectors? Homicide. Oh! Hey! It's okay, they're only from homicide! You scared the bejeezus out of me. Are you the, uh, hot dog czar? My father was frankie gianopolous. And he was the original czar. And i was the-- The duke of dogs. And then, when he passed away-- Oh. Hold on. Oh, my god, are you okay? No. No, i'm fine. Oh, boy, i'm fine. Oh, that happens to me three or four times a week. My doctor can't figure it out. Really? His doctor can't figure it out. Anyway, when my old man passed, I inherited his kingdom, so to speak. You hungry? Yeah, yeah, sure, i'll take one. I love hot dogs. Oh, yeah, yeah, take all you want. We take care of our friends in blue, And they take care of us. Boy, that's good. What is that, beef or pork? We use ""meat."" Why do you say it like that? Uh, we are required by law to put it in quotes. Yeah. Mr. Dog-- Mr. Dog czar, We're looking for councilwoman eileen hill. She's been missing for two days. I heard about that. It was on the news. I can't help you. When was the last time you saw her? Oh, it was, like, three weeks ago. A month, uh-- No, they're good. Uh, she did call me on monday morning And said she was coming over, but she never showed up. Which was fine with me. You don't like her? Oh, i wouldn't say that. I would say i hate her. Hate. And every vendor here feels exactly the same way. She wants to regulate us to death. She wants us to wear gloves. - And to put lids on the condiment trays. - Lids! And to change the water in the pots every other day. And what's wrong with that? These dogs are like a fine wine. They need to simmer. The simmering. That's the secret. Yeah, the simmering. See, the ""meat"" has to simmer. Anyway, yeah, she never called to cancel. She never showed up. That's all i know. Yeah, maybe she did show up. And maybe you had an altercation. And maybe you hit her. And maybe you killed her. Maybe we're gonna have to get a search warrant and tear this place apart. You go right ahead and be my guest. Believe me, If i did what you are accusing me of, I wouldn't just leave her body lying around. She would be somewhere where no one would find her. She would be gone. Have a good day. You hear what he said? Yeah, some place we'd never find her. Mysterious. Randy, think about it. Maybe bury her in some park somewhere. Gah, i could eat a million of these things. There you are. Oh, thank god you're here. - Is that straight? - Yeah, it is. - No, the left side? - No, it's perfect. - I don't think so. - It's perfection. - Look, i talked to the captain. - You're blind. He just looked at the surveillance tapes. He said eileen hill never went near that warehouse. Plus, the hot dog guy passed a polygraph test. - Looks like a dead end. - Yeah, it probably is. He'll still have to answer to god For that ""meat"" he's been serving, though. Maybe the pole is crooked. How many of these did you make? And how many have you put up? Uh, including this one, One. This'll be one. You're offering a reward? Look, i-- I have to find her. There's gonna be another vote in two days. I can't win without her. And you want to make sure she's safe. - What? - And you want to make sure she's safe. Yeah-- Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. That too, yep. Okay, that's-- That's good enough. Let's go. Let's go, let's move on. We're moving on. God, if they tear down that parking garage, I don't know what i'd do. Don't worry, mr. Monk. Everything's gonna be fine. She's out there somewhere. Just keep looking. We will find her. So, uh, you want me to put this up? Maybe in the waiting room. I think it might upset some of my patients. A lot of them are paranoid enough. Well, what if i write ""she's probably okay"" on the bottom? Maybe. And by ""maybe,"" you mean-- I mean ""no."" I'm sorry. Adrian, you've been going back to that parking garage for 11 years. - Ever since trudy died. - That's right. You're there two-- Maybe three times a month. The forensics people have covered every inch of it. So here's my question. Do you believe-- I mean, do you really believe, in your heart of hearts, That there's evidence in that parking garage you haven't found? No. Still, you're determined to save it. There's a wall on the lower level. It's a gray wall, And it says ""b-5"" in big, red letters. What about that wall? It was the last thing that she saw. I can't live without it. All right. Here's what i think. I think you should let it go. Let the children have their playground. - I can't. - I think you can. Five years ago, you probably couldn't. But now, i think you're ready. I'll never be ready. That's why i have to find her. They're going to vote again tomorrow morning. Without councilwoman hill, it's three to three. The new vote wouldn't count. They'll tear it down. You think she was murdered? It's starting to look like it. Maybe she ran away. Maybe she couldn't stand all those meetings. I served on the city council. Not here. When i lived in tulsa. I hated it. The meetings where interminable. After a few months, i stopped going all together. I used to send my secretary in as my proxy. Is that legal? I was in tulsa. Proxy. Adrian, you're standing up. Why don't you sit down? I think you're a genius. Okay, you can stand. I'm gonna put you on hold. If you get disconnected, please don't call back. - Oh, it's you again. - Yes, it is. It's me. - Did you find her? - Not yet. Actually, i was-- I was looking for ms. Grote. I told you, she's not in. - She's still not back? - No, she's sick. She has pneumonia. - She won't be back for two weeks. - Oh, god. You're a staff member. I mean, you're-- You're full-Time, right? Why? You can vote at the hearing tomorrow. You have the authority. I don't think so. No, no, no. It's in the bylaws. Look. ""If a council member is absent or incapacitated for any reason, ""Any member of his or her staff-- "" It's maria, isn't it? These are for you. Why were you asking about janet? I-- I just wanted to make sure she wasn't here. 'Cause i didn't want her to, you know, get jealous. Are you interested In politics? No. Hmm, fascinating. I like the way you think. Are you, um-- Are you, uh, busy for lunch, Or do you have a modeling job? - I'm married. - Yeah, no, i know, i know. Strictly business. There's a big vote tomorrow, And i just want you to hear my side of it. I only get 15 minutes, So i usually just grab a hot dog. Great, perfect. Hot dog. And some sauerkraut. Not too much. That's too much. A little more. Thank you. You're not hungry? No-- Uh, no, i'm fine. I ate yesterday. Three dollars. Oh, uh, let me get that. It's no problem. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. It was a ""pleasure"" seeing you again. I mean, a real ""pleasure."" - The ""pleasure"" is all mine. - All right, i get it. So, maria, how you holding up? Oh, it's crazy up there. Reporters keep calling. And detectives. You don't have any clues or leads or anything? Not yet. She should have told me she might be disappearing before she hired me. Uh-Huh. It's common courtesy. She could have put it on the flyer. There was a flyer? Yeah, in my lamaze class. That's how i got the job. Really? It was the easiest job interview i ever had. We talked for, like, five minutes. Then she gave me a drug test, and that was it. Oh, i probably shouldn't be eating these things. Yeah. If you ever meet my kid in, like, 20 years, - Just don't tell him, okay? - I promise. So maria, What do you think? About what? About the parking garage, where my wife died. Can you believe they want to tear it down? Isn't that outrageous? I guess. Although, you know, a playground would be nice, for the kids. Yeah, but, they don't really need a playground. They can play in the parking garage. It has ramps. - God, kids love ramps, right? - That's true. They can pretend it's a fort or pirate ship. They can use their imaginations, Which, i think we need more of. - Hmm. Maybe. - Yeah, so if you agree, All you have to do is go to that hearing tomorrow, And just raise your hand. Just raise it up, okay? Cast your vote for imagination. I don't know. You want me to represent ms. Hill, But how do i know what she would do? She told me. We talked all about this. She's on my side. Well, she never said anything to me. I just wish we could find her journals. She used to write down all her notes in a journal. There's no journal. At least, nobody's found it. Did you check her apartment? Yes, we've been there all week. What about her other apartment? She has two. I can't believe the receptionist knew about this place the whole time. I know. She even had a key. Why wouldn't she tell anybody? Because nobody asked! I'm telling you, natalie, the woman is so stupid, It hurts me to talk to her. Physically hurts me. Do you see a journal anywhere? She supposedly kept a journal. Huh. Looks like she had some roommates. A cheerleader, A french maid. Wait. Oh, you know what? They weren't roommates, natalie. This is a love nest. - That's what it is. - You think? This is one of those love nests that you read about. Yeah, but for who? That's the question. Who was she meeting? Oh, my god! What? What is it? Nothing. It's nothing. Mr. Monk, Don't open that drawer, you understand? Whatever happens, whatever you do, Don't ever, ever, ever Ever ever, ever, ever, ever, Ever, ever, ever, ever open that drawer! What if there's a clue in there? What if it could solve the case? - I don't care! - Okay, i won't. All righty. The plot thickens. Now what? She was pregnant. Is it-- Is it her? Yeah, it's definitely the councilwoman. Her family just i.D.Ed the body. Mr. Monk, i'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. I know about the zoning thing. I know you were counting on her. The m.E. Says she's been in the bay since monday night, Probably dumped off the vinton street pier. Where those german tourists were killed? I hate that pier! So what do we do now? We do what we do. Sign on the door says ""homicide."" Come on. So we don't know who, we don't know where, We don't know why, but we do know how. She was strangled with this. A very fancy necktie. - Chalmers of london. - Yep, very high end. They don't even sell these in the states. Let's start here. Wouldn't it be easier to get some dna And try  to find the father? There is no father. She was pregnant. Nope, she wasn't. But we found those pregnancy tests in her apartment, And they were all positive. We told dr. Kay what you had found. We had him check twice, And the councilwoman was not pregnant. Not even close. Okay, wait, i don't understand. You know, this was her love nest. No one else lived there. Why should she have somebody else's home pregnancy test? Is this her handbag? Yeah, we found that tangled in the rope. So then, - This has to be her journal. - Yep. Can i get a copy of the contents? Already done. This is it. This is all i need. - A- Ha! - You solved the case? What? Oh, no, not that. Come on, natalie, we can still make it. - Where you going? - City hall. As you all know, we lost a dear friend this week. Eileen hill's body was discovered earlier this morning. Let us pray that the san francisco police catch her killer And bring him or her to justice. Or if they don't catch him, Let us pray that eileen's murder was the work of a random nut job, Or frustrated ex-Boyfriend, And not some kind of a masked vigilante Who, for some reason, has a personal vendetta against the city council, And is determined to slaughter us, One member at a time, Picking us off when we least expect it, Using a different, yet somehow appropriate method For each of his grisly killings. Amen. So let's get started. Maria schecter is joining us. She'll be acting as eileen's proxy. I see you're well prepared. Yes, this is her journal, so i know what she was thinking, And how she would want me to vote. Adrian monk even underlined all the important stuff, And even made little arrows. How nice for you. Well, let's get right to it. We have some old business. Resolution 12-B. We will be voting yet again On whether to preserve or demolish the parking garage on summerset avenue. By a show of hands, All those in favor of demolishing the garage, And replacing it with a beautiful, Long-Overdue neighborhood playground and park. Three. All those opposed To the children's playground. Democracy in action. - It's a beautiful thing. -I'm not sure it's exactly What the founding fathers had in mind. I can't believe i won! I can't remember the last time i won anything. Did you see harold's face? Oh, that was the sweetest part. There he is, there he is. Mr. Monk. Who wants to shake my hand? I'll shake anybody's hand. No wipes, no wipes, limited time offer. Harold? No? Paul? I'll take you up on that. Congratulations, mr. Monk. The shrine to your beloved late trudy's still intact, And i still have my parking space. - Yeah. - All's right with the world. - Yeah. - Congratulations, adrian. Well played. Thank you, harold. I feel like celebrating. How do people celebrate? They take their friends to the nearest bar, And buy them some very expensive wine. There's one across the street. I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna do it. Who's with me? Who's gonna come? It's my treat. Wait a minute, who said that? - Who said that? - Did i say that? - I don't know. - I'm sorry i don't know. Harold? - Paul? - I'll catch up to you. Great, great. Maria, let's go. I can't go, obviously. Ah, i understand. Well, thanks for everything. And i'll talk to you later. You can't drink, Because you're pregnant. Duh. Can i help you? - You're the guy. - Pardon me? You killed the councilwoman. You were her sex lover. And you killed her. Oh, my god. - Why on earth would i-- - Why? To shut her up. To save your marriage. You knew you'd never be able to explain a pregnant girlfriend. Pregnant girlfriend? I read the coroner's report, mr. Monk. Eileen wasn't pregnant. That's right. She wasn't. But you thought she was. The day she disappeared, Lieutenant disher asked you if eileen had been drinking. Do you rember what she said? Had she been drinking? No, no, no. She wouldn't be drinking now. ""She wouldn't be drinking now."" Why did you phrase it like that? Only one reason. You thought she was pregnant. You don't like the way i phrased an answer? What kind of evidence is that? Actually, The key piece of evidence was right in front of me the whole time. It was her. Me? What? I don't know how i could've missed it. Eileen hill was a well-Educated professional woman. She was an adult. This woman, on the other hand, is a dolt. Adult, dolt. Adult, dolt. - Adult, dolt, adult dolt-- - Mr. Monk, she's right here. She knows she's an idiot. She can't even answer a phone. Have you ever tried talking to her? It's torture. Question, why would eileen hill hire a moron like that? The answer is simple and heart breaking. To convince you that she was pregnant. To manipulate you, to get you to leave your wife. She need to have a home pregnancy test come out positive. And for that, she need pregnant urine. Pregnant urine? That's why she advertised in a lamaze class. She need to hire a pregnant woman, So she could give her a drug test. It was all about the drug test. It's the only possible reason why eileen hill-- Or anyone-- Would hire this person. He doesn't mean it. Of course, you did have some trouble When you were dumping the body. ??? ????? But there were two couple tourists on the pier(???). Did they see you? Did they take a picture? You probably weren't sure, but you couldn't take a chance. Still waiting for some proof, mr. Monk. Real evidence. You mean, like this? Chalmers of london. Imported. Custom made. Just like the one that was around eileen hill's neck. Sheriff. Mr. Crawford, would you come with us, please? Yeah. Looks like we have two reasons to celebrate. Come on. A dolt? Sorry? Is that what you think? After i came down here and voted for you And helped save your stupid parking garage? You think i'm an idiot? I-- I-- I didn't say that. Yes, you did. Like, 20 times. You said i was a moron, And that the only reason anyone would hire me was for my pee. Okay, maria, i'm sorry. I got excited. You know, people say things when they get excited. I can say things too. I'm changing my vote. - What? - I'm changing my vote. - What? - I want the playground, Not the parking garage. Okay, wait a second, you can't-- Harold, she can't do that. It's too late, right? In point of fact, it's not too late at all. This is only a recess. The meeting hasn't been officially adjourned. So the vote isn't final. - Read the bylaws. - I read the bylaws. Well, read them again. Let's reconvene the meeting. We're gonna be voting again. Uh, for the record, i don't think you're a dolt. Maria. Your boss looks pretty depressed. May i suggest that you call his new therapist? - What was his name again? - Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell. See you in the waiting room. - Nice work. - I'm sorry, i'm sorry. Okay? Future site of the trudy monk memorial playground"

We should get to the bookstore. Christine, you were pretty rough on some of your costars in the book. Just told it like it was. - How do you think they react to that? - They'll get over it. Steven dorn sounded pretty angry. - Steven dorn can write his own book. - He said you better watch your back. Well, maybe I should have one of you boys start my car for me. Wait, I don't need to. I can start it from here. -= 801 =- ""Mr. Monk's Favorite Show"" It's a jungle out there disorder and confusion everywhere no one seems to care well, I do hey, who's in charge here?

He's her biggest fan. Natalie, there she is. It's really her. I can't believe somebody tried to hurt her After she brought so much happiness to so many people. - We know. - We've seen the list.

Cathy Cooper all grown up. This isn't really a good time for us right now. I'm sure you understand. I should explain. I'm Adrian Monk. I'm working with the San Francisco police. That's why i'm here. I'm not some crazy, fanatical groupie. God, i can't believe i'm actually talking to you. I'm Natalie Teeger. I'm mr. Monk's assistant. - Why are you wiping? - Tell you later? - How do you feel? - I feel very lucky. Of course. - And scared to death. - Of course. I'm sorry, I'm Kim Kelly. I'm Christine's publicist. - Can I talk to you for a moment? - Sure. I'm just gonna. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. I've heard your name, of course. You've helped a lot of people, haven't you? I'm scared to death M. Monk. The person who did this, he isn't gonna stop. Someone's been sending her letters, horrible letters, ever since she started writing her book. Yes, yes, the captain did mention that. The police say it's just an overzealous fan. We thought so too, but after this, she needs a bodyguard. Bodyguard, right. Someone we can trust. I know you're busy. I'll do it. Okay. $1,000 a week, is that fair? It's a deal, I can't pay it all at once. No, we would pay you. Even better. Of course. So glad to help. Thank you. I'm so relieved. I can breathe now. I can't wait to tell Christine. Welcome to the family. I'm in the family. I'm in the Cooper clan. Janey, I can't find my new beatles record. Scamp took it. He likes the Beatles. Our dog is a hippie. We should have known, because he hates taking baths. Scamp, come back here. Danny, Janey, I told you before. No running in the house. That's it. You're both grounded. You're not the boss of us, Cathy. When I'm wearing this, I am. Billy, where are you going? To the bathroom. Where's your hall pass? - You need to get one from mom. - Shucky darns. All I can say is she better write fast. Ever since you were elected to the safety patrol, - you've been driving us crazy. - You're like a mad dictator. - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. Let me guess, you never Miss a rerun. - Yes, you are. - Reruns? Are you telling me you know ever line of dialogue but you haven't seen an episode in 35 years? Not crazy, just a fan. I'm proud of you for wanting to keep people safe, honey, but here at home, that's my job. You don't want to put me out of work, do you? I never thought of it like that. I guess Danny was right. I let all that power go to my head. I'm sorry, dad. I let you down. Danny's playing that music again. Better go have a talk with him. Can I borrow your sash? He was such a great dad. What was he like, you know, in real life? Was he nice? - You haven't read my book, have you? - No, not yet. I can't wait. Listen, let's watch the the babysitter episode. Could we please? I love the part where you and Janey turn back all the clocks, right? So that you could stay up later. You two were such rascals. How's the investigation going, Mr. Monk? - Anything to report? - Well, we have this Surveillance photo from the radio station. He was standing across the street before the car exploded. The police said he was there all morning. Right. Christine said she never saw him before. How'bout you? No, sorry. What about the letters? Well, I'm gonna see captain Stottlemeyer later today. I should know a lot more then. What do we do in the meantime? Well, I suggest we watch a few more episodes ofthe Cooper clan and then take a tour of the house. Why don't we take a tour of the house right now? Shucky Darns. Get it? That was what Billy said. Could you stop worrying for five minutes? It's my job to worry. Super-Duper Cooper Cooper clan. And this, of course, is the bedroom. Where does that lead? The patio. You want to make sure those doors are double bolted and change the locks. Yes, sir. I'll take care of it. And you're gonna need to black out all those windows. Buy some curtains. Make sure they're heavy. Remember when Billy and Danny rigged all the window curtains to make you think there was a ghost? That was another classic. A mirror? Very good. Excellent precaution. I see, so that if you're lying in bed and someone breaks in through that door You have the Triangul or - I don't get it. - It's more of a personal thing. You know, you should really read my book. Yeah, yeah, I can't wait. We have a permit for that. That was my idea. I had Christine buy one after she received her first letter. Good, good. But then in season five, right, the bake sale episode, you ate those brownies and you never had any reaction. Well, maybe Dr. Nabors gave me some medicine. You mean Dr. Norberg. That's impossible, because at the end of the tonsils episode, dr. Norberg said he was retiring. I don't know. I just I don't know. - Do you have any other questions? - Yes, yes, I do. I mean not related to the show. Well, I have a photo shoot later, so I better get dressed. Do you want to come with me, Mr. Bodyguard? No, I don't think that's necessary. Shy? I like that in a man. She likes anything in a man. The silver globe. - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah. This hunk of metal saved her career. She won it for a Tv movie about anorexia. The vanishing girl, I remember. That was the only awards show I ever saw. I was probably more nervous that she was. And it went on forever, didn't it? First that guy came out and told all those jokes. - That was Bob hope. - Whatever. And then the two accountants came out and went on and on and on about all the rules. They were from Fineman and Kelly. They tabulated the ballots. Yeah, and then finally they announced her name, best supporting actress, Christine Rapp. God, I was so happy. I was. I was cheering like, ""ahh"" He's gonna kill me. - How'd he get in? - I don't know. - Maybe through the basement. - She's got to be a mess. She's a basket case. I told her to check in to a motel under an assumed name. That's a good idea. There's no fingerprints on the lipstick. No fingerprints on the mirror. And the handwriting, such as it is, matches the letters. They're all postmarked sunset heights. Any fibers, DNA? Negative. Envelopes are clean too. Wait a second. What is it? I know this sounds crazy, but I've seen this handwriting somewhere before. Where? I don't know. - Somewhere. - Well, he's obviously disguising it. - He probably uses his left hand. - That makes sense. Or if he was a lefty he used his right hand. - That makes sense. - Or if he was ambidextrous, he probably got drunk and then wrote it. - That makes less sense. - You want to look at them again? I don't have to. I didn't write them. How'bout this morning, steven, around 7:45? I was in bed, alone. - Well, that's unfortunate. - I agree. Keep your mouth shut. I wonder what he was referring to. You really, really need to read her book. Yeah, will read it later when I have some time. - I want to savor it. - No, see, Mr. Monk, this is the thing. You're not gonna want to savor this one, believe me. Is that Billy Cooper? Yeah, I think that's the guy who played Billy Cooper. Is this you? - That could be anybody. - I didn't ask if it was anybody. It's not me. Okay, do you own a sweatshirt like that? I just told you it's not me. Am I some sort of suspect here or Shucky Darns. Hey, Steven. Hey, Shucky Darns. Steven. Shucky darns! - Shucky Darns. - Monk, come here. That's what he said on the show almost every week, right? - You remember? You remember? - Do I rember? Yeah. Yeah, sorta rings a bell. - Who is this guy? - I'm Adrian Monk. Have you been receiving letters too? Oh, my god. He's probably after the whole cast. Okay, it's gonna be okay. We got a photo of the guy. We got samples of his handwriting. All right, listen, we are gonna We are gonna catch this creep. Me and him, don't you worry. You have my word, because he picked on the wrong family. Monk, we are questioning Mr. Dorn about the accident this morning. He is a person of interest. This some kind of a joke, captain? He was in the Cooper clan. He was Billy. Billy cooper. Say, ""Shucky Darns."" Come on just say it. ""Her former Costar, Steven Dorn, declared'Christine rapp is dead to me.'"" that is a figure of speech. ""She's a loudmouth, a liar, and a tramp. ""Next time I run into her, I hope I'm driving a truck."" Did you say that? Why would you say that? Because she's a loudmouth, a liar, and a tramp. Are we talking about the same Christine Rapp, the actr She She was your sister. - He hasn't read the book, has he? - No. I know you're not officially on the force anymore, and I can't give you orders, but I am ordering you to go home and read this book. Oh, my god. My god. Oh my god. - You okay? - This is horrible. It's horrible. What are you drinking? - Tea. - Is it hot? - Yes. - Good. Pour it into my eyes. - Do it, blind me. - You know what, she's an actress. They all have problems, especially when they start that young. - Judy Garland - What is that? - I don't know. - Thank you for not knowing. You're welcome. This is unbelievable. Of course someone's trying to kill her. Anyone she's ever met has a motive. Anyone who's ever read this has a motive. There's a page missing, page 73. - Maybe it fell out. - Pages don't fall out. It fell out. - It was torn out. - It fell out. Stop it, stop it, stop it. No, Mr. Monk, you don't want to see page 73. It can't be any worse than the rest of it. You wanna bet? - I have to know. - No, Mr. Monk, please. - Mr. Monk, please. - It's my book. Let me see it. Let me see it. What are you doing? It's for your own good. That's $87. Is this mastercard or - Do you take cash? - Sure, yeah, cash will do. Great. - Do i know you? - No, you do not. Okay, room eight is just up those stairs. Hello, I'm at the Safari in near the airport. Somebody's been shot. We'll just be a little while longer. There she is. Did anybody else know you were here? He must have followed her. Obviously, you checked in. I checked in. I was walking to my room. He was right there. He just came at me. - Did you see a weapon? - A knife. He had a knife. He said, ""I got you this time."" I had a gun, my gun, in my purse. I pulled it out. I wasn't even thinking. I just closed my eyes and bang. You OK? Well, if you're not too busy, the body's over here. Thank you. - So who was he? - A nobody. Well, as close to a nobody as you're gonna find. Timlinson. We just Ran his name. Never been arrested. Not even a traffic ticket. Manages a taco bell. Before that, 15 years with the city parks and maintenance. Before that, he was in the mail room at some accounting firm. Before that, a couple years of community college. Under the radar his whole life - until about an hour ago. - And he wrote all those letters? Yeah, looks like it. We found more in his coat. Plus the handwriting matches, at least to me. Plus he lives in sunset heights. That's where the letters were postmarked. Why would he do it? Maybe he loved the show. Maybe the show meant the world to him, and she betrayed everything it stood for. He read the book, didn't he? - Not page 73. - No, I ate it. Good. Miss Rapp, do you remember signing this? We found it in his car. No, but I've signed millions of those. I'll bet you have. Mr. Monk, thank you for being here. You never saw this guy before? Maybe. I meet a lot of people. Yeah, we know. We read the book. Maybe you should have called your friend Bob Denver. Mr. Monk. I'm so sorry. He's never really read anything like that before. - Can I take her home now? - Yeah. We'll bring the car around front. We'll deal with this tomorrow. I'm sorry to disappoint you, Is it true, the things in the book? The things things you did? - Not the whole truth. - I knew it. I knew it. - Thank god. - I've done a lot worse. I mean, stuff I couldn't even write about. I was young, Mr. Monk. Weren't you young once? Right? Maybe you weren't. But you've been lonely. I can tell. I was just a girl, Mr. Monk. Just a girl, trying to be a little less lonely. I don't have a lot of happy memories. Watching that show was about it. Now it's gone. Well, if that's true, I'm really sorry. Can you forgive me? Don't be mad. I know how you hate surprises, I'm gonna warn you. I'm gonna be surprising you. What? When? In about ten seconds. This is sort of a heads-up, like a surprise alert. Wait. You can't just burst in here and say, ""surprise alert."" You have to give me a little warning. OK, sorry. This is the surprise alert warning. This is the surprise alert. Now Surprise! I called ambrose, and he told me this was your favorite snack. Ten round crackers, a glass of apple juice - with one ice cube. - What's going on? And I rented this, your favorite show. I don't have a favorite show. I know how important this show is to you. You can still enjoy it. You can still watch it. All right, all right, you're 12 years old. It's Tuesday night. It's 8:00. You've been waiting all week. It's cooper Clantime. Make yourself at home with the cooper clan you'll never be alone with the Cooper clan you got Billy, Janey, Cathy, and Dan - don't forget Skip - it's scamp. Scamp, get off that divan! You wasted your money. I can't watch it. Forget about Christine Rapp and her stupid, stupid book. Everybody in Hollywood's crazy, and if we think about that stuff, nobody would ever to go the movies. - I don't go to the movies. - Or watch TV. - I don't watch TV. - You get the point. I don't. Let's just try it. Let's just watch one. Which one do you want to see? Let's see. ""Where there's fire, there's smoking."" That sounds funny. ""Slumber party pooper."" ""Grounded for life."" Well, I mean, they all sound fantastic. Let's just play the first one. Episode four, ""broken arm, broken heart."" Good choice. Episode four. Make yourself at home with the cooper clan you'll never be alone with the cooper clan picture go fast. - It just started. - Picture go fast. Picture regular. Picture regular. Hey, Jimmy, you want to sign my cast? Nobody groovy wants to sign my cast. Picture freezer. Picture freezer. The ""E"" and the ""T"". - It's the same handwriting. - As what? As the mirror and the letters sent to Christine Rapp. I knew I'd seen it before. She wrote those letters to herself - with her left hand. - Why? So she could kill Victor Timlinson and claim it was self-defense. - She was setting him up. - You heard the captain. - He was a nobody. - Well, he was somebody to her. Hello? Hello, Mr. Timlinson? - I don't think he's home. - Probably not. He's single, and he's dead. Wait. Are you going in? - It'd be a crime not to. - It'd be a crime if we did. So it doesn't matter either way. - Don't touch anything. - I'll try not to. I was talking to myself. So what are we looking for? A connection between this guy and Christine Rapp. She killed him on purpose, They must have known each other. I don't see anything. Exactly. That's what's wrong. I mean, he was obsessed with her, remember? Where are the pictures? Where's his cooper clan lunch box? There should be a shrine. I'll go check in back. Interior decorating? I don't think so. Natalie, look at this. I got it. You know, this was your mother's favorite vase. It was a family heirloom. Do you know what heirloom means? Easily breakable? Dad, you're a surgeon. Why can't you operate on it? Wish I could, billy, but I'm afraid in this case, the patient's never gonna recover. You all know the rules about running in the house. We need to know what happened here. Which one of you broke the vase? Do you have something to say? Maybe it was a ghost. I always felt this living room was haunted. The window was open. Maybe a raccoon came in. I don't think it was a raccoon. It's not a ghost. I think the culprit is in this room right now. Why are you always accusing us? Why don't you ever get mad at Adrian? You never even suspect him. Adrian never gets in trouble. Adrian is perfect. Hey, mom. Hey, dad. Hey, Danny. Hey, Cathy. Hey, Billy. Hey, Janey. Sorry I'm late. I was busy at school because I'm so popular. Guess what. I made the football team. And guess what else. I'm the quarterback, the popular star quarterback. And nobody makes fun of me because I'm so popular. That's wonderful, Adrian. Just don't throw the ball around the house. Why not? The vase is already broken. I'm so proud of you, son. - Thanks for being a wonderful boy. - You're welcome, dad. And thank you for never driving away and leaving us forever. I would never do such a thing. You don't have to worry about that. Is there anything you'd like to say to mom and dad? Mom, dad, I have a confession. Scamp broke your vase. - Scamp? - We didn't want to tell you. We were afraid you'd send him back to the kennel. I understand why you did what you did, but it's never right to lie. Sorry, dad. Is there anything else you'd like to confess? I looked in Janey's diary. No, you know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about this. You mean, all the trophies you won playing sports? No, not my trophies. I'm talking about her silver globe award. You didn't really earn this, did you? - What you're talking about. - Here's what happened. was cancelled, your career was in trouble. I'm not listening. And when you were nominated for this award, you knew it was your last chance, and you would do anything to win. You met a fan named Victor Timlinson. He told you where he worked. It was the luckiest break of your career. He worked for an accounting firm called Fineman and Kelly. They tabulated the ballots for all the big award shows. Including the silver globes. He worked in the mail room, witch meant his the first person to see the ballots I don't know how you did it. Maybe you paid him off. Or flirted with him. But somehow you convinced him to rig the final tally. Years went by. You probably figured you'd never see him again. But when he read about your big book deal, Mr. Timlinson reappeared. He got greedy. He tried to shake you down. He threatened to tell the world the truth about how you really won this. And you knew if you paid him, he'd eventually want more. They always do. So you decided to kill him. - That's crazy talk. - You set him up! You sent those letters to yourself. You even blew up your own car. On monday night, you arranged to meet him at that motel. You shot him. You planted that knife in his hand and those letters in his coat. We've talked about this. Killing people is never the answer. I'm afraid you're grounded, young lady. It's not fair. He doesn't have any proof. The DA. Is gonna laugh you out of his office. I don't think so. 'cause I found this in timlinson's apartment in a hollowed-out book. The original ballots. Timlinson must have kept a couple as an insurance policy. - I'm very disappointed in you. - It's not just her! This whole family is wacko. It's all in her book. You know where she is now? She's in miami dancing in a strip club. What choice do I have? I have a baby to feed. Danny didn't send me any child support. I haven't seen a nickel. How do I know the kid's even mine, Janey? - What about me? - You got hooked on crystal meth. This was the last job you ever had. Shucky Darns. Do you hear that? What are they laughing at? What are you Mr. Monk, help me. - I'm not finished yet. - Mr. Monk, help me, please! Mr. Monk, help me. Help me, please. Mr. Monk, help me. Get back! Get back. Don't move. Stay there. Stay down, and just stay right there. You're in big, big trouble, young lady. That was from episode five, season two, ""grounded for life."" I used to love that one. Can I help you? Yes. I would like to return this. Was there a problem? Yes, there was a problem. She's a whore. - And she killed someone. - That too. I'm sorry you're disappointed. Here you go. Anything else? Yeah, it's hardly worth mentioning. Do you rember when I said you could keep the change? How much was it? Excuse me. Is there a problem? This page is from a different book. It's been taped in. I don't think so. ""Oliver was told that he might do what he like with his old clothes. He gave them to a servant who'd been kind to him."" - This is from Oliver Twist. - I told you. I'm sorry, - I tried to tell him. - Now I remember. See, she ate page 73, so I put another page in there, a different page. - You ruined the book. - Actually, I improved the book. That's charles dickens. It's a classic. I don't understand. Why would you do this? I believe the sign says, ""no questions."" Sorry. What? They were the only family I had. Now I got nothing. That's not true, Mr. Monk. You've me. And you have Julie, and you have Randy, and the captain. We're your family. - It's not the same. - Sure it is. - You don't say funny things. - Sure we do. Say something funny. Well, I can't just say something funny off the top of my head. - Yeah, Cathy Cooper could. - Well, she had writers. OK, wait, wait, I got one. Knock, knock. That's not funny.

Okay, this is a dime. - This is ten cents. - This is a ten? And this is five. But it is bigger. - I will never understand. - It's no problem. So do you live around here? No, I am visiting for one week. Then I'm going home to my husband. Well, ""married"" is an interesting word. It means different things to different people. To me, it means everything.

Good night. -= 802 =- ""Mr. Monk and the Foreign Man"" VO By : ¤Aka¤  &  do_Ob Team Subs-Addicts"" Wait, wait. I'm not finished. Almost. - You done? - Hold on, Mr. Monk. I'm sorry, I don't read as fast as you. Nobody does. - Hold on. - Why don't you buy your own copy? There's a newsstand right down the street. - Actually, Mr. Monk, that is my copy. - Okay, fine, take it. - Take it, read it. - You can finish it when I'm done. Yeah, it'll be old news by then. We'll have a new president. What? - What? - You smell that? - Is that you? - Is what me? Are you cooking bacon? Does it look like I'm cooking bacon? It's coming from outside. I knew it. It's a hippie. It's incense. He's burning incense down there. By the way, that's a perfect name for that stuff because that's how people react to it. They get incensed. Get it? Incense, incensed. You add the ""D"". Forget it. You can't sell that stuff without a permit. I am not selling anything. Of course you're not. Nobody wants to buy that junk. Find another street. Good-bye. - Peace and love, and Woodstock. - Woodstock? You heard me! How can you not smell that? Maybe we should call the cops. We don't have to. That was the cops. - We have a job. - Thank god. Finally be able to breathe. I can't breathe. Open a window. It is open. Why don't we light some incense? Dr. Zee says she's been dead 12 days, give or take. Her name was Maria Fuentes She was the housekeeper. Those are the owners out there, John and Carolyn Buxton. They just got back from barbados. Maria stayed behind. She was supposed to lock up the house. Excuse me, lieutenant. Do you want some liniment cream? It'll kill the smell. Nope, I'm fine. It's not my first crime scene. They got home this morning at about 8:30 came in from the garage, - he saw his cell phone. - Yeah, Buxton left his cell phone. I guess he was on vacation. So when they came in from the garage, that's when the smell hit'em. Are you trying to impress that girl? - What girl? - The CSI tech. You think that's a quality she's looking for in a man? Do you think she's saying, ""why can't I meet an attractive, to the stench of rotting flesh?"" I honestly have no idea what you're talking about. Anyway, he came in, and he practically tripped over the body. Is there anything missing from the house? - No, they're saying no. - It might have been personal. She had a boyfriend, or an ex-boyfriend. He did two months for assault last year. - She was only hit twice. - Yeah, so not a crime of passion. What do you got? It's an earring. One earring. She took it off. And this is a first aid handbook. Did someone try to treat her? I asked the owners. That book normally lives on the shelf down below. It was open like that when they found her. Maybe the killer felt bad, like remorse, and tried to help her. There's blood on the book. But the countertop underneath is clean. - What does that mean? - It means it was already there. It was already like that when she was killed. So the killer opened the book to the page about head trauma before he hit her over the head? So it would appear. That's very unusual. Are you sure you're okay? You're turning green. I'm just hungry Green with hunger. You're green with hunger? Yeah, it's a You never heard that before? - No, I never have. - It's a very common expression. I've got to I've got to go. Somebody called maybe. Just checking on some evidence. Sergeant. For the love of crackers. I should have known. Do you mind? It's 7:45. People are trying to sleep. - They are? - Yes, they are. So cut out the Jam session. This is not the fillmore west, and you are not Louis Armstron okay? Look, here's $5. All right? Go to the park and buy yourself a drink. I'm sorry, but I cannot leave. - Sure you can. I'll help you. - You do not understand. - I cannot leave this corner. - Why not? My wife was killed here. Your wife? Two weeks ago on this corner. This is sacred ground. Here we are. Please, make yourself comfortable. I have some juice. I'm very happy for you. No, no, no, no. I'm offering you some juice. Would you like some juice? I'm sorry. Thank you. I don't know your name. What does it mean? It means nobody picks you for their softball team in seventh grade. I am Samuel Waingaya. Tell me about her. Here, sit down. Her name was Ansara. It means sunflower. That is what she was. She was a school teacher. This is why she was here A teaching conference, two weeks in San Francisco. - She was so excited. - What happened? I don't know exactly, but she was at the grocery store down the street buying food, and a vehicle, I think a van, drove through a red light. It kept going. A hit-and-run. I remember reading about that. I was out of town when it happened. But it was in all the newspapers when I got back. How do they know it was a van? They don't, but I do. I saw the tire tracks on the street. They were still there when I got here. I know something about cars. I'm a mechanic back home. They were in the road. They are from a headlamp. Have you been to the police? They are doing all they can. That is what they say. And you made these? ""Reward for information. That's very generous. Not really. It is $85. I am not a rich man like you. What, what, what, what is this? What are you doing? I'm so sorry. It's so rude of me. Please, would you like one? No, no, no thank you. But do you Do you have to It calms my nerves. You did say for me to make myself at home. Did I misunderstand? Wait a minute. Hold on. Here. Breathe it into this. Okay? See? There you go. And there you are. I love it. It's ingenious. - What do you call it? - A smoking bag. I've never heard of such a thing. Is it new? Yes, it's brand-new. This would be very popular in Nigeria. Right, right. Here you go. I am sorry to wake you, Adrian Monk. It will not happen again. Thank you for your juice. Yeah, Samuel, don't go. I'm I'm a police detective. I'm very good at it. I'm sure you are. Here's the thing. I want to help you. I I I'm going to help you. We're gonna find the man who killed your wife. You want to help me? But I don't understand. It's just like in the movies. You've never been here? You said you spoke to the police. Downstairs, just for ten minutes only. They said that they would call me. Two weeks. No calls. No hope. Until now. Do you drink coffee? - I love coffee. - Then you're gonna hate this. What? What you said about the coffee. It was very funny. - Am I that funny? - No. Hey, here it is. Technically, you shouldn't be seeing this. This is from a gas station surveillance camera. It's about a minute after the accident, half a mile east. Excuse me, captain Stottlemeyer. It was not an accident. When he hit her, that was an accident. Driving away and leaving her there, that was murder. I appreciate that, Mr. Waingaya. That's why we're here. Here it is. There. We think that's the guy. He's moving pretty quick, and he's missing a headlamp. You were right. It's a van. What does that mean? You do not want to know. Adrian Monk knows. What about the headlight? Can we trace it? We've got sergeant Kramer's report right here. He already tried. Every garage within ten miles, nothing turned up. Mr. Waingaya, the case is open. Sergeant Kramer's a good guy. He's gonna do his best. But cases like this are very, very hard to solve. Do you understand? You can't ask for miracles. Ansara used to say, ""miracles happen every day you just have to know where to look."" Excuse me, there's no smoking in the building. It's okay, lieutenant Disher, I know the routine. I brought my smoking bag. Your smoking bag? He's trying to quit. He's down to two bags a day. Did you hear that? She said two bags instead of two packs. Thank you so much, Natalie Teeger, for teaching me how to laugh again. You know, there's a smoking section down at the end of the hall. Natalie, Randy, why don't you take Mr. Waingaya and his bag We don't have a smoking area. Just go to the conference room and open a window. Yes, sir. Mr. Waingaya, if you'll follow me. Two bags, it's very funny. - Where is ""picture go regular""? - What are you doing? Well, I might have missed something. No, I'm talking about your friend Samuel. What are you doing getting his hopes up like that? You and I both know the odds against solving a two-week-old hit-and-run with virtually no evidence. Monk, it's 1,000 to 1, probably worse. Now this case, Maria Fuentes, the murdered housekeeper, this case This case is fresh. It's piping hot. It's solvable if we act fast. We are going back to the house. We gonna walk the property talk to the neighbors. I can't help you. I'm sorry. I'm working with Samuel. - You're working with Samuel? - He lost his wife, Leland. They ran Trudy over and just kept on driving. You mean Ansara. Trudy was your wife. Wait a second. Picture go back. Make picture go back. All right. There you go. Picture go regular. Is that the same van? He turned around. The surveillance camera is there. He was driving west. He was getting away. Then he turned around. Why would he turn around? - Guilt. - No, he did not come back to help my wife or call a doctor. There was no guilt. Excuse me. How are you guys doing? - We're living the dream, man. - Great. Are you guys here a lot, drinking beer? Hanging out? Slacking, you know, off? Slacking off? Are you a cop? Not technically. It's a long story. Hey, we got time. And we love stories. I was suffering from what the doctors called a psychotic break - They don't care. - No. Okay, there was a hit-and-run two weeks ago on pine street. - Did you hear anything about it? - It was on the 17th, a tuesday night. Please try to remember. Were you guys here that night around 8:15? Probably. Do you remember seeing a van with a broken headlight? He was going that way. He must have been doing about 80. Wait, yeah, yeah. Dude, they won't let us use the bathroom here, right? So I had to cross the street and use the one at that diner. And some dude in a van almost hit me. Do you remember this? There's a bathroom at that diner? I will never forget it, even if I live to be, like, as old as you, man. flips a u-ey, almost hits me again. Did you see his face? Did you see the driver? He was, like, hunched over like he was on his cell phone or something. Cell phone. He was headed into the tunnel. That's why he turned around. He didn't want the call to be interrupted. What about the van? What color was it? I have no idea. Well, do you remember anything else? I have a dentist appointment tomorrow. About the van. You know what, I think it was, like, an exterminator van or something. Exterminator. Because I looked up and it had these big letters on it. It said ""poison"". Poison. Yeah, I remember looking right at it and saying, ""poison?"" This is how we do our laundry in America. - These are your whites. - My whites, excellent. Your off-whites. Your off-off-white. These are the primary colors red, yellow, green, blue, and that's indigo. Left socks, right socks. I've labeled them for you. But in nigeria, we just wash all of our socks together. Well, I don't like to judge people, but that's wrong. So you mean you separate everything? But how much is that going to cost? $200. But I've been watching the friends on tv for years. This is not how they do it. - What friends? - You know, the Tv show friends - Lisa Kudrow? - Jennifer Aniston? Yeah, we don't get the African Tv here. I've been looking at trucks on the street. None of them say ""poison."" Yeah, I know. It doesn't make sense. Exterminator vans usually say ""pest control"". Or something like that. I can't figure it out, but I will. I know you will. Excuse me, are you using all the machines? That's right. But they're empty. That is the pre-wash cleansing cycle. The pre-wash what? The cleansing cycle. If you are going to live here, you should learn some of the customs. Did you see that, with the finger? - What does that mean? - That means ""we're number one."" And we should hurry. He's not an exterminator. - He's not? - He works at a restaurant. A french restaurant. The boy made a mistake. The truck did not say ""poison."" It said ""poisson."" Poisson Fish. Very good. Good work, Samuel. We are gonna get this man. And he is going to pay for what he did to us. To us? I mean to you. What he did to you. This is the van. We can't just say that. We have to be sure. I am sure. Look at this light. - It doesn't look new. - Exactly. He is diabolical. He has replaced the broken headlight with an old headlight, not a new one. It's been repainted, see? Maybe. Maybe. What is it? Rice. Ansara was buying food the night she died. She bought rice. I saw the sales receipt. We have to bring this to the police. - What? - I need a bag. This is the third bowl you chipped . I don't want to hear your excuses. I've been warning you for a month. Mr. Nichols,  I'll pay for the bowl. You can take it out of my pay. Tell me what it's worth. It's worth of a lot more than you. Adios. You're fired. You can pick up your check on Friday. The apron. What does that mean? Good morning. Beautiful. That's where she was killed. But there's no marker. It seems like there should be a plaque or something. She is not Trudy. I spoke to Natalie. She's worried about you. - I'm worried about Natalie. - Shut up. Let me talk. You and I both know what's going on here. You're frustrated. It's been 12 years since Trudy. You're getting your wires crossed. We haven't been able to solve her murder, you're fixating on this case, - on this woman. - I'm not fixating. There's got to be six dozen flowers here. Natalie says you've missed two appointments with Dr. Bell, and you're not eating. I'm not hungry. She also said that That you and your friend Samuel have a suspect. - Kenneth Nichols. - And you're planning to go undercover in his restaurant to get closer to him? ""He's the guy."" You don't happen to have an I don't know, say, evidence? He has a record Drunk driving. And we found some rice on the van. Some rice? - Well, doesn't he own a restaurant? - Yes. Well, it's not exactly a smoking gun, is it? There's rice all over this town. It's the San Francisco treat. All right, I'll check the guy out. I'm on it. I promise. But you, you need to step back, buddy. OK, I was there 12 years ago. It ate you up. You were crippled. You could not leave your room. I won't allow that to happen again. So promise me that you'll think hard, long and hard before you do anything stupid. I promise. Good. Have a good day. - Looks good. - What is that? Is that a speck? We better make sure. I need a plate. Where are they? - What have you been doing? - Well, We did this fork and this knife. We've been washing them American style. What the hell does that mean? What about the potatoes? What did you do? You were just supposed to peel them. They look like dice. - American style. - American style. Why do you keep saying that? That doesn't make any sense. - Is there a problem here? - No, sir. These are the new dishwashers. Monsieur Adrian and monsieur Samuel. I was just showing them the ropes. They can't be any worse than the two clowns we just fired. Well, I stand corrected. That's coming out of your pay. I  did a fish run. When they're done here, I want you to - have them unload the van. - Will do. I'll be at the bar if you need me. Please don't need me. You heard the man. Retournez au travail. Get back to work! Tuesday the 17th, the farmers' market. Kenneth picks up fish and produce every week, - if he's sober enough. - And where is the farmers' market? Vinton street, near the wharf. - How far is that from where - It's close, maybe five blocks. Then the puzzle is complete. He was driving back from the farmers' market. He's  an alcoholic. He had been drinking, - and he ran a red light. - Maybe. Not maybe. Yes, this is what happened. There's no proof. We need evidence. When we prove it, if we prove it, and you want to Do something to him, I'll help you. Why would you do this for me? - You didn't even know her. - Of course I knew her. We were married for seven years. What are they doing here? Who? John and Carolyn Buxton. I was just at their house. Their maid was killed two weeks ago. Adrian Monk, what is going on? I don't know. She was on the phone. - Who was on the phone? - The maid. The woman who was killed. That's why she removed her earring. Hello, my name is Adrian. I'll be your server. I have your soup. We haven't ordered yet. I just assumed you wanted soup. Was I right? And for the lady, tiramisu. Dessert? Why wait until the last minute? I understand you're friends of my employer, Mr. Nichols. Yes, we've known Kenneth for years. Why? - Have we met? - No. I'm new here. I'm sorry to hear about your housekeeper. Someone mentioned that she was killed recently. She was bludgeoned the death. Is that right? More coffee? Wait a minute, I do know you. He was there. He's with the police. Are you a detective? Actually, - I'm moonlighting. - As Waiter? Well, You know our motto, to protect and serve. When I'm a cop, I protect. And at night, I serve. - But it's day. - Exactly. I've been thinking about your case. The morning you returned from your trip, - you said you found your cell phone. - That's right. I forgot to take it with me to Barbados. - It's no big deal. - But when you got home It was lying on the kitchen floor. What's this all about? I'm just tying up loose ends. How is that tiramisu? It's good. Delicious. Great. I'll tell the chef. Yes, one more thing. Does Kenneth Nichols have your cell phone number? Kenneth? Of course he does. We talk all the time. Especially during baseball season. They talk after every game. May we see the wine list? Definitely - and we can prove it? - We can't prove it . He committed another murder, a maid, a housekeeper, the same night. Where's the phone? This way. - Who are you calling? - Captain Stottlemeyer. We need a copy of Nicholson phone bill. That's the smoking gun. Actually, this is the smoking gun. Outside, the both of you. I think it's time for you have a break The smell! I can't breathe! I can't get a break. First the incense, then the dead housekeeper, and now this. God it stinks! It's like chemical warfare. Will you please stop talking about the smell? Sometimes you are like a big, crying infant. We have other problems, Adrian Monk. That's better. Can I say something? - Is it about the stink? - No. Yes! I can't breathe! Would you just think of something else. You said that another woman was killed. - What did you mean? - It stinks in here! Adrian Monk, just keep talking. Here's what happened. Kenneth Nichols was driving that night. He was in this van. He called his friend John Buxton, but Buxton wasn't there. He was in Barbados on vacation. The housekeeper, Maria Fuentes, answered his cell phone. They talked for a minute. While they were talking - what happened next? - He hit her and kept driving. My god, I just hit somebody. Maria overheard everything. At that point She knew too much. He had to keep her quiet. So he kept her on the phone. He kept her talking while he drove across town. I pulled over, she's hurt pretty bad. But someone's called 911, an ambulance is on the way. Hold on. I have a book here. It says to keep her warm and keep her head still. She was a flower. She was so young. She was just beginning. We are turning. What is happening now? Now he kills us. Fine with me. We must go on. They would want us to go on. They would want us to be strong. They are here with us now. Do you not feel it? Not anymore. Well, I am not going to give up. And neither are you. This is your final lesson. This is how we do things in America. We cry a lot. We confuse our dead wife with other people's dead wives. And then we give up. - We're stopping. - That can't be good. We've got to get these ropes off. God. I have an idea. I have an idea. Can you reach into my pants? My cigarette lighter. I got it. I got it. What's that smell? My flesh, it's burning. It stinks. Sorry. Look at her! Look at her! Son of a bitch. Her name was Ansara. Say her name. Say it! - Say it! - -Ansara. That's Trudy. Say her name. - I didn't know her. - Say her name! - I never met her. - Say her name. All right. Trudy. Here. - What are these? - A good-bye present. It's comedy cds. It's Richard Pryor, Monty python, Bill Cosby. If you think I'm funny, these guys are gonna rock your world. Thank you. But I know these guys, and they are not as funny as Natalie Teeger. ""Two bags a day."" How do you do it? I don't know. I'm just funny. I am. I guess this is good-bye. There is no such thing. We will meet again, Adrian Monk. Someday you will come to Africa to visit. Maybe. No maybe. I'm saying yes. Or you will come back here. Either one, we'll see. We'll see. Nobody knows. What's it like? What is what like? Knowing. Knowing is everything. But your turn will come, Adrian Monk. You are next. Do not give up. Never. This is for you. Thank you. No man has a greater friend than Adrian Monk. No man has a greater friend than Samuel Waingaya.

"Are you mad at me? You're mad at me. I'm a detective. I can tell. - I didn't do anything wrong. - You didn't do anything. That's the problem. You didn't say a single word all night. I don't understand. Why did you want to come? You begged me to invite you. I didn't want to be alone. You were gonna be gone all weekend. It's embarrassing. Those people are my oldest friends. Everybody thought you were sick or something. You just walked around rearranging spoons and plates and sweeping up crumbs. Couldn't you have at least tried? I tried. I smiled. - I smiled a lot. - You were wincing! That's my smile. That's how I smile. I'm just not a people person. But what does that mean? What does that mean? You're not human? Actually you know what? That would explain a lot. It wouldn't explain everything, but it would explain a lot. - Did you hear that? - That can't be good. - Why are we in this car? - I told you Julie borrowed my car. - She's moving some furniture. - We are in the wrong car. - This is the wrong car! - Well, it's too late now! It's not the radiator hose. - What about that? - That's the radiator hose. It's not that. It's not the battery. - It's not the alternator. - What about that? That's the radiator hose, Mr. Monk. You keep pointing to the same thing. Here. Call for help. - It says ""no signal."" - Well, then go try over there. -= 803 =- ""Mr. Monk and the UFO"" VO By : ¤Aka¤  &  do_Ob Well, for starters, you got a blown solenoid. That's just for starters. - Everybody needs their eyes checked. - Stop saying that. I don't need glasses. I definitely saw something. It was some kind of aircraft. I'm sure you did, Mr. Monk. At least you think you did. It knocked out one, two, three routing switches. Fried some wiring. It's gonna run you 300, parts and labor. Well, when will it be ready? - Tomorrow if you're lucky. - Excuse me. Is there an air force base around here? An air force base? Can't say there is, because there ain't. Weather station? No. We got a new putt-putt course out on highway nine. You're probably wondering why I'm asking. - Not particularly. - I saw something in the sky last night. Some kind of hovering thing. A hovering thing? Like a flying saucer? Not a saucer, no. Okay, yes. Yes, it was sort of Saucer-shaped. I know that sounds crazy. Not to me. I saw a ghost once. What? Not the same thing. I saw a ghost. It was in my stepfather's barn. Right, right. What you saw was real but I didn't see a ghost? There's a difference. I'm not you. I, I make my living up here with my head. - You're calling me stupid. - No. No, that's not what he meant. Well, maybe I'm not smart enough to fix your car. No, no, no, no. Sir, sir, sir. Mister, mister Boom. What my friend meant to say No, no. You can fix the car. You're car smart. I'm car smart? Is that what you just said? - I don't remember. - Okay, you know what? Here's my new estimate. - $800. - You just said 300! Well, I must've added the numbers wrong. I was confused. You see, I'm not really smart up here. I'll go write it up. - Apologize. - Okay, I'm sorry. Not to me. To the guy. - What for? - You called him stupid! - Well - You can't say things like that. He's a human being. He has feelings. Do you have no empathy at all for other people? Put yourself in his place. You know, imagine being him. Okay, I'm him. Oh, god, I got to go take a shower and finish high school. Sorry. Yeah, me too. We don't accept checks. Captain. Hey, it's Natalie. I don't think we're gonna be making that traing seminar today. That's all right. We can reschedule it. - What's going on? You okay? - Yeah, I think so. - You think so? - Well, I'm in Nevada with Mr. Monk. My car broke down. We're in some town called Vintonville. - I've never heard of it. - I don't think actually on any maps. - What's wrong with the car? - I don't know. There's only one mechanic in town. His name is Boom Boom and he already hates us. How's Monk holding up? Not so good. He thinks he saw a UFO. Really? Maybe they're there to take him home. Maybe that's his ride. That's what I said! That would explain a lot, wouldn't it? - I'm really worried, sheriff. - I can see that, Dolly. It's not like her. All her lights have been out for four days. How do you explain that? We both know what Margie's like. Remember three years ago? She ran off to reno with the accordion player. - Excuse me. - I'll be right with you. - Unless it's an emergency. - No. Good. Because Frankly I wouldn't know what to do if it was. Why didn't she ask me to bring in her mail? She always asks me to bring in her mail. Because maybe she left in a hurry. Maybe she got swept off her feet. - This is Marge we're talking about. - Can't you go in and look around. I don't have any cause, Dolly. It's only been four days. Come on, I will bet you a slice of your award-winning pecan pie that next week she shows up with a new boyfriend or a new tattoo or both. It is gonna work itself out, I promise. It always does. Everybody's business is everybody else's business. That's why we live here, I guess. So, how can I help you, mister I was at a wedding last night in Montville with my assistant. And we were driving home and the car broke down. It was about a mile north of here. There was a bridge. - Yeah, west creek bridge. - Well, - I saw something. - Okay. In in the sky. Yeah, it was about 10:30 pm. And it was all lit up. It was hovering there. And, and it went zipping around. - You saw a UFO? - No, I didn't say that. So, was it an object? Could you identify it? - No, no. - And it was flying. You add that all up, Mr. Monk, you've got yourself a UFO. All I'm asking is this: did anyone else see anything last night? No, sir. Nothing was reported. You know, the weather out here can be a little bit tricky. Occasionally we get something called dry lightening. No, this wasn't lightening. It was a vehicle. It was a flying thing. Where are you staying? We're at the sleep inn out on route four. Okay, well, I will call you if I hear anything. Thank you so much for stopping by. Can I just say one thing here? Okay, I am not one of those, you know, nuts. I'm a former detective. I work for the San Francisco police quite a bit. - In fact, you can call them. - That won't be necessary. I believe you saw what you saw. Let me show you something, Mr. Monk. These are the cases that I have pending. I've got a rabid raccoon on the loose. And I've got teenagers knocking over some mailboxes. And now I've got dolly who thinks that her neighbor's gone missing. And this is a busy week for me. To tell you the truth, I kind of hope you're right. I mean, a Martian invasion would be quite a nice change of pace around here. Look there! What's that? What's that over there? It's a firefly. While I was at the library, I did some research on u - You know. Right. - UFOS. And they said it's usually swamp gas. Yeah, you could be right. Except we're I think I was just tired and seeing things. Yeah, that's what I think. I got your message about your staying another night. Is that okay? Sure, no problem. Stay as long as you want. It's nice to have the company and the truth is it's been pretty quiet. Is there a problem with your room? I couldn't help noticing all your cleaning supplies. It's fine. The hotel's great. This is just a hobby. He only bought one bag. That's like giving you a gold star. Cheese and crackers. You see that? - Are you nodding? - Yeah, I am. I bet they came from Andromeda. From the first or second nebulae, Which means they've been traveling for 5,217 years. There are no inhabitable planets In the Andromeda galaxy, Nimrod. - Don't call him Nimrod. - It's okay. It's my name. Hey! Guys! Guys, you know there was a sighting here 65 years ago. Government said that it was a weather balloon. - A weather balloon? - Excuse me. Did you make the video, the one on the internet? - That was me. - Where'd you see it? Over there, right above that tree. Who are they? It's the internet, Mr. Monk. News like this travels fast. The internet people. Hi. Is this the lobby? - It's right over there. - What's going on here? - Is there a loser convention in town? - Somebody saw a flying saucer. - A flying saucer? - I know. The image i saw was clearly a class four Intergalactic doom freighter. Flying saucer? They're coming for the oxygen. Have the negotiations started yet? We haven't heard. I'm gonna call the garage, see if the car's ready. Yeah, dial fast. Dial like the wind. Excuse me. The hotel Clerk said that you were the alpha contact. The alpha contact? The first to see them. Did the saucer make any noise? Were the lights blinking? And was it like a random blinking Or was it more rhythmic? Were you probed? Are you sure? Sometimes they probe you and give you an amnesia Pill. Yeah, I'd remember. Sometimes they give you a frontal lobotomy. I'd still remember. Natalie! Pardon me. Pardon me. The part's not in yet. I think he's still mad at you. - Call him again. Call him back! - It was just 2 minutes ago. Offer him more money. Offer to marry him! They found the landing site! Excuse me. Don't touch that. That could be evidence. One, two, three, four depressions. Maybe it's from the landing gear. Holy moly! This one actually might be real! A real one finally. Can't wait to tell my stepdad. He's been laughing at me for 20 years. Look at these burn marks. They must be from the From the what do you call it? The thrusters. Somebody should get a picture of this. - So, what do you think? - I can't think. All these internet people. We're going to fan out And look for the rest of the fleet. Great idea. Fan out. Fan way out. Way, way, way, way out. Well, there was something here. I mean, something made these impressions. It had to be last night because it rained yesterday. Mr. Monk, isn't it possible? - We both saw what we saw. - No! No, it is not possible. Of course it's possible. As Carl Sagan said, ""It's pure hubris to assume our tiny blue marble Could contain the only intelligent life in the galaxy."" The aliens have arrived. - Or. - Or what? Or anything. Any other explanation. It might have been some kind of a prank. Maybe some college kids. - Why would they bother? - I don't know. All I know is it wasn't from - outer space. - All right? Let's agree to disagree? Let's agree to not even do that. Wipe. - What is he doing? - He has a little germ thing. You afraid of our germs? Not yours in particular. Anybody's. - He's not sweating. - Yeah, I noticed that too. - How come you're not sweating? - I don't sweat. - I it's a glandular thing. - He was the alpha contact. He was going like this. What do you think it means? - It's some kind of signal. - No, it's not a signal. - It it just helps me concentrate. - Can we see your Belly Button? No, you may not. - What are you doing? - We're showing you ours. Now you show us yours. He has a Belly Button, okay? Pretty sure. You're pretty sure? But you've never seen it. - He's not an alien. - Are you sure about that? How often do you excrete? See, our car's in the shop. - So, and we think it's ready. - I think they're calling, actually. - They're ready. They just called me. - Another day? It's my distributor. He sent me the wrong part. I guess he's even more stupid than I am. - Here's the thing, Bobo. - It's Boom Boom. Boom Boom. Sorry. We really have to get back home, so we could pay extra If there's any way we could expedite things. Well, let's see. We'll give him a call. It's ringing. - It's your old pal, Boom Boom. - Okay, listen, Boom. About yesterday, I'm sorry I said you were stupid out loud. You're not sorry you thought it, You're just sorry you said it? Yeah, I'm not gonna apologize for thinking - Just don't say anything else! - I'm not We're gonna check back in with you later, Boom Boom. Thank you. Over here! - Not so loud. You'll scare them away. - I don't think so. Saw a movie once about an extra terrestrial. Who didn't know he was an extra terrestrial. They rewired his brain or something. I don't watch movies. Give me bad dreams. That's funny. In the movie, The extra terrestrial had bad dreams. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. Mr. Monk, you mentioned you were a detective. I took the liberty of calling San Francisco. Spoke to Leland Stottlemeyer. He spoke very highly of you. I wonder if you could help us out. Edward Garcia, Adrian Monk, Natalie Teeger. Dr. Garcia and I don't get many cases like this, So we want to be sure that wt it right. Oh, god. Oh, no! The poor thing. The missing woman? I owe dolly a big apology. This is, or was Marge Larkin. - Where's her face? - Coyotes, probably. She's been five days, maybe six in the sun. She was a hiker? Marge was a lot of things. She, she came into a little bit of money A few years ago when her parents died, And so she just dabbled In all kinds of things. Yoga, Spelunking, Trout farming. - And apparently hiking. - Where's her face? We already talked about the face, okay? Where did they find her? A couple of those UFO aficionados found her in the foothills about five miles west. Just lucky break. They were all out there looking for ET. She could've been out there forever. I figure she was hiking along the ridge, Fell somehow, hit her head, and died instantly. And then the coyotes must've dragged the body about a mile, maybe two, into the desert. Dr. Garcia's written ""accidental death"" On the certificate, but I asked him to write it in pencil. I wanted to get a second opinion. Why? It's a very small town, Mr. Monk. And Marge Larkin was as close as we have to an important person. So, like I said, I wanted to get this right. Yeah, please. - So, head trauma. - She fell face first. There's no defensive wounds. No no scratches. So, she didn't put her hands out when she fell. These clothes appear to be new. And sleeves are too short. And the treads on these boots, they're not warn down at all. What was that? Silicon packet. They sometimes put them in new boots. She couldn't have been hiking, not with that in her shoe. What does it mean? It means that somebody dressed her after she was dead. After she was murdered. Thank you again for calling me. Of course we called you, Kyle. You're her brother. Is there anybody else we should notify? No, it was just me and Marge. Can't believe she kept all this junk. It's like a pawn shop. When was the last time you were here? my father's funeral. It's no secret. Marge and I, we weren't close. You never spoke. Christmas, birthdays. Families, you know. It's complicated. Excuse me. Her plants are dying. Do you mind? Sure, thank you. Marge loved these plants. Wasn't crazy about people but she loved her foliage. Last I heard you had a shop in San Diego. It was fun while it lasted. I filed chapter 11 a year ago. Whole mall went under. You need a deputy? What is it? It's double-sided tape. There was a rug here. What is that? It's from a shirt. A new shirt. I think she was killed here in this room. And then redressed. You really think someone murdered my sister? Sheriff, I'd like to see where they found the body. You hear that? What the hell is that? They think that Mr. Monk is from outer space. He's not. Get off the van, you freak! What's wrong with you? My sister just died. There he is! Where are you from? I was born in Marin County. Really, he's not alien. He's just persnickety. - What is love? - I don't know. - What is the frequency? - I don't know. he doesn't know the frequency. - Can we touch you? - Don't touch him! Our germs are poison to him! Actually, that one's kind of true. Please, Monk, we've been waiting for so long. - We just need some answers. - You just stay back. We've got some earth business to take care of. Make him show you his belly button! They found the body here against this rock. The coyote tracks heading west, but they're gone now. Can they drag a body that far? Sure. I've seen them drag a deer carcass seven miles. Listen. Somebody's here. Thought I saw something following us. Must be one of your UFO buddies. What did you say to them anyway? Nothing. I was just minding my own business. Was being myself. And suddenly everybody wants to know the frequency. For the love of god, Mr. Monk! Show them your belly button! - Never! - Get down! - It's Sandy. - Well, just squat! Squat! Stay here. God! Look, you're bleeding! It's probably from the bullet. Wait, listen, listen. I think he's leaving. Come in. This is sheriff Fletcher. Hello, anybody? - What about the cell? - No signal. - Well, at least he didn't kill us. - Are we sure about that? Let's revue the situation, shall we? We're in the desert. No car, no radio. And coyotes face-eating coyotes and things that eat the face-eating coyotes, and things that eat the things that eat. - We get it. - He left us for dead. So what do we do? I would very much like to disappoint him. One of us is gonna have to go get help. The highway's about 15 miles that way. All right, Natalie and I will go. Mr. Monk, we can't leave him. He's been shot. - Natalie and I will stay here. - Mr. Monk, he can't walk. What do you suggest, Natalie? Do you have any ideas at all? You get help. I stay here and take care of the sheriff. Any ideas at all. Because if you do, I'd really like to hear them. So, no ideas. Not a one. Are you okay? Just keep going, Mr. Monk. You can do it! What are you doing? That's the only water you have. Don't waste it! They're all Sandy. No, Mr. Monk. Save the water. Just go! Go! That's better. Here's what happened. Who are you talking to? Who are you talking to? It's evidence. Let's take it with us. I usually have some candy in here. Here's some breath mints. Is that it? I'm gonna ask you if that was a coyote and you say no. Was that a coyote? Really, was it a coyote? I'm sweating. Look, I'm sweating! I'm human. Not particularly proud of it. I'm human, okay? This is it. This is where it ends. This is it. Surrounded by dirt. Covered in dirt. You win, dirt! Congratulations, dirt! Well played. Natalie, you were right. You called it. I'm dying alone. I don't want to die alone. I want people people who said it I like people. Gimme a chance! Just give me once more chance. I'll be nice. I'll be good. I'll be i'll be empathetic. I'll be the empathetic detective. Just Just send me some people! Please! I need people. People. People! Not these people. Doctor, doctor, I think he's awake. Mr. Monk? What did he say? ""Floss."" Floss? He means his teeth. You flossed your teeth last night in the hospital for about three hours. Then you took a four-hour shower. I don't think there's any hot water left in the whole state. Let's try this again. When they found you, you were carrying this bag. You wouldn't let go of it. I think it's important. I'm looking at batteries, engine lubricant, eye glass wipes. I know what happened. You mean about the UFO or about Marge's murder? Both. It's all connected. The eye glass wipes, they're Kyle Larkin's. He killed his sister. For the money, of course. He put her in a hiking outfit and dumped her body in the desert. It would look like an accident. Like she was out hiking, lost her footing, and fell. As soon as anybody found the body, he'd be rich. He went home and waited for the call that his sister's body had been discovered. But something was wrong. The call never came. He realized the coyotes must've dragged it away. Without the body, he couldn't prove she was dead. He had to find it, but how? You said Kyle owned a store. I could make out some of the lettering on the door of his van. It said ""models and hobbies."" That's right. He sold kits for model trains. And airplanes. And airplanes. More. He needed somebody else to find that body. Anybody else. So he build a UFO. It was a just a remote control model. Then he made what looked like a landing site. He knew somebody would see it and the news would spread. He knew the internet people would come. They believe anything. So basically he was putting together a search party. He need people out there looking around the desert. He knew someone would eventually find his sister. It has been an honor to watch you guys work. Mr. Monk, Ms. Teeger, I am going to be forever grateful that your vehicle broke down in my neck of the woods. But if you will excuse me, I have a suspect I need to go arrest. Your fan club's here. They're gonna be mighty disappointed that none of this was real. I'll tell them. Let me talk to them. Watch this. Hello, again. Hello. Hello, again. I have some good news. The object we saw was not a UFO. It was just a toy. I remote control model designed by a man who murdered his sister. You'll read all about it tomorrow in the newspaper. So you can all go, Now Please, go home. Please. Stop wasting your time Live life. Find, you know, employment and fall in love. You're human. Right? It's a gift. It's a precious, precious thing. You want to appreciate it. Thank you. Mr. Monk, good for you. That was great. You were sensitive and respectful. That's the nicest thing I've ever seen - anyone? - Not anyone, but you. The nicest thing I've ever seen you do. - Is there a problem? - You're not fooling anyone? - Excuse me? - We don't believe a word of that. That was no model. And it's obviously a cover-up. You're just trying to manipulate us. We want the truth. Earth people of the net, you were right. I am not human. I traveled here to your how do you say? Planet on a class four intergalactic doom freighter. - I knew it! - I was sent to, you know, prepare the way and to observe things and probe things and do alien things to everyone. - Hello? - Hello. You're in the paper today. Kyle Larkin confessed to killing his sister. He confessed to everything. I guess he didn't have any choice after all that evidence they'd found in his van. What about the tinfoil brigade? Are they still out front? Just a few. Most of them went home. - You need some help? - No, no, I'm fine. Just cleaning. I haven't dusted up here for two or three Hours. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Were you trying to look inside my shirt? My god. You don't think i have a belly button. It's just ever since we got back, I've been having crazy dreams. About me, Natalie? I'm not from outer space. I know. I'm sure you're not. - Can I see it? - No, you may not! Honestly. I am as human as anything in this room. See, right there. Right there! When you say things like that, it doesn't make sense. Anybody would be curious. Just a peak! - Get away from me! - Come on, Why not? Because it's an outing? Come on, Mr. Monk. - You can't stay in there forever. - Leave me alone. Mr. Monk, come on! Leave me alone or I will destroy your whole planet. Mr. Monk, come on. Little peak. Little one, come on."

Well, it's a refrigerator. Let's try the kitchen. Yeah, all right. I was just asking. That's another step. - Where? - Right there. What, that? What are you talking about? Yeah, it's gonna cost you. - Cost me what? - Money, 40 bucks. It's in the contract. - What? - Page four. ""Any change in elevation in said residence ""or place of business shall constitute a stairway. - Additional delivery fees may apply."" - That's ridiculous. It's not a step. It's a lip.

Well, that's ridiculous. It's just a lip. - That's what I said, exactly, verbatim. - Tell him no. He's doing the stare-down. Then stare back. Mr. Monk, he's testing you. Just look him in the eye and say no. I don't think I can. I've never won a stare-down in my life. I'm ""O"" for five. Mr. Monk, this is your house, isn't it? You can't let someone stare you down in your own house. It's my house. You're absolutely right. - What's it gonna be? - Okay, $40. Plus 120 for the delivery. Just a second. Plus gratuity. Okay, there you go. Thank you very much. Okay, I understand. We'll be right down. - You okay? Who was that? - It's the FBI. They want to ask you some questions. First off, I'd like to thank captain Stottlemeyer for letting us meet here this morning. When we're in LA. of course we'll be working out of my field office. - Who's going to LA.? - Mr. Monk is, I hope. I work for a division of the bureau called Team Alpha. It's our job to identify and track high-profile targets, dangerous individuals. For the last four months, we've been following a man named Frank Depalma. He's a contract killer, an assassin. He's probably the best in the world. I've never heard of him. He's worked very hard to make sure you haven't heard of him. He's linked to 17 murders. and we've never been able to prove a thing. There's just no evidence at all. I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me? Mr. Depalma arrived in Los Angeles yesterday morning, and at 4:35 pm. He stepped off a curb on wilshire boulevard and was hit by a bus. He was killed instantly. I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me? Here's a picture of Frank Depalma. Oh, my god! - Jeez Louise, look at that. - Sweet. I'm sorry. What does this have to do with me? - Mr. Monk, look at him. - He's your twin. - Really? - Yeah. - I don't see it. - Well oh, my god. - It's me. - That's your Doppelganger. - They say everybody's got one. - Who says that? People. And their Doppelgangers. Fortunately, we were there when the accident occurred. So we kept a lid on it. We kept the press out. The death certificate says ""John Doe,"" - so officially, it never happened. - I think I see where this is going. - Yeah, me too. - No, you don't. We'd like to find out who hired this man and who his target is. Adrian, the FBI would like you to go to Los Angeles and take Frank Depalma's place, just for a day, two at the most. You want Mr. Monk to go undercover as a hit man? We'll have a wire on you. We'll never be more than 20 yards away. Okay, thank you very much. We're gonna pass. - Why don't we let decide for himself? - That's not how it works around here. Meeting's over. Come on, Monk, I'll walk you out. Actually, there's another reason you might want to reconsider. Frank Depalma came to Los Aangeles to kill somebody. We don't know who hired him. We don't know who the target is. If you don't help us, they're gonna find somebody else. There's a life at stake here, Mr. Monk. FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION - You were born and raised - 829 chambers street.

I blew up his yacht. Made it look like a fuel leak. Well, that was very impressive, Mr. Monk. Or should I say ""Mr. Depalma""? All right, we better get you dressed. Your friends are meeting us downstairs. Oh! You mean now? We're already late. Somebody been calling your hotel room looking for you. Wait, wait, no, no. I can't go now. I'm not ready. I just started. You're gonna be fine. You've got the whole file memorized. I just forgot it. - Forgot what? - Everything about the guy. It's a blank. Hold on. Okay, I got it back. Wait, it's gone again. Okay, it's back. Look, I've run dozens of agents undercover. The end of the day, it's all about attitude. - Attitude. - You gotta sell it. You gotta believe that you're Frankie Depalma. Right, you walk through a door, you don't just walk through it. You stride. You swagger. You're at the table, you own the table. OK, you are the toughest son of a bitch in the room, and everybody knows it. Like the refrigerator delivery man. Right. Okay, from this moment on, Adrian Monk, he doesn't exist. Right. You're Frankie Depalma. You're a killing machine. Yeah, that's it. Welcome back, Mr. Depalma. - I'd like to meet him. - Who's that? My twin, my Doppelganger. I wonder if I could take him. - You mean like in a fight? - Yeah, I bet I could take him. Man versus Doppelganger. Team Alpha to base. I'm approaching the room. Okay, I'm in the room. I'm looking around the room. On my right is a wet bar with two bottles of vodka, two bottles of scotch, and assorted other liquors. Above the wet bar is some type of blackboard. No chalk. There are two bowls of fruit One real, one plastic. - Both contain grapes. - Is he gonna tell us all he's doing? - Apparently. - I'm ascending three steps. The upper platform has an 8x3-foot hot tub. It's steaming. Smells heavily chlorinated. On the hot tub are six, repeat six, white rolled-up terrycloth towels. Possibly Egyptian cotton. On the south wall is a thermostat set to 75 degrees. I'm descending the stairs. There's a standing lamp on my right in front of a gray couch with four cushions. Two gray, two orange. I'm touching the standing lamp. Still touching the lamp. Still touching. Can't stop touching the lamp. What's wrong with me? There's a suitcase on the ottoman. I am opening the suitcase. The suitcase is open. Wait a minute. It's wider on the outside than it is on the inside. There must be a hidden. Hidden compartment. There's someone at the door. I am walking toward the door. - Hello? - It's Lola. Lola who? That's not funny, Frankie. Open the door. How many Lolas do you know? How many other Lolas do you need to know? - You look really nice Frankie. - Thank you. At this point, most men would be commenting on how I look, but that's cool. You're not most men. - You're definitely one of a kind. - Not quite. Are you feeling okay? You sound funny. I'm okay. Oh, my god, look at your view. This is beautiful. This is way nicer than mine. I'm in 1801, in case you were wondering. All right, you're still mad about Barcelona, and I don't blame you. But Frankie, I'm trying to make it up to you. I mean, I got you this job, didn't i? I mean, you're making, like, 80 grand in two days. I mean, I figure you and I are even. Maybe not. Room service. I didn't order room service. Actually I took the liberty. Hello. Come on in. Champagne. It's on the house, complements of Jimmy Barlowe. Well, be sure to thank Jimmy Barlowe for me. Thank you. - Is there a problem, Mr. Depalma? - No. It's just yesterday you seemed more appreciative. - How appreciative was i? - $20. For what? Fine. Fine. Okay, here is 20. You gonna give me that 50 cents back? - Are you feeling okay? - Not as good as that waiter. $20, what a racket. Listen, this is a little embarrassing, but maybe I'm getting old. I forgot the name of the target. It's okay because I didn't tell you his name. Can you put that gun down and come sit with me? Good boy. Actually, I don't know this guy's name either, but we're gonna find it out tonight. I hope it's that waiter. Here. Cheers. - You're not even drinking it. - Yeah, I'm trying to cut down. Well, I hope you're not giving up all your vices. - Is there a problem? - I have a girlfriend. You have a girlfriend? Well, as I recall, that's never been a problem for you in the past. Here's the thing. We're sort of going steady. Steady? Well, I think that's sweet. She's here. - Here in the room? - Yeah, no. She's here in Los Angeles. I mean, she could come in any minute. She might want to kiss me too. She's pretty. We kiss all the time. What was her name? Natalie Teegerb. - Teegerb? - With a ""B"" on the end. It's Canadian. It's French Canadian. Well, I'd like to meet her. Bring her tonight. - No, I don't - No, I insist. Girl's gotta know what she's up against. You know what I mean? We'll be at the victory club up Laurel Canyon. Will Jimmy be there? Well, that's pretty much a safe bet. He owns the joint. Just meet us at the bar at around 8:00. Well, I guess you have a date, Miss Teegerb. It's so loud. I like it. You want to dance, Frankie? Frankie don't dance. Neither do i. I can't do this. I'm not a tough guy. - Who am I fooling? - You're fooling everybody. You're doing great. I've been listening to you all day. If I didn't know you, I wouldn't even know you. Help you? I hope so. Can you turn the music down just a little? You gotta be kidding me, Buddy. This is a dance club. You don't like the music, take a hike. Okay, sorry. We're looking for Jimmy Barlowe. - Never heard of him. - What about his friend Lola? All right, if you see'em, tell'em Frankie Depalma's looking for'em. Mr. Depalma? I had no idea. I'm new here. My name's Charlie. Let me turn the music down. - Is that okay? - What do you think? I could turn it off. You're right. It's much better this way. Good call. Hey, what happened? - Who turned it off? - It was hurting my ears. Who the hell are you? That's Frankie Depalma, Jake. Hell, Frankie Mr. Depalma, I had no idea. I'm really sorry. Here, let me buy you a drink. It won't happen again. I'm really, really sorry. Hey, relax. Walk it off. Give Frankie a chance to cool down. Same old Frankie. I can't take you anywhere. You must be Natalie. You're a lucky woman. - I know I am. - Well, enjoy it while you can. We should get going. Jimmy's in the back waiting. - Jimmy's in the back. - I'll take good care of him. That's him? Doesn't look like much. Uncle Jimmy, I could have done this job. I woulda done it for free. I told you, Lenny. I needed the best. Shut up and watch. And who knows, maybe you might learn something. Frankie Depalma, this is Jimmy Barlowe. Frankie Depalma, I hear good things. - About me? - Yeah, of course about you, otherwise why would I say it? This is my nephew, Lenny. And of course you already know Tony G. we haven't seen each other since Miami. It must have been, what, three, four years? Sounds about right. So how is fat gordy? Still fat. He got fatter. Actually he's thinking about changing his name to ""fatter gordy."" Listen, Frankie, before you and the boss get started, little davey was my second cousin. His family would like to, you know, bury the kid, get a little closure. But we only got a head and one leg. We can't find the rest of him. Maybe you could help us out, you know? I'll think about it. - What are you doing? - Your tie - is crooked. - Okay, I get it, I get it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked anything about little davey. Okay? Do whatever you gotta do. It's none of my business. Sorry I even asked. Is someone gonna tell me why I'm here? Business first. I like that. There's a guy over in Ventura. His name is Greenblatt, Stanley Greenblatt, and he needs to have an accident. - What kind of accident? - Your kind of accident. Job is a piece of cake. Okay, guy lives alone. He's, like, 100 years old. Here they are. Lola said that you're a connoisseur. You're gonna like these. These are cohibas. Hand rolled. Sweet. You know, I was wondering are these things gonna taste as good when they're legal? Know what I mean? You you don't cut off the tip? No, no, that's too easy. So this greenblatt guy, what'd he do? Lola said you didn't ask any questions. Why would she say that? That's another question. What look, my uncle says do it, you put this old guy down. Okay, that's the job. That's all you need to know. What It doesn't make sense. This guy's a nobody. Stanley greenblatt, 75 years old. It's his birthday today, actually. He's a retired ups driver. He lives alone. He's a widower. He's got one son, one daughter. Son died last year. - And? - And nothing. Guy's never been arrested. There's no mob connection whatsoever. I mean, As far as we know, he's never even met Jimmy Barlowe. So then why does Barlowe want him dead? And why would he pay somebody 80 grand to do it? - Maybe it's an insurance scam. - Doesn't track. The guy's not insured by anyone for anything. He's broke, living on a fixed income. Jimmy B never said anything about why he wanted him killed? Agent stone, can we go home now? Mr. Monk did everything you said. It's been really hard on him. - He has trouble enough being himself. - I appreciate that, Miss Teeger. I really do, but we don't have the whole picture yet. Right? Who's Stanley Greenblatt? Why is there a contract on him? I mean, until we know that, our job's not done here. It won't take much longer. Just a day or two. What do you think? Can you keep going? Randy and I can check out the old man for you. Sure, I appreciate that. Thank you. Get outta here, both of you! I'm gonna call the police! Mr. Greenblatt, we are the police. We're here to help you. I don't need your help. Just leave me alone. Sir, we think you might be in danger. I don't give a damn what you think! Would you get out of my house? Have you ever seen this man before? His name's Jimmy Barlowe, also known as mad jimmy. He owns a couple of casinos in reno. I never heard of him, okay? You satisfied? - Well, he knows you. - I don't give a damn who knows me. Why don't you people just leave me alone? You're gonna give me a heart attack. Sir, we can protect you. We can put you in a safe house. I'm not going anywhere, not with you or anyone. Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye. - I think he wants us to leave. - You think? Stanley, we're leaving. Why would Jimmy Barlowe want to kill this guy? Maybe he met him. You OK? - I'm all right. - That must have stung. How's it look? - How's what look? - The job. The old man. How are you gonna get in? I don't know. I haven't seen the house. You haven't even cased the joint yet? - What the hell you been doing? - Relax, Lenny. This is the way he works. He's methodical. I thought that was you. Are you on vacation too? I didn't think you ever left San Francisco. I didn't think you ever left your living room. Isn't this weather amazing? You don't have to check the weather report, Every day is 78 and sunny. It's like paradise. Harold Krenshaw. How you doing? How do you guys know Adrian? I'm sorry, Pal. You got the wrong guy. Do I look like an Adrian? You believe this guy? - What are you doing? - Hey, Pal. You're making a mistake. Now you got a decision to make. You want to be in the papers tomorrow in the obituary section, section D? You made a mistake. Go home. Do it. I'm sorry. I thought that you were somebody else. What are you looking at? Finish your Shirley temple. What'd I tell you? Let's get the check. I lost my appetite. Still wearing the suit? Didn't get a chance to change? Why should I change. This coffee's cold. It tastes like BM. - It's iced tea. - Well, warm it up. So, You want tea? I want warm iced tea. That's it. We're pulling the plug. This operation is over. - I think you're right. - What? What are you talking about? I'm not quitting now. Why should I? I'm in the zone. I'm Frankie Depalma. No, you're not. You're in too deep. I've seen it happen before. Even real cops, when they go undercover, they get their wires crossed. What do you mean, ""even real cops""? - That's not what I meant to say. - I'm not quitting. I'm in too far to quit now. Look, we're close. We have the who. All we need is the why. Right? Why do they want to kill the old guy? - You know what, we're calling Dr. Bell. - Why? Because you're enjoying this way too much. I think you like scaring people. I think you've been so repressed and powerless for so many years, it's just gushing out of you. You are not yourself. Or maybe you're meeting the real me for the first time. That was Harold Krenshaw you were pushing around this morning. OK, look, I'm in charge. It's my call. We're pulling the plug. You can't stop me. You can't keep me here. I'm gonna finish what I started with you or without you. Sit down. Get out of my way, Leland. I'll be in touch. Now who the hell was that? Hello? I knew you'd come. Like a moth to a flame. How did it go? - What, you didn't kill him? - Not yet. Why not? Was there a problem? Frankie, you give your word to Jimmy Barlowe, you better keep it. I'm not whacking anybody until I know why. Who is this guy greenblatt and why is he so important? Since when do you care? Did you forget what you said to me in Barcelona? The minute you start asking why, it's time to get out. I don't want to talk about Barcelona. It's ancient history. Well, that's what I've been trying to tell you. Does Natalie know you're here? Is she ancient history too? I was just getting ready for bed. You want to do my legs? No more games, Lola. Who is Stanley Greenblatt? I need to know. Fine. Frankie, you win. I'll tell you. But you need to come and sit with me. The room might be bugged. Closer. I don't know. Who are you? You know who I am. I'm Fr Adrian. Depal-Monk. What? I'm Adrian. Wait a second. I'm confused here. What's going on? Are you okay? You're acting like you're, like, hypnotized or something. Great. Stay. Hold on. - Hey, what's going on? - You seen Frankie? Yeah, he's over there, I think. I've been looking all over for you. What are you doing? I'm rinsing. Uncle Jimmy's furious, okay? He says no more excuses. He wants the old man dead tonight. We're sick and tired of waiting for his funeral, you know? Tonight, no. No, sorry. Tonight's no good. Here's the thing. I made other plans. I'm whacking somebody else in Pasadena later. I've already bought the bullet, so Jimmy said if you don't do it or you can't do it, then I get the gig. So what's it gonna be, you want the job or not? Then let's get this done. We we're gonna have to go out through the basement. I saw guys  He didn't look right to me. I think he might be a cop. We'll take my car. It's okay. You stay here. I'll take care of the old man. I'll whack him, I'll call you when it's over. Jimmy wants me to go along. He insisted actually. Looks like we're gonna be a team. - What's the problem? - I don't like it. It's too quiet. What do you mean it's too quiet? Quiet is a good thing. You want a parade? Come on, let's do this. I just remembered. I forgot my gun. It's my lucky gun. What do you need a gun for? It's supposed to look like an accident. Right. I'll go in. You stay out here. You stay by the car. I need a lookout. You see somebody, you honk the horn. Mr. Greenblatt? Hello? My name is Adrian Monk. I'm with the police. Mr. Greenblatt? Hello? Mr. Greenblatt? My god. - He dead? - Heart attack. You're lucky. Captain, do you have a minute? Mr. Monk would like to say something. Sorry. Mr. Monk, you have to do it in person. I'm sorry. Show him the card. Go ahead, read it. ""I was'udderly'wrong."" It's a cow. Udder. ""I'm sorry if i upset you. ""Please give me another chance. ""I would hate for my careless gesture to spoil our fine romance."" It's the only one they had. Thank you, Monk. I realize how hard this must have been for you to have Natalie buy it for you. I bought it, but Mr. Monk paid for it. Or he will. The point is he knows he went too far, and he feels terrible. He'd never had that kind of power before. It was like a drug. It went to his head. He learned his lesson. Why don't you tell him what you learned? I'm not a tough guy. Sure you are. I don't think so. You are one of the toughest guys I know. - No - you just don't advertise it. But it's in you. It's buried deep down. You fooled all those wise guys, didn't you? You couldn't have done that unless it was in you. And you stood up to me. - I'm proud of you, man. - I don't feel it. I had it. I had it for one day but, it's gone. It's not gone. It's there. When the chips are down and it really matters, you'll find it. What happened to Jimmy Barlowe? Nothing. We can't touch him. Technically, there was no crime committed. - But Mr. Greenblatt - died of natural causes. There was no murder. No cash changed hands. I just talked to agent stone. The case is closed. I still don't understand. Why would the mob want to kill him? Nobody knows. Probably never will. - So that's it. - Thanks for the card. I'll put it with my collection. Those are nice. From your boys? Two birthday cards from your sons. That's right. They both sent you a card. - That's right. - You have two children. So you got two cards. You know, Monk, not saying anything is always an option. When I was in Greenblatt's house, he had two birthday cards on his mantle. They both said, ""happy birthday, dad."" There were two cards. What does that mean, two cards? You were right. I don't know how we missed it. Greenblatt's son, Alvin, the one who died last year, he worked  for one of Jimmy Barlowe's casinos. They never found a body. That's right. He drowned near Catalina. There was no body. what's going on? Alvin Greenblatt is alive. We're thinking he stole some money from the casino and then faked his own death. He's alive? Are we sure about this? He sent his dad a birthday card last week. Lenny said that they were ""tired of waiting for the old man's funeral."" This wasn't about Stanley Greenblatt. It never was. It was about his son. They've been looking for Alvin for a year. That's why they wanted him dead. They were trying to lure his son out of hiding. They figured he wouldn't miss his father's funeral. So he's here? I don't see Alvin. Hell, nobody's here. Why am I not surprised? I think we're too late. Maybe they picked him up at the airport. Great. I been waiting a year and a half for this. Where's my money, you son of a bitch? I don't okay, okay! I'll tell you. I've got it. It's i buried it. It's in my attic under some floorboards. I got some bad news for you. I believe you. Kill him. - No, god. - Is this a private party? Frankie, I thought you left town. - What are you wearing? - Chanel no. 5, and you? What? I figured out what was going on. I put two and two together. This is Greenblatt's kid, right? What's he into you for? But we got what we need. We're gonna finish it. Let me do it. Give me the gun. - Why? What for? - I'm a professional, all right? I got a reputation. His old man keeled over ten minutes before I got there. I felt like a fool. It pissed me off. Let me do it, no charge. On the house, for my own peace of mind. I just want to put this kid ten feet under. - You mean six feet under. - Whatever you want. I prefer ten. It's up to you. Give me the gun. No, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Give me the gun. Give me the gun. Fine, you do it. No, don't! Don't! Nobody move! Don't move. - FBI! - Get 'em up. Let me see your hands! I told you this guy wasn't right! I knew it! I told you. You had it in you all along. Mr. Monk, are you all right? I was so scared. You and me both. Great job, Monk. You're the dead man. Actually, he's been dead since Friday. I knew you wasn't right. What do you think? It's just making so much ice. It won't stop making ice. I understand. If you could back up a little. Here it is. The shut-off thingy broke off. I got one in my truck. I can fix it for you right now. - Great. - It'll cost you 200. It's not even a week old. There must be some kind of warranty. Normally, yes. But it wasn't hooked up correctly, It's all been voided. But you hooked it up. - You hooked it up last week. - You want me to fix it or not? You're gonna fix it. And you're gonna fix it for free. I don't think so. You're gonna fix it for free. Not gonna happen You know what, I I think you're right. I'm sure it's still covered. I'll go get that part. I still got it. You still got it. Team Subs-Addicts"""
"Here's what happened. You were in the middle of a very messy, very expensive divorce, and you wanted to get rid of your wife. That is absurd. Do I have to listen to this? - Yes, you do. - What you needed was an alibi. First, you ordered a two-ton slab of marble. Then you went to work, but you weren't sculpting just another statue. You were sculpting an alibi, a perfect alibi. You had it all worked out, down to the last - details - Hold it! Don't say another word. Excuse me, sir, this is a private conversation. Yeah, this conversation's over, unless you want to talk to me, but I cannot promise that I would listen, detective. - And you are? - I'm Harrison Powell. I'm Mr. Gildea's Attorney. I just moved up from Los Angeles. And you must be Mr. Adrian Monk. I saw your profile on in Focus. Very impressive. Thank you. I was just explaing to Why don't you tell it to the judge? We're denying everything categorically. Have a nice day. Come on. Let's go. You look like a man who could use a drink. Evan, let's go. They can't keep you here. It's okay. Harrison, it's too late. They know everything. They have all this evidence against me. No, they have no evidence against you. They have nothing, Okay? You're an innocent man that's been unjustly accused. And I'm gonna prove all that when we get to court. Harrison, it's Adrian Monk. He's never lost a case in his life. Well, neither have i. This'll be great. -= 805 =- ""Mr. Monk Takes the Stand"" VO By : ¤Aka¤  &  do_Ob Team Subs-Addicts"" Good morning. And in this corner district attorney Charles Friedkin. How you feeling, champ? Are you guys ready? Did you all do your homework? Charlie, relax, we've testified at 100 trials. - 112. - Well, I'm just making sure. Now did everyone review the grand jury transcripts and the follow-up reports? Mr. Friedkin, don't worry. They can do this in their sleep. In fact, on at least two occasions, Lt. Disher has. Well, nobody's sleeping today. Harrison powell is the prince of darkness, so be careful up there. Don't volunteer anything. If you don't rember something, just say you don't rember. - He's guilty, right? - So was OJ. Hey, speak of the devil. Devil appears. Gentlemen. Ms. Teeger. Mr. Gildea, that's a nice suit. I wonder how you'll look in pinstripes. Harrison, my offer's still on the table. This is your last chance. Here's my final offer to you. You drop the case, make a public apology to my client, you save the taxpayers a lot of money. I'm offering you a gift, Charlie. You can keep the police from looking like chimpanzees with guns. Okay, I'll see you all inside. Under oath this time. - And I hate you. - ""Chimpanzees with guns."" - Charlie, don't sweat it. - He's all talk. Captain Stottlemeyer, could you describe the events of october 2 for the jury? Yes, sir. Approximately at 8:00 am. My team and I responded to a suspicious death call at 104 Pickens drive. The housekeeper had discovered the body. Who had died? Nancy Gildea. Nancy Gildea. I was just reading about her. - She was married to that famous artist. - Evan Gildea. They were separated. Very separated. I guess these are some of his. This is amazing. Look at that. It's perfect. Mr. Monk, that's a display stand. The art is out here. Well, that's junk. Well, the M.E Says she's been dead about 12 hours. So that's about 8:00 last night. Yes, sir. Looks like a straight-up break-in. Punches a hole through this window. Opens the door from the inside. She wakes up. They fight. He takes that statue from here hits her once. So, base of the skull. Medulla Oblongata. - Killed her instantly. - I don't think so. That hole's pretty small. I don't think anyone could fit their hand through there. Sure they could. And did you determine whether Monk was right? Yes, sir. Lt. Disher ran a field test to be certain. Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt. I saw Lt. Disher in the hall before the trial. I couldn't help but notice both of his hands were bandaged. Yes, ma'am. He wanted to be sure, so he tried it again with the other arm. He tried it again? He's very thorough. I'm sorry. - Oh, my god. - I can't help it. - Drink some water. - I tried. It's not working. Maybe if you scared me. If you hiccup again, i'm gonna take Randy's gun and shoot you. - That worked. - You're welcome. No wait. Rudy? Hey, this is Rudy Smith from the big buddy program. I used to be his mentor. Hey, man, how you doing? I was just thinking about you. This kid was trouble with a capital T Back in the day. - Hey, rember how we met? - He caught me spray-painting. Yeah, I caught him spray-painting police cars. Made him work it off five days a week for a month? A little bit of tough love. What you doing here? You a lawyer now? A little doogie howser thing going on? Smith, let's go. Van's downstairs. Let's go. Wait. Detective. Hey wait. Detective. What did he do? He robbed a store and killed the Clerk. Murder one. Let's go. Captain, when did you first suspect Evan Ggildea was responsible for his wife's murder? Well, actually that was Adrian Monk. See, Monk was looking around at the art at the victim's house, and he noticed something. - He hit her with this? - Apparently. Why didn't he use this one? The fight started here. I would have grabbed this. It's heavy enough. It would have been perfect. Instead he crossed all the way over there. E.G. Evan Gildea. So Monk figured that Mr. Gildea, not wanting to destroy one of his own pieces of art, grabbed the other statue. And that's when you began to Focus on the defendant. Yes, sir, that's correct. - Thank you, captain. - You're welcome. Your witness. That's a great story, captain Stottlemeyer. I won't take up too much of your time. I just have a few questions. Your consultant Mr. Monk, is he a trained psychologist? No, no, but he's a lot smarter than any psychologist I've ever met. Yeah, he would have to be, having never met my client, to know that my client would not use one of his own statues as a murder weapon. That was just a theory. A theory that led us to a substantial amount of other evidence. Okay, we'll get to that other evidence a little bit later. I would like to know, if we could just back up for a little bit, how was Mr. Monk able to divine where the fight started? - Where the fight started? - Where it started. How did he know, for example, the fight did not start in, say, the foyer? I'll have to consult my notes. Were you there when the fight started, captain Stottlemeyer? Was your friend Adrian Monk there when the fight started, captain Stottlemeyer? No, he was not. Isn't it possible, captain Stottlemeyer, isn't it possible the fight could have started in the foyer? - Yes, it's po - Good job. I think we're done. Let's move on to something else, shall we? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Not you. It's just this kid. - I really thought he turned a corner. - Well, you said he had problems. Shoplifting. Like, a couple of fights, but nothing like this. I promised his grandmother i'd look out for him. She made me promise. Hey. How'd it go? Give me a sec. You're sweating. - He's tough. - Your tie's wet. - What happened in there? - He's tough. That's what happened. He kept coming at me like Muhammad Ali. You're up. Monk, be careful in there. Don't give him any openings. Leland. I'm fine. Evan gildea is the guy. We both know he's the guy, and in 20 minutes the jury's gonna know it too. And so I concluded that Mr. Gildea had the means, motive, and the opportunity to murder his wife. I have no further questions. Mr. Monk, on behalf of the people of San Francisco, I want to thank you for sharing your opinion. It's not my opinion. It's what happened. Your witness. Mr. Monk, I too would like to thank you for a lifetime of service. You're welcome. If you don't mind it won't take too much time, i'd like to review your testimony. - What part? - All of it. Every syllable actually. Let's start with your trip to Santa Barbara. You said that happened the day after the murder? That's correct. As I said. We drove down to Mr. Gildea's studio the next morning. We spoke to a local police sergeant, St. Carney. What have you got Sergeant? I was here at 9:00 this morning after you called. - I told him about his wife. - How'd he take it? Seemed pretty shaken up. What do you mean ""seemed""? Was he faking it? You tell me. He's right inside. Wipes. Plural. - Plural wipes. Wipes. - Okay. - It's a dust factory in here. - Mr. Monk, he's a sculptor. - It's part of his job. - It's no excuse. Evan Gildea! Hello, we're with the San Francisco police department. What are you doing here? Why aren't you out looking for the son of a bitch that killed my wife? - We are. - Who's this? This is Adrian Monk. He's consulting with us. Mr. Gildea, where were you last night around 9:00? I was here all night. I was working. Were you alone? No. I was with her. Mr. Monk, are you okay? - I'm fine. - You were making a noise. I don't think so. Could you read that back, please? The defendant removed a sheet revealing a naked Are you nervous, Mr. Monk? I'm fine. You were describing the statue. I'm not gonna win any husband of-the-year awards, I admit that, but I did not kill Nancy. I never get violent. If I get angry, I take it out on the stone. Besides, it's just not possible. It's not physically possible. I was here all night. Ask Sgt. Carney. I was finishing up when he came in this morning. Your honor, I would like to introduce ot the court defense exhibit A. Is this the statue that you saw in Mr. Gildea's studio? The statue is my client alibi. It's kind of important that you take a look at it. In fact the statue is the single most important piece of evidence in this entire case, and you can't even look at it. I got the gist of it. I'm sorry, he got the gist of the evidence. I got the gist of the head and the Upper head area. She's your grandmother. She loves you. I don't want to see her. Not now. Not like this. At least call her, okay? Look at me. You gonna call her? - So how's your lawyer? - She's okay. Rudy, what happened? Was it my fault? - Your fault? - Yeah, I was your big buddy. I was supposed to look out for you. And I should have said, ""Rudy, don't kill anybody."" I didn't kill anybody. I talked to the DA. I know what you did. I swear. I messed up. I went in there, I robbed the place, I admit it. I took 30 bucks from the cash register. I grabbed a gold chain from the lady. Then I split. She was alive when I left. You grabbed a chain? You told the cops that? It's not in here. Guess you guys aren't perfect. Look what I found. Our friendship bracelets. Put it on. I remember when we made these. Remember what we said? I remember. We promised each other we wouldn't lie to each other. So I'm gonna ask you one time. Did you kill that woman, Rudy? I swear. I didn't do it. Is there a problem with the microphone? There is a small kink in the microphone, your honor. You'll thank me later. There it is. You're welcome. Mr. Monk, I'm sure you're aware that in this court we've had not one, not two, but three art experts. They have all examined this sculpture. They've all agreed it would take at least 12 hs to sculpt a piece like this. That's true. At first it looked like the perfect alibi. All right, is that better? Thank you. Mr. Gildea, how do we know when you sculpted this? - I mean, it could have been last week. - Or last year. Here's how you know. She was carved from a two-ton slab of Belgian gray marble that was delivered yesterday at 5:00 pm. Here's the receipt. You can call the quarry yourself. How do we know this is the same slab of Belgian gray marble? You could have sculpted the-the-the - Nude. - The nude statue out of a different slab. And when that marble was delivered yesterday, all you had to do - was hide it. - Hide it? You think I hid a two-ton slab of marble? That's fantastic. Where is it, detective? Is it underneath the couch? Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Gildea. Sorry about your wife. You understand, we always have to talk to the husband, especially in a case like this. Of course. The clock. - Excuse me? - The clock in your studio was 20 minutes slow. And that popsicle is half-melted. Your freezer must have been off for a while. - You blew a fuse. - A fuse? Wait, you're right. I remember. I was plugging in my coffee maker No, it wasn't a coffee maker. You were using something much bigger. There's a heavy duty extension cord in there. It is the only thing in your studio not covered with dust. You were using some, some kind of tool. A Jackhammer. You killed her, you drove back here this morning you chopped up all of the marble with the Jackhammer before Stg. Carney arrived. It wouldn't have taken you more than an hour. I chopped it all up? You're in the middle of nowhere. Nobody would have heard you. And then what? Where did I put it? Two tons of marble. - Maybe I ate it. - No. No, you didn't eat it. We're standing on it. And he took the two tons of marble, and he spread it across his driveway? That's right. And you're a detective, Mr. Monk. You're not a science fiction writer? No, I am not. - A writer. - That's too bad. I think you might have missed your calling, Mr. Monk. Objection, your honor. Argumentative. Sustained. Let's bring it in. Your honor, I would like to introduce to the court defense exhibit B. This is a sample of the gravel taken from my client's driveway. Now, Mr. Monk, if what you're saying is correct, the all of these pieces could have come from the same slab. Therefore, they should all fit together like a giant Jigsaw puzzle. - Isn't that right? - In theory. In theory? You want to send my client to jail for the rest of his life on a theory? Now wait, I misspoke. It's not a theory. It's what happened, okay. He's the guy. Okay, well, let's see if you're right. Let's see if this piece matches this piece. Do these two go together? How about this one? - Nope. - How about this one? - How about this one? - Objection. Order in this court. Who is that woman? That woman, your honor, is the witness's nurse. No, she is not my nurse, your honor. She is my assistant. My nurse left five years ago. Well, we're all very sorry to hear about that, Mr. Monk. Objection! To what? To what I said Mr. Monk, you are testifying. You cannot object to your own testimony. Why do you need a nurse, Mr. Monk? Objection. Immaterial. Mr. Monk said he needed a nurse. I'll allow it. Answer the question. I had a breakdown ten years ago after the death of my wife. That was the same time you left the police force, correct? Could you please explain to us the exact circumstances of your departure from the police force? - Psychiatric discharge. - I can't hear you, Mr. Monk. It was a psychiatric discharge. We're all very sorry for your loss, detective Monk excuse me, former detective Monk. Former detective Monk. I'm sure you would do anything to impress the commissioner to get your badge back. Objection. Mr. Monk is not on trial. It establishes credibility, your honor. Overruled. Former detective Monk, isn't it true that the only way you could get reinstated is to be appearing to be solving a high-profile case. A high-profile case, just like this one. Appearing to solve, no. I did not appear to solve anything. I solved the case. I solved it. He's the guy. He is the guy. He chopped it all up with a jackhammer. Where is the jackhammer? He had all morning to get rid of it. Look, it's so obv And these pieces do fit together. I'll show you. Okay? Here, look. This one goes with this one. Wait a sec. All right, look. All right. Hold that one. While this one not that one that one not that one. How do you find the defendant? This verdict isn't going to bring Nancy back. Nothing can do that. But it did restore my faith in the American legal system. It's the best legal system in the world. At least it was today. It's my fault. Don't beat yourself up. You can't win 'em all. The gravel and the microphone. What was I thinking? You had a hell of a run. Nobody goes undefeated forever. - What happens now? - Nothing. It's over. Mr. Gildea can never be tried again. He's right. It's called double jeopardy. - How do you sleep at night? - Like a baby. In a expensive bed. Thanks for asking, though. And, detective? - Lieutenant. - Lieutenant. You're wrong. Some people do go undefeated forever. And I still hate you. That's weird. - What? - The taillights. On evan gildea's car. They don't match. One is brighter. We can't arrest him for that. Give it up. It's over. They beat us. We are almost out of time, so I want to thank our guest His book is called undefeated: the Harrison Powell story, Do you have a card in case I get in trouble? You know, a speeding ticket or something? You know, Sean, for you, as a matter of fact, I do. For any criminal in San Francisco, this is basically a get-out-of-jail-free card, Because you are a regular Mr. Monopoly. I guess I am. I've made a decision. I'm quitting. I'm not taking any more cases. I'm sorry to hear that, Adrian. Is it because of the Tv interview? What interview? Harrison Powell was on TV last night. You didn't see it? Did he mention me? I don't remember. You don't remember? How long was the interview? About ten minutes. You saw a ten-minute interview last night, and you don't remember if my name was mentioned? All right, he might have mentioned your name. I should have known. You're a very good detective. Yes, I am a good detective. But I'm a terrible witness, which is why I'm quitting. Adrian, setbacks like the one you just experienced are a part of life. You could argue they're the most important part of You don't understand. A killer a stone-cold killer is back on the street because of me. Because that lawyer Harrison Powell ripped me apart on the witness stand. You weren't there. He he dismantled me. I was helpless. - I understand. - It's going to happen again. What's to prevent it? I'll solve another case, then somebody else will be arrested, and all they have to do is hire Harrison Powell. It's like he has one of those get-out-of-jail-free cards. It's funny you mention it. That's exactly never mind. I'm a liability now. I'm the weak link. Believe me, I'm doing the city a favor. All right, before you decide, let me tell you a little story. No, there's nothing you can say. My mind is made up. Just hear me out. Please. Is this a long story? - No. - Is it a parable? As you know, I went to college on a baseball scholarship. Now there was a pitcher in the league named Scotty Hunt, who was my nemesis. All right, he had this sinking curve ball. I mean, I couldn't touch it. He struck me out 15 times - in a row. - This is a parable. It's not a parable. If it's anything, it's an allegory. I'm quitting. Please let me finish. Now I considered giving up. Then I decided, I'm not just gonna roll over. I'm not gonna let this jerk ruin everything I worked so hard for. So I went to school on the guy. I studied him. I looked for his weakness. And I realized he had a tell. He was tipping his curve ball. Last game of the season, I'm at bat, bases loaded, we're down by three, I saw the tell. I'm looking for the curve ball. And I nailed it right field fence, grand slam. We went on to win the playoffs. - I don't want to be rude. Is that the end of the allegory? Yes, it is. I'm quitting. - What are you doing? - These are my old case files. I'm organizing them by date, and then cross-referencing them by name of the suspect. The yellow folders indicate multiple victims. - What are you gonna do after - I'm gonna burn them. - You can't quit, Mr. Monk. - Already have. Mr. Monk, there's a case, a very important case. Nobody else can handle it. I know what you're trying to do, but it won't work. My mind's made up. She's not asking Monk. I am. It's Rudy, my little buddy. You remember the kid from the courthouse? The D. A Just announced that they want to try him as an adult. The kid's looking at 25 years. It's very important to you, isn't it? Then you don't want me anywhere near it. You know what happened. That last case came crashing down around me. We want to show you the crime scene. Come with us. It'll take 20 minutes. Maybe you'll see something. You can't say no. Well, you can, but you can't. I can, but I can't? I don't understand. You don't, but you do. He confessed. To robbing the store. - He confessed? - Not to the murder. Randy, you know the law. If I go with you and I see something, then I might have to testify about it. And if I accuse someone, they could hire this Powell guy. They probably will. Well, I'm willing to take that chance. Why? Because he didn't do it. - An auto parts store. - It's a family business. It's been closed since the murder, so the scene is pretty much intact. Natalie, you be the owner. You're behind the counter. She was older. Pretend I'm older. Fine. So pretend she's older. - All right, Rudy parks out back, comes inside the store, he looks around and pretends to shop. And it's just Rudy and the woman. - Other witnesses? - He can't remember. He thinks there might have another car parked out back. Maybe there was somebody else here inside the store. - That's not much help. - I know, Monk. I mean, he was scared to death. So he comes over to the counter ""May I have some change?"" She opens the register. She opens the register. He grabs the cash, grabs her gold necklace, bolts out the door. - He didn't hit her or shove her. No, he swears that he didn't touch her. I mean, the body was right over here in the corner with the murder weapon beside it. It was a tire iron from the shelf. So it was spur-of-the-moment. He didn't plan on killing anyone, or he would have brought a weapon with him. Good point. Although a good lawyer Harrison Powell, for example might say rudy didn't have to bring a weapon with him because he knew there'd be something like a tire iron in the store. ""It is an auto parts store, isn't it, former detective Monk? ""Have you ever been inside an auto parts store, ""former detective Monk? Do you even own a car, former detective Monk?"" - Mr. Monk, what are you doing? - ""Oh, that's right. ""They won't give you a license. Isn't that true, former detective Monk?"" ""Objection!"" ""Order in the"" - What's the use? - Mr. Monk, come on, come on. You got to forget about Harrison Powell. You got to keep going. Come on. Do the hand do the hand thing. Go on, go on. You got it, you got it. There's a camera? But the recorder's empty. Which means the killer must have taken the tape. But your friend Rudy is short. He's, what, 5'4""? - 5'4 1/4"". Well, he couldn't reach that shelf. There's no stepping stool. ""He didn't need a stepping stool, former detective Monk. ""There are hundreds of things here he could have stood on. ""Why are you crying, former detective Monk? ""Why don't you stop wasting everyone's time - and get the hell out of here?"" - Objection, badgering yourself. Overruled. Mr. Monk, come on, come on. Come on, come on. Look at me. Look at me! You have to get this lawyer out of your head. You're not thinking straight. Come on, Randy. Keep reading. Let's see. ""There's $30 missing from the register. ""She was struck once in the back of the skull, - medulla oblongata."" - Wait, wait. - She was only hit once? - Yeah, she died instantly. That's exactly how Nancy Gildea was killed. - Monk, you're right. - Yeah. When did this happen? What was the day? October 1st. About 10:00 pm? That's right. How did you know that? Mr. Monk, what are you looking for? This. If you're trying to scare me, you can forget it. I was acquitted, remember? Jury of my peers. This isn't about your wife, Mr. Gildea. This is about sara paddock. Different murder. Different case. Who? She was the woman at the auto parts store you murdered when you were leaving town. That was her name. Sara Paddock. It's okay. Just take your time. - I'm not sure. - I'm sorry. I read about that. The auto store. I thought you caught that kid. There was a young man in the store. He robbed the place, he grabbed a few bucks, but he didn't kill anyone. Here's what happened. What? Nothing. It just feels good to say that again, especially to him. Here's what happened. You drove to San Francisco, and you murdered your wife, no matter what the jury said, you murdered your wife. But as you were leaving, you had a problem. One of your taillights was burned out. You couldn't driving home like that. If the cops stopped you, your alibi would be ruined. There was an auto parts store up the street, you ran in to buy a new bulb, you were gonna pay cash, nobody would ever know you were there. But your timing was terrible. Don't worry. We've got everything on video. Now you had a bigger problem. As soon as she reported it, the cops would take a look at the security tape. And we'd see you in the store three blocks away from where your wife was killed, and you couldn't afford that. If it's all right with you, I'm gonna wait for my attorney. His name is Harrison Powell. I think you might remember him. He's in my head again. No, Monk, he's actually he's here. Thank god. I've been brought up to speed. I understand you found a burnt-out taillight bulb next to an auto parts store. Congratulations, former detective Adrian Monk. May I? This this bulb must fit, what, Former detective Adrian Monk, have you ever been inside an auto parts store? Do you even drive a car, former detective Monk? If you guys aren't gonna charge him, with anything, and I can tell by the dumbfounded expressions on your faces that you're not at all. You can turn that off 'cause we're hitting the road. Let's go, fella. I'm double-parked. The truth will come out, Powell. Somehow it always does. Your client killed that woman. When are you people gonna stop hassling me? You've got the real killer here. That dope-smoking, chain-snatching, little thug right over there. He killed her. Everybody knows it. Excuse me. Wait a minute. Hey, did you hear what he just said? Yes, I did. I wonder why you're asking. Did you hear what he just said? I didn't say anything. You just called that young man ""a chain-snatching, dope-smoking little thug."" I was being kind. How did you know about the chain-snatching? He read it. It wasn't in the papers. It wasn't even in the police report. There is only one possible way he knew Rudy took that necklace. You saw it happen. It's called guilty knowledge. And juries eat it up. Mr. Gildea, you're under arrest. Randy, would you like to do the honors? My pleasure. Yes. Yes. Do you really want to go up against me again, former detective Monk? Yes, I do. I'll see you on the ball field. - The ball field? - I've seen your curve ball. I can hit it now. - I'm really looking forward to this. - No, you're not. - He is gonna rip me apart. - No, he's not. Mr. Monk, you're gonna do great. You've seen his curve ball. I don't even know what that means. I can't believe I'm doing this again. I'm proud of you. You're getting back on the horse. A couple of suggestions. Just a thought. Maybe work on not crying I mean, quite so much in front of the jury. - That's a good note. - -Yeah, also, you can think ""mayday"" all you want, but it's probably a mistake to yell the word ""mayday"" - from the witness stand. - Did I do that? - Couple times. - More than. - I better write these down. - I have to return these cuffs. - There are no timeouts. - Right. No do-overs. No heavy, heavy sweating. We find the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree. Are you surprised? What went wrong today? - You gonna change the name of the book? - No comment. Come on. Excuse me. Go ahead. Say it. It hurts, doesn't it? How's your little buddy, He's gonna get 500 hours of community service. And I'm getting him a job at the station house too. Really make him work it off. Somebody working at the station house. That will be sort of refreshing. Don't say it. - I'm proud of you. - You can say it. You were the best witness ever. You answered all the questions. You didn't get rattled, even when the microphone was all bent up and twisted. - You ignored it. - I don't know why you're so surprised. Just doing my job. Come on, Mr. Expert witness. I'll drive you home. Team Subs-Addicts"""

Monk, if she was pushed And it's looking like she was pushed It happened out here. - This is the crime scene. - I'm good. For the love of god, Monk, it's a balcony. It's perfectly safe. It wasn't perfectly safe for her. Well, she landed by the awning, so we figure she went over someplace about here. I think she was over there. By that plant. Three or four leaves missing. I think she grabbed at the plant as she went over. You're right. What do you got? It's a Ribbon. ""Lasky."" Lasky Jewelers. It's probably from a jewelry box. Well, it's small. Might have been a ring. Officer, could you hang onto that for me, please? Look at this footprint. He was on his toes. Yeah, I see it. He was squatting. Or kneeling. He was proposing to her. You know, that fits. The hotel suite, the champagne, the ring box. He comes here to propose to her, he pops the question, she turns him down, he snaps and kills her. So we're looking for a boyfriend. Boyfriend. Good. Boyfriends are good. They're easy to find. - Did you get it? - Yeah, it's not in here, though. Maybe Maybe tomorrow's. - Well, can I see it? - No. Why? Because he's a critic, Natalie. Who cares what he thinks? I mean, he's probably just a frustrated actor, anyway. I'm too nervous. You read it. Look, this is just one man's opinion, - just - Read it. ""Last night's premiere First-rate material ""second-rate arrangements,"" Give it. Okay, ""Julie Tteeger's rendition of away, ""the classic ballad, was completely ""forgettable. ""A corny, cliche-filled performance ""that had me begging for less. Ms. Teeger owes me four minutes of my life back."" That could mean anything. You okay? He's just a Jerk. It doesn't matter. I guess not. - You were friends with Callie? - Callie Esterhaus? I knew her, but I didn't really know her, if you get what I mean. She only worked here a couple of weeks. - Was she dating anyone? - I think so. She was kind private about that stuff. I think he might've been married. It was just a feeling I got. Did she ever mention any names? We, found a date book in her apartment. She referred to a man by initial J. Does that mean anything? Maybe his name began with a J? Did you just write that down? - I put a question Mark after it. - ""Corny, cliche-filled performance?"" How can they say that? It's just not true! - I thought you threw that out. - I bought another one. You're torturing yourself. You've become obsessed with this review. - Look who's talking. - That's true. I get obsessed too, but I can handle it. I've had years of experience. How could he call her forgettable? My daughter is anything but! Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but what What homicide case are you guys working on? Because we're working on the Callie Esterhaus case. Maybe you remember it. - Natalie, forget about that review. - He broke my little girl's heart. - Julie's a tough kid. She'll - He called her forgettable! Don't just stand here whing about it. Why don't you go yell at what's-his-face? The, the critic. His office is five blocks down the street. Go on. Sorry about that. She's had a tough day. Did she know Callie too? Yeah, she did. Natalie, for god Where'd she go? It's the biggest engagement picture the paper's ever run. I'm surprised your father didn't put it on the front page. He wanted to. I think daddy's more excited about this wedding than you are. That's not possible. Excuse me. John Hannigan. - That all depends. - My name is Natalie Teeger. My daughter was in the play that you reviewed last night. If you'll excuse me, I'm kissing my luscious fiancee. Sorry, she sang away. The ballad, remember? You called her ""completely forgettable."" Your daughter is not forgettable. No, what I meant to say was I wish I could forget her, but alas, the banality of that tune she tried to sing is seared indelibly in my brain. - Is that better? - You know what you are, you're a bully. For your information, julie got the most applause of anyone. People loved her. They were crying. I'm sure they were. Lunch. Thank you, Kevin. Winberries again? I'm a creature of habit, darling. Get used to it. Your complaint has been noted, Miss Teeger. Anything else? Is there something wrong? What about the people in the next room? Maybe they heard something. I talked to them. They were out all night. Fingerprints on the railing? There were fingerprints. They belong to the maid. He must've worn gloves. He knew what he was doing. - Where have you been? - I've been thinking I solved the case. - What case? - I know who killed Callie Esterhaus. It was John Hannigan the critic. We know you're upset about that review, but you can't  accusing the man of murder. I know that he did it. I went to his office. He's wearing the same cologne. The cologne that we smelled in that hotel room. - The cologne you smelled. - Plus he's a ""J"" for John. Plus they probably knew each other. She worked at winberries. That's his favorite restaurant. He eats there every day. First of all, Callie Esterhaus died at 8:35, which was during Julie's show. Hannigan was in his seat all night. We saw him. No, he snuck out during the show. The hotel is right down the street. He killed her then snuck back in. Natalie, we were there. You kept looking up at him. He never left his seat. You've got to admit, it's a good alibi. Sold-out theater, including Monk. He did it. I don't know how, but he did it. That's what he always says. What about motive? Motive, that's the reason. I know what a motive is, Mr. Monk. Hannigan is planning to Marry Diana Phelps, the boss's daughter. If she knew about Callie, she would've left him his career would've been over. So you want us to go arrest the guy because his name begins with ""J,"" and he might have met her. I have proof. You have proof? - Proof. - Proof positive. Ironclad. If anybody sees it, they'll know he did it. - Do I've to do this? - We talked about this. This is a murder investigation. It's very important. Cell phones off. - What? - Cell phones off. And if anybody has any hard candy, please unwrap it now. Ready? Say you'll understand, love take me by my hand, love we will meet again, love on another day there is much I don't know I don't know where dreams go, all I know is I am bound away so let's go pick him up. What am I missing here? That's your proof? This is the proof. Nobody who was in that theater who heard that voice could've written this review. He wasn't there. He couldn't have been there. My daughter is not forgettable. I think Julie is wonderful, and she was wonderful last night. Very poised. - But that doesn't necessarily mean, - you don't believe me either? Julie, sing it again. Why does - That's OK, we got the point. - You made your point. Natalie, listen. You've certainly given us a lot to think about. Forget about it. Sorry to have wasted your time, detectives. Honey, let's go. I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea. I'm sorry. It was very nice. Hello? Mr. Monk? I'm sorry to bother you. Natalie, are you OK? Where are you? I'm downtown. I'm at the police station. What are you doing here? I've been arrested. I don't understand. Wait a sec. You were in the man's backyard? - That's right. - Looking through his garbage. - What were you doing? - I was doing your job. Just a review. It's just one review. - Julie seems fine with it. - It wasn't a review. I mean, it wasn't a real review because he wasn't there. He did it. I know that he did it. - 'Cause he criticized her? - Because she sings like an angel. John Hannigan, this is Adrian Monk. He consults with us upon occasion. Yes, hello. I'm a big fan. This is lieutenant Disher, and, - I believe you know Natalie Teeger. - Unfortunately, yes. Good news. Mr. Hannigan has graciously agreed to drop all charges. So we're letting you off with a warning, Miss Teeger. Thank god. I have an announcement too. I'm not giving up. I am never giving up. 'Cause you broke my daughter's heart, and you killed - that poor waitress down the street. - Now I've killed a waitress. This is getting more pathetic by the minute. Which explains what you were doing there. You never review community theater. And what about this? - It's - What is that? It's a chinese dumpling. I found it in your trash can. These are your bite marks. Look. The strawberry from the crime scene. - It's a perfect match. - Actually, we can't match it. The strawberry was too soft. We couldn't get a cast. Well, it looks the same to me. It's quite all right, gentlemen. I've dealt with stage mothers before. They're almost all delusional and, to some extent, unstable. It's sad, really. My advice to you is to worry about your own problems and not try to live vicariously through your daughter. I wish I could stay, but I have a column to finish. You can keep the dumpling. You monster! She's not with us, I mean, not officially. You're gonna rot in hell! Not with us. What's this? A check for $300. I'm hiring you, Mr. Monk. I need your help. I can't do it myself. This check's no good. - That's sweet of you to say, but - I mean it's literally no good. You can't cover this. Sure I can. I just deposited my paycheck on Wednesday. Right, but I happen to know that that check is going to bounce. So this check is pretty much worthless. You wrote me a bad check? - How could you do that? - I might ask you the same question. - Your check was bad first. - There's no right and wrong here. It's all tangled up. One check, another check. - It's like the chicken and the egg. - No, it's not. There's no egg here. There's no egg. This is all chicken. You're taking my check and you're working for me. Julie said the review doesn't matter, but I know that it does. Julie's a kid. She'll bounce back. How can you say that? When have you bounced back from anything? You're still dealing with stuff your father said to you when you were three. People don't forget. People don't always bounce back. This could ruin everything for her. He wasn't there. I just have to prove it, but I can't do it myself. All right. All right. I'll take a look. - You can just owe me the money. - You owe me the money. - Why don't we call it even? - How is that even? If I have to explain that to you, I'm probably paying you too much. You're doing great. Does Mr. Hannigan always sit up here? As a matter of fact, no. That was his first time. Normally he's down here. Fifth row, center. - Why did he move? - I didn't question it. I figured he wanted his privacy. That important, right? That sounds important. Why was he sitting up here? What's so important about this seat? This light's out. I didn't notice it. I'll get the maintenance guys. Hold that. It's not burnt out. Someone unscrewed it. That's something. No? He wanted to make it darker, so when no one was looking, he replaced himself with an inflatable dummy. I don't think so. He was moving. I saw him clapping. How about a mechanical man, like a robot? Maybe. I've got to wash up. Mr. Monk, welcome back, sir. Hello, Gilson. I wonder if I could wash up. Of course. Mrs. Coruthers said you might be coming by. Said it was part of a a big investigation. That's right. This is different. I've separated the antibacterial soap, sir. I see that. I see that. That's exactly how I have it at home. High praise, indeed, sir. Thank you. Let me ask you something. You know the box seat, up there in the mezzanine, section B? Yes, sir. Do you think someone could sneak out of there during a performance? I wouldn't know, sir. There's an exit door up there. Where does it lead? To a fire escape. It leads out back, behind the theater. Behind the theater. Behind the look at these towels. Look at these towels. You are an artist, Gilson. You are the Michel Angelo of lavatories. Thank you, sir. You've got me curious. Just what is the nature of the of the case you're involved in? I'm here with my assistant, and she thinks that someone snuck out during the play on saturday night, killed a woman up the street, and then snuck back in. Killed a woman? His girlfriend. And what do you think, sir? Well I thought it was crazy at first, but now I'm beginning to think she's on to something. Did you see anything that night, the night we met? No, sir, not that I can recall, but I'm not the person to ask. I don't have the best view of the house. Of course, if you think of anything anything unusual, here's my card. - Give me a call. - Yes Sir. Good-bye again, sir. It's always a pleasure, sir. What? - What are you doing here? - I'm sorry to bother you, sir. This is for you. - Small gift. I thought it might help. - There's a performance tonight. You took a night off to bring me this? Actually, I wanted to talk to you about saturday night. A policeman came to see me. A man named Monk. A woman was murdered near the theater. Really? Saturday night, about 8:30. Are you involved in something, sir? I just don't want any trouble. It's just a coincidence. You worry too much. As long as you're here, would you help me carry some boxes? I'm supposed to bring them inside. Yes, sir, I'd be happy to. - How bad is it? - It's bad. Blunt force trauma. He was hit from behind. Metal bat or a crowbar. Construction crew found him on the bay shore freeway under an off-ramp. Can we talk to him? Maybe not for a while. He's in a coma. How do you know this guy? He's my men's room attendant. It was John Hannigan. He did it. Here we go. No, it can't be a coincidence. He worked at the theater. Teeger, give it a rest. Are you gonna blame every crime in California on this guy? What is this? Stuff in his jacket. Nicotine gum? We already checked. He never smoked. It's probably a gift Wait wait don't hug me. You're gonna want to hug me, - but don't hug me. - Why? You were right about Hannigan. He's the guy. I knew it! I knew it! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Mr. Monk! The man we saw that night, the man in the box seats, had a wristwatch, remember? We saw him checking it. John Hannigan doesn't wear a wristwatch. I wish I could stay, but I have a column to finish. The man we saw in the mezzanine was not John Hannigan. It was the bathroom attendant. They switched places. Here's what happened. Hannigan needed a dupe an accomplice. He tricked Gilson into helping him. He must've said something like, ""could you do me a favor? ""This is 2 hour show, "" I need a cigarette break, but I can't be seen leaving. Could you take my place for a couple of minutes?"" When the lights went down, they switched places for eight, maybe ten minutes. Just long enough for Hannigan to run two blocks and throw Callie Esterhas off the balcony. Excuse me. May I say something? I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it! I got to call Julie. Natalie, we can't prove it. Can we? He's right. All we have is some nicotine gum and a wristwatch. Hannigan's just gonna lawyer up. He'll deny everything. I know. I know, you're right. Where's the proof? Captain, I hope this is important. I have a deadline in 37 minutes. Make that 36. Her again. Do I have to get a restraining order? It was just a review. Get over it. This is not about the review or what happened to Callie Esterhas. This is an entirely different matter. Right this way. That's him. - That's him. - Are you sure? What the hell is this? It's OK, miss, he can't hurt you. Go ahead. Tell us your story. Well, last night I was downtown at winberries. I was waiting for some friends, and he bought me a drink. - A rum and coke. - What? This is crazy. - If you think - shut up! Let her finish. Go on. I finished the drink, and I I felt kind of woozy and dizzy. And he offered to walk me to my car. And the next thing I knew I'm in the parking lot, and I'm fighting, and he was grabbing me, and he pulled me down. This is preposterous. It wasn't me. I was home. I was writing all night. Well, her story checks out. Her dress was ripped, she has bruises on her shoulder. I've never seen her before in my life. Well, how did she get your business card? - She said you gave it to her. - I have no idea. Captain, I swear to you. I was home. I don't know this girl. This is very important. I want you to take a good, long look at this young woman. Go on, take your time. Be very careful. Are you telling me that you've never seen this girl before - she walked in here today? - Yes, sir. I'm sure. I'd swear on 100 bibles. I have never seen this woman before in my life. I believe you. Lieutenant, did you hear what he said? Yes, I did. Did everyone in this room hear what he just said? You're all witnesses. Mom, can we go home now? Mom? I'd like you to meet Julie Teeger. Julie was in the show that you reviewed on Saturday night. But you missed her performance 'cause you snuck off to murder your girlfriend. No. She wasn't in the curtain call. She was in costume. She was wearing a wig and makeup. That's right. That's right. But in the first half she had a solo number, and she looked. Just like this You would've recognized her if you were there. I think I need to call my lawyer. We have phones downtown. You can call from there. Wait a minute. Your review? She's not too forgettable now, is she? Get out him here. Mom, I think this is it. It's from the admissions office. Dean of admissions. You open it. No, I can't. I'm too nervous. Mr. Monk, you open it. I'd be happy to. I'll call you later. Let you know what it says. Where are you going? Well, all my - My equipment is at home. - No, open it now. Here. Here. You understand, it's not going to be perfectly straight. Got that. Here we go. It's the big moment. El grande moment. Are you excited? Used to be. Open it. Are you ready? May 17th. Patricia Green, dean of admissions, department of theater and dance Administration building. Berkeley, California Dear Miss Teeger that's you. Wait, that is a nine. That makes the zip Or is it a four? Read it. Read it. May 17th read it from where you were.

You can't stop reading in the middle of a letter. May 17th. Patricia Green, dean of admissions, department of theater and dance, administration building, Berkeley, California, Dear Miss Teeger"
"Step into it, now. Come on, Petey. Don't be afraid of the ball. Step into one, now. Come on, kid. Here we go, Petey. Nice level swing, now. Eye on the ball Petey. Comme on, you can do it. Here we go, level swing. All right. Hey, that's all right. Hey, Petey, it's all right. See that ball. Wait for a good pitch. Come on, Petey. Looking good, Martha. You want to play? We need a center fielder. - You trying to kill me, Chauncey? - Don't talk like that. You're gonna outlive us all. Hey, here we go, petey. Come on, now! Step into one, now. Meet the ball. Here we go. You can do it. This is your pitch, Petey. Comme on now, this one is yours. Meet the ball. Here we go, Petey. All that practice about to pay off. Come on, Petey. That a boy, Petey! That's how you do it! That's how you do it, right there, kid. Somebody get that. Those things cost four bucks each. Nice hit, Petey! Attaboy! Look at all this stuff. I guess we have to pack it all up. Let's worry about it after the funeral. I still can't believe this. She beat cancer twice to die like that? Hit by a baseball. At least she didn't suffer. Her fish. They must be starving. There you go. I know. I Miss her too. What's that? Bills Mostly. I'll give them to the lawyer. Beth Beth, look at this. What is it? Is that a baseball? It's postmarked tuesday. That was three days before she died. -= 807 =- - Don't touch it. - I'm not touching it. I don't even want to look at it. Thank you for coming. We caught a weird one here. - I mean, this is off the charts. - What happened? What did you do here? We rearranged the squad room. I guess I should start at the beginning. On friday, a woman named Martha Murphy was killed. She was hit by a baseball. She was power walking past the little league field when a 12-year-old kid named petey cunningham knocked one over the fence and beaned her, left temple. I mean, what are the odds, right? A million to one? - A billion to one, maybe. - You rearranged the squad room. Why? It's supposed to be more efficient. We've, broken it down into five different units. - It's actually working out pretty well. - Whatever. Listen, get this Yesterday, Martha's family flies in from Denver. They go to her house. They're gonna get grandma's affairs in order. Guess what they found? It's the darndest thing. - In 30 years of law enforcement - Here's what I don't nderstand. What was the problem with the way it was? The way it was before was the way It's always been. I haven't even gotten to the voodoo stuff yet. - Voodoo? - I mean, it's so random, isn't it? You got all these arbitrary formations and I mean, who can work like this? It's madness. Okay! I don't know what I was thinking. Randy, let's put it back the way it was. What, you mean right now? For how long? Until Monk dies. You heard the captain. Let's move the desks back the way they were. Let's go, sergeant. Give me a hand with this one here. Captain, yeah. Let me just grab that there. Hey, guys, let's go, let's go, let's go. We don't have all day. That's right. Yeah, thank you. Don't touch that. Yeah, captain. Yeah, if you can get that one back there. There we go. There we go. All right. Chair. Yeah, that one's a little off. It's a-askew. You know, kind of Okay, now, that's too far. You went too That's the way it was. Yeah, almost. So what did you find at her house? Over here. Voodoo doll. We've already traced it from a store in the haight Reverend Jorgensen's voodoo boutique. Just sent fenderman and kramer up there to take a look. It was postmarked last tuesday in nob hill. Checked with post office. The postmark is 100% legit. So here's what we have. The doll was mailed three days before she died. And I'm looking at it, but it's just not possible. Wait a minute. What? I'm sorry. Something about voodoo? - She was exercising? - Yes, sir. Power Walker, came by every afternoon. At the same time? - Varied 3:30, 4:00. - So she was walking along here. The ball came over the fence. Are there a lot of balls hit over this wall? Not really. Every now and then, maybe. It was a hell of a hit, actually. I mean, too bad about Mrs. Murphy, but Petey really got all of it, 'cause you kept your eye on the ball. You listened to me, waited for your pitch. It was a beautiful hit. I mean, until the, you know. Right. Hi, Petey. Did you know, Mrs. Murphy? No, sir. Am I going to jail? - Probably not. So what do you think? Act of god, right? Yeah, so how do you explain the doll? I can't explain it yet. You want me to start rounding up witch doctors? That'd probably make a hell of a lineup, though. You know, it's not funny. I used to laugh about it too. About what? Voodoo, black magic. Wait, you can't actually believe in that stuff. Somebody predicted that poor woman would get hit by a baseball three days before it happened. How would you explain it? Well I mean - Maybe - Well, wait, I got it. Well she walked by here every day, right? So maybe the killer was waiting back here behind this tree with a baseball gun. A baseball gun? There's no such thing. Yeah, but there are pitching machines. So how would your baseball-gun killer - that's a good name for him by the way. - How would he know someone would hit a home run at exactly that moment? And what happened to the other baseball? Yeah, the baseball. It's voodoo. It's real, and it kills people. How about this? She had an insurance policy with a no-suicide clause. So she had to make it look like an accident. She came here, she waited for a home run to be hit. She grabs the ball and cracks her own cranium. With a baseball? She fractured her cranium? Was she that strong? - She exercised. - She exercised. I think voodoo's looking better and better. Okay, let's be rational here. We live in the real world. It is governed by science, physics, laws of nature. There is always, always a non-voodoo explanation for everything. Except voodoo. I don't understand. Did some Gypsy put a curse on you when you were a child? - I don't want to talk about it. - We'll be right there. Randy, what is it? Hat? It's another doll. Hi, lieutenant. - Is this a crime scene? - I don't know. I think so. - I don't know what the hell it is. - Ed, just tell himwhat you told me. Okay, remember this a couple days ago? There was thunder and lightning. The guy kept golfing. Remember you said what a Jerk the guy was, how he single-handedly proved Darwin's theory? - What about it? - The guy's nam is Ralph Farris, okay? This is his place. He doesn't have any family, right? So this morning, the super comes in to start packing up and And what? And this. Postmarked a week ago, nob hill. Go ahead and open it. - No, you can open it, sir. - I'll open it. Although, technically, I am just a consultant. Sergeant, - you're not helping. - Yes, sir. I'll open it. It's another doll, isn't it? And there's a lightning bolt coming out of its head? No, it's his neck. No, you're right. It's his head. Now do you believe me? What What time is it? It's not 8:00, is it? I have a surprise, a good surprise. It's a good thing. We're going away. We're going on vacation. No, thank you. You've been working too hard. You need a break. I already made a reservation. It's a five-star resort in Santa Barbara. Five stars means immaculate. Here's the brochure. We don't have to fly. It's right down the coast. And get this Your room is on the tenth floor. Room 1010, how about that? Wait, wait. We talked about this. I don't really do vacations. Did I mention it's my treat? It won't cost you a nickel. Room 1010? What about Julie? Julie's still on the internship in Washington. So It's just you and me, boss! - You ready? Here we go! - Wait a second. Now, you mean? - Right now? - Yeah, that's the fun of it. We just get up and go. We're fancy-free! - We're fancy-free? - Yeah. Is that what you just said? How can I leave? I'm still working on the voodoo thing. They won't even Miss you. They'll be fine. - I have to call the captain and - No, no. I'll call the captain. I'll do that. You just get your coat. Captain Stottlemeyer, please. Hi, it's Natalie. I'm taking Mr. Monk out of town for a couple of days. Yeah, I agree. He needs a break. So don't even bother calling. Get the coat. I will, I will, as soon as we get back. Okay. All right, bye. - He wants us to take a lot of pictures. - That phone's unplugged. - Pardon me? - It's not plugged in. There's the cord. Are you calling me a liar? - It's not plugged in. - So you're calling me a liar? I don't know what to say. It's not plugged in. Natalie, what is going on? Are you in trouble? It's this case, Mr. Monk. I hate this case. - What, th th Two voodoo dolls. Three. The captain called an hour ago. Excuse me? - Are you in charge? - Yes, ma'am. We both are. Mostly him. It wasn't his heart. It was that doll. That voodoo doll killed him. Yes. Miss Dilworth, Angeline Dilworth. - He was my uncle. - Ms. Dilworth, I need you to take a deep breath? Can you do that for me? - Are you okay? - I'm gonna wait out here. Natalie, you're being ridiculous. I can't go in. I'm sorry. Yeah, I hate to mention this, but it is technically your job. - Then fire me. - I'm not going to fire you. Just don't go anywhere. You're my ride home. I hate this case. You've made that clear. You hate the case I was upstairs. I heard him scream. I came back down. I guess he had opened the mail, He just collapsed. I'm an E.R Nurse. I tried everything. I did cardiocerebral resuscitation. And I just It was too late, and He was just gone. We found these on the kitchen counter Nitroglycerine. Yeah, he had a bad heart. He'd been sick for a long time. That's why I moved back To help. I was the only family he had. Captain, we're all done here. Can I take him? I want Monk to have a look at him. Where the hell is he? I don't know. Hey, there you are. Where the hell you been? - I called two hours ago. - It's Natalie. She didn't even give me the message. She's all twisted up about this case. She's outside right now. She won't come in. Now, wait a minute. Let me get my head around this. You are the level-headed, brave one now? She's shaking her head. It's this voodoo stuff. She she believes it. - Yeah, I don't think she's coming in. - I can't really blame her. We've all got the heebie-jeebies. Say hello to doll number three. - Heart attack. - Yep. Victim number three, Robert Boyd, 64 years old. Guy was a big fish. He owned boyd teletronics. The cell phone company? So, according his niece, Angeline dilworth That's her right over there. He's had a bad ticker for years. She's been worried about him, especially this last week. Why is that? Apparently, he was obsessed with the voodoo killings. He was watching the news, following the case. - He's real superstious. - Yeah, so I see. So he goes to collect the mail, including this box. Yeah, same as the others Postmarked three days ago, no return address. He opens the box, sees the doll. Bob's your uncle, his heart just stops. ""Bob's your uncle""? That doesn't sound right. Well, Bob was her uncle Uncle robert. - Right, but that doesn't matter. - Excuse me. - It's a figure of speech. - A figure of whose speech? - I've never heard - His name is Robert No, I know. No, no, back up a second. I've never heard ""bob's your uncle"" before. Have you been to Australia? - No, I've never been to Australia. Bob's your uncle, mate. Didgeridoo. Have you been Have you been to Australia? Did you, like, see a movie, like? Like, ""that's a knife, mate."" Is there a problem? It's upside down. What is? The horseshoe. It's supposed to point up, so the good luck stays in the shoe. He was a superstitious guy. I'm surprised he didn't know that. Maybe that's why it didn't work. We haven't met. I'm Adrian Monk. I've heard of you. You're that famous detective. I'm Angeline Dilworth. I understand you were here alone when it happened. - That's right. - Did your uncle know the other victims? Martha Murphy or Ralph Farris? Natalie just called from the driveway. She wants to go home. Now? Yep, she's in pretty bad shape, I can tell. - You'd better take care of her. - What can I do? You've seen normal people, sensitive people, taking care of each other. Do what they do. Call you later. I'm sorry about your uncle. Look at this place. It's like halloween the year round. Lucky Bath crystals. Incense powder. Money powder. It's guaranteed to cure all financial woes. - Well, you should buy it. - Can't afford it. Cupid's arrow. It's a love potion. - What? - It's not working. Good. Are these the same voodoo dolls from the news? Be very careful with that. That's a very powerful instrument. - Don't give him your real name. - Why not? Just to be safe. - The dolls. - Right. Reverend Jorgensen. - My name is Leland Stottlemeyer. - So is mine. We'd like to ask you a couple of questions about your merchandise. We're gonna be a while here. Thank you. Thank you. I've been talking to you guys all week, and I'm all talked out. Well, that's unfortunate, because there was another incident, - Did you sell this doll? Probably. Looks like mine. You're three for three, because all three dolls came from your shop. Give me a break. I can't be responsible for how my dolls are used. Did did you take out this advertisement? What if I did? It's no big deal. Could be a motive. - A motive? - Publicity. Seem to be pretty busy here. You think I killed all those people for publicity? How? How did I do that? We don't know. We don't know yet. Are we done here? Yeah, we're done. If, you think of anything else, please, don't hesitate to call me or call lieutenant Natalie, it's me. Feeling better? Great, listen I have a favor to ask. I don't know what's going on with you and all this voodoo stuff, but here's the thing. You cannot be the unstable one. I cannot take care of you. This morning I spent six hours organizing my cereal boxes. I've to be honest. I cannot function like this. Do you understand? What? I got it. They'll be here in five minutes. Was there anything else in the box? When did it arrive? The postmark says pacific heights. Do you know anybody in pacific heights? They miss Pelled your name. T- e-a-g-e-r. Who spells your name like that? The devil. Excuse me? The head's been cut off. That's what it means. I'm I'm gonna be decapitated. It doesn't mean anything. I mean, it could've broken off in shipping, right? You're right. It has been cut with some kind of scalpel. What's gonna happen to Julie? Look at me. Look at me. All right, this is me talking. Nothing is going to happen. I don't know what's going on here, but it isn't hoodoo, and it isn't voodoo. Someone Is just trying to scare you. Voodoo isn't real. It's a fairy tale. You've been asking me all week How can I believe in this stuff? When Mitch first started his tour, I lived in South Carolina. We had a little apartment off base. There was this woman who lived down the hall, Ms. Ayida. She claimed to be a voodoo priestess. She said that Mitch was in danger. She told me to warn him. I didn't say anything. I didn't warn him. I guess I didn't take it seriously. The next day he was shot down. And you blame yourself? It's not a fairy tale, Mr. Monk. We get your call. Hey, good morning. How'd you sleep? I didn't. Do you know anything about ceiling fans? - Like what? - Do they ever come off? There's one in my bedroom. I swear it was whispering my name all night. Try the couch. It doesn't matter. I'm never sleeping again. - Where's Mr. Monk? . We've got 40 guys on the case, Nat. - What are you looking for? - A knife. I threw them out. The blender, too, and the hedge clippers. Got it. Listen, everything's gonna be fine. We're gonna put you in a safe house this afternoon. Randy, I'm not leaving. - I'm never leaving this house again. - You're gonna have armed guards. It's already been scheduled, Natalie. The cookie. Sorry. Doesn't matter. I could have the whole sixth fleet guarding me. It's just a doll. You really don't believe in it? Witchcraft, voodoo? I'm a Pisces. We're not superstitious. Where's your milk? No toque la muneca, you understand me? Do not touch the Don't touch anything, okay? We'll have an officer there in 20 minutes. I told the mayor not to go public. Now we got 50 copycats out there. Half the town is getting voodoo dolls in the mail, and all of them want a squad car in their driveway. But these are the four, the only four that count. The same wrapping paper, the same handwriting, it's strange. He doesn't write the address on the box. He uses these labels. What does that tell us? I don't know. I don't know. It's the damndest thing, right? What about the victims? Any connection? The FBI's been running their names all day. There's no connection. Here's some more bad news. Our number-one suspect, our only suspect, is not gonna fly. - The guy who was selling the dolls. - Reverend Jorgensen. He's got an alibi for all three victims. And now Natalie. Now Natalie. How's she doing? She's scared to death. I just talked to Randy. She hasn't gotten off the couch all day. Now he says she's wearing one of those plastic dog funnels around her neck. That can't be good. We have got to do something. She's going to completely unravel. It would take me forever to replace her. But of course, that's not the most important thing. This isn't about me. You know, if she really does take this crap seriously, there is something we can do. Don't answer it. Don't answer it! It's okay. I know who it is. Thank you for it coming. Right here, right this way. This is Hadley Jorgensen. Reverend Jorgensen. Captain Stottlemeyer told me you had a problem. He thought I could help. How? How? Sister, you have been cursed. And without getting too technical, I'm here to un-curse you. Mr. Monkis going to help. I am? I've taken the liberty of making a replica of the dolls, working from photos. Does this look about right? How do you know this will work? Sister, I guarantee it. You shall be cleansed. Can't you just fast forward and get to the end? What what is that? It's an herb. It's called asafetida. Also known as devil's dung. We're done here. Thank you very much for coming, though. Please let him finish. Yes, it's almost ready. What is it? It's my own original recipe. If you would be so kind as to reattach its head. Here's some adhesive. Some witchgrass, some coltsfoot. Mandrake root. Smidgen more. All I need now is the doll. One second. It doesn't have to be perfect. Almost done. It's symbolic, really. There we go. The forces of darkness are gathering. Hold on. It doesn't have to be perfect! Wait a second. It doesn't have to be perfect. - Almost done. - Doesn't Wait one sec - please, just let him finish! - Hold on. She's suffering, Mr. Monk! It doesn't have to be that's close enough. The potion is ready. Potion's ready. Cleanse this body. Release its soul. Expel its darkness. Make her whole. What did you do? - What? - Did you drink that? You said You're supposed to rub it on your neck! - What, are you mental? - What do we do? - What do we do? - What? 911. 911! Another chant? Call 911. How do you feel? - God, it hurts. - I know, I know. Just hang on. Hang on, they should be here any They're here. Here they're. Maybe we should induce vomiting. Let's call that plan never-do. We got a call. Somebody o. D.'d? - What did she take? - An anti-hex potion, about 15 ingredients. She wasn't drink it. Angeline, right? Mr. Monk, small world. I didn't know you were a paramedic. - I didn't mention that? - No you didn't. - What was in it specifically? - Nothing that unusual. Some alkanet root, some deer tongue, root bark, motherwart, graveyard dirt. What wasn't in it? Write everything down. I'll go with you. Sorry, there's There's no room. You can ride with me, if you don't mind the mess. You allergic to any medication? You were there. You were a witness. I said the potion was ready. I never said to drink it. That's not voodoo. That's voo-don't. What is all this stuff? It's gonna get us killed! They're my good-luck charms! It's a small world. Excuse me? The paramedic, I met her before. She was Robert Boyd's niece. Wait, wait And before that! Victim number two! She was the paramedic on the golf course. There's got to be a good explanation. I know Angeline, and she's a good person. You know her? I mean, I've seen her around. She's a customer. She's a customer? Has she ever bought any of those dolls? Sure five, maybe six. That's it. That's it. She's the guy. - Who's the guy? - The paramedic! Angeline, she's the connection. Her uncle was loaded. He was the real target. The other dolls were just distractions. It was so simple. It was brilliant! All she need were some packages that had been postmarked. So she mailed a few empty boxes to herself, then she waited. She need the right accident, the right victim. Martha Murphy was perfect. She lived alone. Angeline borrowed her key, snuck into her house, and left the box and customized doll in plain sight. Two days later, she did the same thing with Mr. Farris. The third victim was the real target. Killing her uncle was easy. Angeline's a paramedic. She knew exactly what drugs to use, something untraceable, something that would look like a heart attack. She put some good-luck charms around the room to make him look superstitious, and the stage was set. Thanks a lot, detective. I'll probably never sell another voodoo doll. You're in a lot of pain. Let me get you something. Do you have a cell phone? No, I never use them. I prefer to communicate over the astral plane. Fine. Go! Come on. You have to run it. Do it. Just do it now! - Call an ambulance! - A different, this one's cursed. Right away. I don't understand. Why me? She was afraid I was getting too close. She was trying to keep me distracted. 'cause she knew how much you cared about me. She knew you'd be so worried about me, - you couldn't think straight. - That was her theory. But don't forget, she was clinically insane. I'm so relieved. I've never been happier to be wrong. - About what? - About everything. About voodoo, about Mitch and me. Good! I'm glad. Welcome back to the real world, the world of facts and science, and rational thought. You missed one. - You were saying? - Facts and science Natalie, if you let superstion rule your life, you're just avoiding any responsibility. - You missed another one. - No. You missed it. I watched you you missed it. - Where was i? - Rational thought. Exactly. Superstitions, hexes, curses, voodoo They're all just crutches that people use when they can't cope with the"
"Hello. Hey mom. I got your message. Guess where I am. In the tub. It's my third bath today. I know. I know about the drought. I actually talked to Dr. Bell about it. He said not to feel guilty. He said I should pamper myself. I know, he's great. Mom, he's my therapist. How can you ask me that? I guess he's cute, for a shrink. Hello? Mom. Hello? Jesus, Pearl. You scared me to death. Who let you in? Oh, god! -= 808 =- ""Mr. Monk Goes to Group Therapy"" VO By : ¤Aka¤ Team Subs-Addicts"" - Morning, Mr. Monk. I have your mail. - Okay, just throw it away. I can't throw it away until I look at it. What are you doing? - The dishes. - That's not the dishes. That'sadish, one dish. You can't waste water like that. Haven't you been reading the papers? - We're in the middle of a huge drought. - Not the middle. Nobody can really say if it's actually in the middle. It's a big problem. It's all over the news. The reservoir's almost empty. Nobody's washing their cars or watering their lawns. Natalie, what was I supposed to do? I had an omelet. That's not funny, Mr. Monk. What if everybody felt like that? - Do they? - No. So we're okay. - What is it? - It's from your HMO. - Don't open that. - It says ""important."" All the more reason Just throw it out. - Maybe it's good news. - Yeah, good news from my HMO. What do you think I won a free colonoscopy? It's a new policy. It's about your therapy. They're putting a cap on the number of sessions. Well, how many? Well, that's no problem. I go four times a week, so we're not even close. No, that's not 2,000 per year, Mr. Monk. That's total 2,000 total In your life. Total? I'm sure you're fine. That's a pretty big number. It says here that's seven times the national average. - What are you doing? - I'm adding. - Wait, you started in 1964? - No, those are the number of sessions. How many are left? That's good. Takes a water shortage to make you appreciate how refreshing a cold glass can be. But I guess that's human nature. - When something is rationed. - I don't care about that! I don't want to hear any small talk today, okay? No small talk. Only big talk. Big, vast talk. Something happened. This came this morning. What are you doing now? - What are you doing? - Looking for my glasses. My new bifocals, and it took took some getting used to and I don't care about that! Nobody cares about that. - Where'd you put 'em? - I was sitting right here. - Here! Here they are. - Thank you, thank you. All right, thank you very much. All right. - Yeah, it's - All right. What is this? - It's from my insurance company. - Yes, so I see. Today's session is number 2,000. This is it. This is my last session. This is the last session they'll reimburse you for, but you always have the option of paying yourself. - Well, how much is it? - It's 200. Dollars? $200? This is my last session. Oh, my god, we have 48 minutes. It's my last shot. We have to really focus, really focus. Adrian, I don't know how much we can do in one session. I made a list of all of my problems here, so Well, Adrian, that's That's not how it works. You see, therapy is an ongoing process, and the progress is incremental. Yeah, well, we have to try, okay? Let's knock off as many as we can, all right? ""My fear of disappointing my father."" Go. Adrian, i'm not comfortable working under this kind of pressure. All right, all right. Hold on. Okay, let's see now. We've talked about this before. The loss of your father came at an impressionable time in your life, and I think it created an emotional vacuum. Yeah, okay. Forget that one. We'll never get that one. ""Germophobia."" - Adrian, this is not a game show. - Germophobia. All right, germophobia. All right, germophobia. Your fear of germs is not unusual. Some people find that it helps to read scientific journals to demystify Pass. Okay, ""sibling rivalry."" - Well, I've never met Ambrose. - Pass! God. I've been in therapy for ten years. I have to have something to show for it. I mean, I we have to cure something here. ""Death of my mother."" Pass. Fear of height, pass. ""Fear of fear itself."" Yeah! Here here's one. ""Claustrophobia."" Claustrophobia. Now, we've discussed that. We talked about visualization. You remember that. I said if you ever feel trapped somewhere. You can imagine a door. I tried that once, but the door was locked. - Just imagine you have a key. - I tried that. The key didn't fit. - Maybe it's a skeleton key. - This is not working! Come on! You got to try harder. - Cure me, for god's sake. - Maybe there's another way around this? Let's see now. Wait a minute. This policy only applies to private sessions. You can join a group session. That's a new category. It's like starting over. Group? Yes. Now, I have one group that deals specifically with phobias and obsessive behavior. They meet twice weekly like clockwork. There would be other people there? Yes, it's a group. It's a group of people. Actually, this policy change might be a blessing in disguise. I think you could really benefit from this. They don't like me. - Adrian, they haven't met you. - They don't like me! I can't do it. All right. Sorry to hear that. I hope you reconsider, cause I think you'd get a lot out of it. Yeah, okay. ""Fear of bees."" Bees. Well, luckily we live in a more urban environment, so the fear - of bees - Pass. Fear of blenders. Well, if you don't own a blender, then, - actually - Pass. ""Fear of bees in blenders."" - Here. - Please go to group therapy. I don't have to. I can talk to him right here. - I think you're being ridiculous. - Yeah, ridiculous like a fox. Ready? Let's go. Oh, my god. Do you bike here too? Every morning. I remember you mentioning that once or twice. - Hello. - How you doing? Just fine. You're probably wondering how I'm doing. I been thinking a lot about my mother. I really can't give you a session right now. What session? We're just a couple of guys - in the park talking about my mother. - Join my group. We meet tuesdays and thursdays, 10:00 a.m. Wait, Dr. Bell! Wait! Dr. Bell! Come on, you're losing him. Turn! Come on! Go. Mush, mush. Mush! Okay, I'll join the group. Thank god. I have come to a decision. I am not going to the convention. - I thought you told your boss - You know what? Let him fire me. I don't care. I hate my job anyway. It's medical supplies, wheelchairs, and prosthetic arms. It's gruesome. I hope he does fire me. Rhonda, I know you don't like to travel. But this is your career. This is important. You shouldn't just throw it all away. Dr. Bell There's a man. I'm so glad you changed your mind. Come in, come in. We're just getting started. Who is this? This is Adrian. Yes, he's gonna join our little group. Our little band of brothers? I think you'll fit right in. What, without asking us? Rhonda, it's not your decision. Adrian, this is Rhonda. Hello. It's nothing personal. I just don't like surprises. - I'm sorry. - Adrian, you don't have to apologize. You're right. I'm sorry that I'm sorry. Adrian, this is Augie. Arachnophobia, agoraphobia, - claustrophobia. - Augie, we've talked about this before. You don't have to tell everybody about your phobias. I just hate it when he does that. - You hate when anybody does anything. - Shut up. And of course, you know Harold. I just want you to know, for the record, i'm glad you're here. And I don't feel threatened in the slightest. I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but I hope we can put our differences aside and work with neven together as a team. After all, it takes a village. You call him neven? Well, things are a little less formal in group therapy. You still can't shake hands. I see we have our work cut out for us. Icanshake hands. I used to use a wipe too. Remember? I was so germophobic. I'd always have a wipe in my pocket, like this, and I'd wipe my hands, like this, and then I'd fold it up into a little square and put it in my other pocket, like this. I was pathetic. Adrian, why don't you take a seat? Wait, excuse me. He cannot sit there. You can't sit there! - This is Barbara's seat. - Barbara? Yes, she was in our group. She died three weeks ago. - She drowned in her swimming pool. - It doesn't matter how she died! The point is that was her regular seat, and I just think it is disrespectful. Thank you. All right, deep breath. Good. Adrian, in our last private session, we talked a bit about claustrophobia. I think that's a good place to start, since that's a condition - that all of you have in common. - Not me. - Please. - I mean, not anymore. I used to hate tight spaces, but neven cured me. Really? You're cured? Well, you never mentioned that. I was about to when Adrian walked in. You know what did it? Visualization. That was really great advice, Dr. B. I visualized a door, and then I visualized a key to the door. Well, that's great. I'm really happy for you. Well, I couldn't have done it without you, doc. You're a god. Thank you. Gracias. Danke schoen. Spasibo. Arigato! Cam on anh. That's, Vietnamese. I tried it visualiztion, the key and the door. It didn't work. Why don't you have your assistant visualize it for you? You have an assistant? Yes, Adrian has a very difficult job, which requires an assistant. He's a decorated police detective. He's a real hero. What about us? I mean, we're out there all alone, assistant-less. We have no help. We have no one to lean on. We're the real heroes. I think Barbara's the lucky one. She doesn't have to deal with any of this crap anymore. Yeah, I know. And I'm gonna Miss her too. We all Miss her. We'll be grieving for a long time. I wish I had an assistant. She could grieve for me. - What is your problem? - What isyourproblem? Okay, now, you see, now, now, we all have problems. You're just jealous. You've been jealous of me since the first day we met, which, by the way, I like to refer to as black tuesday. - Why would I be jealous of you? - Okay. I made $210,000 last year. How much did you make? - $2 million. - Liar! He's lying. Admit it, Adrian. My success is killing you. It's eating you up. - What success? - I'm on the city council. - People voted for me. - Because they don't know you! - Did anybody here vote for this clown? - Not me. Dr. Bell, you're in his district. Did you vote for him? - You not supposed to ask that question. - That's a no. See, neven didn't vote for you, Harold. Suck on that. I'm gonna rezone your whole neighborhood. - I can do that! - Why don't you rezone your I'm gonna put a kentucky fried chicken on your roof! Stop it! Stop it, please! - I know where your roof is! - Stop, please! - Sit down. - Please sit down, Harold. - What about him? - Adrian, please, sit. Yeah, please, sit. Harold, stop it. Sit. Adrian please. Down. Good. Now I know you're not a big fan of Harold Krenshaw's. - I hate him. He can go to hell. - Yeah, I understand, but besides him, besides Harold, who can go to hell, - how was the session? - Awful. Well, what were the people like? I don't know. - How many were there? - I don't know. Five, eight. They hardly talked about me at all. All they did was drone on and on and on about their own lives and their own - problems. - Yeah, Mr. Monk, isn't that the point? Nobody cares about them, Natalie. Dr. Bell is just as bad. He kept interrupting everybody, telling little parables and stories. I'm wasting my time. Group therapy never helped anybody. Then why don't you quit? - Are you following us? - I think you're following me. Harold, we were here first. We came straight from Dr. Bell's. A lot of his patients come here, because it's right across the street. For example, that guy over there. - He's not even in our group. - Not anymore. He left the nest five weeks ago. That's Xavier Danko. He's completely cured. He was more screwed up than anybody. What was wrong with him? He was obsessed with an exotic dancer named tiffany something. He was following her. He got better. I want to be next. I want to get better too. That's why you have to leave the group, Adrian. You're ruining everything. - Has every right to be there, Harold. - No, he doesn't. Excuse me! He has 20 items. It's only one item. They're all the same. - But you're buying 20. - But it's the same item. - But you're buying 20. - Of the same item. There's the sign. It doesn't say 12differentitems. I think it's 12 items total. - Thank you. - You I'm buying the first ten, and he's buying the rest. Well played, Adrian, well played. Sir, are you buying anything? No, I'm just trying to get him to quit my group. Forget it. I'm not quitting. Why not? You were just complaing about it five minutes ago. You said you hated it. That was before I knew you wanted me to quit. Hey, I'll see you thursday. I'll save you a seat. I have a coupon. There he is. - Thank you for coming. - What happened? We were wondering the same thing. - Either he jumped or was pushed. - We thought you might know the guy. His employment card We found it in his wallet. Dr. Bell. You know him? He was in my group. - Augie something. - Yeah, Augie Wellman. He was a mechanical engineer. He lived upstairs. So was Mr. Wellman depressed? - Of course he was. - So it was suicide? I don't think so. Look at his wrists. Hair has been pulled out. Someone taped them. He was tied up. Could be a serial killer. He's killing people according to their phobias. This guy was afraid of heights, so he pushed him off the roof. Augie wasn't afraid of heights. He was afraid of spiders. That's different. It's killing people using the opposite of their phobias. The opposite killer. So you're saying the opposite of a spider is a tall building? What do you think the opposite of a spider is? I have no idea, but it's not a tall building. Tell that to the opposite killer. Are you crying? No, I have allergies. What are the odds? The odds of what? Two dead in two months from the same group. It looked straight up to me. Accidental drowning. She had water in her lungs. She had a severe concussion, like she hit her head on the way in. - Did you check the house? - No sir. I don't know what you're expecting to find. I mean, the crime scene is long gone. The girl was cremated eight weeks ago. The case is cold. - I wonder how cold. - I don't follow. Look, she died october 2nd, in the morning. It must have been chilly. - It probably was. - Where's the towel? There's no towel next to the pool. I wouldn't go swimming first thing in the morning in october without a towel. I mean, I wouldn't go swimming anyway, but you see what I mean. I think she was killed. Let me guess. The victim was not afraid of water. It's him The opposite killer. - That's his M.O. - There is no opposite killer. If there were, you would have been killed by a falling rocket scientist years ago. Okay, where are we? We got a jumper with some hair missing from his wrists. We've got a missing towel. Can't go knocking on the D.A.'s door with that, not yet. Well, let's keep digging. Oh, my god. What? What is it? I think somebody is killing off my therapy group. You're smiling. Sorry. Somebody is killing off my therapy group. You're still smiling. And then there were three. Well I think we better get started. Who wants to go first? I know it's difficult. It's overwhelming. First, Barbara drowning, now Augie. If you want to cancel the session, Cancel next week, I certainly understand. I don't think we should cancel. In fact, i think we need each other now more than ever. - Please. - We need your strength, Neven, Your guidance. You're the beacon. You're the light that will see us through our darkest hour. So, Harold, how is it up there in Neven's butt? You lonely? Getting scared of the dark? Rhonda, let's not forget rule number one - Don't make it personal. - I'm sorry. I just don't understand. Why would Augie jump? - He didn't seem that depressed. - Maybe he saw a ladybug - Or a firefly. - He didn't jump. - The newspapers said - I know what they said. The police withheld some information. The truth is we still don't know the exact cause of death. I think Augie was murdered. I think someone tied him up - and dragged him to that roof. - Oh, my god! Dr. Bell, i don't know what to feel. Tell me what to feel. - I think we should all feel confused. - Confused i can do that. I think Barbara was murdered too. You said ""think."" You're telling me you're not sure? I think someone, for some reason, Is killing this group off, one by one. What do the police say? They're looking into it. They'll probably want to talk to each of us. Why? What, you th - They think it's one of us? - It's possible. - One of us? - It's possible. There is a possibility that one of you is Not quite sane. All right, let's not get carried away here. It's just a theory. It was him. - It was Monk! - Excuse me? He hates us. I heard him yesterday talking at the supermarket. - He hates all of us. - I didn't say that, exactly. And he said you were boring. He said that he hated all your stories, Which, in my opinion, Are the highlights of every session. - That's not what i meant, doc. - That's all right, Adrian. I admit that i have, on occasion, to ramble on. I get carried away occasionally. That's all. - What in god's name are you doing? - Investigating. Harold, please sit down. Who had a motive A motive for murder? You did. You resent the group. Admit it, you want neven all to yourself! - That's ridiculous. - Is it? Which of us would know how to commit a perfect crime Without leaving a single clue? Who's the famous homicide expert? - I am. - And who's in the perfect position To steer the investigation away from himself? Me. All right, hold on here. Adrian was trying to warn us. A classic cry for help. Or Was it an attempt to divert suspicion? Do you even have an alibi for wednesday? How about when Barbara was killed? Of course you don't. Here's what happened. The hmo changed their policy No more private sessions. You were desperate. You needed to kill one of us. So there'd be an opening in the group. - Do you deny it? - Of course i deny it. Which is exactly what a guilty man would say! That's true. Augie was next. You lured him up to the roof. It was easy he trusted you. You're gonna pick us off, one by one, Until you have Neven all to yourself. It's a guy. What you are suggesting is absurd. Adrian's not capable of killing anyone. Mr. Monk, you're not a killer. - Are you sure? - Yes, of course i am. What if Harold is right? It all fits. I know 1,000 ways to kill people. And i have a motive. I admit it. - I want Dr. Bell to myself. - No, it couldn't be you. - You have an alibi. - What alibi? - I was here. I was alone. - No, you weren't alone. You were with yourself. - I wasn't alone, i was with myself? - Exactly. You would know if you were sneaking out. And killing people. That's the kind of thing that people tend to remember. Maybe not. I black out sometimes. You've seen it. Sometimes five hours go by, And i don't know where i've been. That's true, but it's always triggered by something, Like you've seen yourself naked, Or you saw a documentary on the nature channel. Just stop Look at me! It wasn't you. It couldn't have been you. Let's move on. Who else was in the group? - There's Harold. Could it be Harold? - I don't think so. You're right. God would never do that. It would make me too happy. Okay, let's eliminate Harold. - Who's left? - Rhonda. I think they're closed. Door's open. Hello? It's Adrian, from group. - Do you smell that? - Do i smell that? I'll be smelling that for the rest of my life. She's dead. She mixed bleach and ammonia? Chlorine gas. Rhonda's worked here for nine years. She would never make mistake like that. Murder. Oh, my god, Mr. Monk, that's three. If i was gonna kill somebody, This is exactly how i would do it, with Cleaning supplies. Look, Mr. Monk, it couldn't have been you. Relax. These aren't your brands. You buy the good stuff. These are the cheap store brands. That's true. That's true. - Danko. - Who? Xavier Danko The other patient. We saw him at the supermarket, remember? He was buying cleaning supplies, the exact same bottles. Harold said that he quit group therapy about a month before Barbara O'keeffe was murdered. Danko must have revealed something in therapy, Something big, something worth killing for. What'd you do? My god, let's get you some fresh air. Come on. Come on. This way. Come on. Somebody's here. It's okay, i'll go. You'll get the next one. Oh, my god, i'm buried alive! I'm buried Help me! Let me out! It's no use. I've been banging on it for an hour. I still think it was you. - Please, let us out! - Help! Help! - Let us out of here! - Pease! Let us out! - Please stop touching me. - I'm not touch you're touching me. I'm not touching you. You're touching me. - Just stay on your side. - I'm i don't have a side! Just back up four or five millimeters. Okay, that's your side. Now, this is my side. From that end of the spare tire. To the jumper cables. Stay over there, and we'll be fine. My side's carpeted. - My side's quieter. - That's impossible. Your side has the muffler, so my side is quieter. - Grow up! - You grow up. I don't feel like it. Captain Stottlemeyer, please. I got to get out of here. I can't stand it! The ceiling is crushing me! I feel it closing in! - It's like i'm being buried alive! - Stop it. I can't! You're making it very hard for me to panic! Just calm down, please! I thought you were cured. What about your technique Visualization with the door and the key and all that? That doesn't work. It never worked. I was just trying to impress Dr. B. Why do i do that? Why do i Why do i care what people think? What's wrong with me? There's nothing wrong with you. The truth is I actually - Admire you. - Stop it. - No, no, i mean it. - Don't. I mean it. Look, we're we're basically the same guy. We have the same kinds of problems, The same issues. But you you're out there. You're in the world. You have a family. You have a real job. You don't let it stop you. That's nice of you to say. Look at me. Harold, look at me. Look at me. I think we've been looking at this the wrong way. This trunk, you know, these walls. They're not closing in on us. - They're not? - No. They're They're protecting us, really. Protecting us? Yeah, they're keeping the bad stuff out. Protecting us? Protecting us from germs and snakes - And harmonicas. - And nature and my mother and her new boyfriend. - And Xavier Danko. - And Xavier Danko. Yeah, that's right. This trunk is our friend. I've been in therapy for ten years. I think this is the first real breakthrough I've ever had. This group-therapy thing really works. It really does. I wish Dr. B could see us. He wouldn't believe it. He's walking away. Keep cranking. It's working. This was a good idea. Here - Thank you. I appreciate that. - My pleasure. Hold still. - What? - That's neven's house. How do you know? He had a cocktail party last summer. And he invited you? I didn't say that. Okay, we We have to find a phone and call the police. There's not enough time. It takes the police 4 minutes and 20 seconds to get here. Don't ask. Be careful. He's got a gun. Listen, Adrian, if anything happens to me Nothing's gonna happen to you. I won't let it. - Ready? - Let's do it. Well, there you are. I was about to come and get you. The police will be here soon. I'm so sorry. Xavier was just telling me how he killed Tiffany Bolt. The woman he was following? Yeah, that's right. He put her car and her body in the reservoir, then he began to get worried. Of course, the water shortage. Right. The reservoir levels have been dropping. He was afraid the car or the body were about to be discovered. What did I do? He told everyone in the group about his obsession. So you were the only people on earth who could connect him to that poor girl. Right. He was trying to kill us before the body was found. Actually, we have some news too. Right. Harold and I were locked in the trunk, but we dealt with it. We had a real breakthrough. Actually, I I definitely think we can cross claustrophobia off both of our lists. Do you believe in god? Excuse me. My friend was just talking. We didn't interrupt you. Go ahead. See, what we realized was the trunk was protecting us from germs. - Nature and my mother and - Snakes. Founder Well, it's 10:00. I think we should get started. Where's everyone else? As you know, we had three members who were Well, who died. What about Harold? Harold Krenshaw did something quite extraordinary. He found another doctor. I don't understand. He wanted you to have these sessions with me all to yourself. You have quite a friend there, Adrian. A friend like that is a blessing. Now, as far as your hmo is concerned, these sessions are still technically group sessions. You'll just be a group of one. So So let's get started. Congratulations on your beating claustrophobia. I'm proud of you. So what's next? ""Death."" Death? - That's gonna be a tough one. - Yeah. Could you sit here? Of course. So I like this. I think I should have tried group therapy a long time ago. Team Subs-Addicts"""
"Wait no, no, no! Don't, don't! Don't no no! -= 809 =- ""Happy Birthday Mr. Monk"" VO By : ¤Aka¤  &  do_Ob Team Subs-Addicts"" - How about a watch? - I already have a watch. - Some people have two. - Why would I want two? Look, if you have one wristwatch you always know what time it is. If you have two, you're never sure. Come on. I have to get you something it's your birthday. Don't remind me. And not just any birthday, you're 50 years old. That's a milestone. You know, you don't understand. He's coming. He's coming. If you buy me something then I have to pretend to like it. And then I have to rember to thank you and then I have to return it. And it's a nightmare. It's a nightmare. Where is everybody? They're probably in the captain office. He said it was very important. - Where are the cups? - What cups? All the cups and the paper plates. Yesterday there was a big pile here. I don't know. We're late, come on. Wait A minute. What are you doing? I knew it. Why'd the captain want to see me, again? I told you, it's a double homicide in marin county. You said triple homicide. - I don't think so. - Hey, you said triple. All right What happened, did somebody get better? It's a party isn't it. It's a surprise party. No, Mr. Monk, I would never do that. I know how you hate parties. Nice try, Teeger. It's a surprise party, can't you just play along? - I don't wanna play along. - Come on, everybody's chipped in. We've been planning it for weeks. I can't. I can't do it. I hate birthdays. What were we thinking? He's the best detective in the world. I am not giving up, Mr. Monk. You're officially on notice. - I am throwing you a party. - As a matter of fact, you are not. Yes I am We're gonna have balloons and cake and dancing. For the love of god, why? Because, Mr. Monk, it's your birthday. And whether you like it or not, you have friends who love you and want to celebrate your life. - We're happy you were born. - You're so cruel. Oh, my god! Where's the rest of him? - That's all there is. - He's all squished! His name was Bradley Foster. He was the maintenance man here. Apparently, he fell into the compactor. I'm gonna send a guy out to check the parking lot for his car. Yeah, I'd look for a compact. - It's not funny. - Did you see what he was wearing? Those aren't briefs they're more like boxers. He was probably still alive when he dropped into the gears. The rotating blades must have ripped his spinal column and shredded his lungs. He must have been screaming and begging for his life the whole way down. Captain, this is Paul Wellman, the building manager. - He found the body. - And when was that Mr. Wellman? It was at 8:30. I had noticed that the door was open and that was kind of strange so i, you know, turned on the lights and I came in and that's when I saw the blood sort of Sort of trickling down. At first I thought it was an animal that had been trapped. I looked inside and - that's when I saw Bradley. - What do you think happened? Well the compactor must have jammed. I guess he forgot to turn off the circuit breaker. Look, I've been here 15 years and we have never had an accident - like this before. - Tell him, Randy. It's not an accident until we say it is. How long did he work here? Five years, give or take. He was a good man. Yeah, excuse me. You said you came in and you turned on the lights? That's right. Are you sure about that About the lights? Yes, sir. I'll never forget it. I turned on the lights and saw the blood. Why are you asking about the lights? Who turned them off? That makes things a whole lot more interesting. Let's seal this building. Talk to everybody. Mr. Wellman, was there anybody else here last night? Well there's a camera in the lobby, and I was just checking the tape. It looks like there was one other guy here. Meckler, Richard Meckler. - Meckler, got it. - Now, he left around midnight but I mean, I don't think that means anything 'cause he works late a lot. What does he do? THE WORLD'S FIRST SELF CLEANING VACUUM! Ladies and Gentlemen, my name is Richard Meckler. I'm a patent attorney. Now, I must hear a thousand bad ideas every year. And believe me, I've met every nut job in California. But when kurt pressman came into my office five months ago with this vacuum, the world's first self-cleaning vacuum cleaner, I knew I wanted to be a part of it. Let's bring kurt up and he can tell us all about it. Kurt Pressman ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it. Well done, sir. That's it. Give it up, people. Thank you, buddy. Self-cleaning vacuum. Do I wake or do I dream? I don't know, Mr. Monk. - And we are you last night Mr. Meckler - Last night? I was working late. Got home around 12:30. Yeah, 12:30. Here use mine. No thanks, I'm good. Did you, see anything unusual last night? Were there any strangers in the building? - No, sir. - What's all this about? - Do you know a Bradley Foster? - Yeah, the janitor. He was murdered last night. We found him in the basement. Oh, my god! Consumer currents? - You write for them? - Indeed. I bought my motorcycle last year because you guys recommended it. You gave it five stars. - How is it? - It's five stars. I love it. So thank you. Choppers aren't my department. I mainly cover household appliances like blenders and vacuum cleaners. But if you're in the market for an energy efficient three cycle dishwasher with half load option i'm your gal. TK. What's the ""T"" Stand For? It stands for my first name. Mr. Preston, excuse I'm sorry to bother you. I just have to know, how does it work? I mean, where does all that dust go? It's a high voltage electronic filter. It's in the brochure. - The dust is disintegrated. - Yeah, I didn't get a brochure. - I'm here with the police. - Police? Yeah, we're here about, something else completely unrelated, but I think the work you're doing is historic. A self-cleaning vacuum is right up there with the wheel or windex. - Thank you, thank you - Hold on. Where can I get one Or two? Actually, I could take two. We have a waiting list, and I'll make sure you're on it, Mr Monk, excuse me. Sorry I took so long. You had the diet, right? I can't tell. Is that diet? - Diet, definitely. - Diet? Great. - Thanks. - Pretty good turnout? I told you, partner, you build a better mousetrap. This is lt. Disher, he's with the San Francisco police. Yeah, i, I heard the police were here. Trina? Theresa? Why do you care? Because it'll make it slightly easier for me to track you down. Don't touch it! - It is a vacuum cleaner. - You're not suppose to touch. Richard? - Richard? - I can't Call 911. He's having a heart attack. - Oh, my god. Richard! - Captain! - Step back, step back. - Richard! Doctor! Get me a doctor. Is there a doctor in the house? Help him! Help him oh, my god! - Morning. - Good morning. How did you sleep? I was up all night thinking about that poor man, that lawyer. I've never actually seen anyone have a heart attack before. Is that the new vacuum? Where did you get it? The, the captain met this reporter from a consumer magazine. - She let me borrow it. - And how is it? It's spectacular. See there's no dust bag. You don't have to empty it. And if it picks up a coin or something, look There's a little tray. See, I think I'm in love. Well, I'm sure you two will be very happy. Come on, the captain's waiting for us. I almost forgot, we just have to stop off at my place. I forgot my cell phone. Excuse me. Good. We found your phone. It's in your bag. What are the odds? So where are they? Are they at your house? Come on, Mr. Monk, can't you just come with me? Just pretend to be surprised. They're your friends. They're waiting for you. They love you. They wanna do something special for you. I can't I can't. I can't do it. Why? Tell me why? There has to be a reason. I'll tell you. But you can't tell anyone. I haven't even told dr. Bell. Okay, I promise. My god, what is it? All right. I was ten years old, and there was this cowboy. - A cowboy? - Cowboy Hank. He was He was on Tv every week and he was my hero. When I turned ten my mother surprised me. She hired cowboy Hank to come to my party. It must have cost her every nickel she had. And, he, he brought a rope with him. A rope? Like a lasso. Oh, my god. What did he do with it? Tricks. A lot of kids from my class were there. Cowboy Hank was really funny. He did all his tricks - and then he left. - He left. As soon as he was gone, all my friends, my so-called friends, went home. They didn't stay for cake or anything. They didn't care about me. They just wanted to see cowboy Hank. That's it? Everybody left. That's your story? - I'm so throwing you a party. - What? It's gonna be the biggest party of the year. It's gonna be a cotillion. We're gonna dance until dawn. No, I can't. Not after what happened. That's the stupidest story I ever heard. I'm sorry but that is lame. - Everybody left? - Well it was very traumatic. It's stupid, I mean, I have worse stories than that. Everybody does. - Wait, why can't you tell Dr. Bell? - I didn't think he could handle it. I am so throwing you a party, as god is my witness and i'm going to surprise you too. You're gonna surprise me? You're not gonna surprise me. You don't think i'm smart enough? It is so on. I'm throwing you a party, boss. It could be anytime, anywhere. - So what are we looking for? - I don't know. Somebody threw the guy in a trash compactor. There had to be a reason. - How long did he live here? - 11 years. I got a mouse pad and a surge protector but no computer. And I got a toolbox that looks like some tools are missing. Somebody's been here. Somebody's been eating my porridge. Hey, thanks for coming. - Where's your boss? - He's in the hall. He won't come in. He thinks it's a surprise party. Monk, get in here. Thank you for coming. Looks like somebody's been here. They took the computer and maybe some tools. Check that closet while you're over there. - I think I'll pass. - You'll pass? Right, you think someone's in there? You think there are 50 people in that closet with balloons and party hats waiting to jump out? Excuse me, do I need to remind both of you that two nights ago the man that lives here got torn apart in a trash compactor? I bet he was surprised. I know she's been trying to throw you a party. And, - she's going to. She's gonna get you. - I'll get you. But this is a murder victim's place of residence. Do you honestly think that she would do it here? No, I don't. And that is precisely why I do. And because I do, I don't. So yes, I do. - Natalie, tell him. - There is no party. - Why is she smiling then? - Because she's a friendly person. - She winked. Come on, she's winking. - Teeger, quit winking. - She winked again! - I need you to focus. Randy, fill him in. Bradley Foster, graduated M.I.T. 1982. Worked for general electric for ten years. Then he just disappeared, fell off the radar. Apparently he started drinking, washing dishes, moving from job to job. He ended up living here pushing a broom. I knew it. I knew it. Confetti. Where are they? Okay, you can come out wherever you are. No that's not confetti that's shredded paper. It's what we See there's the shredder right there, that's material evidence. Let's put it back. Thank you. What do you got? It's been chewed. The lawyer. The heart attack? He was here. Mr. Monk, what are you doing? You don't want me to look, do you? - No, I don't. - I wonder why? Because it's putrid and disgusting. You were right. We just ran a full toxicology screening. Richard meckler was murdered. Poisoned. We found eight CC's of sodium fluoroacetate in his blood stream. Sodium Fluoroacetate. - F.L.O - Fluoroacetate. I'm gonna write up the notes later. We don't come across it very often, thank god. It's extremely toxic and fast-acting. - Yeah, we know. We were there. - Another murder. - Coincidence? - I don't believe in coincidence. Okay, let's take a step back. We got a Janitor who's killed. The only other guy in the building is a lawyer named Richard Meckler. Ten hours later, Meckler is poisoned. What do you think, Monk? I don't believe in coincidence either. And I also don't believe in surprise parties. - He has a big birthday tomorrow. - Happy birthday. Doc, you said that the, sodium flur - Fluoroacetate - It was, fast-acting. That's right. Once you ingest it, you're dead within ten seconds. That doesn't make sense. I was right there. I was talking to the guy. I didn't see anything. Neither Did i! Can I just say something? If this is my party, it's the second worse birthday party I've ever had. What's going on? The guy that died yesterday was poisoned. So we're gonna recreate the crime. Well why call me? Am I a suspect? Am important to the case in some way? Not particularly, no. So you were just looking for an excuse to see me again. Miss Jensen, if that were true, if I brought you down here in the middle of the afternoon just to talk to you and get to know you better, that would be a serious abuse of my authority. It certainly would. Do you mind? This is TK Jensen. She writes for consumer currents magazine. She was at the event last night. I thought she might be able to help. What's TK stand for? She's taking the fifth on that. Let's get started, captain. You're going to be Richard Meckler. You're standing right here. Right there Natalie, you're his wife. So you're standing right there. What about me? You're you. - But I'd rather be Meckler. - Why? - He has more to do. - Randy, you're you. All right. I am the inventor. I am Kurt Pressman. I'm sorry, I don't have a part for you. I walk across the room carrying two glasses of soda. I step up he wasn't sure which one was diet, so he took a sip. Then Meckler's wife takes a sip. She took a sip. She gave the glass to Meckler. He drank from it. Five minutes later he was dead. So how was he poisoned? That's the question. - It had to be in the drink. - No, that's That's impossible, Dr Z said the poison hits you like this. And he was sipping it for at least five minutes. Besides, his wife and pressman both drank from the same glass They didn't even get sick. So it wasn't in the drink. Was he eating something? Wait. He was chewing on his pen like a nervous habit. Nope, it wasn't the pen. That was the first thing we tested. It was clean. Well, maybe somebody injected him with something, like a needle. No, I was there, I would've seen that. A blow dart, you know, a poison dart. And the dart? It would have been sticking in his neck. Not necessarily. There could have been a elastic wire attached to the blow dart. They're called Dartarangs. How do you know they're called Dartarangs? 'Cause they're probably called it. Or at least that's what they should be called. Just nod your head and say maybe. - Maybe. - Interesting, Randy. Interesting. Is the child safety lock in the off position? Is the power switch on? Is the cyclone cover tightened securely? Cyclone cover I don't understand it. It was working perfectly. I was using it all morning. I cleaned the filter, and it just stopped. You cleaned the what? I cleaned the filter. You cleaned the air-actuated ionized electronic filter? That's right. I always clean the filter. - It says do not clean the filter. - Where? Here, here, here, here, here. I saw that, but it didn't make any sense. You always clean the filter. What did I do? What did I do? I'm so sorry. So sorry It's true what they say The good die young. Not this vacuum. Take me instead. We can find somebody to fix it. Nobody can fix it. It's not even in the stores yet. Wait. Wait,. The guy the inventor. He can fix it. His address is right on the back of the booklet. - We can be there in 20 minutes. - We can't go now. - You have Dr. Bell at 2:00. - I'll call him and cancel. I don't think it's a good idea, Not today. - Why not? - Because you seem really anxious lately. You've the janitor's case. Plus the poisoned lawyer, so that's two big cases. You're under a lot of pressure. I don't believe it. - What? - I don't believe it. You are diabolical. You're planning a surprise party in Dr bell's office My therapist's office. Have you no shame? It's not in his office. It's in the office next door. I rented it out. Everybody's waiting. They're already there. Please just come with me. It'll take just an hour. Told you before, I can't do it. What, because of cowboy Hank? - Cowboy Hank. - Because of one bad party. Congratulations. You win. You're gonna spend your birthday alone. And the next birthday after that. And the one after that too. Until you finally die alone, pathetic and miserable and sad. And alone Deal. Can we fix the vacuum now? In here. I already spoke to your colleague, Lt. Disher, earlier. Actually, that's not why we're here. It broke. It just stopped working. You're not here about Richard? Could you have a look? It'll just take a minute. I don't think I can think about work. Not now, not after what happened. It's just Richard was more than my lawyer. He was one of my oldest friends. I've known him since high school. - I just can't believe he's gone. - I can appreciate that. It was a terrible thing. We're very sorry for your loss. But as long as we're here. It just stopped working? He cleaned the filter. - You're not suppose to clean it. - I know that now. We wrote it as big as we could. It was big. All right, let's take a look. Great, thank you. Thank you so much. So this is This is where you invented it? Worked on the prototype for five years. Five years? Well, you know what Thomas Edison said. Invention is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. I have a theory. I think Edison said that to explain his BO. I need a Phillips-head. You know, the perspiration I gather from the lieutenant that you don't think Richard died of natural causes. We can't talk about the case, you understand. You mentioned another case, a janitor you feel might be connected? It's possible. It's a work in progress. Mr. Monk always says it just before he figures it all out. Really? - How does she look? - Well, you were right it's the filter. I can't replace it now. It will take a couple days. Friday? Friday is Richard's funeral. What time? Noon. So you're home when - How about this, I'll call you. - That sounds great. Thank you, so much, for letting us just drop by. - Thank you. - Yes and god bless you and your work. All right, how about this. It won't be a party. I mean, not technically, it'll just be me and Julie. We'll come over tonight with a birthday cake and a couple candles? I don't want a cake. OK, fine, uh, how about a cupcake? One cupcake and one candle. Crumbs. OK, a plastic cupcake, a picture of a candle, I promise we won't have any fun at all. You know what I want? What I really want? What? Just name it. - I want you to make a left turn. - Why? Turn here. - What's going on? - We're being followed. What do I do? - That's the captain. - Are you guys OK? - We're being followed. - Is it a black SUV? Nevada plates? Stay calm. We just got word that somebody put out a $20,000 contract on your life. - Contract. - Both of us, or just him? What was that? Gun shots. Go! - Which way? - Away from the bullets. Wrong way! - How do you know? - It says wrong way. - Help us. You gotta help us. - They're after us. Oh, my god. This way! Come on. - The dumpster. - I can't. The port-a-john. Have we met? Mr. Monk, you have to choose. I choose death. - Hey, they're down here. - Go! - Why did you close it? - Because we're hiding. I changed my mind. I'll take the port-a-john. What do we do with them? Let's dump them in the river. They're talking about us. Come on out, both of you. Let's see your hands. Hands up. - Got any last words? - Yes, I do. There's something I wanna say. - Happy birthday, Mr. Monk. - Surprise! Gotcha! Thank you. You should have seen your face. I should've seen my face. - You're not mad are you? - No, I'm OK.

He took the idea to Richard Meckler, which made sense. Meckler was a patent lawyer in that same building. Self-cleaning vacuum. Fourth greatest invention since the dawn of man. Meckler knew it would be worth a fortune. You and Meckler were old pals. You were in it together. He killed Foster in the trash compactor, and you were the beard. You were the phony inventor. Meckler was greedy, but you were greedier. You decided you didn't need a partner so you killed him You poisoned him at that reception. I poisoned Richard Meckler? How? You were there. So were you. You brought him his drink. It must have been in the drink. I drank from it, remember? From the same glass. The ice cubes. The ice cubes. Mine are square. These are round. So are yours.

No, i couldn't afford to park my car there. - Not on my salary. - Yes. I'm sorry, i forgot. You work for Ebenezer Monk. That's right That's good. Trouble ahead. Anyway, he fell down the staircase On the golf course. It was their fault. Some of the stones were loose. - So we're gonna sue them. - Good for you. Actually, i'm gonna meet my lawyer in 20 min. - Good. - Why don't you guys come with me. 'cause it won't take long, then we could go out for lunch afterwards. We could, you know, catch up and have some fun. I would love that. That sounds great, sure. Natalie, i have a question. Does he still eat the same thing every day for lunch? - Well, wait, what is it? - Turkey club, lightly toasted, Hold the lettuce, hold the bacon Hold the mayo. Five slices of turkey cut four ways on a square plate. Half the time he sticks me with the check. Oh, my god, he still does that? I swear, i don't know how i survived on $950 a week. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. I'm almost finished. Ou paid her $20 a week more than me? I have a kid! - Her kid ate more. - That's not fair, and you know it. Okay, fine, i'll pay you the same. On one condition. When we go to lunch, don't talk to her. I mean, you can talk to her, but not about me. Don't compare notes. And sit at separate tables. And if she offers to pick up the check, For god's sake, don't argue with her. Ms. Fleming, we represent the Eastdale country club.

It was an accident, okay? Say it was an accident. No, i want you to say it was an accident! I know that look. I remember that look. I hate that look. Mr. Monk, i think they're over there. They call him Mr. Monk? I know. It's weird. I can't call him by his first name. It's just not me. Do you mind if she calls you Adrian? Of course not. Why would i mind? - Yeah, see, i don't like it. - Me either. Are you serious? Good. That's it. All right. Plant the left foot, honey. Focus on the ball. Well, you looked great. That's the important thing. Mr. Walsh. Is this a bad time? Sir? I can't think of a much worse time. I'm sorry to To bother you. I'm Adrian Monk. I know that name. Yeah, you're in the news. The detective. That's right. And this is my assistant Natalie Teeger And Sharona Fleming, my other assistant. My ex-assistant. - My other, former - Hi. - My other ex - i'm a really big fan. I saw you four years ago at brook haven. - That was heartbreaking. - That was a rough beat. And i left the circuit shortly after. Took the job here, married this beautiful woman - the best decision of my life. - I'm Carolyn. And this is my long-suffering caddy Gary Hanks. - Hi. - Hello. So you Said Fleming. Is this about Howard Fleming? Yeah. He was my uncle. I'm sorry. How are you doing? She's fine. I read the police report. I understand That you actually saw the accident? Yes, sir. We both did. I'll never forget it. It was on the It's all in the report. It was early. What, about 7:30 or so? I had about a 7-iron into the green. Pulled a really bad left and long. It was the worst shot i've ever seen him make. So we were behind the green in the shrubs Looking for the ball, and we heard this yelling. And it was Howard. I know him slightly. I'd seen him around the club. Gary had a cell phone, So i told him to call 911. The battery was dead. Piece-of-crap phone. Thanks for nothing, Fujikawa cellular. Gary went for help. I stayed with Howard. I tried CPR. Tried everything. By the time the paramedics had gotten there, he was gone. I'm sorry. Adrian, you're going the wrong way. The car's over there. It'll just take a minute. I want to see the crime scene. It's not a crime scene. Don't call it a crime scene. What's wrong? I don't understand. They both saw the accident. - It sounded legit to me. - Yeah, me too. Can't we just say it's an accident And get on with our lives? Get on with our lives. He was your uncle. I Barely knew him. I met him twice. - Oh, my god. It's my cuff. - Stop whining. It's only water. Just shake it off. Shake it off. Here. Don't tell her i did this. Would you lie down on the ground right here Where they found your uncle? - Natalie, would you? - No. So what do you think? I think i made a mistake. I mean, look, the third step Is very loose. He obviously slipped and hit his head. So it was an accident! Thank you, god. Benji is going to college, And i got to tell him this. That's great. - Natalie? - Can i see that? - Sure. - He didn't fall. - What? Look at this. Look. All the golf clubs are still covered. There's no golf club on the ground Anywhere near the body. I don't think he was golfing at all. And look at this he teed off at 7:10. He died at 7:30. How did he get to the 14th green in 20 minutes? - Doesn't make any sense. - Are you sure? You have to tell her. I know. - Are you gonna tell her? - No. 'scuse me I'd like to lodge a complaint against one of your officers. What did he do? He hasn't written or called me in five years. Sharona Fleming. Get in here! - You look fantastic. - Thank you. We've got regulations against public displays of affection, Which i'm officially waiving. - It's so good to see you. - It's good to see you. Hey, i heard you got a new girlfriend. Congratulations. - Oh, my god! You won the lottery! - I feel like i did. Is she here? There she is. She is here. You look great. Thank you, Randy. It's really good to see you, Randy. And - and what? I don't know, just waiting for the punch line. You always used to set me up and hit me with a zinger. - What, i did that? - Only all the time. - Oh, my god, was i awful? - No, you were Truth is, i missed it. Excuse me for repeating myself, But you look great! Did you pull that rap sheet? - No, i didn't get a chance. - Isn't it right there in your hand? Yeah. There it is. What's this? Yeah. Howard Fleming. He's clean, no priors, no convictions. This is about your uncle. Yeah, Monk told me about that. That's tough. I'm sorry. What's this, two lawsuits. He slipped and sprained his neck. hit by a car. A Mercedes. Settled out of court. He was just unlucky. A little too unlucky. What is that supposed to mean? She didn't mean anything. Nobody means anything. Nobody means anything? What does that mean? Doesn't mean anything. All i'm saying Is your uncle Howie seemed to fall down a lot. Yeah. Into some pretty deep pockets. Adrian, you were there. You saw the steps. You said it was an accident. It's an accident! Definitely. Absolutely. - No question about that. - Okay. But Just to be sure, maybe we Maybe we should swing by his apartment. And take a look around. Just to be What? Sure. - Can't hurt. - Yeah. Can i talk to you for a second? So You're gonna go to the uncle's apartment And check things out. And you're gonna take Natalie and Sharona. Can i give you a bit of advice man-to-man? - Big mistake. - I know. You have You're Barely you're You're very You're a fragile person. - Thank you. - These women are gonna drive you crazy. - You're gonna have a breakdown. - I know! I love Natalie, and i love Sharona too. They're both wonderful women. You got lucky twice. But to gether they're like bourbon and vodka. I love them both, But i can't have them at the same meal, Because they don't mix. These women are so different, Monk. They're gonna tear you apart like a piece of saltwater taffy. I know, i've been a piece of taffy all day. Natalie's been acting like mary, queen of scots. She wants more money. I mean, she won't lay down in the dirt when i ask her. - I'm losing her. - And it's only gonna get worse. What'll i do? What You're gonna have to leave one of them here. I can't. I can't choose. Well be careful. Can i call you if it gets weird? - Uncle Howie liked the ladies. - How do you know? Just trust me. He liked the ladies. This is me. This is my first communion. I wonder why he kept it. You're family. I only met him twice. Look at this. What? What is it? I think your uncle was broke. No, no, no, let me see. He was my uncle. - He was my uncle. - Okay, okay. I'll just hold them all up and you can both see. I hate this case. It's not a case. It was an accident. I hate this accident. Cushions. What are those doing in here? My god, he was practicing. Practicing what? Falling. Sharona, i'm sorry, But your uncle Howie was a con man. That's what he was doing on the golf course. He was staging an accident, So he could sue the country club. Right, so he was pretending to fall, And then he really fell. It happens. I guess con men can trip, too. I don't believe it. - You not perfect. You could be wrong. - Maybe, but i'm not. This doesn't mean anything, cushions on a floor? You know what I say? I say that we keep looking. We go back and we talk to the golf pro again. - He was a witness. - No, that won't do any good. Wait a second, wait a second, wait a second. Is this just about the money? Yeah, of course, this is about the money. Natalie, if this was a con game, if he fell on purpose, I won't see a nickel. But it's not like you lost money. You're back where you started. Which is broke! Which is trying to put my kid through college! Not everyone has zillionaire parents. I've never taken a dime from my parents. Well, then give them my number. I hate this case. I have all the affidavits. I'm leaving right now. I'll meet you downstairs. What are you doing here? Are you busy? I'm due in court like ten minutes ago. I just need to talk to someone, and I just rember how good I used to feel after I talked to you, Really? Walk me downstairs. What's going on? Adrian thinks my uncle's some kind of scam artist. We went to his apartment, there were pillows on the floor, and Adrian thinks he was practicing how to fall. - Well, that makes sense. - It does? Doesn't it? That doesn't mean he's a con artist. I mean, lost of pe Lots of people practice how to fall. Why? - In case they fall. It's common sense. - But, Sharona, you got To admit if Monk thinks your uncle running some kind of a scam he's probably running some kind of scam. Adrian is not He's not infallible. He's been wrong before. Remember the ski instructor? Adrian said he was the guy, and it ended up being his twin brother. - Do you remember that one? - No, he was the guy, remember? There was no brother. He was pretending to be his own twin. I still don't believe it. You're talking about track record, why would this be the one case he screws up? 'Cause he's not thinking straight. Natalie's turned him against me. - Why would she do that? - 'Cause she's jealous. - Adrian likes me better. - Did he say that? No, but I can tell. A woman can tell who likes who. - She can? - Absolutely. Perry Walsh, 904. Where you going? - Ninth floor. - The elevator's over here. He always takes the stairs. I know he always takes the stairs, I always made him take the elevator. Thanks, I appreciate it, but I don't want to make him uncomfortable. But he has to be uncomfortable, otherwise he'll never learn. I'm not his psychiatrist, I'm his assistant. Then why don't you try assisting him, instead of pandering to him? How about this? It's the ninth floor. Let's take the elevator up to four, and then walk up five flights. Yeah, that sounds fair. Or we take the elevator up to level five and walk up four flights. Can't argue with that. - You treat him like a child. - He's not a child. I did not say he was a child. I said you're treating like him. - I'm being supportive. - You're don't. - You're enabling him. - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna get on the elevator and take it up to 18 and walk down 9 flights. That way everybody's miserable. Mrs. Walsh, sorry to bother you. Is this a bad time? No, it's fine. I was just working out. We're here to see your husband. Come on in. He's in the kitchen. I'll go get him. - Thanks. - Are you okay? It was a long walk. Is the elevator broken? I still don't know what we're doing here. We already talked to this guy. We should talk to him again. - He witnessed the accident. - It wasn't an accident. - It was an accident. - Here we go. You remember Sharona and Natalie. I mean, Natalie and Sharona. Hi. Nice surprise. - Can I get you something to drink? - Thank you. We're fine. We have a few more questions about the incident. We think that Mr. Fleming might have fallen on purpose. - Really? - It's just a theory. On that morning, Did you actually see mr. Fleming play any golf? Well, now that you mention it, no, I don't believe I did. But he fell, right? I mean, he really fell. He didn't pretend. Well, I was 50 yards away. It looked real to me. I don't know if he's that good of an actor. On second thought, I'd love some water. Sure. I'll be right back. - Doesn't mean anything. - Don't say that. Be cool! - Just be cool. - Doesn't mean anything. Look at this. His wife is reading these books: the passions of erica, it's a series. See? Volume 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Where is volume four? I'll tell you where it is. It's in your uncle's apartment. I saw it lying open by the couch. She left it there. - They're having an affair. - What? Uncle howie? - Do you think that he knows? - He not only knows. He did something about it. He killed your uncle. Oh! Come on! Think about it. Howard was sleeping with Carolyn Walsh. What are the odds of her husband witnessing his fatal accident? It's off the charts. - It's virtually impossible. - But they weren't alone. - The caddy was there. - He saw the whole thing. That's the beauty of it. It was a perfect plan. I don't understand. I'll tell you later. You have to tell me now. Say ""here's what happened."" Well, he's right there. Just tell me. - Say ""here's what happened."" - Here's what happened. Walsh knew his wife was cheating. He found a letter or overheard a phone call. Somehow, he knew, but he didn't say anything. He kept it a secret. He began planning his revenge. We've got orange juice if you'd like. - Juice is good. - Fresh squeezed would be good. - Keep going. - No! He's right there! Okay, get over here. - Just get in! - I'm not getting in there! Keep going. We're in a closet! I can't do this in a closet. Yes, you can! Ttell me what happened. Quickly. Come on. Can we go now? What? - Neither do I. - Just do it again. Slow down. God. It was Walsh's idea. He came to your uncle. He said he had a plan to rip off the country club. Howard would pretend to fall down the stairs. Walsh would be the unimpeachable witness. They'd sue the club and make a fortune. Walsh must have known howard was broke. He knew he'd take the bait. Okay. Where was I? He took the bait. That morning, your uncle was on the green. He was in position. Meanwhile, Walsh made sure he and the caddy were close enough to see it. Your uncle thought it was just another scam, but Walsh had other ideas. Can we at least open the door just a crack? Keep going. The caddy ran off to get help. That left Walsh alone with your uncle. It was a perfect plan, two witnesses. Walsh himself and his caddy had seen your uncle fall down those stairs. Nobody would ever suspect it was murder, the end. Can we open the door? We were just taking a little tour. Is this oak? Mr. Monk, he knows. That we know. I think we're done here. Are you okay? I'm waiting for the screaming to stop. - There's no screaming. - The screaming inside my head. You were in a closet in his house. He was standing right there. He obviously heard everything. Why didn't you just leave the apartment? I tried! I told them to be cool. I actually said, ""be cool."" Just step outside the house. - Talk in the elevator! - He doesn't take the elevator. We don't have a case because you tipped him off. I just got off the phone with him. It's a brick wall. They're all lawyered up. And his wife? She's not talking either. That's'cause he probably threatened her. If this is a homicide, and I believe you're right, because you always are, we're up against it. We've got nothing! We have no physical evidence! Why you looking at me? It wasn't my fault. - What does that mean? - Nothing. Are you blaming me now? Wait a minute. It's not her fault. Her uncle died. She's got the right to ask questions. You weren't there. - Neither were you. - I wasn't there! Monk, what do you think? Where we going? I have $52. How far will that take me? I don't know, let's find out. If we hear anything, we'll let you know. Is that the captain? What did he say? No news. Well, he can't go too far. He can't sleep without his trudy pillow. Or that special red toothbrush. Or his little flossing kit. Or the sound machine with that fog horn noises. Actually, that one broke. And they discontinued the model. Really? What did you do? I went out and bought an actual fog horn and made my own tape. No kidding. I have an actual fog horn sitting in my garage. I do not know how you put up with him. I don't know how I put up with him. Actually, I do. I loved him. I swear, this was the best job I ever had. Every day was an adventure. Funny thing is Adventures are never fun when you're having'em, you know? Sharona, I'm sorry. I'm the one who should be sorry. I was totally out of line. You're doing a good job with him. Natalie, you're really patient with him. - It's more than I ever was. - No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. You're a saint. The reason why I can be nice to him and I can be patient with him is because you did the hard part. You were here right after Trudy when he couldn't even get out of bed. I think I might've been too tough on him. You need to be tough. He was in a bad place. You got him here. You got him to me. You found me. Have you been here all day? I've been here for 12 years. You can come home now. We're fine. I know you saw us fighting, I know you got scared, and we're sorry about it. We talked about it, and we decided we really have to nail this guy Walsh. Absolutely. I don't care about the lawsuit. I don't care about that money. You were right. Howie Fleming was my uncle. He wasn't perfect, but he was family, and we can't let Walsh get away with it. So we want to go back to the country club. Maybe we overlooked a clue or something. What kind of clue? We don't know. That's where you come in. Come on. Let's go home. We'll make you dinner. Is tuesday still chicken pot pie? Why, what have you heard? Of course it is. I don't even know why I asked. Even a cancelled card can come in handy sometimes. - Where do we start? - I tell you where we start. Right here. - This one's locked. - Wait, hold on. - Where'd you learn that? - Self-taught. Fujikawa. The battery was dead. Piece of crap phone. Thanks for nothing, fujikawa cellular. It's from the caddy's cell phone. Walsh must've switched batteries. That morning, Walsh put a new battery in the caddy's phone. One that wasn't charged yet. He had to be sure the caddy couldn't call for help. Is that proof? He could explain this. But maybe - What? - The caddy's cell phone. If the new battery is still inside it, it would have Walsh's fingerprints all over it. - He'd have a hard time explaining that. - My god, we have to find that caddy. Hey, Mr. Walsh, how you doing? Forget the caddy. We gotta stop him! Move to three under and Nice putt! Excellent. Let's go to 14. It's all over Walsh. Mr. Monk, are you okay? Let him go. Just let him go. He wins. It's over, it's over. Your cell phone! I need your phone! Faster! We got him. We did it. I was back there I was making sure he didn't double back. What do you say? Are we gonna talk to this caddy?

You're not listening to me. - I hope you do. - Am I not being clear? - I appreciate it. - Yeah, well, I hope that you do. - I appreciate it. - Hey, thank you for coming. - What's going on? - Missing person. - I hope that's what it is. - Her name's Amanda Castle. She's an artist. Apparently, she's a pretty big deal, very famous. - Never heard of her. - Me, neither. Somebody's heard of her, because the press has taken an interest, which means the mayor has taken an interest, which means I'm here, which means you're here, and you. How was the picnic? - Horrible. - It was great. Adrian Monk, Natalie Teeger, this is Samantha Austin. She's Amanda's agent. How long has she been missing? Since last weekend. Since sunday morning. I was supposed to meet her at my gallery. She has a show next month. I was just telling the captain something's wrong. I can feel it. I've known Amanda for years, and she never would have gone anywhere without her medication or without Shelby. - And Shelby is her daughter? - No. Shelby is her son? Here she is. Come here, girl. There's a good girl. It's a dog. Shelby is a dog! Well, she's the only family Amanda has. Family. Did Amanda wear glasses? Somebody wore glasses. Was she dating? Was there anyone in particular? She didn't say. She never did. She's a pretty private person. Are those glasses? Looks like it. Did somebody pose for this? I don't know. I think it's new. Could be a lover. - How do you figure? - Well, he's naked, and Lower right corner? I thought that was the signature. We need to find him. Not a problem. We'll just make a copy of this and put out an A.P.B. I don't think that's gonna work. You can't even see his face. I was joking, Randy. Course you have to say that now. That dog lick hand! Dog lick hand! Dog lick hand! Boil some water! Dog lick hand. We don't have boil water. Calm down. - Dog lick hand. - Yes, I know dog lick hand. Dog likes you. Dog's been following you around. Well, tell her not to like me! Don't like me, you understand? Go away. You're a bad dog. Go away. Somebody call animal control? Yes, over here. This is just temporary until Amanda gets back. I can't keep her. I have a cat. Come here, girl. - You should adopt the dog. - Excuse me? Just for a day or two until the owner gets back. I'm worried about you you're getting lonely. - Not that lonely, not dog lonely. - I think you are dog lonely. - Dogs are family. - No, no, dogs are animals, and they're filthy, they're naked, and they eat, and then they un-eat, and then that is probably the worst idea you've ever had. - Why don't you take her? - I would, but Julie's allergic. - It's just for a day or two. - I gotta take the dog. Let's go. Come on. I don't want any problems. I got two more pickups today. Get in the crate. There you go. Come on, get in there. - Get in the crate. - Do you No, never.

Hello, Shelby? What the What is that? Where are you? What are you doing? What? What are you doing? Oh, my God! God! Stay away. Stay away! Stay! Thank you all once again for coming. You know the situation. We're looking for a woman. Her name is Amanda Castle. Although any dead body would be of interest to us. Thank you, Randy. She lives in that yellow house there. That's where she was last seen, so we're going to start here. Has everyone signed in? No? Come on. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. You taking good care of Mr. Monk? Yeah. You want the gloves? No, I don't want the gloves. I'm so glad you brought her. Well, I didn't have a choice. I couldn't leave her alone In my house on my floor. She won't stay in the umbrella. This dog is not, and may never be, umbrella-trained. He's a funny man, isn't he? She's so clean. She should be. I washed her for hours last night. Yeah, don't! Don't pet the tail. She doesn't like that. You like her. Admit it. You like having someone in the house. There are moments that aren't entirely unbearable. Sounds like true love. Where you going there? Hey, where you going? Sorry about that. It's okay. She probably just smells my dog. Hello, sweetheart. - What is she, a terrier? - We don't know. Yeah, she's just staying with my boss for a while. What are they feeding you, sweetheart? Somebody needs to go on a diet. Okay, let's get started! Gonna line up over here, arm's length apart. Gotta go. Nice meeting you. It's okay. Don't listen to him. You're not fat. So keep your eyes down. We're looking for anything unusual, any freshly dug dirt, signs of a struggle, articles of clothing. Over here! It's hers. This is a note. ""Saturday morning Meet Dylan."" That's the ex-husband. I mean, could we get that lucky? Nobody's that lucky. Here, hold Shelby. Don't yank on it. She hates that. You're yanking it. - I'm not yanking it. - What have you got? It's Amanda Castle's. Who found it? Guy in the gray shirt with the glasses. Glasses? I want to try something. Excuse me, hello! Could I have your attention? We think that one of you killed Amanda Castle. If you're guilty, would you please raise your hand? Well, we were just wondering. Sorry to bother you. Have a nice day. What was that about? - Who is the guy with the glasses? - No idea. Well, we need to find out. I think Amanda is dead, and I think he killed her. Look. Look at the buckle and the snap. There's no rust. It couldn't have been laying out in an open field all week. He planted it. He's trying to frame the ex-husband. What was all that about raising your hand? He didn't confess. No, but he didn't look around, either. Everybody else did. Tell me when it's 2:30. What time is it? It's 1:15. - What happens at 2:30? - I promised somebody i'd be home. It's Shelby. A man and his dog. - You love her. I can tell. - I don't love her. I don't hate her. She's fine. I don't mind her for a couple of days, maybe a week, whatever. How's she doing? She's really smart. This dog is really, really smart. - I've been teaching her tricks. - Like? Like not to lick me, not to drool, not to roll over, not to, you know, discharge anything. Since you mention it, I was gonna give it to you later, but It's a sha-poopie. Yeah, I don't need that, because I've taught her to hold it in. Until when? I haven't decided. She might decide for you. You should take this. - Yeah, okay. - This could be it. He gave a phony name when he signed in yesterday, but we ran his plates. Say hello to Steven Dewitt. He's an industrial engineer. He owns, or, rather, his wife owns a $2 million brownstone on rockaway drive. - They know Amanda? - Very possible, yeah. She's an artist, he's a big patron. Apparently, he hangs out at the galleries. - What about the phone records? - No, nothing yet. Be nice if we had a body. She could be anywhere. No, not quite anywhere. All right, this is her house, and we know it's not there. This is the park we checked yesterday. It's not there. That's my house. We can eliminate that. And this office. That's true. It's not here. Captain? Is there anything you want to eliminate? Amanda Castle called The call lasted eight seconds. She didn't say anything and hung up. Where did she call from? From the general vicinity of Steven Dewitt's town house. The general vicinity? Yeah, well, within ten city blocks. That's the best they can do. It's not enough to prove they knew each other. It's 1:22. We really should get back. - You said 2:30. - Yeah, but and I hate to keep her waiting. Want to stop and pick up some dessert on the way to surprise her. She loves surprises. Face lights up. See you later. Does he have a girlfriend? He kinda does. Okay, no licking. No licking, no licking. Okay, look, I will take you out. Just let me put these on first. Yeah? Yeah, you see what I got you? Do you see what I got you? Don't tell anybody, but I missed you, too. Yeah, ice cream. I didn't know which flavor you liked so, I got you all five. Come on. Here we go. Get ready. You're ready. Here we go, girl. Go get the ball! Get it. Go on, girl. Go get it. Get no? Fetch the Yeah, you're right. That's no fun at all, is it? OK, here. Is that better? Get it. Get it. Good girl. Bring it. Bring it. Yeah, that's much better, isn't it? Because you gotta feel the ball. You gotta feel the ball. I know. I know. Stay with me now. Stay on the path. I'm proud of you boys. You're doing great. Look at that view. Breathtaking. Looks like we're heading east. You can tell by the moss. The moss grows on the north side of the tree. Do you know why? Because there's more shade on it. What are you doing? What is that, a rug? Don't touch it. Just leave it alone. You don't know where it's been. Seriously, hands off the rug! My hands are off the rug, see? Just leave it alone. Good. That's it. You're a good girl. Yes, you are. Just a second. Hello. When? I understand. Thank you for calling. OK, listen you better sit down. You remember Amanda, the nice lady who took care of you? No, please, sit. I'm afraid I have some bad news. Well, she had an accident. She won't be coming back. Don't don't don't cry. Don't cry. Oh, she's happy. She's on a farm with all her friends. She loves it there. She's chasing rabbits all day, and you're not buying that. I know how you feel. Believe me, I know exactly how you feel. Never alone, little one. Never alone. I've already talked to the police. I mean, the real police. They were here for three hours. I didn't know the girl, I never met the girl. You were at her house. You were looking for her. I saw she was missing. It was on the news. They said they need volunteers. I was just doing my civic duty. - Next time, I won't bother. - You gave the police a false name. I have four or five unpaid parking tickets. You want to arrest me for that, go ahead. Something spill? - Excuse me? - This part of the floor, it almost looks like it was bleached. Excuse me, I'm not comfortable with you just wandering around. I'm sure you're not. I didn't kill anyone, mr. Monk, you can't prove that I did. Can you? I can't. I like your paintings. Do you go to a lot of galleries? I think we're done here. No, I'm sorry, I misspoke. I know we're done here. Very nice meeting you both. One more question. Just curious, about the rug. - Which rug? - This rug. - It looks brand new. - It is new. Steve bought it last week while I was in London. I couldn't have been more surprised. Is this about that missing girl? The poor thing. I told you not to volunteer. He thinks he can save the world single-handedly. I don't think we've met. I'm Gwen. What a cute dog. - Where's your tail? - He's an Australian shepherd. They're born tailless. They're bred that way. That makes you special, doesn't it? - Can I get you folks a drink? - Actually, they were just leaving. I didn't even get your names. There's no need to. They won't be back. I'm home! There you are. - So how was she? - She was great. I see you. There you are. She's so cute. I love you, too. I love you, too. Thank you for watching her. I wish I had a dog. She didn't eat? She wasn't hungry. Well, maybe, were you waiting for me? - She was probably waiting for me. - I think she was. Your aunt Natalie's out front, so she'll give you a ride home. You said $5.00. Right. You have change for a hundred? Really? Then you won't need my five. Attitude. Where's my girl? This way. That a girl. Easy, easy. What do you got there? Just a bug. It's just a bug. Come on, this way. Come on. Good girl. Come on. No, this way. What are you doing? You don't know her. This way. Come on. Come on. This way. Somebody tried to kill shelby? Maybe he was drunk. You know, he was just turning around. It was deliberate. He tried to run her down. He wasn't interested in me. He was definitely after Shelby. Maybe he doesn't like dogs. How could anyone not like it? What reason would anybody possibly have? I don't know. I don't know, but it's got to be connected to Amanda castle. She disappeared a week and a half ago. Now, tonight, somebody tries to kill her dog. It can't be a coincidence. Was it the guy, Steven Dewitt? - I couldn't tell. - What kind of was it? I don't know. I was I'm so worried about Shelby. She's been acting strangely. Look at her. She hasn't eaten. Maybe she witnessed the murder. She saw Dewitt kill Amanda and now he's afraid that she'll identify him. - How? - She could bark at him. Randy, as far as I know, in California, dogs are not allowed to testify in open court. Maybe Dewitt's afraid they'll change the rule. What, change the rule against dogs testifying in court? You know, one of those referendums. It is California. You want to know how tired I am? I'm so tired, I don't know if that even makes any sense. Come on, I'll give you a ride home, you and your girlfriend, we'll sleep on it, maybe it'll make more sense. All right, let's go. Ah, good girl. Good girl. Cute dog. Veterinarian hot-line. What's your emergency? I have a dog well, she's not really mine. Sort of adopted her, but it's complicated. You see, I'm a former police officer. Sir, is the animal sick? Yes. Yes, I think so. She isn't eating, and she, uh she seems to be shivering. Is she panting heavily and heaving? Yes. Yes. Has she been putting on weight? Well, yes. Yes, she has. Well, it sounds like she's whelping. - I don't understand. - Well, I think she's in labor. I don't understand. She's in labor. She's having a litter, little puppies? Baby puppies. You mean now? It sounds like it. Sir? Are you still there? Congratulations. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. You're doing great. Please bring me a towel. Keep breathing. I know it hurts. I've been there, too. - Where'd you get the mask? - Left top drawer. It's a natural thing, mr. Monk. Your mother did it, twice. You're not helping at all. She didn't do it in somebody's living room! She didn't go surprising people. Why why didn't you tell me she was pregnant? I didn't know. Nobody knew. Come on, you're a woman. How could you not know? It's a disaster. Little animals coming out of other animals. What was god thinking? It's the miracle of life. It's a beautiful thing. OK, that's not such a beautiful thing. - I mean, in general. - This is what i get. Trying to be nice, and they open my - your heart? - My house! - They open my house! - You opened your heart, mr. Monk. Don't close it now. Here it comes, ready or not. Not yet! I'm not ready yet, please. Just tell her to wait. Wait! Wait, tell her, no. Shelby, no! Bad dog! You're doing good, sweetie. Keep breathing. - Here it comes. - What is that? That can't be right. That is that cannot be right. That can't be right. That is not right. There's no way that congratulations, grandpa. I know. It's a boy. What are you gonna name him? Exhibit ""A."" Good girl. Exhibit ""A""? Check out the tail. - What tail? - Exactly. - His father's an Australian shepherd. - A tailless Australian shepherd. Steven dewitt. His wife mentioned she'd been traveling recently, and how long was she gone? - About three months. - That fits. While his wife was out of town, he was having an affair with Amanda. They were ""hooking up,"" you understand? And while they were hooking up, their dogs were ""hooking up."" Everybody and everything, ""hooking up."" Do you rember two days ago? Dewitt showed up to help look for the body. He was petting shelby. He was patting her belly. He noticed she was pregnant. Dewitt had a problem. He knew as soon as we saw these tailless puppies, we'd run a DNA test. We'd have proof, living proof their dogs had met, which would prove he knew Amanda. That's why he tried to run her over tonight. Well, looks like we've got our smoking gun. You're just about the cutest little smoking gun in history. The jury's gonna eat you up. Wait a minute. I think we have more evidence. Excuse me. Good girl, Shelby. OK, here comes exhibit ""A,"" ""B,"" ""C,"" Exhibit ""D."" Another one? What's the record? I think it's 101. - That was the movie. - Right. That woman again, who was that, coupe de ville? Cruella. Cruella, she was bad news. Monk, this is good scotch. Where'd you get it? It was a christmas gift from the mayor. Well, thank the mayor for me. I think she's done. And so am I. Randy, you better drive. What about Dewitt? We'll pick him up. Call Kramer and have somebody go to his house, and put an a. P.B. On his vehicle. - What do I do? - You get some sleep. We'll be back to pick you and the dogs up in the morning. The puppies, what do I do? Mr. Monk, you don't have to do anything. She knows what she's doing. Bye, Shelby. Good job. You've a lot of explaining to do, young lady. You're too late. She's already had the litter. What are you gonna do? Kill them all? I suppose i am. But I'm a witness, so you'll have to kill me, too. No, don't move. You just stay where you are. I don't think you're a killer. I think you loved amanda. - It was an accident. - I believe you. - She fell and hit her head. - That's not murder. It's manslaughter, maybe obstruction. That's bad but. it could be a lot worse. Don't make it worse. Don't make it worse. - It was an accident. - I know. I know it was. They're beautiful. I know. I'll take that one. What's his name? Exhibit ""B,"" - but you can call him as you want. - All right. - Say thank you. - Thank you. We'll take good care of him, we promise. Wait. Wait. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't split them up. They have to stay together. I know it hurts, and I know you're thinking about your own family. With dogs, it's different. It's not different. They're a family, they have to be together. Here's the thing. There are five dogs here. You can't keep them all. You're you know. - You're you. - I know, I know, I'm me. How about this? - We'll take all of them. - Really? The whole family including the mom. We have three acres, it's all fenced in. They'll love it. Great, I'll get her things. Anne Marie, you want to help? You can visit her anytime. - How about 2:00? - OK, 2:00. - You mean, tomorrow? - Every day. Every day? I'll go get her leash. It's OK. I know them. They're a good family. You'll be happy there. Never alone, little one. Never alone again. Team Subs-Addicts"""
"-= 812 =- ""Mr.Monk Goes Camping"" VO By : ¤Aka¤  &  do_Ob Team Subs-Addicts"" Sorry we're late. Have you been waiting long? - Are you all right? - Yes, sir. I'm just smiling. I just want to say that we really appreciate the work you've done. Unofficially as a consultant over the last eight years. We've been reading your case file and talking with your colleagues. It's a very impressive record. I worked on the raincoat strangler case. We worked that case for nine months without a lead. - I still don't know how you did it. - I got lucky. Actually, it was more than just luck. I talked to the suspect, and I noticed there were a few discrepancies in his alibi. It was quite impressive. It was dazzling, actually. Impressive, dazzling, i'll take either one. I see you're still working with neven Bell. I've known neven for years. He's a good man. And a good psy doctor. We made some real progress. So I see. Tell him I said hello. Can I use your phone? You don't have to say hello now. The next time you see him. Got ya. It's fun to laugh. Mr. Monk, I also appreciate the work you've been doing for the city as well as the progress you've made. I have to say i'm very encouraged. - However - How however. Handing you a gun and a badge is a big responsibility. It's probably the most important decision this panel will ever make, and it wouldn't be fair to you or the city to put you on the street prematurely. And, speaking personally, i'm just not sure. I'm not convinced you have the judgment, i'm not convinced you have the temperament. Thank you for coming in. We'll have an answer by next week. I mean, it was going so well. The first two loved me. I could tell we were all laughing, for some reason. But the third guy, this captain Willis, Frank Willis, he just hated me. Well, two out of three At least you're getting closer. Mr. Monk, I just don't think you have the judgment or the temperament. - That's how he talks? - Yes, exactly. Well, it's just a preliminary hearing, right? They'll make the final recommendation next week. Maybe he'll change his mind. You know that Hank Henderson shot his partner? He shot his own partner, and he was reinstated a month later. Hank Henderson plays the game, Mr. Monk. He plays golf with the police commissioner's brother. You got to get out there, network, kiss some butts. - Sounds so unsanitary. - You know what I mean. Schmooze. You have a week to change his mind. Hey, there you are. How'd it go? Good. It's two to one in our favor. Well, that's not bad. - You're getting closer. - Yeah, to retirement age. At the moment we have bigger problems. Driver's in the hospital, the guard is dead. Went down around 10:30. Very professional, very well-planned Until it wasn't. Bad guys parked here. The armored car was about an hour behind schedule, so they must've waited here for some time. Two guys, they got out, ski masks, both with rifles, bang the driver, bang bang the guard, then make off with 900 grand. - So what do you think? - I can't believe Anderson got reinstated. - He shot his own partner. - Any fingerprints? No, nothing. The cab was clean, the doors. They were probably wearing gloves. Open the meter. Pardon me? Well, you said the armored car was running late, if they didn't want draw attention to themselves they were probably feeding the meter. Fingerprints on the coin. Hey, get the tech guys over here. Have 'em open this meter and dust every coin they find. - Thank you. - I'm not a schmoozer. That's the problem. I don't play golf. How do people schmooze, anyway? - Is it ""schmooze"" or ""smooze""? - Sorry I'm late. Don't tell me. - All right, tell me. - It's an outreach program. The a department's sponsoring it. It's called ""buddies in blue."" You know, kids in the city sending time with cops. I'm taking four kids camping this weekend. It's gonna be so much fun. Everybody's gonna get a badge. Almost everybody. Hey, do you want to come? I could use the help. Do you have plans? You're not feeling well? I hope you feel better. - When are you leaving? - Tomorrow morning. - Why are you wearing that now? - I have to get acclimated. It's like swinging two bats in the on-deck circle. Women, they just don't get it. Take it off, Randy. Yes, sir. What is that? What do you got? Peanut Shell? These Shells were twisted apart. Most people just split 'em down the middle right? - That's how I eat it. - Yeah, me too. I'm allergic so I don't eat 'em. Good work, detective. Tell that to captain Willis. Frank Willis? No. He's the one voting against Mr. Monk. Yeah, I know Frank. That's brian's dad. - Who's Brian? - Brian, he's one of my buddies in blue. Going camping with him this weekend. Really? Really I'll come with you. Really? - You said you need some help. - Great. No, Mr. Monk, it's camping. - Yeah, in the woods. - Yeah, I know what camping is. I don't think you do. You said I should play the game; that's what I'm doing. No, no, I meant more like an indoor game like gin rummy I'm going camping with little Brian Willis Camping and schmoozing all weekend long. And then he's gonna come home with a lot of stories about Adrian Monk. I'm sure he will. Okay, Will Dellman. - Hey, Will. - Here. - I call shotgun. - Hang on, nobody rides shotgun. Everybody rides in the back. Cool van. I call window. What's this thingy? Can I see your gun? Hop in the back, there. All right. Good man. Hey, norman walters. Sorry, Norman, no video games.

Mom, dad, can I get a little help? That's where we are, and that's where you're going. The middle of nowhere. Not too late to back out. I am doing this. I am playing the game. - At least try to have some fun. - Natalie, it's a game. It's not supposed to be fun. So here are your wipes. Extra wipes. Thank you. Back-up extra wipes. Some extra back-up wipes. You want me to write your name in your clothes? Not necessary. A, my name's already in them, and B, these clothes aren't coming off. - Even when you sleep? - I won't be sleeping. - Where's your canteen? - I won't be drinking either. If I drink water, I make water, you understand? I don't want to start the machine, you understand? - Unfortunately yes, I do understand. - Oh, my God. There he is. Let the games begin. Lisen I got to say good-bye to Brian, your son? Should I get a name tag? Sorry, it's work. It's always work. All right. So, camping. This'll be great. I used to go camping all the time. I loved it. Great. Why don't you go? Well, I wish I could. When you come back, we'll do something together just you and me. You mean between phone calls, right? Captain Willis. Hey, I thought that was you. - Are you part of this? - Yes, sir. I'm one of the instructors. Because I love kids. I forgot to mention that yesterday, but I love kids. Because they're the future, aren't they? So I guess I'll be getting to know your son here. I mean, I'm assuming he's your son unless he's your younger brother. - His brother? - I mean, you seem so mature, and you look so young. And you're a detective? Good comeback. Good comeback. Okay, that's enough schmoozing. Let's go camping! Have fun. - Love you. - Whatever. Your father is a great man, you know, you must be very proud. - We're gonna have fun. - Hey, Brian! Here, let me get that. Okay, guys, here we go. I just had two cups of coffee, I could do this all day. So let's try again. Where is your boyfriend? Which one? The one you've been living with for three years. Luke Johnston. The one that robbed that armored car with his brother. Luke didn't rob anybody. Winona, listen to me, this this wasn't just another smash and grab. A guard got killed. And we found Luke's fingerprints near the scene. Near the scene. What does that mean? It means I want to talk to him. That's what it means. - Where are they? - No idea. Sure you do. I'm not saying another word. Luke and del are like family. That guard had a family. Winona, I want you to give luke and del a message, and don't tell me that you can't because I know that you can. I want you to tell them that Leland Stottlemeyer says hi. And I will see them soon. Hey, cool, you brought your transistor radio? - What're you listening to? - Music. - What kind of music does your dad like? - Whatever sucks. Who's your favorite band? I like the various artists. You heard of them? They do all kinds of soundtracks. Look, it's not gonna work. - What? - Kissing my butt to impress my father. Me? What are you talking about? I heard him talking about you. You're the cop that went crazy and now you want your old job back. Don't deny it. You can't make him like you. Believe me, I've tried. I'm hungry. Me too. - When's lunch? - I'm thinking we'd stop about noon. What time is it now? That's a good question. All right, this is called a sundial, guys. There's the sun, there's the dial, - it's gonna tell us the time. - Why don't you just use your watch? 'cause this is more fun. Come on, the pioneers didn't use wristwatches or Ipods. All right, let's see now. Say it's about Come on, guys, all right, fine. If you need a snack you can Hey, eat some of those berries. No, no, that's not a good idea. They're called moonseed berries. They're extremely toxic. Why don't we just agree that everything in the woods is bad for you? Let's not eat or touch or smell anything. All right, come on, guys, come on. Here we go. We're sticking to the plan. Let's, make it over that ridge, then we can eat? All right, this is fun. If you say so. Fun, fun, fun. That's what he said They found your fingerprints. Well, that's impossible, we both had gloves on. - Yeah? Then why are they talking to me? - I don't know. What else did you forget? Did you get rid of the guns? - Guns are gone. - Did you dump everything? Don't worry about it. You just better be sure, luke, is all I'm saying, because they are gonna be checking everywhere. Everywhere you've stayed, everywhere you've been. You mean the cabin? Just get back there and make sure it's clean. Baby, if you get sent up again I don't think I can stand it. It's gonna be okay, you understand me? We're gonna take care of it. When I get back, you and I have to talk. What about? About how we're gonna spend all this money. I'll see you soon. - They picked her up? - They don't know anything. - And what they know they can't prove. - Where we going? Back to spider lake. We got some cleaning up to do. Yeah, this is perfect. This is perfect. All right, guys, we're camping out right here. Let's set it up. You guys, look. Look. Bullet Shells. Looks Like someone was taking a little target practice. Probably some juvies. Juvies? No, you know, they were probably playing hooky. Do you play hooky? I know I did when I was a kid. Yeah, I was a real hood. I was a hood in the hood. Somebody kill me. You know, like neighborhood, right? We got company. - I got matches. - Not yet. No, it's not quite even. We're just going to burn it, not live in it. Yeah, you'll thank me later. Hey, Brian, would you like to help? Sure. Here. There you go. He got me again. He really got me. What a rascal. - You got me again. - Guys, look what I got. - Look, look, look, look - Yeah! Okay, good job. That's a fish. Where'd you get that pole? I made it. It's easy. I found some string and I made a hook and sinker. Excellent. Nicky, good job. - You showed a little initiative. - Thank you. Let's get a picture of that bad boy. All right. Okay. All right. Smile. Good. Let's get a close-up of the fish. All right. Hey, can I try out your gun? Will, put that down, put that down. Will, this is not a toy, okay? How many bad guys have you killed? I don't really want to talk about that, okay? - Two. - Only two? He's a cop. They called him the spider lake maniac Bicause all the killings happened right here in these woods about a year ago. Actually, it was a year ago. Tonight. There's a mental hospital about ten miles away from here. It's called the Lassen county clinic. Everybody thought it was escape-proof. Somehow he escaped. Randy, excuse me. The lassen clinic's been closed for 20 years. That's right, yeah. - Must've been another mental hospital. - Which one? I don't know, I don't remember. But the point is he escaped. Now, on the first night he killed two fishermen. Slit their throats. But he didn't need a knife. Want to know why? Because he didn't have a left hand. Instead, he had a razor-sharp hook! Actually, they don't use hooks anymore. These days they have prosthetic hands. You know, Rubber. - Just like real hands. - Well, he had a hook. Or a hand. It was probably a hand. It was a hook. - Or a hand. - The important thing is he was a maniac and the simplest thing could set him off. He was probably bipolar, which by the way, they can treat now. - There's this new drug called lexapro. - Lexapro is excellent. Well, the spider lake maniac didn't take his medicine. I'm sure he took his medicine. It was probably mandated by the court. - You're scaring the kids. - They probably started off with xanax. That's what they did with me. That reminds me I have to take my pills. What're you doing? What is that? This is my backup. Fine. So thanks to modern medicine, the spider lake maniac now lives in a public housing project with his pet cat and never bothers anyone. The end. That was pathetic. It was a great story, professor Lame-O. It's 10:00 guys, let's just bedtime, all right? Let's go, let's, pack up the camp. Let's grab food, seal it, get it off the ground. We don't want to have to feed any more animals tonight. Professor Lame-o? - What are they doing? - They're getting food off the ground. It keeps the bears away. All right, guys, let's hit the hay. I can't believe this is the same sky we have in San Francisco. I could get used to this. - How about you? - I can never get used to anything. Listen, Randy, I wanted to apologize. I get it. You're just trying to impress Brain. Schmoozing, right? - How's it going? - Terrible. You know, he's a good kid, Monk. They all are. I don't know how you do it. - What's that? - How you take it. People joke around, tease you, you never get mad or upset. Used to bother me when I was coming up in uniform. I heard people laughing, telling Randy Disher stories. It hurt, you know. I almost quit. What happened? One night I got a call. A p-300 downtown. There was a bumper sticker on one of the cars, and it said, ""happiness is a choice."" I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but it changed my life. I made a decision right there. I chose to be happy. I mean, i i really believe that. I mean, you have the power. You can choose to be happy. I guess I should read more bumper stickers. Everybody should. It's late. I'm gonna go sack out. - Good night. - See you in the morning. Wait a minute. P-300? That's a fatality. It was pretty ugly. The driver hit a tractor trailer head-on. He and his wife were both DOA. And this was the car that had the bumper sticker? - ""Happiness is a choice."" - That's right. Well, actually it was on fire when I got there, so it was hard to read. And this didn't deter you or make you think twice. I mean, it was an epiphany, Monk. You can't just choose where you get it. I mean, it could be from a guru on a mountaintop or it could be from a bumper sticker on a burning Subaru. Good night. I'll see you in the morning. Let's go. I can see it. I can hear it! - I think we lost it. - I don't think so. That was a mature Grizzly. They can run up to 30 miles an hour. I read somewhere that he's probably more scared of us than we are of him. That's not true. - That can't be true. - This is all his fault. If you see a bear you're not supposed to yell! You're supposed to talk to it calmly. Calmly, like this. Did you guys hear him? He was screaming like a little girl. I wasn't screaming, exactly. You were screaming and crying. We all saw you. You're so pathetic. I was warning you. I was you know, sounding the alarm. Like like Paul Revere. More like paul revere's scared little sister. You joker. - He didn't have a sister. - What do we do now? Let's just review the situation. We've been running for a long time. - Mostly in circles. - That's true. Wait, so you mean we're lost? With no compass? No cell phone? We need to stay hydrated. That's the most important thing. - We need water. - We passed the lake at least twice. - I say we go back to the lake. - Good idea. Let's die by the lake. How many is that? 'bout 30. We shot off two clips so there should be more out there. I say we bag it. If we can't find 'em, they won't either. Check it out. That's one of our shells. You said 5 minutes. That was 20 minutes ago. I meant eastern time. - Relax, nature boy. - Let me see, I can break it. - Hey, I got it! - Pull it in, pull it in! What do you got? Guys, that's a beauty. - Grab me that bucket. - It's my first fish! It's like my first anything. - How much do you think it weighs? - 100 pounds, at least. It's got to be a record. I can't wait to show it to your dad. Are you mental? We're not showing this to anybody. - That's our lunch. - Yeah, he's right. We can grill it. - It's big enough for two dinner. - No, I caught it. I'm keeping it. - We're all hungry. I think it's lunch. - I have to say I'm with Brian on this. Big surprise. Brian caught the fish. Possession is 9/10 of the law. That's the rule. In fact, when you're in the woods, it's 10/10. - That doesn't sound right. - Rules don't have to sound right. - That's another rule. - Shotgun. - Will, we're not even near the van. - No, shotgun. Over there. Are you guys OK? Good to see somebody. We were hunting, we heard some yelling. - A bear tried to eat us. A real one. - No kidding. We got a little turned around. Do you guys know where the highway is? Sure. It's right down that hill. There's a trail. Yeah, take you two, maybe three hours. Guys, you hear that? We're gonna be home before dinner. Fish was just too big, so we had to cut it. Hook, line, and sinker? Nice trout. That's a real beauty. - You want to sell it? - No. I'll give you 50 bucks right now, cash money. I figure anyone willing to pay 50 will pay 500, right? Wait a minute. You would actually pay him $50 for the fish? What do you say? I'll give you 75 bucks. Seventy no. It's not for sale. Listen. Hey, that's that's me. That's that's my song. Dude, this is gonna rock your world. You ready for this? - I'm Randy Disher. - Who? It's the Randy Disher project. I'm your ring tone, that's my song. Go ahead. Answer it. Not today. I'm on vacation. Anyway, we're gonna take off. But it was nice to meet you guys. - Good luck with your fish. - Happy hunting. Thanks for the help. - Yeah, sure thing. - Happy hunting, boys. Thanks a lot. - Do you think they made us? - I don't know but we need get it. You know anything about fish? And what is that? Oh, that's the sinker. I made it from with one shell casings we found. You said we could take 'em. Right. Remember the armored car friday morning? I think these are the guys. Did you notice the peanut shell? It was twisted open. - Just like at the crime scene. - Yeah, I noticed. - You should've taken the 75. - He'll be back. Don't worry. I think Brian's right. They will be back. All right. You have your gun, right? No, it's back at the campsite. All right. All right, guys. Listen up. We're gonna make it to that highway, we're gonna double-time it all the way, Brian, give us the fish. - No way. - OK, buddy. This isn't a game. Those men are dangerous. We need to get the hook and the sinker out of the fish's mouth. Forget it. I caught it. - It's my fish. - Listen. You said so yourself. - I'll get him, just take the others. - Right, we'll meet you at the highway. Let's go, guys. Be careful! Are you OK? You OK? OK, give me the fish. - Just give me! - No way! Give me the Give it to me! No way! - Give it to me. - I want to give it to my dad. No way. Throw the fish. Give it to him. Wait. Not yet. I just need the little sinker thing. Material evidence of a homicide. Give it to him. Here you go. It's all yours. Bon appetit. What are we gonna do? He doesn't like it. He's gonna kill us! Do something. It's OK. It's OK I'm very calm. We're very calm. Look how calm we are. He likes it. It's working. Keep talking, keep talking. - What do I say? - I don't know. Tell him a story. - What what story? - It doesn't matter! He's a bear! You're probably wondering what we're doing here. Here's what happened. See, an armored car was robbed, and the guard was killed, and the police recovered some shell casings from the crime scene. And if they could match them to the casings found in that clearing, they'd have an airtight case. Exactly. And those two men they weren't hunters, they were killers. They must've been target practicing up here, and someone must've spotted them. Maybe a park ranger. That's why they came back. 'cause they knew that those shell casings could tie them to the crime scene. I guess it got bored. - Nice work. - It's what I do. Let's go. Right here. All right, listen. I want you guys to stay here. Nobody moves until I get back, OK? It's gonna be OK. They are. Let's go. Drop it now! Down. Down on your knees. Down! Get down! Good job. Both of you. I just spoke to the DA. You made his day. - What happened to your hand? - It was in a fish. Natalie, in a fish. - Mojo wire. - 'scuse me? Remember? You asked me my favorite band. - That's their name. - You're welcome. I didn't hear him say thank you. I did. Dad, I caught a fish. I caught this fish you think it'll help? We'll find out. Well, let's get started. I'll go first. Last weekend, this man, Adrian Monk, saved my son's life. Actually, he did more than that. He challenged my son and stood up to him in a way that I was never able to do. I've had a change of heart. I'm going to approve this recommendation and support his reinstatement. So so that's a yes? Thank you. Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. I'm in! I can't believe it! Excuse me, detective Monk. As you know, this vote has to be unanimous. I've been reviewing your record, and I'm afraid that I still have some serious reservations. I can't recommend your reinstatement at this time. Thank you. Thank you, sir. I won't let you down. Did you hear what I said? I'm sorry, but I won't be recommending you either. - I have to say no. - Thank you. Thank you so much. You won't be sorry. So how's it going? Thumbs down, two to one. Poor thing. How's he taking it? Surprisingly well. - Hey, man. We were listening. - So you know. Isn't it great? I'm back. I'm back. Wait, Mr. Monk. Do you understand what just happened in there? What are you talking about? Of course I do. Come on. Let's go celebrate. Happiness is a choice. Well, we have to tell him. Yeah, after lunch. I'm back, baby! Team Subs-Addicts"""

He's a deadbeat. Good for nothin'! - Now you go in. I'll cover the back. - Stay here. - Don't shoot! Oh, don't shoot him! Don't shoot him. Oh, Mr. Barton, I can't stay mad at you. - It's a cat? - Shh. [whispers.] he thinks he's people. - Louie, it's okay. Where are you? It's a false alarm. That's the burkman building, isn't it? - So? - Nice shooting, and nice grouping! - Monk, what are you doing? - Just cleaning up for you. - Leave the shells, monk. Leave the shells, monk. - Safety first, right? - Monk, leave the shells. - You know what, I'll get those later. - What the hell are you doing here? - It's about Manny Alvarez. - Who? - The window washer. You know, the guy who got the reward. - What about him? - Well, his story doesn't track. Listen, he said he was on the seventh floor Of the burkman building at 2:30 looking west. Well, I went back up there during lunch. You were probably wondering where I was. - No. - Yeah, well, now you know. I was up there at 2:30 looking west. The sun was directly in my eyes. - So he was wearing sunglasses. - No, no, no, he said he read the license plate. I have 20/20 vision. I couldn't read anything from the seventh floor. Nothing. - Monk, the guy's tip was righteous. Hmm? The pickaxe killer's in jail. He confessed. We have the murder weapon. - We found pieces of his victims in his attic. - Yeah, no, no, I know. I know the tip was good. - Well, what're you saying? - He's lying, okay? The window washer's lying. That's all. - Look, I think I know what's going on here. You're jealous. The big, super detective. You can't stand the fact we didn't need you. - No, that's not it. - Monk, look, you got what, - 19. - I'm giving you an order. - Hmm? - Forget the window washer and let it go. - Okay. You're right. I'm letting it go. Wait. I can't let it go! - Let it go! - Okay, there it is. It's gone. I feel better. - Hey, man, you're late. - Uh, this is a little dramatic, isn't it? - We have an agreement. We don't be seen together, yeah? - Okay, Manny. You want to play secret agent, that's fine by me. So are we gonna do this? What--what-- what are you doing? [clipped breathing.] - Russell dimarco. Did you know him? - I met him once. My first day back. - He was a rookie. Still on traffic duty, poor kid. - What do you think he was doing here? - Well, he lives nearby in crestmont village. About a mile away. He was probably heading home. - Heading home? - It's a shortcut. You can cut right through the parking lot. - Then what? - I don't know. Maybe he saw something, Something going down and he stopped. - Did he call it in? - He didn't get a chance. - What's that? Looks like a coupon. Hardy Chow dog food. He didn't follow the line. You see, the dotted line there. - Well, not everybody's you. Thank god. - Do you have a Dollar? It's the same size. It was a payoff. That's what he was doing here. Somebody was paying dimarco off, or that's what dimarco thought. Cut up newspaper Into Dollar-sized pieces; make it look like cash. - Why? - To distract him. To put him off guard. And then they shot him. - Or he had a dog, and he just wanted to save 30Â¢. - It was a payoff. - Monk, come on. Look, the captain's gonna be here in a few minutes. I want to get this straight. You saying this kid is dirty? - It would explain everything. Why his safety is still on and his gun is holstered. - I'm not saying you're wrong. You might be right. But here's what I am saying. Until you're sure, until you're 110% Hmm? You're to shut your face. Do you understand that? You're on this side of the blue line now, detective monk. That kid is family. So I'm gonna ask you one more time. Are you 110%? - No. - Then button it. - Have fun. - What, you're not coming? - I'm right behind you, detective. - Ahh. Hello, again. I'm detective first class-- - I know who you are. What took you so long? I've been waiting for three hours. He's inside my apartment. - Okay, uh, is this about your little friend Mr. Barton? - No, this is different. - All right, ma'am, look. The 9-1-1 line is for emergencies only. Real emergencies. - This is an emergency! It's Mr. Lawrence. He lives upstairs. He's gone crazy. - It's Mr. Lawrence. - He came downstairs for a visit. He wanted some milk. He loves milk. - Yeah, I'm sure he does. - Then all of a sudden, he starts running around, Knocking things over, screeching, screaming. He tried to scratch my eyes out! - Uh-huh. Let me guess. He's persian? - No. He's from Burma. - Of course he is. What the hell have you been feeding him? - [shouting in foreign language.] - So how's it going? - Oh, it's going great. I love it. How are you, detective? - I'm doing great. Couldn't be better. - You're back in the saddle. - [laughs.] absolutely. Back in the saddle. Yeah So what are you doing? - Oh, busy, busy, busy. There's a big dinner tonight at the four seasons. I called this morning And they didn't have a table for eight, But they just called back and said They could put two smaller tables together. - Oh, that Sounds like A hassle. But at least you got a good story out of it. - [laughs.] right. Uh, well, I have to go. I have to proofread some press releases. But you take care of yourself, Detective first class Adrian monk. - You too. Good-bye. - Bye. - Hey, guys. How you doing, man? [whispered greetings.] I don't see him. - He's here somewhere. Separated the fruit salad. This way. There you are. What are you doing? - They don't have a dog. - Excuse me? - Newspaper clipping in dimarco's hand. It was for dog food. - Right, the coupon. So you think dimarco crossed the line. Monk, we looked into it. Tell him. - He's clean. I mean, at least so far. His bank account checks out. He wasn't in debt. No personal problems. - We'll keep digging, monk, I promise, But in the meantime, You've got to tread carefully here. Weaver's right. You're not freelance anymore. If you're gonna accuse a cop of something, It's got to be airtight. Hey, hey. My butt's on the line here too. Come on. - [whispers.] passport application. - I said come on. Hey. - Mrs. Dimarco. Mrs. Dimarco. I'm so sorry for your loss. My name is Adrian monk. I'm a former detective--actually I'm a former former detective. - Thank you for coming. Did you work with Russell? - I only met him once at the station. We talked about computers I do have a couple of questions. Is this a bad time? - I-is this a bad time? - Just take a second. Were you and Russell planning a vacation? - Yes. - To the Cayman islands. - That's right. - Was that his idea? To go to the caymans? - He wanted to surprise me. He bought the tickets last week. - Oh, last week? Why the caymans? Did he have a bank account there? - A bank account? - Monk, what are you doing? - I'm just paying my respects. He was a great guy. We're all gonna miss him. Yeah. Did he ever say anything to you about offshore accounts? Hiding money? - What are you saying? Are you--are you accusing Russell of something? - Oh, god! - Hey, captain, you better get him The hell out of here before we have to. - Come on, monk, I want to show you something. - What--what--what is it? - It's outside. - What--what is it? - It's you not getting beat up. - Oh, I'd like to see that. - I have to say I've been Looking forward to this all week. I've been thinking about you. So how does it feel? - Good. I feel great. - Yeah, well, it's not a gift, you know, you earned it. - Mm-hmm. - So Are you happy? - [laughs.] I'm very happy. What--why wouldn't I be? This is What I've wanted for years, you know? All right, why--why--why-- Why--why do you ask that? I mean, you don't think I'm happy? - Oh, I didn't say that. No. I wasn't implying. No. - All right, I'm not happy. Are you happy? Nobody wants to work with me. I can't choose my own cases. The crazy cat lady keeps calling, Although it's not always a cat. It's my dream job. And it's making me miserable. - [clears throat.] I was afraid of this. You know, it's not an uncommon reaction. People achieve a goal, something they've always wanted. It's not always what they-- what they expect. We call it ""aspirational regret."" See, when I was a kid, I wanted to go to a baseball camp. That was my dream. Baseball camp-- - Excuse me, could I stop you right there? - Sure. You have something to say? - No. - When the gods wish to punish us, They answer our prayers. Oscar Wilde said that. - I can't believe I was happy before. Why didn't you tell me I was happy? - Adrian, you can always quit. - I can't quit. - Everybody will understand. You've changed, the department has changed, You've been your own boss for 12 years. It's hard to go back. I can't quit. [rolling cart approaches.] - Ah, Sam. - Oh, evening, detective. - What's in the box? - Oh, this is dimarco's stuff. I cleaned out his locker. His wife's picking it up in the morning. It breaks your heart. - 23, 24 - So I write down the license number. - Mr. Albanov. Hello. My name is Adrian monk. - Oh, I can't help you, my friend. I promise my accountant. I can't loan anybody another nickel. - Sir, I'm not here to borrow money. I'm, uh-- I'm with the police department. This'll just take a minute. - Oh, police. Oh. My friends. - That's right. - Hey, listen, I'm running a little late. Can you, uh, join me upstairs? Eh? - Upstair--uh, no. No, no, no, thank you. No, actually, I'm, uh-- I'm waiting for my partner. He's supposed to meet me here. I'm surprised you didn't quit your job When you collected all that reward money. - Oh, I did. [chuckles.] I give two weeks' notice. Time for somebody to wash my windows for a change, eh. Okay, so, uh, this is about what? - [sighs.] all right. Fact is, Manny, I'm here to arrest you for murder. - 'scuse me? - You heard me. - [laughs.] And, uh, who did I kill? - Russell dimarco. Police officer, was shot last week. - Russell, uh-- - Are you gonna pretend you didn't know him? You were on the same softball team, I was at his house last week, and I saw his team jacket. - Everyone at main street deli, this is for you guys. Russell! Yeah, yeah. I knew him, uh But this proves, uh What? - Yeah. Right. Okay, I'll tell you later. I'm not gonna repeat myself. All right? Let's just wait for my partner. - Oh, your, uh--your partner doesn't know about this? - Not yet, no. This is 415 vinton? - Uh, you-- you haven't, uh, Told anyone about this, have you? Oh, is that him? There? - Where? - Hey, it's 9:30. Aren't you meeting monk somewhere? - Oh, don't remind me. Another crackpot theory. - Looking for this? Hey, why don't you just jump? Three floors, you'd only break your leg. - No! No! No! - Fourth floor-- broken back. - Aargh! - Oops. Too late. Now you're dead. How did you know? - I saw-- I saw dimarco's ticket book. You didn't spot that serial killer. Dimarco did. He--he solved the case. He spotted the killer's car and realized He had just found the most wanted man in California. But dimarco didn't care about fame. He was after the fortune. The reward money. He had a problem-- he worked for the police force, Which meant that he wasn't eligible to collect the reward. He needed a partner. A front man. That's where you came in. And he told you who the killer was, And all you had to do was come up with a story And collect the money, but you-- You wanted-- you wanted the whole reward All to yourself. - [laughs.] Well, not that it matters much, but, uh, you're right. I think this'll do. You know, I don't know why you insist to come up with me today. Accidents are pretty common up here. It's very dangerous work. Especially in such a high wind. - What What are you doing? - I'm murdering you, my friend! [scaffold rattling.] - [screaming.] - You're gonna make me work for this, huh? [motor whooshes.] - OkayHa! - Gah! - Thanks for dropping by, eh! [scaffold rattling.] - Aah! - Come on! Gah! Gah! Gah! [motor whooshes.] Aah! - Step back. - You okay? - He tried to kill me. - Yeah, we know. We were watching. - And he killed dimarco. They were partners. They were planning to split the reward money, But Manny here got greedy. - Nice work, detective. - Former detective. - Former former detective. - Former former former detective. - Are you turning in your badge? - He has it. - Get dispatch. Yeah, get a-- bring me rescue services - Sign here and here. - This blood? - Sorry it didn't work out. - I'm not. At least now I know I'm not the man I was. - Who is? - So what are you gonna do? - Uh, I haven't decided. I'll either go home and brood or go home and sulk. I'm leaning toward brooding. - Well, when you leave, use the west entrance. - Why? - Surprise. - What is it? - It's a surprise. - Well, what is it? - Well, if we told you, It wouldn't be a surprise now, would it? - No, I guess it wouldn't. What is it? - What is it? - Natalie. - Heard you might be looking for an assistant. - What about your job with the big promoter? - Oh, Jim paxton can make his own dinner reservations. He doesn't need me. I'm needed here. - I pay $900 a week. - I am not taking a pay cut, Mr. Monk! - Then you shouldn't have quit. - I didn't quit, you let me go! Oh, god, you make me mad! [scoffs.] What are you looking for? - The captain said there'd be a surprise. - I'm the surprise! I talked to the captain this morning. - Oh, good. - What--what, you're disappointed? - No, I said, ""oh, good."" - Well, you sound disappointed. What were you expecting? - I thought it might be Joey Heatherton."

Bang, one in the back. Bang, one on the head. .22 caliber. There were some patients down the hall, but they didn't hear a thing. - This sounds professional. - That's a safe bet. - They are all here. - What's all here? The bottles. Here is the inventory. He didn't take anything. So it was a setup. He wanted us to think junkie. Looks like the killer stuck around for awhile and used the computer. - How do you know? - The mouse is on the left side, but Dr. Nash is right handed. - How do you know that? - He was right handed 12 years ago. Here's the thing Ethan said when the Governor called. He didn't say ""I won't let you down"" or ""Thank you for the big honor"" He said-- - Do I have to move to Sacramento? Ethan will never move. Here you go. I think he's gonna be buried in this yard. Hell I'm not gonna move now. I just fixed the leaky shower upstairs.

Are you thirsty? - Actually we're on duty sir. - Ah yes, of course you are. ??? Joey Kazarinsky. Why I'm not surprised. Sure its him? The M.O. matches, he is left handed. He uses a .22 with a silencer. Plus we got a parial print. Monk put it all together. Ha, well done Detective. Well everything looks in order. This is a historic moment, this could be my last warrant I sign. Don't tell anyone its not official. The governor wants me to commute to Sacramento. Hey, State Supreme Court.

He is going to put 2 and 2 together eventually. In this case, 2 and 2 equals: Me. I'm afraid its gonna get rather personal. ?? - What do you mean personal? - I mean he would come after me, try to kill me. ??? - Why would he do something like that? Bacause 12 years ago. I killed his wife. This is for Mr. Monk, This is for me, Mr. Monk, me. Mr. Monk, me. Mr. Monk. I don't get it, why separate carts? why not just separate them when we get home?

So Julie, your mom says you are going to Berkley. Theater Arts? - Yeah that's the plan. - You'll live at home? - No, I'm already all packed up. - I don't want to talk about it, I can't believe her leaving. - Mom I'll only be 30 minutes away. - This won't be a home, it'll just be a house. - That's a nice conversation killer. - So Adrian, you working on any interesting cases? - There was a homicide at a birthing center. - That's ironic - It was a professional hit, we know who did it we just don't-- don't know why. Mr. Monk you ok? I'm fine. I guess I'm just not hungry. I can usually eat her food. Mr. Monk, please stop, please. No there's a spotits not coming out. another spot I'm seeing spots all over. I think he's sick. Adrian, look at me. He is burning up. We should get him to a hospital. - I'm gonna need some blood. - Natalie give her some. - I need your blood. - What is that? not a needle, that's 10 feet long. Never given blood before? Well you've had shots before. I don't think so. We'll there's a first time for everything. I need you to roll up your sleeve. Can you please hold your friend? It's ok. Wait wait wait. I'm feeling much much better, its a miracle. No you are not better, they need some blood. Just lay back. -Who you calling? - Everybody. ??? ?? Mr. Monk. I'm Dr. Mathew Shule. Sorry to keep you waiting. - That's ok, ok. I wish more people would wipe their hands like that. We'd have a lot fewer patients. Thank You. Mr. Monk I work in the Hematology Department. In fact, I am the Hematology Department. - Hematology? - Rare blood disorders. ??? Mr. Monk we've never met. How well do you take bad news? - oh oh not good. - I'd rather hear the good news first. - I'm afraid there is no good news. - There is always good news. - People say: ""I have good news and some bad news"" - Not this time. - Have you eaten anything unusual lately? - Why do you ask? Well this is all very preliminary. We'll have to run more tests. But it looks like Adrian's been poisoned. poisoned? - I said ""Well done""! - It was well done! ?? You should have seen it it was still pink, it was bleeding. ??? - If I gave you food poisoning can you forgive me? - If you gave me food poisoning, no. Listen, we're not talking food poisoning here, it is a lot more serious than that. This is some kind of synthetic toxin. ??? Yes, and we do not know how it was introduced, but the dosage was quite substancial. ??? You've been poisoned Adrian. Somebody is trying to kill you. And they may have succeded. ??? ?? - Monk sit down. - It's ok Randy, I'm not pregnant, I'm dying. - Please stop talking like that. - I'll stop talking soon enough. Oh god there he is. Here he comes. ??? ?? I hate the way they walk. This is the longest hallway in the world. Hey how you feeling? Scared. Here's what we know. Everybody ate the same food at dinner. Nobody else got sick. So we're assuming it wasn't introduced there. I sent a team to your house, take all the food they can find. - Are they gonna put everything back? - After we're done testing. - Cause I have a system-- - They are gonna put it exactly the way they found it. ?? But I'm afraid we still don't know how you were introduced to the toxin? - Is that important? - Is vital. We only know its risin based But that's all we know, it can be 4000 different compunds. We can't treat you until we know the source of the poison. ??? Can't you pump the stomach, or give him antibiotics? I'm afraid is not that easy. We need to identify the specific toxin. We'll try to manage your pain as best we can. So, how long? You are gonna feel normal for awhile. Then some vomiting followed by death. Vomiting? That's right followed by death. vomiting. - Yes followed by Death. - Adrian I need you to focus on the last part of that sentence. ??? Vomiting and then death. Is there any chance death can come before the vomiting. - Two days. - Wish they were five. - Why? - It's just a bigger number. - Wait what is this? - The suspect from the brithing center, we're tracking down. ?? - Natalie we've got more important things-- - No, i've seen this guy. At the supermarket. - When was this? - Yesterday, walked away with Monk's shopping cart. ??? Yeah for about 20 seconds. - Well that's long enough, he might have put something in the cart. tampered with something. - Do you still have the reciept? - Yeah I think so. ??? - We'll test every single item that was on that list. - Is there enough time? I dont know. Thank you for coming, I have to tell you right off the bat that this is not an officialy sanctioned task force. - So nobody is gonna paid overtime. - We're not here for the money Captain. I appreciate that, I'm sure Monk does too. Ok this is our target: Joey Kazarinsky. - A.k.a, Joey Kaz, or Joey K. We think Kazarinsky shot Dr. Nash last friday and that he poisoned Adrian Monk. - What's the connection? - Monk was working the Nash case. Other than that, we don't know. Now we're gonna split up into groups. Half of you are gonna work with Randy on the shooting; they know who you are, Randy. I want to know anything about Dr. Nash. Who he was? Who loved him, Who didn't love him? The rest of us are gonna find Kazarisnky. We're gonna turn every rock in North California. Now this guy is dangerous he is armed, he might be carrying chemical agents. Be careful, BUT, this is important. No guns. You get a lead, you phone it in. Keep your gun in your belt. We need him alive. If he dies, Monk dies. Understood? ??? They'll find him. You were with Kazarinsky yesterday, we know you sold him some fake id, what was it? driver's license, passort? I dont know what your talking about. I don't have time to dance with you today, my friend is sick. ??? - You're friend is sick, what does it mean? - it means that I need that name. I need to know the name that Joey Kazarinsky is using now. So you need the name? what you gonna do? hit me with a phonebook? There are no phonebooks in here Captain, nobody uses them, all use computers. You know, you are right. - Did you get a name? - Yes I did, but your computer crashed. - Mason, can you see the ticket booth? - Roger that.

So we said no there would be secret but there 'something that I never said. E 'thing happened, terrible, years ago, before we met. Mr. Monk, must crush ""play"". It is over 'for two hours. It 'all right. It 'all right. Here. I know I've always idealized. Yes', you think I am a kind of saint. But, darling, I'm not perfect. I made a mistake. A big mistake. E 'was fifteen years ago, before we met. I had a story. With my law professor. Then he was married. I swear I did not know. However, we  Well, I became pregnant. I know you're disappointed. Not love him. In reality ', not even know, but I loved being pregnant. A little girl. E 'born January 2, 1983. E 'died the same day. He lived for nine minutes. I've never seen. Ever seen. However, the father, the professor, Rickover called Ethan E.. Rickover. The distinguished Mr. Monk. And 'a pleasure to see you. It 'a judge now. It 'just been appointed to the court of appeal. That's why I made this tape, because 'the woman disappeared for a week, Wendy Stroud, and 'the midwife that gave birth to my daughter. The midwife disappeared. The midwife disappeared. I do not know what to think. Tell me what you think. Why 'do not let this go on? And Ethan called me yesterday, so, 'from nothing. Cioe ', ten years since the speak. Wants to meet me tomorrow. And do not know. Maybe, but it ', maybe I'm just paranoid, but there was something in his voice. It 'just  I was scared, you know? Well, Ethan has a dark side. I know. I saw it. I know what and 'capable. Anyway  That's why 'I made this tape. And if I'm wrong, and how ' certain and nothing happens, then will exchange 'with the clock Digital I had asked. But if I am right and something happens, I wanted you to know everything. You deserve to know everything. Adrian  You're more 'love of my life. You are my life. You are  my life. Mr. Monk, so I'm sorry 'a lot. What are you doing? - I'm going to take Rickover. - What do you do? Mr. Monk, call the captain. Why 'not told me? Mr. Monk, everyone secrets. She loved it.

Not yet. Judge Rickover me to return to one of its previous judgments Harurra against California. She was the deputy attorney General in that case, and 'correct? Exactly, Senator. It was a case worth death in which he claimed that the prisoner, Mr. Harurra, were entitled only to hope the commutation of the death penalty. And this' opinion IN 'convinced? In all honesty, 'Senator, is certainly not. The Law and 'changed. I have changed. Then I had twenty-eight, I thought I knew everything. And 'obviously aware of that there are cases pending presenting similar circumstances and that in some of them are involved Recent advances in the analysis of DNA? Judge Rickover? Senator, I do not think is a good idea to rewrite the constitution, only because of a breakthrough in science. The fundamental principles of right have not changed. Never change. Are talking about their application in a new context. The context and 'always the determining factor? Excuse me? The context and 'always the determining factor? In my opinion, it '. These are the same basic principles, that gave life to the system legislation since the days of John Cook. But, after all, are not here to teach civics, no? In fact, I would not mind. For some of us might be useful. Senator, and 'was a long morning. If and 'possible, I would ask for a short interval. I find it an excellent idea. A little 'air serve everyone. We find ourselves here at ten-fifteen. Mr. Monk, what a surprise. I heard that and 'sick. No, no, no, I feel  I feel much better. Much, much better. It 'a relief.

Wendy Stroud, the midwife who assisted childbirth and my wife. I had been warned. I had heard that before appointment of each hearing, all came out of the insane asylum. Judge Rickover, we know everything. Really? Mr. Monk, I have had hundreds of students at Berkeley. Some of them had much brain. Piu 'a had a crush on me. But tell me, have any proof? - Where 'the baby? - E 'morto. The child and 'dead. The birth certificate? Some certificate? Gone, all gone. Thought about her. She sent Joey Kazarinski center for births, last week. They were updating the registers. The director must have discovered something about Trudy, on the child. So 'she killed him.
