Enough. I got to be out of here.  The orders go from God to me to you.  -This is Carlo's Bakery. - ## Sugar ##  Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries  go out these doors.  This is the crew -- mia famiglia.  We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  ## Sugar ##  ## Oh, sugar, sugar ##  Come on. We got to go. We got to go. We got to go.  This is it, man. This is go time.  We got no margin for error.  All right, I need everybody on their ""A"" game today.  This week at Carlo's Bakery is a crazy week.  Danny, you're gonna clear off this bench.  You're gonna cut and fold and get ready to pull.  We're gonna make 400 birthday cakes,  2, 000 cupcakes, hundreds of pastries,  hundreds of pounds of biscottis and cookies,  five monster wedding cakes,  four or five huge specialty cakes.  I got zero room for error. I got zero room for mistakes.  I really have to make this happen.  I hope my sisters downstairs understand  what I got to do this week  and just give me a little courtesy  to try not to break my chops.  [ Beeping .]  Hey, guys, where's the pastries?  Where's the other stuff for the store?  Just be patient, because I got a lot of things going on.  -Don't break my chops. -Come on, guys.  BUDD Y: That's my sister Mary. What can I say?  Mary is just a little rough around the edges.  She just is a little blunt.  Well, why not? It's 7:30.  I know the time, Mary.  I don't need you to tell me what time it is.  Mary can be the best or Mary can be the worst.  Who's making this butterfly? This is the ugliest --  Are you trying to scare our customers?  You know, sometimes she just doesn't handle situations  the right way.  You have to help me. I can't help you.  I don't know your daughter, dear.  She's actually really a good person with good intentions.  She just comes off the wrong way sometimes.  I need chocolate-dipped cannoli shells, little ones.  BUDD Y: That's my sister Grace right there.  I know Grace's annoying voice.  She's my oldest sister, she's level-headed,  and I love her.  All right? And ice-cream cakes.  -I know. I'm working on it. -And I have no cupcakes.  I'm doing the best I can, all right?  You know, basically, my father was a god.  M y father, Buddy Sr., he was this magnificent baker  who everybody looked up to and respected.  Words cannot explain what a good father he was.  I lost him when I was 17.  I made a promise to him.  This bakery -- I'm gonna make it a household name.  I will do what I have to do to make this happen.  GRACE: Buddy, on line one, you have a phone call.  Maria McBride from Brides magazine.  Pick up on line one, Bud.  BUDD Y: Buddy. May I help you?  McBR I DE: I need your help, Buddy.  Whatever you need, I'm here you. You know that, Maria.  McBR I DE: I'm calling you because I really need a showcase cake.  It's the inside back cover.  Brides magazine wants me to do a huge shoot,  inside cover -- awesome.  I mean, the best possible scenario  for publicity you can get.  McBR I DE: Key is, I need it this week.  -[ Laughs .] -We're shooting on Friday.  -You're shooting on Friday, huh? -Yeah.  BUDD Y: No matter what, even if I'm slammed,  no matter what I have to do to get this done, I got to do it.  -McBR I DE: Have a good day, -You too.  McBR I DE: Bye-bye.  All right.  We have a cake for Friday for Brides magazine.  Six-tier monster.  They want something piped, something old-school.  You can't say no because that's an opportunity of a lifetime.  And I also love the whole theme of it.  She said black and white. I was like, ""Ah!""  Like, the light went off in my head.  I saw this six-tiered cake perfectly iced in white fondant  where it was so perfect and square  with the smallest double-zero hand-piping techniques  in black on it.  I saw red flowers on it -- beautiful red roses.  But she's like, ""What about white anemones?""  That's beautiful. That's the perfect flower.  I mean, it's white and it has a black center  and little black things coming out of it.  You got to make Brides magazine happy.  I said, ""Let's try the anemones. ""  The first thing I got to do is dirty-ice this cake.  And ""dirty-ice"" means taking buttercream  and kind of crumb-coating the cake  and it makes the fondant stick to it.  We use it kind of like a glue.  We got to get that sugar. Where's that sugar?  I say, ""All right.  Let's set up for royal icing and get the sugar. ""  JOEY: Hey, Bud.  Not for nothing, there's no friggin' sugar.  I got all kinds of [bleep.] lined up downstairs.  I'm down to three guys. I got no sugar.  BUDD Y: That's my brother-in-law Joey.  He does a lot of the baking.  He's a little bit of a hothead.  But when push comes to shove, he knows who the boss is.  Not a bag of sugar.  I mpossible.  JOEY: Frankie, is it impossible?  If it's impossible, I got to be friggin' blind.  BUDD Y: Little Frankie -- He's family. He's my cousin.  I'm godfather to his daughter.  He's still got a lot to learn.  I nventory this week told me there were 20 bags of each.  There's two guys that check the inventory downstairs.  And they're telling me there's no sugar?  Maybe they needed 20 bags! You got to use your brains!  If you didn't order any sugar last week --  I ordered 25 bags of each last week.  How the hell do we not have sugar in this bakery?  Things are at a standstill. I got all this work to do.  And I ain't got time for this.  Go and get sugar! Okay? Just go and get sugar!  I can't do any more than I do. I can't. I can't.  JOEY: Production just stopped. We have empty ovens.  If the ovens aren't full, we don't make any money.  If we have nothing to put in the oven, you have nothing to do.  I don't want to hear it now. I got enough things on my mind.  JOEY: You ain't gonna have cakes to fill 'cause we got no sugar.  But who checks the stock?!  The problem in here is communication.  Everybody wants to -- me, da, da, da, da.  But nobody wants to say, ""Hey, we need this"" or ""We need that. ""  Now I got to lose a guy for an hour to go pick up sugar.  When something goes wrong, then we got to hear him.  Is that what we want to do, peoples?  BUDD Y: Mauro is a. k. a. Chef Mario.  He's my brother-in-law.  I would say he's my right-hand man.  Huh, peoples? Is that what we want?  I'm just sick of it.  MAURO: Well, you want to be the boss, right?  Everything's got to go through you.  If something goes wrong, it's the boss that's --  BUDD Y: Yeah, well, I do my end, Mauro.  I'm not an accountant.  You know, I'm an Italian baker in Hoboken, New Jersey.  It kind of goes with the territory, you know?  I can't be a cream puff.  Once in a while, I got to step it up a notch.  When I say something, I want people to jump.  That's how it's got to work this week.  We're Italian.  Italians -- rah, rah! We're loud people.  We're family. There's gonna be fights.  JOEY: Where'd you go, China?  Shut up! Here's your [bleep.] sugar!  JOEY: You screwed up. You didn't get the sugar.  Now you throw it on the bench like it's my fault.  You know, come on, Frank. Come on, Frank.  Get it right the first time.  BUDD Y: You got to understand something.  You're working with these same people 15, 18 hours,  five, six, seven days a week.  Things are gonna get heated.  -[ Clatter .] -Get this off the bench first.  BUDD Y: This isn't a library. This isn't church.  [ Grunts .]  This Brides magazine cake is like the biggest thing ever.  It took a couple hours, but we got the cake iced and stacked,  ready for that old-school design that Maria wants.  But if I don't get these flower petals started,  we're gonna be in big trouble.  People like Maria McBride know what they want.  She told me that she wants white anemones on the cake.  These anemones are such a pain in the neck to make  that my staff was actually calling them ""enemies. ""  [ Chuckles .]  I would say to make one anemone,  it probably takes 20 to 30 minutes per flower.  And you got to do 30 of them.  GRACE: It's a busy week.  And now we have a cake for Brides magazine.  But it's also Buddy's birthday on Friday,  and we want to throw him a surprise party.  Bud  We're gonna trick him into making his own birthday cake  with a pretend customer.  He wants a boat? For this weekend?  [ Both laugh .]  BUDD Y: A lady called up.  She wants a boat cake for this week.  What am I gonna say?  As bad as I know that I don't want to do it  and I'm gonna be overworked, you got to make the customer happy.  The whole thing will be cake. It'll probably be pound cake.  But the bottom, too?  When I had to think of  what would be the perfect cake for Buddy,  it was really quite easy.  Buddy's passion and the thing that he enjoys most is to fish.  Tell her we're doing her a favor.  All right.  MAN: Frankie, why'd you put this slip here?  FRANKI E: Which? I didn't put a slip there.  BUDD Y: Listen, listen, listen. I don't want to hear anything.  I'm in the zone right now.  Maria McBride says, "" I want some piping detail on the cake. ""  You know, that's me.  I'm old-school. I was born and bred on piping.  What I'm doing is taking black royal icing,  squeezing it through a tiny, tiny tip,  and drawing designs on it.  When you're piping black onto white, it's a one-shot deal.  There's no room for mistakes.  You put it, it stays.  Otherwise, you have to take the fondant off  and put a new fondant on.  Any slip of the hands could cost you hours of work.  You really got to be on your ""A"" game.  All this stuff that I got on my plate,  I go to get a cup of coffee.  Grace says to me, ""There's an e-mail. ""  Who could that be?  And the whole Mary fiasco begins.  I get the e-mail, and it basically says  that you your big-mouthed sister told me to go scratch  and I'm never coming to your bakery again.  Mary's got a history of being rude to customers.  Print me a copy of it so that I'm gonna take her upstairs  and speak to her about that.  I want to see you upstairs in a minute.  -Me? -Yeah.  I'm enfumed now. You know, I --  That's it. The Hulk is coming out.  And I could feel my insides knotting and twisting.  [ Sighs .] Now read this.  Read it aloud.  ""Last week when I came into the store,  some rude, big-mouthed blonde  jumped down my throat for no reason. ""  I really don't even remember having an argument.  Yeah, but you're downstairs now.  Grace tells me you're being rude to people.  Buddy, Grace strolls in at whatever time she strolls in.  I'm helping customers! She's answering e-mails.  It's not my fault.  -I helped like 40 people -Listen, okay?   and made every single one of them very happy.  Enough!  Mary! Enough!  Listen!  I get this e-mail from a customer complaining about Mary.  I confront her about it, and she's mad at me!  Just because she's my sister and I love her -- and I do --  and I feel that she does a lot of good,  she can't get away with being that way.  I got to get back to work.  The number-one target to me was the Brides magazine cake.  And I started piping my heart out.  You know, I'm piping like a madman.  And then things start to change.  I forget everything.  Everything gets quiet. I don't hear nothing.  You know [ Exhales deeply .]  I'm in my zone.  I could feel the stress coming off of my body,  just coming off me.  I was doing good.  MARY: Earlier, Buddy called me into his office  and accused me of being rude to a customer.  And I just wanted to end it  because I thought it was so stupid.  If I did, I would tell you.  Promise me you're gonna make a conscious effort to be nicer.  I promise you, but I don't remember being mean.  You know I love you.  We did hug each other. And it's done. It's over with.  -Aah! -[ Laughs .]  BUDD Y: I got all these cakes going on,  things are starting to fall in place   and then there they go.  They got to stick me.  They said, ""Oh, what about the boat cake?""  I'm like, ""Oh, my God.  I actually forgot about the boat cake. ""  All right, Remy, get the boat.  All hands on deck. Let's go to the boat cake.  Think boat, Buddy, think. [ Sighs .]  I kind of thought, ""What would I like for a fishing boat?""  And, you know, boom -- It popped in my head.  I see white, blue, and it's got some chrome on it.  A little fisherman guy fishing.  Maybe we even put some fish on it.  I think some fish will look cool.  And I know what I got to do, and I can nail this down.  So the first thing we had to do was carve the cake.  And we iced it in the fondant.  We got to start adding detail to it.  We had to make the doorway to the little cabin underneath.  The rails around the front. And I had to put water.  And I used piping gel,  where I made it really crystal blue,  and I kind of did like a wavy pattern all over the cake.  We had a little bait box.  We had a tackle box, a little cooler.  We had a fisherman.  All made out of modeling chocolate,  which means it's all edible.  And the more we put on it, the nicer it looked.  It was coming awesome.  I love it. Makes us want to go fishing, no?  WOMAN: It looks amazing. Oh, my God.  It's Thursday.  And I still got a lot a lot of cakes to finish,  but the number one on the list is the Brides cake by far.  Looks pretty good.  Right. This will be the back.  The big photo shoot's tomorrow.  I was skeptical about using the anemones   as a topper 'cause they're more of a flat flower.  But to tell you the truth, this actually worked beautiful.  -Buddy, you outdid yourself. -MAN: How do you do that?  BUDD Y: I finished, I stepped back,  and I started to admire my work.  GRACE: Buddy, have you a call on line one.  Maria McBride from Brides magazine's on line one.  McBR I DE: Just thinking about all of the different options.  I know it's kind of a crazy last-minute concept,  but what it means, Buddy,  is us picking out two more cake ideas that you can execute.  Two more cakes? Are you nuts, lady?!  And I got to have it ready for Friday?  Maybe we do maybe two smaller cakes?  I can't say no.  She knows I can't say no.  So I'm stuck.  I mean, I don't know what I'm gonna do.  She just dropped a bomb on us.  I mean, she dropped like an atomic bomb on the bakery.  M y team was P. O. 'd, like, big-time.  -McBR I DE: Talk to you later. -Ciao.  McBR I DE: Bye-bye.  -All right. -Are you kidding me or what?  BUDD Y: Agreeing to do these cakes  equated into my team having to make  another 650 petals of anemones, okay?  Plus we had to get two cakes rockin' and rollin' ASAP.  M y vision for these next two bridal magazine cakes,  the first one, I wanted to go with stenciling.  Very much goes with the feel of the other cake,  but it's different.  The second cake, I'm gonna use black fondant  and then cut out all different floral patterns.  I'm gonna still use the anemones to tie all the cakes together.  Okay. Give that to Violet.  I got to put people in gear.  I also got to get the rest of the cakes for the week done.  I got a lot of work still. A lot a lot of work.  I just hope we have the time to do it.  It's gonna be close.  JOEY: Yo-yo, come here. Then the other one's a 5.  No, they're not! This is 6! This is 5!  These are the ones I picked up the first time!  All right, all right. Listen, listen!  All right, listen! Enough!  Everybody shut up and get to work. I don't want to hear it.  The orders go from God to me to you.  We got the cutouts on the one cake.  I love it.  We did the stenciling on the last one.  Very sexy.  Today's all about the flowers.  I got to put the flowers on these cakes.  All right. Everybody, come look.  MAURO: They look beautiful. That's what we want.  BUDD Y: I was so happy with the cakes that I made.  I was so proud of me.  I was so proud of my team.  And I was like, ""Okay, let's get in action. ""  Get in and go.  We got to go to the car. Danny, watch the top.  -DANN Y: Don't worry about it. -BUDD Y: Don't mess it up, Danny.  -Watch the top. -MAN: Take it easy.  BUDD Y: Watch out.  I still had to get the cakes in the truck   drive through the tunnel,  get them to New York, and get them to Maria.  I was really nervous about these cakes falling.  There was absolutely no way in hell  that I was letting that cake get damaged  in any way, shape, or form.  I really, really want to wow Maria, and I think we nailed it.  Hello.  Beautiful.  BUDD Y: I mean, I got some cakes that are phenomenal.  McBR I DE: Those are fabulous, Buddy.  BUDD Y: To hear it from Maria McBride  of Brides magazine  Not bad for three days' work.  [ Both laugh .]  M y father was looking down on me. He was proud.  [ Camera shutter clicks .]  M illions of people are gonna see this magazine.  It's huge. Huge.  I love it. I really, really love it.  Wow. What a shot.  Right now I'm thinking I wish my dad was here.  You know, I wish my dad was here  to see where I am and what I've done.  Before he died, I told him, ""Dad, one day,  everybody in America is gonna know who we are.  I promise you. ""  He is definitely smiling down on me right now.  -Salute. -WOMAN: Salute.  -McBR I DE: Excellent. -BUDD Y: Cheers.  I was proud of what we did,  and a weight lifted off my shoulder.  But there's still one thing I got to do.  I got to deliver this boat cake to this restaurant.  I'm backing into this room, and I'm looking at Mauro.  And I walked into the room  and I didn't see anybody 'cause I was looking at the cake.  -Surprise! -Surprise!  BUDD Y: I hear, ""Surprise!""  and I almost jumped out of my skin and dropped the cake.  [ Cheers and applause .]  Aww.  -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday, Buddy!  I was touched, you know? They got me.  They really got me, you know?  It was really, really nice.  So we didn't get paid for it?  -Oh, my God! -[ Laughter .]  This is to family, our famiglia.  -Salute. -Salute.  Cheers.  MARY: Look at what clean cuts these are, Buddy.  You're a professional.  After a week like this week, to tell you the truth,  I couldn't be with better people.  And, you know, what a perfect ending to a crazy week."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  We want it to look like a real fire truck.  JOEY: This is all wrong. Fire engine has water.  Fire truck has ladder on it.  BUDD Y: I'm thinking maybe cheetah, leopard, zebra.  You know, something real sexy.  How the hell did it peel off?!  Listen to me! How bad is it?  This is the anniversary week of my father dying.  I wanted to maybe make something special for him.  You got the chief in front, giving everybody orders.  BUDD Y: That's right.  It was so phenomenal, it hurt.  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   All right, guys. I got the cake of the week.  Team meeting.  This has got to be awesome.  It's for a retired fireman. You know, it's a good thing.  I had this local fireman come in.  And he wanted me to make this cake  for this retirement home for these fireman  who are sick, who are disabled,  you know, who put their lives on the line for us.  We want it to look like a real fire truck.  We want it to have the sirens and the lights, if possible.  I don't know if you guys can do that or not.  I'm gonna make the cake look so real  that you're not gonna want to the touch it.  You're gonna think it's on fire. How's that?  [ Chuckling .] We'll see.  BUDD Y: We need sirens, lights.  I'm gonna chainsaw this toy up.  We're gonna take the electrical components out of it.  There's no textbook for this. You can't read this.  You can't buy a ""how to make crazy fire-truck cake"" book.  That's the fire truck?  Not only is Joey a baker here,  but he works two days a week as a fireman.  JOEY: This is all wrong.  We're talking about doing a cake for firefighters.  And they're gonna say,  ""Ah, it's a great cake, but this is wrong. ""  The hydrants over here --  They're flowing water,  and they don't even have any water going into the engine.  What's the difference between a fire truck and a fire engine?  Fire engine has water. Fire truck has a ladder on it.  We definitely want an engine.  All right, do we know what an engine looks like?  M y brother-in-law Joey, I think, saw the frustration,  you know, because the wheels were turning,  and I just wasn't getting what I wanted.  -Wish I could see it. -I'll get you a fire truck.  You want a fire truck, I'll get you a fire truck.  I was like, ""Hey, that's not a bad idea.  Call them up. ""  [ Siren wailing .]  You want a fire truck? There's a fire truck.  This is a truck. That's an engine.  All right, we want to look at the engine.  We want to see the engine.  Let's look at the engine.  We start looking. I'm like, ""Frankie, photograph it. ""  Shoot 'em up.  [ Camera shutter clicking .]  JOEY: This is a steamer connection.  This was the one I was talking about hooking to the hydrant.  BUDD Y: So we're gonna pull up in front.  JOEY: Right, you'll pull up, you hook to the hydrant.  This comes in. This goes straight to the pumps.  The pump panel is always on the driver's side.  Now, this is where all the controls happen,  you get the water out of the hoses and everything.  Everyone's gonna look at this cake and dissect it.  They're firemen.  This is for real firemen. It's got to be for real.  This is not a fire truck. This is like a fire scene.  There's a fire truck with a guy holding a hose  squirting water on the fire.  A screaming lady like this.  I'm gonna have smoke, lights, sirens.  This thing is gonna be nuts.  I told Christine, Tony, and Sunshine  to start making all the little elements in the scenery.  We use modeling chocolate for things that need to be sculpted.  It's really easy to work with.  You can make it any color,  so it's perfect for getting all the right details.  Modeling chocolate is made of chocolate and corn Syrup,  so it's all edible.  Project like this usually takes six, seven days.  I only got three.  I n the meantime,  Joey's got to get moving on making this pound cake.  Pound cake's definitely the right cake to use  for the fire truck and the big building Buddy has planned.  We use lots of butter  Swear to God, it's fat-free.   sugar   and Buddy's secret ingredient, cream cheese,  which gives it great texture and makes it perfect for carving.  BUDD Y: Joey's got the pound cake baking,  but I got to get moving on something else --  this fashionista cake.  This cake is for two girls who are turning 30.  WOMAN: They're really into fashion.  Anything involving shoes, designer ready-to-wear,  they're all about it.  So we wanted to surprise them with a cake.  BUDD Y: You go from lights, sirens, smoke  to, you know, pocketbook, shoes --  Big transition.  I got to get in touch with my feminine side to make this cake.  Let's get the shoebox out first,  roll it out for the bottom.  I got to make this fashionista cake  for these girls who really know high fashion.  You know, there's no room for error.  The fashionista cake is basically  four separate elements.  You have a shoebox, shopping bag.  You have a shoe. You have a pocketbook.  All those things are made of cake.  Then we cover them with fondant, which is, like, a sugar dough.  I have this thing called ""quilting""  that I used on the pocketbook.  It kind of looked real, real sexy.  So I took this quilting tool and I made these lines,  and I did this quilting pattern to it.  I mean, makes the cake look awesome.  We started painting the whole pocketbook.  And then I had to start putting these pieces together.  I'm so happy to see everybody! I'm back!  -MAN: Hello. -[ Laughs .]  Everybody on line to kiss Mama. How much youse miss me?  BUDD Y: That's my mama.  Mama always just tries to bring joy and energy  and happiness to the bakery.  She tries to make the peace  between my sisters and everybody else.  And then there's my son.  BUDD Y: We have a special bond, me and my mom.  M y Buddy. Very good.  This is the anniversary week of my father dying 15 years ago.  I mean, I thought, being that we always have dinner out,  I wanted to maybe make something special.  You know what? A cream-puff cake.  Oh, that was his signature cake! Oh, you're right.  I can't believe I didn't think of that.  The signature cake.  People really love that.  I wanted him to make a special cake  for us to have for the dessert.  And the cream-puff cake was the one cake that Buddy Sr.,  he created that.  It's 15 years.  I know.  15 years. You're so much like him.  BUDD Y: M y mom wants me to do this cream-puff cake.  It's for my dad. How can I let him down?  MAMA: Absolutely.  BUDD Y: Let's put this inside, Remy.  I got to get started on this fire-truck cake.  We're gonna put this fogging machine underneath the cake.  And I can make the smoke  come out of different parts of the roof.  It's not really smoke. It's water vapor.  It's not gonna harm the cake.  Next, we layer and stack the pound cake  in the the shape of the building.  And we started to dirty-ice it.  That's buttercream icing in there.  What we got to do with that is  just got to get it all perfectly smooth  so that, when we put the walls on, they stick.  The walls are basically fondant.  We took this little brick-impression thing  on all these sheets of fondant.  And I used a board to kind of like guide it up.  'Cause if I would have picked up that fondant and just put it on,  it would have cracked.  I want to cut it now.  We get the whole front and back covered.  I got the girls cutting windows. Then I start going to the roof.  So my roof trick is taking black fondant,  sticking it in poppy seeds.  It's the best roof you could ever build.  And then in the back of my head, I'm like, ""Uh-oh.  The fashionista cake. ""  All right, Sunshine. We got that shoe.  I'm thinking maybe cheetah, leopard, zebra.  You know, something real sexy.  STEPHAN I E: Buddy asked me to make a high-fashion shoe,  so I'm making a zebra shoe.  If I can do my job right, the girls are gonna think  that the elements that I put on this cake  came out of their closet.  And it's all edible.  STEPHAN I E: This is all gum paste,  which is very similar to fondant.  This is completely edible.  BUDD Y: This tissue paper --  This is basically made  This is the fondant,  and we roll it out real thin on the machine there.  The hardest thing part of making a fashionista cake  is the coloring.  Like, the colors all got to complement each other, blend,  and still pop at the same time.  I look at the cake, and I'm like,  ""Hey, this is beautiful. I am an artiste.  I'm a fashionista. Mwah!""  STEPHAN I E: Very sexy.  BUDD Y: I just finished this fashionista cake.  Last delivery. End of the day. I'm trying to wrap things up.  Where's Stretch?  -Come on, Stretch. -Let's go!  BUDD Y: Last delivery, baby. This is it.  Nice and easy. Don't drop nothing.  Don't mess nothing up.  -I'll be careful. -All right?  That's Stretch. What can I say?  I don't know why I keep him around.  I guess, you know, I got a soft spot in my heart for him.  On time. The cake's got to be put in the right place.  -Or you'll be in trouble. -Okay.  At Carlo's right now, I'm the delivery boy.  They tell me I'm bad at everything,  but they keep me around.  I've been there like a year and a half now.  [ Laughs .]  It's not really a hard job.  I mean, I just have to drive and deliver cakes.  [ Thud .]  Then sometimes you hear weird sounds come out of the car.  And that's when the job gets hard.  Oh, man.  The cake seems to have fallen apart.  I'm gonna call up Buddy now.  Oh, man.  Hello.  Hey, um, the fondant was still too soft.  It just completely peeled off.  -What? -It peeled off.  How the hell did it peel off?! You had to hit the brakes!  Listen to me! How bad is it?  He can't even drive around the friggin' corner  without screwing up a cake!  You had to hit the brakes! How bad is it?  We're making progress on this fire-truck cake.  Everybody's got to stop. It's all off now.  Now we got to stop what we're doing,  go fix his friggin' mistake.  -Give me an assessment! -Okay, it's not bad at all.  You need to roll out one more piece of fondant  and stick it back on with more buttercream,  and it's gonna look fine again.  You send me a picture on my phone right now!  The last time the you know what told me it wasn't so bad,  I had to redo the whole cake.  I want to see how bad it is before I go there and kill him.  All right, all right, all right, all right.  We got more of that pink?  Remy, what was the length of that wall?  Cut me another wall. Let's go.  I don't think he meant to do it.  But, you know, either he had to step on the brakes --  Okay, something had to happen.  I'm a little nervous.  Just 'cause you never know how Buddy's temper is gonna be.  Don't think I'd get fired over something like this.  But who knows?  I don't want to hear it.  Luckily, the cake was so well put together  that it was fixable.  I just had to fix the back wall.  -Got it? -BUDD Y: You get the door.  I put it into the memory bank.  I was like, ""Post-it -- Get Stretch.  He's going to pay for today. ""  Did anybody order a birthday cake?  [ People cheering .]  MAN: Wow. Look at this thing.  BUDD Y: The girls come over, and they're floored.  They're like, ""Oh, my God!  I never seen anything like it! It's the most beautiful thing!""  Wow! Thank you so much.  BUDD Y: Happy birthday from me.  All right?  -These are gonna go like this? -JOEY: Exactly like that.  BUDD Y: Next morning, we got the front of the truck finished.  So now we're gonna start wiring this thing.  I'm gonna take it apart and try to keep all the wiring together,  just take the components off.  BUDD Y: I get the pieces and I'm like,  "" I got to get the electrical through. ""  So, what I do is I take a chopstick,  stick a hole through the cake so that I have a nice hole.  Then I put a little straw, kind of like a pipe,  so that we can snake the wires through.  Give me those wires, Joey.  So we snake the wires through.  And then I got to start soldering.  And I'm cutting wires from the other fire truck,  I'm extending them.  It was a real pain in the neck.  So after two hours of this, we finally get this thing wired up.  Joey runs it all to a switch underneath the cake.  Lights.  [ Siren wailing .]  And I press the button.  All the lights work on the fire truck.  MAN: All right!  M y job is to make people happy.  Using real cake, that's what we do.  All edible. We got old-school cake in there.  As hard as we were working with that fire-truck cake,  my team needed a laugh.  Your main objective is to keep Stretch in the doorway.  I had planned Frankie and Danny upstairs on the roof  with a 5-gallon bucket of water and a 5-gallon bucket of flour.  All right.  Hey, Stretch?  What's up?  [ Laughter .]  Hey, next time, you don't mess my cakes up!  This is a family business.  If you work here  Stretch, I love you, baby.   you get treated like family.  They fool around a lot, so  Not normally to this extent, but that's all right.  It's all right. It's funny.  BUDD Y: I knew he was gonna be a good sport, you know?  But at the same time, I wanted to teach him a lesson.  And I think he learned it.  All right, get back to work. Playtime is over.  So we got two things to still do --  the fire-truck cake and a cake for my dad's memorial.  I'm gonna do my dad's memorial cake first.  Cream-puff cake is a cake that my dad invented in like 1982.  One of his friends came back from Italy  with a bottle of liquor called San Marzano.  And my father flavored the cream with the San Marzano liquor.  And then we use layers of French pastry, then cream, then sponge.  Then we do more cream, French pastry,  and then we put the icing over it.  I get the cream puffs. I put the cream puffs around.  I put the whipped cream on.  The strawberries, the kiwis.  I finish it with the chocolate shaves.  And I'm like, ""You know what?  I want to top it with a picture of my dad. ""  What we got is a computer machine  where you scan a picture in.  But instead of ink, it uses food coloring,  which is pretty cool, you know?  No matter how crazy things get, my father is on my mind.  I still think about him all the time.  I got to stop thinking about that  and focus my energy on the fire-truck cake.  That's actually a good thing. Because you know what?  You don't want to be down and somber  when you're making a cake that's got to be awesome.  He looks like he's maybe coming around the corner.  BUDD Y: So, you know, I get the fire truck all done on the cake.  I start piping grass. I start putting firemen.  We start putting the finishing touches.  What else are we gonna do on this board?  It's 9:00. It's 9:30. It's 10:00.  I'm like, ""Wow. It's done. ""  I'm like, ""All right, light it up.  Let's see this sucker smoke. ""  [ Cheering .]  Oh, wow!  [ Siren wailing .]  We were just, like, in awe. The cake was beyond wonderful.  It was so phenomenal, it hurt.  But it was also 1:30 in the morning.  Onetwothree.  BUDD Y: We had to get the cake downstairs.  WOMAN: Careful, Joey.  Wait, wait, wait. This has got to go in, Joey.  I measured for the elevator.  But I measured by the hair of my chinny chin chin.  [ Grunts .]  Go ahead.  Watch the corner.  Hold it. Hold it tight.  BUDD Y: Late last night, we finished the firemen's cake.  Stop!  But we had to get it down the elevator and into the fridge.  What about the height of this thing?  MAN: Watch the little lip. Watch the little lip there.  BUDD Y: Nice and easy.  WOMAN: Ready? Come down there.  Okay. We're in business.  It cleared by that much.  Whoo!  -Okay, get the lock. -[ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: Next morning, it's pouring rain, pouring rain.  We're about to put the cake in the car, clears up.  Come out. Swing. Joey, you and Remy in first.  It was the perfect second, 'cause cake and rain don't mix.  Joey, go in. No, on the right.  Joey's dressed in his fireman's dress clothes.  Push it in. No, no, no. Wait.  Go in the back. Mauro, Mauro. Go in the back over here.  Push it.  And me and Remy in our chef coats, and we're pretty excited.  -Just stay back there. -All right. I'm being punished?  All right.  And then we get in the car, it starts downpouring.  -[ Rattling .] -Whoa, whoa.  Take it easy in front, there!  BUDD Y: Soon as we pull up to the place, the rain stops.  I'm like, ""Oh, man. "" It's just my day. Thank God. ""  I look at the cake. Everything was 100%.  Slide.  Joey, get the corners.  Step one.  Two. Three.  Okay, easy.  Easy.  MAN: No, no, no. I got it.  Push. That's it. Now you're good.  BUDD Y: Okay, you guys are gonna turn.  Two, three, up.  Okay, go up. More in, guys.  All right. Right there.  Thank you.  I just want to say thank you  for all the years of service.  We love you, and we appreciate you.  I hit the smoke.  -I put the sirens on. -[ Siren wailing .]  [ Laughs .]  Now, it's not a real fire, all right, guys?  So nobody jump out of their chairs.  -[ Applause .] -Looked real nice.  The engine and the hydrant and the man and the dog.  Got the chief in front giving everybody orders.  That's right.  It was like a ""tribute to great men"" day for me.  -How is the cake, guys? -Good.  You know, here I am with these great firemen,  and now I'm gonna go tribute to my dad,  who was, I think, the greatest man ever.  -Hi, Ma. -Oh, hi! How you doing?  Just to see the unity of my whole family coming together,  with all the kids.  And you know what? I know my dad was there.  And I couldn't have asked for a better mother.  During that dinner, I had a little surprise for my mom.  It was a tape of the 30th anniversary of Carlo's Bakery.  At the time, I was probably, like, 16 years old.  Ooh-ma!  It was very touching for me.  How about you, Buddy? Come up here and say something.  It brought back a lot of good memories.  BUDD Y SR.: What am I gonna say?  The most important thing with that tape  is to hear my father's voice.  I see all my friends here. I really appreciate your coming.  MAMA: How about me?  -M y wife. -[ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: Just being able to hear him,  it touched me.  Gone but definitely not forgotten.  MAMA: Never.  I thought it would only be right  to make the cake that Daddy invented.  That was his signature cake.  WOMAN: Let's hear it for Grandpa Buddy.  This week was kind of like a real emotional week.  This is my Buddy's cake.  -WOMAN: You got a big piece. -Oh, wow!  I'm so grateful for all my family, especially my children.  They're all the best.  [ Applause .]  Just to bring him on like this, we can carry the tradition.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  [ Cheering .]  That's who we are. We're family.  -Salute. -Salute."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Happy Easter from Carlo's.  BUDD Y: It's Easter. Things are going nuts.  WOMAN: We have a big Easter-egg hunt on Saturday  for the Hoboken Family Alliance.  This Saturday?  I look at the back of this cake, and my heart just drops.  I just can't even believe this happened.  What am I gonna do?  Yeah, but concentrate on what?  BUDD Y: Is all the bread like that?  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   It's Easter week at Carlo's Bakery,  which means it's gonna be nuts.  On an average week at Carlo's,  we could have 200 to 300 people in the store per day.  Easter week, it could be 2, 000, 3, 000.  I mean, that's nuts.  MAURO: Getting done.  BUDD Y: This is where you make your money.  You know, when it's the slow times in January,  these are weeks that add up for it.  So if you don't make your money this week, you don't make it.  And everything just has to go a certain way  or we're in big trouble.  -Is everybody around? -Yep.  All right.  Easter week. Big, big, big week.  It's go time.  We got to do what we got to do to make this happen, okay?  And, Buddy, whosever making these cupcakes --  This is too much!  It's heavy, and it's falls off.  -Mauro, Frankie, it's too much! -But they are top-heavy.  It's too heavy. Look at them.  This poor cupcake don't stand a chance.  It's too heavy.  It looks terrible. It doesn't taste good.  It doesn't look good.  And it's the sloppiest thing I've ever seen.  They're not finished.  This happens to be delicious and my favorite,  and you can't even enjoy them!  Listen, listen. All right?  When you have a problem, you tell me.  All right, well, I told Mauro and I told  I will talk to them, and I will settle this.  But you got to tell me.  You got to be nice. You don't have to be a bitch.  -But it's every time! -You still tell me!  Listen, don't yell at me!  -Mary. Mary! -It's every week.  -And I did go and tell them. -Mary, go downstairs.  -No, I did tell them. -Mary. Go downstairs.  I'm the one who has to sell them, and they suck.  Go downstairs.  -You're saying how busy you are. -Go downstairs, Mary!  Go downstairs, Mary!  It's Easter. Things are going nuts.  And then I get a call.  Hi. How you doing? I'm Buddy.  ""Buddy, there's a consultation here.  They want to talk to you for minute. ""  We're here -- It's short, short notice.  We have a big Easter-egg hunt on Saturday  for the Hoboken Family Alliance.  -This Saturday? -Yes.  We thought it would be really great  if we could get somebody in town to help us  do something really big and special.  We know you do a lot of stuff in town,  so we thought we'd give it a shot.  I know. It's just that it's --  You know, it's Easter week. I mean, it's really  it's a great cause, and the kids would really be excited  and would really love --  I love kids. I got kids of my own, you know?  -So we know you're busy. -Oh, God.  So it's basically a good cause, and I can't say no.  Is that what you're telling me?  -lf you can squeeze it in. -Yeah, of course.  You know, anything for the community.  All right. Thank you so much.  It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a great day.  I'm like, all right, I'll do an Easter bunny,  and then I'll do an Easter basket.  And I'll make, like, a little grass scene,  and I'll stick some Easter eggs around it.  Real festive. Real Easter-egg hunt.  And we'll write ""Happy Easter"" across it.  I think it'll be awesome.  So I told Daniella to make the lip part  out of modeling chocolate, and she was going on that.  So I got Mauro and Sunshine doing the Easter eggs  out of fondant and royal icing.  And then I got Remy making the base of the cake.  This is what the rabbit and eggs are gonna sit on.  I decided to go with vanilla sponge cake  layered with chocolate fudge in between.  We're talking about kids here.  You can't go wrong with vanilla and chocolate.  Everybody's pitching in, and we're cranking along.  We're trying to get this done.  Carlo's Bakery opened in 1910, okay?  It's 2009.  99 Easters we've done.  And every Easter, we make a special Italian Easter bread  called casatelli.  It's a sweet bread.  It's got Easter eggs baked right into it.  So the eggs are basically hard-boiled beforehand.  Then we put them into the dough.  Some people dye them, but we keep it old-school.  We just do them white.  We add some color with some sugar and sprinkles.  You know, the eggs and the bread,  that goes back to the old country.  It's like a tradition that you have to have that,  and it's got to be right.  And one of my favorites.  If I don't feel like I put my hands on some of this stuff,  doesn't feel like it's the holiday.  Just doesn't feel right.  You get everything in the oven, and I'm excited to go upstairs  because I want to see where the progress is.  You don't got these cakes filled yet?  MAURO: We're doing what we're doing.  We haven't stopped for two minutes. We're working.  I-I-I just  Downstairs -- We're downstairs. We're working like dogs, okay?  You got -- Sal's, like, 100 years old,  and he's moving like a maniac.  And I come up here, and people are just working  at a different pace, okay?  Come on, we got to move it a little bit.  We got to go. We got things to do.  We got to finish what we got to finish  because there is no tomorrow.  I'm rolling bread like it's the last day of my life,  like I'm going to the electric chair.  And I come up here, and it's like a cake walk.  It's Easter week. You got to spit fire.  You got to, you know,  have lightning bolts coming out of your butt.  I want everybody doing what they got to do!  I'm not playing with you! I want to see people moving!  Well, listen, I don't want to sell anything that looks burnt.  JOEY: If you don't like them, don't sell them.  LISA: To me, I don't think this looks perfect.  MARY: Buddy!  Do you think that there's a difference the way stuff looks?  I mean, what do you think?  BUDD Y: I go downstairs,  and my sisters are yelling at my brother-in-law Joey  about the way the Easter bread was baked.  If I was going to the store and buying it,  I wouldn't pick the dark one.  All right, I-I-I -- Listen!  You're right, all right? That part, you're right.  It's not burnt, but it doesn't look right.  You know, the guys downstairs  have been doing this a long time.  So my sisters are coming and yell at them,  they take it to offense.  Is all the bread like that?  JOEY: You guys want a thousand things.  You don't understand. You have to wait for the ovens.  BUDD Y: And then it becomes my problem,  and then I got to get aggravated.  And I don't want to get aggravated.  I know! You're right!  I'm not saying that you're wrong!  But I don't want to hear them! I understand!  This bunny cake is for tomorrow,  and they haven't even started sculpting the bunny's body yet.  And I'm like, ""Oh, God. What am I gonna do?""  Mauro, Remy -- Those are my go-to guys.  When I got to do something, those are the guys I look to.  And without them, I can't get nothing done.  I call them over. We're gonna sculpt the bunny.  So we'll cut those four pieces of sponge like this.  We'll stack them. Then you can shape them from there.  BUDD Y: Now, the base of this bunny cake is completely edible,  and that's what the kids are really gonna eat.  The bunny's body will be mostly edible,  with some exceptions for the support system.  Whenever you make a figure standing up,  you need a support system.  So we're gonna cut holes out so that the cakes are like rings  and slide down the doweling rods, so you have legs.  Then you screw a board down, which would be his waist.  Buttercream frosting in between acts just like glue,  and it holds everything together.  Then you got his body, then you screw a board down,  and then you got his head.  That bunny was screwed and glued,  and he wasn't going nowhere.  He jiggles, but he ain't going anywhere.  So, what's the plan for Easter? Who's cooking?  I think since it's Bart's birthday,  I want to try and do Easter dinner.  BUDD Y: So, this year, for Easter,  Grace wanted to cook Easter dinner, if you can believe that.  Grace has never cooked a holiday meal in her life.  I can cook. I never did it.  I went to your house last week.  I go, ""Damn! What, did you get a new stove?""  She says, ""No, we just never use it. ""  It should be amusing.  I might have to eat before I go,  but I'm looking forward to it.  I think youse are gonna be pleasantly surprised.  -JOEY: We'll see Sunday. -We will see.  At least the dessert will be good,  'cause I know where that's coming from.  Every year around this time, we got three birthdays.  We got Grace and Joey's daughter, Bartolina, my niece.  We got my nephew, Buddy Castano. He's Mauro and Madeline's kid.  And then we got Mama.  This year, all three of them are falling in Easter week.  So now I got three more specialty cakes to do.  I don't know what to do with myself.  Bartolina's cake -- She wanted zebra print.  I had a vision -- boom, we'll do the bottom tier zebra,  pink around the bottom, pink tier on top.  "" 13"" on top. Very sparkly. Maybe even a bow around it.  TON I: How you do that, chef? How you do that?  BUDD Y: You know, a little tag -- ""Happy Birthday, Bartolina. ""  Stars coming out of it.  I know this cake's gonna come awesome.  MAURO: Buttons here. They go one here, one here.  You're a pretty big gamer, Mario.  So for Buddy Castano, I'm like, ""Hey, Mauro.  What do you think your son, Buddy, is into?""  And he's like, ""Oh, all he does is play these gaming systems. ""  I'm like, ""Good. We're gonna make him a gaming cake.  We're gonna make it the Buddy Box. ""  Right in the middle, you said, chef?  MAURO: Yes, sir.  BUDD Y: So the concept behind the Buddy Box  is to make the bottom console out of cake,  and we're gonna cover it in black fondant.  Then we're gonna make a remote control  out of modeling chocolate.  And we're gonna make the headset out of modeling chocolate.  The steamer melts the fondant just a tiny bit,  which helps things stick and gives it a nice, shiny finish.  I knew that putting ""Buddy Box"" on it, he would go nuts.  M y mother's favorite flower is tulips.  I'm like, how about a flowerpot cake with all tulips in it?  How's that?  BUDD Y: Looks like a pot.  We sculpted the clay pot out of cake.  And then I used  chocolate crunchies in it to look like dirt.  All those flowers are made out of gum paste,  and they're all edible.  I know my mother, and I knew she was gonna love that cake.  I'm back.  You know, it's a crazy Easter week.  We're busy.  Sometimes you need a little bit of fun.  You need a little bit of boost.  And I says, "" I'm gonna put Frankie outside  in a bunny costume, passing out brownies. ""  It was hard to find a costume, but I found one.  -We even got some vegetables. -[ Laughs .]  Cuzino.  -FRANKI E: What? -Come over here.  FRANKI E: Oh, my God. Stop breaking my balls.  I'm trying to work here. What do you need?  Go in the bathroom and put this on.  What do you want me to do with this?  All right, and then when you're done,  you're gonna hand out samples outside dressed as the bunny,  as the Easter Bunny.  I ain't putting that on.  I'll wear the bow tie. I'll wear the ears.  You got to put the bunny outfit on.  I ain't putting the bunny outfit on.  You can't go with your white thing on.  So I had to tell him it was for charity.  Come on, you got to take one for the team, cuzino!  I've taken plenty for the team!  Cuzino! For charity! It's for charity!  -MAURO: It's for the kids. -It's for kids.  If it's for kids, I'll do it!  If it's for your personal amusement and to break my balls,  I ain't doing it!  You think I would do that to you?  No, not you!  It's for kids! Put the costume on!  -You swear it's for kids? -It's for kids!  I think that'll be hilarious,  just seeing him dressed up as the Easter Bunny.  FRANKI E: Somebody's gonna pay for this.  -[ Laughter .] -Somebody's gonna pay for this!  Hey, it's for kids. It's for kids!  BUDD Y: ""Happy Easter, Carlo's. "" Remember.  [ Laughter .]  How's it going, buddy? Come on.  Happy Easter from Carlo's.  [ Laughter .]  And it was so funny seeing Frankie  dressed up as the Easter Bunny,  giving out samples, saying ""Happy Easter. ""  If my father could only see me now.  Would you like a brownie, sir?  Enjoy. Help yourself.  We got to go. We got to bang this stuff out.  We got to go back on the Easter eggs.  We got to set up for the store.  It's go time, baby. It's go time.  So me and Remy go to town piping on this Easter Bunny.  We're using royal icing because it dries stiff.  That'll make M r. Bunny look nice and furry.  So here's the problem.  We got to work fast  because the royal icing takes a while to dry.  But the longer this sits out,  the warmer the buttercream on the inside gets,  and it doesn't hold together as well.  But you know what, Remy?  It's already starting to get hard.  All right, let's finish.  WOMAN: Who's next?  I'm making baked macaroni, okay?  Never made baked macaroni in my life.  M y brothers and sisters  are always teasing me about my cooking abilities.  And to a certain extent, I guess they're right.  But because it was Bart's birthday, I knew it was my turn.  I had to step up to the plate  and cook Easter dinner for my family,  which was gonna be a crazy thing.  And don't make fun of me, okay?  You better not cook the pasta all the way.  Al dente.  Wait, I have to cook the pasta first?  It's baked macaroni. It cooks in the oven, no?  No, you have to boil it first.  I've never cooked for 30 people in my life.  It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.  I am definitely in over my head. Over my head.  Everyone eat before they go.  BUDD Y: Bunny time, baby. It's bunny time.  While I'm doing this cake,  it's always figuring things out, you know?  You don't make bunny cakes every week.  They look good. Maybe a little bigger, if anything.  I got Remy making the bunny ears and arms  out of modeling chocolate.  They're molded around chopsticks and dipped into coconut.  Danny's making a basket out of pound cake.  We're gonna cover it with a basket weave  made out of fondant.  -That's a girl? -Yeah, we made it a girl.  Give me that cake. The basket.  I'm gonna finish it off with a bow tie  and airbrush some pink food coloring.  I'm gonna put some jelly beans, some Easter eggs.  We're gonna use some pastel colors.  You know, it's got to feel very Eastery.  Somebody cut me ""Happy Easter. ""  At the end of the day, I called my team over,  and we looked at it, and we loved it.  I mean, it was really, really an awesome cake.  -WOMAN: It's beautiful. -BUDD Y: Everybody likes it?  -Beautiful. -MAN: It says Easter.  BUDD Y: All right, we got to get it in the fridge right away  because this bunny's been sitting out way too long,  and he needs to get hard.  Let's go.  Bye, bunny.  Go low, go low.  Put it in your hands. Easy, easy, easy, easy.  There's nothing as freaky  as seeing one of your cakes wobble like that.  Watch the arm. Hold that arm.  Hold the arm.  Don't wheel. Just go -- No, no, no, no.  Put it where it's got to go.  Mauro, stay with the arm.  I mean, that bunny in the fridge tonight --  I don't know if I'm gonna get any sleep.  I'm really worried about that bunny.  I just hope that he makes it.  Happy Easter.  BUDD Y: It's Easter, and the store is packed.  I mean, you know, jam-packed.  Take care. Happy Easter. Happy Easter. Take care.  And I see a lot of my old-timers, a lot of my friends.  A lot of people that I haven't seen in a long time.  And it makes everything so worth it.  -Bye-bye. -Okay.  BUDD Y: So it's the morning of the Easter-egg hunt,  and I got to deliver this cake.  Come on, Danny. Let's go.  Help me grab the cake. Let's go.  I open the refrigerator. I go in.  I look at the back of this cake, and my heart just drops.  Oh [bleep.]  STRETCH: Oh, my gosh. Ridiculous.  The bunny's fur fell off.  STRETCH: I'm sorry.  BUDD Y: The royal icing in the refrigerator  just doesn't dry properly.  We're gonna pick it up.  What am I gonna do?  That looks like it peeled right off.  And I realize I got to scrape the whole bunny down, basically.  I got to take the eyes off, take the face off,  scrape the bunny down, and basically start over again.  I just can't even believe this happened.  Give me some shaved coconut now.  Remy, stop that. Come over here.  They're expecting me with this cake before the Easter-egg hunt.  I got to be there.  GRACE: So, today is the big day -- Easter --  and I have to cook dinner for 30 people.  And cooking is not my thing.  I just looked around,  and I didn't know where to begin or what to do.  I was running out of counter space.  I was running out of oven space.  -[ Alarm beeping .] -The fire alarms went off.  I'm, like, trying to flag out the smoke.  M y family was coming, and nothing was ready.  The clock is ticking. I got to get this cake done.  I don't want to disappoint these kids.  I get everybody together,  everybody working on the cake, and we banged it out.  I mean, that only took 10 minutes.  That was pretty amazing.  Need some coconut to go, guys.  Come on. Let's pack this up!  We stick the cake in the truck.  Slide it in, Danny. Straight.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I close the lid.  To deliver this cake to the Easter-egg hunt,  I drove very, very carefully.  You know, I did not want to hit no bumps.  I wanted a direct route.  I didn't want to take any chances.  I really didn't want to disappoint these kids.  We get to the park.  You know, we're just in the nick of time.  [ Cheering .]  As soon as we got there, alls I heard was, ""Wow!""  All the kids were going nuts.  I mean, it was -- It was such a touching moment.  It just made everything so worth what I do.  And I was just happy to be there.  -Thank you! -Thank you!  Thank you, kids. Happy Easter.  Aah!  I got to go home. I got to get changed.  I got to get over to Grace's because everybody's waiting  to have Easter dinner.  It's a little smoky in here.  GRACE: Yeah, we had a couple fires, for real.  Hello! Happy Easter!  So, you know, I walk into the kitchen,  and I could see that Grace is way in over her head.  How we doing, Grace?  You need some help?  Let your brother help you a little.  The ham should be done. How long has that been in?  M y family and me -- We might fight, we might argue.  But the bottom line is, we love each other.  We're family.  GRACE: All right, everyone sit down.  May God bless us. Another Easter together.  Many more in the future.  -Salute. -Salute.  And I'll never do it again!  -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah.  -[ Laughter .] -MARY: Good job.  BUDD Y: Dinner wasn't horrible.  Who wants pasta?  Her baked macaroni was dry like her elbows.  -I have three trays of this. -MARY: It's delicious.  BUDD Y: I was proud that she made the effort and she tried.  So, after we finished Grace's great meal,  I'm like, ""This is the perfect time.  Let me go grab the birthday cakes. ""  MAMA: Oh, tulips!  BUDD Y: And everybody's just in awe.  MAMA: Oh, thank you!  BUDD Y: Happy birthday.  They were totally floored by it. They loved it.  Everybody was, you know, going crazy.  I want the three of youse to go blow out your candles.  Happy birthday, everybody.  One, two, three! Go!  [ Cheering .]  At the end of the week, it was a great Easter,  it was a great birthday, it was a great time.  I love my family, I love everybody,  and I'm waiting for next year.  -Eat the dirt. -It's good.  [ Laughs .]"
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Dude!  It's the start of the wedding season.  Everybody around here has got to be organized  so we can get everything done.  -That's not our cake. -STRETCH: That's not your cake?  -No. -No.  BUDD Y: These guys wanted a cake  the size of a roulette table and wheel for Saturday.  Are they nuts?  You got to do this cake,  or you're putting me in a bad situation.  You weren't standing here watching them?!  I get yelled at 'cause of everybody else!  We're screwed. We don't have a backup plan.  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   Come on, guys. This is it.  It's the start of the wedding season.  You know, we probably have 45 wedding cakes this weekend.  That's a lot of wedding cakes.  You know, the wedding-cake process  is a long line of people who get involved  and touch a wedding cake.  It's just not me doing all the work.  Everybody around here has got to be organized  so we can get everything done.  You have no idea what we're in store for.  They are just gonna come after us,  cake after cake after cake,  and we just have to take them down one at a time.  'Cause if we don't, we're gonna be in big trouble.  Let's get cracking.  I n addition to all these wedding cakes I've got,  I also got a big specialty cake this week  for a client you really can't say no to.  So, uh, what's the occasion?  Well, we have one of the guys at the club,  he's gonna be nominated as man of the year,  so we want to get a special cake made up for him.  How do you get nominated to be man of the year?  You know, he does a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  He helps the community.  You know, he's the boss. He's the boss.  It's got to be big. Maybe like in a casino theme.  Like a roulette wheel. Has to be authentic.  The numbers put perfectly in the right order, in sequence,  Really almost like you're at --  Like you're not gonna know it's a cake.  You're gonna know it's like a roulette wheel,  and you're actually playing there.  You got to do this cake,  or you're putting me in a bad situation.  I definitely want to do the right thing by you guys,  so I'm gonna try my --  try my best to get this started and do it right.  So I'm gonna go big on this thing.  I'll make a long, green roulette table  with all the numbers and everything.  And you got to have the wheel.  It's gonna look like wood on the outside,  and the inside is gonna spin.  Ladies and gentlemen, place your bets.  The most important part was  to get the wheel in the middle spinning.  And I know I need, like, a lazy Susan or a turntable in there.  We're gonna cover that in pound cake.  That's what I use when I got to sculpt tricky stuff.  We're gonna carve it down to a cone shape  so it looks like a real wheel.  -Cut a 13-inch hole out. -13 for sure?  BUDD Y: Mauro is gonna get started on shaping  the outside of the wheel.  We cut the vanilla sponge cake and stack the layers.  Then we ice it with buttercream.  We got to give the buttercream time to set  before we put the fondant on it.  -I'll be right back. -Okay.  -Hi. -Hi.  -Um, I'm here to pick up a cake. -Okay.  -Cream-puff cake. -Sure.  Guys, do you have a cream-puff cake ready upstairs --  ""Happy Birthday, Mom""?  JOEY: What cream-puff cake? We ain't got a slip for that.  You didn't do any cream-puff cakes today?  Well, you guys have to make this cake now.  The lady's here to pick it up.  I mean, it was for 11:00 pickup,  and now it's not ready.  Help me look for this slip,  because, Mary, they said that they didn't do  any cream-puff cakes today,  and this lady's here to pick up this cake.  She has a receipt.  BUDD Y: We get hundreds of cake orders every week.  So we write a slip for every cake order.  We'll do the French cream, some fresh strawberries.  BUDD Y: That's what's telling you what's inside the cake,  how many people, what it's for, what's gonna happen.  Whatever that slip says is law.  Once the order is written up,  it goes into a slot by what day we got to make it.  After the cake is made, the slip goes underneath the cake.  That slip is supposed to go with the cake on delivery  all the way till the cake is put on the table.  Oh, wow.  The slip is huge.  This isn't some kind of computerized system.  We're old-school.  We've been doing it this way for a hundred years,  and it works  MARY: Hurry up and send it down  'cause the lady is missing her party.   most of the time.  Okay, the cake is ready. It looks beautiful.  [ I ntercom beeps .]  -MARY: Buddy? -What?  All the water's brown.  Tell Sal. Tell Sal not to use any water.  Nobody drink any water.  Tell him not to make any mixes.  Tell him there must be a water-main break or something.  Try to find out what's going on.  All the water's brown.  Tell Sal not to use any water.  Nobody drink any water.  Tell him not to make any mixes.  Quart of water.  BUDD Y: So today we had this problem  with brown water coming out of the taps.  And I gave very specific instructions  that nobody's supposed to use the water.  But does anybody listen to me? Of course not.  -[ I ntercom beeps .] -MARY: Buddy?  You better check downstairs,  'cause I think they're using that brown water.  But didn't I say not to use the water?  Didn't I say not to --  Hey, he told me to use the water!  Was I in here? I was outside!  I said not to use the water!  You were next to me, and I show you the water!  You said go ahead, put it inside!  -BUDD Y: Look, it's brown! -It's brown, yeah!  MAN: Take it easy. Don't get excited.  BUDD Y: You want to drink it?!  And you weren't standing here watching them?!  He's the senior guy. He told him to use it!  It's not a joke, okay?! Throw it in the garbage!  Okay? Go get water! Go get some water!  All right, we throw this in the garbage. Ugh.  I mean, it's just a little thing!  Come on, guys. Let's do it.  We got to get all hands on deck for this roulette cake.  Me and Remy will fill this.  You start cutting this, okay?  But I need that other sponge, too.  Remy cuts the sponge, and we start going to work.  We lay out sheets of vanilla cake  in the shape of the table  and cover those with chocolate fudge  Lot of fudge. Delicious.   and another layer of vanilla cake  covered in buttercream icing.  The whole thing gets covered in green fondant  so it looks just like a roulette table.  I started icing up the wheel.  I sent Tone-Tone to cut out the little numbers,  you know, for the board.  Those numbers are cut from rolled-out fondant.  And then he puts them on red and black fondant circles  to make the roulette markers.  I had Mauro figuring out the way  all the numbers were gonna go on the wheel.  After we cut out the little squares,  I had Daniella painting the numbers with a brush,  with an edible, silver paint.  Then we started painting the outer part of the wheel.  To get the mahogany wood finish that we go for,  we take the gel color -- yellow and brown --  and we kind of just paint with a fan brush,  and we get the wood grain in it,  you know, so that it's a little streaky.  Once we get the table covered and done,  we can start building the wheel.  If we did our job right,  this thing should spin just like a roulette wheel.  -We only need two quarts. -FRANKI E: Help me with the door.  -Dude! -I'll help you.  -You'll help me? -Yeah, I'll help you.  What the hell was that for?  'Cause you got me in trouble, too.  -I got you in trouble? -Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I'm the one that had to go get water  'cause you guys screwed up!  He screwed up, not me.  I don't care who screwed up. I'm getting tired of this.  I get yelled at 'cause of everybody else.  Last time, it was the sugar. They did the count wrong.  This time, it's the water.  Why do I always get blamed for stuff?  Somebody's got to get the blame. It ain't me.  Make sure you don't brew no coffee, Madeline.  Make sure you brew no coffee.  No, we're not gonna brew any. Should we get bottled water?  Thank you.  This water's clear. This water is clear.  They're saying that the water is usable.  They had to change a valve or something.  That's why it was brown.  But they said it's not because it's dirty.  BUDD Y: So the brown water was just a temporary thing.  But it was still a big distraction,  and we all got to focus.  I got to jump from one complicated cake  to the next complicated cake.  And I have to be focused on one thing,  turn it off for a second,  go to another cake, and focus on that.  Come on. What is this, coffee break?  Let's go.  Get the molds out. Let's rock 'n' roll.  Ain't got all day.  This cake is a special cake. It's for two grooms.  And I think these two guys are gonna love it.  The concept of this cake was old movie theater --  gold leafage, you know, red walls, and stuff like that.  And that's really what I wanted to do.  To match the theater,  I covered the cake in dark-red fondant,  and then I add gold lace.  The next step what I have to do is take fondant and gum paste  and mix it together and put it in a lace press mold.  Go down and pull.  Bella. Beautiful.  And then you have to cut it out in the shape that you want it,  which is time-consuming.  Gonna take these lace appliques,  and we're gonna paint them in an edible gold paint.  And I start to put them on the cake.  And there's really not a right or wrong.  I have to put them on till I see my vision coming through.  'Cause this cake is so different,  and it's just so gonna fit in the movie theater,  like that old red-and-gold feel to it,  so I'm really happy with it.  We're gonna start on this cherry-blossom cake.  It's a five-tier monster covered in cherry blossoms.  So this cherry-blossom cake is one of my favorite cakes.  You know, very clean-lined, iced perfectly, white fondant.  Start rolling.  And I use chocolate-fondant branches,  and I kind of scatter them all up the cake.  As I put the branches up the cake, it's my vision.  It's what I want to see.  The branches kind of like  majestically climbed up the cake,  and it looked awesome.  The hardest part of this cake is definitely to make the flowers.  Handmade gum-paste cherry blossoms, okay,  which are 100% edible.  It's painstaking work.  You know, there's a lot of little details in it.  Okay, so you got one down, 350 to go.  -350? -[ Laughs .]  [ Sighs .]  BUDD Y: While Toni paints all those flowers,  I want to get back on the roulette cake.  We'll cut a circle out and just put it on top  and then paint that wood grain.  As I'm making this cake, I'm saying to myself,  I don't want to disappoint these guys.  I got to make this cake right.  Easy.  I get the wheel in place, and then all of a sudden  The cake is hitting here.  You got to lift this. Quick.  MAURO: Not all the same. Know what I'm saying?  -Maybe slid when you -BUDD Y: It's hitting there.  MAURO: I'm telling you, it's the numbers.  BUDD Y: It's not the numbers.  23-- Look how much lower that is.  BUDD Y: See, it's right here that it's hitting.  It's just got to go a smidge this way.  Maybe you should just shave that.  And I had to just center the wheel so that it would go right.  And all of a sudden, she starts spinning,  and I am like, ""Whew. Thank God. ""  Come on. Let's do this.  I'm going as fast as possible.  I don't want to eff this up. You know?  BUDD Y: Mauro's almost done piecing together  the grid pattern on the roulette table.  Tony's using food coloring  to finish up the details on the gum-paste chips.  We just got to get the number markers in place on the layout,  and we're almost there.  How many roulette wheels spin like that?  Look at that. Look at that. Pick a number, pick a number.  It's all edible. This is the real deal.  I'm putting in my favorite number -- 31 black.  All right, guys. Good job.  It's time for the best part of making a cherry-blossom cake.  Once I start sticking those little flowers everywhere,  man, the cake just comes to life.  It looks like the tree in front of your house  is blooming right on the cake.  All right. All done.  I really like this cake. This is a sexy cake.  -WOMAN: Looks good. -BUDD Y: Very sexy.  I was really happy with the way this cake came out.  It was a beautiful cake.  When Stretch comes into the bakery,  his first job is to look over the delivery list.  After he knows where he's going, he's supposed to get the cakes,  make sure that the slips coordinate  with the delivery list, and go to the delivery.  Ooh. This is a heavy one.  BUDD Y: If something goes out of place,  it's not on the right date, you could be in big trouble.  -Got it? -Yeah.  BUDD Y: Especially during wedding season, I mean,  Stretch can have 25, 30 deliveries in a day.  STRETCH: Hopefully everything goes smooth  with this five-tier in the back.  It seems pretty sturdy.  As long as they keep it cold, it should be all right.  This is where all the bumps are.  [ Thudding .]  This is the cake for tonight.  No. That cake is not for tonight.  Our wedding cakes are here already.  -You sure? -Positive.  Do you know if anybody ordered a cake that's similar to this?  I think they have one ordered for tomorrow.  Really? Do you guys have room in the fridge?  -No. -All right.  DANN Y: Hello? What's up?  So I have a cake here.  Apparently it's not for tonight. It's for tomorrow.  Yeah, well, I didn't see the slip.  BUDD Y: You got to look at the slip and see the dates.  And he didn't do it.  This is a mix-up  which definitely could have been avoided.  MAURO: What did they say at the Westmount?  He was like, "" It's not for today,  and I got no room in my fridge. ""  -What did you do? Bring it back? -Yeah.  Buddy seemed a little pissed, but  There's nothing you can do about it, my friend.  It'll be okay.  I guess I'll bring it back there tomorrow.  I mean, a mix-up like this makes us look  like a bunch of morons, and we're really not.  DANN Y: We don't want no more mistakes today, okay? Please.  STRETCH: I'll do my best, Danny. I'll do my best.  You know how to get to this place, right?  BUDD Y: After the mix-up with the cherry-blossom cake,  Stretch needed to deliver the wedding cake  to the two grooms at the old theater.  Hey, hey, hey.  I have your cake, actually.  Right over here if you'd like to take a look at it.  -Sure. Let's go. -Let's go.  Um  -That's not our cake. -STRETCH: That's not your cake?  -No. -No.  What was the cake that you ordered supposed to look like?  -Red and gold. -It was a red-and-gold cake.  Oh, okay.  BUDD Y: How do you mess this up, Stretch?  Like, it's a theater. It's red. It's gold.  Like, it doesn't fit, this purple-floral cake.  But then again, Stretch don't read the slips.  If he would have read the slips,  it would have said red-and-gold cake.  This isn't a red-and-gold cake. This is a purple cake.  Let's just get this one out and get the real one in.  Sounds good to me. All right.  All right. Let's make it happen. Thank you.  STRETCH: Twice in one day? Really?  I'm starting to see little flaws in the slip system  and how, you know, one little thing can lead to another.  And, you know, there's a lot of other people  who are gonna get blamed besides Stretch.  Stretch was able to get the right cake  and make the people happy.  -This is my happy face. -[ Laughs .]  Thank you. Good save.  -High five. -Nailed it!  BUDD Y: We got one last delivery today.  But I know this one's gonna go right  because I'm gonna deliver it myself.  All right, let's go, let's go.  We got to get this cake to the local social club,  but this thing's a monster.  -Got it? -FRANKI E: Yeah, I got it.  BUDD Y: Let's keep it nice and low.  You got to get your hand up here.  -I'm gonna let go of the door. -BUDD Y: Easy, easy. Ah!  Lay it on the railing. Stay on the railing.  Take a deep breath. This is gonna be all in one shot.  Slide it down. Slide it down.  Keep it up a little higher, Mauro.  Go. Go, go, go.  No, no, no. Wait.  Danny, you're gonna come around to my side.  I'm gonna pass it to you.  Get it down. Down, down, down, down.  Get out, Remy. Get out.  You got it. You got it.  Yeah, but I lost my friggin' hand.  BUDD Y: Open the door.  DANN Y: Door's open.  BUDD Y: Frankie's end in first.  I got to bring this cake to a social club,  and I'm like, "" I'm taking my big boys with me. ""  I'm taking Mauro. I'm taking Danny.  I'm taking Frankie. You never know.  If they don't like the cake, I got the right crew with me.  I'm pulling up to the place.  I see guys sitting outside,  giving me looks like, ""You looking at me?""  Really, really old-school kind of guys.  So I open up the back of the truck,  and I'm like, ""Whew. ""  The cake got here in one piece. No problem.  I was really happy with that.  DANN Y: Go on the other side.  Wow. Ready?  Watch your step over here, all right?  The first two guys I see are the guys who ordered the cake.  -We did a good job? -Excellent, excellent.  You like it? It looks good?  Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.  I didn't want to let you down.  And they're like, ""You did good. You did good. ""  I'm like, ""Whew. Thank God.  That'll get these two guys off my back. ""  -Watch this door. -Watch.  Nice and easy.  Okay. We're in business.  BUDD Y: Okay, guys. Easy.  So we get the cake inside. We get it up on the table.  And the boss is playing cards.  They call him over.  They say, ""Oh, come look at the cake. ""  He's looking like he's buying a new car,  making sure that there's no scratches on it.  M y heart is racing.  Ba-doom, ba-doom, ba-doom, ba-doom, ba-doom.  -You like it? -Fantastic cake.  I'm glad.  I was like, ""Whew! Thank God. ""  After that moment, everything changed.  They welcomed me in like one of the family.  Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you.  It was a great feeling.  You know what?  It's the end of the week, I did all my cakes,  and the main thing is I was happy with them.  I know we're not the most organized  operation in the world.  But everybody got their cakes this week,  they all loved them,  and, most importantly, I didn't get whacked.  I get that breather for like one day,  and then chaos starts again."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Oh, my God. It's so ugly. Are you serious?  BUDD Y: This bride is crazy!  No, don't do no more.  I don't appreciate what you just did.  That is exactly not what I wanted.  I wanted to make it high. You told me stay lower.  I mean, I got to worry about everything?!  -We got to do this cake. -I'm not doing it.  We ain't doing another cake, so let him handle it.  All right, if I say we're making a cake,  we're gonna make the cake whether we like it or not.  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   It's wedding season, communion season,  graduation season, cake season.  I got cakes coming out of my ears this week.  So I'm working on this wedding cake,  and the bride's mother has been a great customer for years.  A couple of months ago,  she came in to plan her daughter's wedding cake.  And where are we having the reception?  Alpine Country Club.  Beautiful. Very nice venue.  It is nice. It's not what she wanted.  We were gonna get married in the desert with no one watching.  BUDD Y: Sounds cool.  With a camel. But I don't do camel riding so good.  We weren't gonna invite you, though.  Oh, thanks. I'm only the mom.  [ Laughs .]  I deal with 30, 40 brides a week.  You're bound to get a couple pain in the asses.  -This is your dream wedding. -No, it's not.  I got married in City Hall. I never had a dream wedding.  ALISON: This is the wedding you never had.  SUELLEN: I never wanted.  They couldn't agree on nothing. It was like night and day.  But she doesn't make any arrangements.  I have to take care of everything.  She doesn't even talk to me now. It's all text.  Then you start crying. She gets loud. She hangs up.  BUDD Y: Let's get back to the cake.  It could be different colors. What colors were you thinking?  Some nice white fondant.  Black.  She wants black. Black's not for weddings.  I'd rather make it a little bit more like funeral-esque,  -maybe like calla lilies. -I like calla lilies.  Death of my parents controlling me.  -[ Tires screech .] -[ Laughs .]  So, if the cake doesn't work out, can we throw it at her?  BUDD Y: Throw on me?  -No, at her. -BUDD Y: Oh, at her.  I want to make something that youse are both gonna love  and that you're both gonna be happy.  For the amount of guests you're having,  I would say probably four tiers.  We'll do it in an ivory.  We're gonna do the draping, compliment Mom,  and then we're going to do the calla lilies.  -Oh, look at that. -ALISON: Looks really nice.  Congratulations. It was a pleasure.  We'll make a beautiful cake, okay?  If you have any other questions, let me know.  M y plan of attack is to fill the cake, cover it in fondant, okay,  and then lay the drapes on it.  I could actually fold the fondant into pleats,  'cause it's so pliable.  Laying drapes on is actually a technique that I love.  The beauty of draping is letting things fall.  Let gravity take effect.  I steam the cake a little bit, and poof, I lay it on,  and I just let it open.  It just opens just enough.  And I was so happy with the way the cake was draped.  We hand-made all those calla lilies,  and then I had to start sticking them on.  So I start sticking them on, and as I'm looking at it,  the cake is getting nicer and nicer.  And I thought that I was gonna make the bride happy  by just having the calla lilies.  -What do you think? -MAURO: She's definitely  gonna like this, mother and daughter.  BUDD Y: Yep.  Hey, I want to talk to you about something.  Girl contacted me from St. Joseph's Hospital  in Patterson.  She asked me if we would be interested in doing something.  It's a kid's hospital, so I want to do whatever she wants.  For the kids, anything.  She has a logo, so I was thinking logo on a sheet cake.  Couple sheet cakes for calls like that, no problem.  I'll call her back. I'll let her know we'll do something.  BUDD Y: We just got to make a couple sheet cakes.  We're gonna knock them out in an hour. Not a big deal at all.  It's gonna be like no problem.  What?  Buddy. May I help you?  Hi, Karen. How are you?  3-D replica, huh? Wow.  So this cake's got to feed 500 people, too?  KAREN: Yeah.  Send me the logo to my e-mail,  and I'll try to look at the plane  and then try to get an idea from that.  KAREN: Thank you so much. Bye-bye.  BUDD Y: Joey!  Hey, you told me about that charity thing,  and I said no problem because it's for charity.  But she calls me up, and she says it's 500 people.  She wants a 3-D airplane, this and that.  You know, it's gonna be tough.  Where am I gonna have the time to make this?  This has got to be a big cake. This cake is gonna be huge.  We'll cut it out to look like a cloud.  I look at the logo, and once I look at it,  boom, it pops in my head what I'm gonna do.  The bottom cake was going to be, like, clouds.  And then on top of it, we were gonna have the biplane.  And then coming out the back would have been a little banner,  and it kind of wraps around the front  where it says, ""St. Joseph's Hospital. ""  You cut the board.  -You get the sponge. -I'll start trimming it.  Remy will start the plane. Let's get in gear.  Let's go, let's go, let's go. You got to shake it.  I said, "" Mauro, you're gonna cut out the sky pattern  from sheet cakes. ""  It's gonna be filled with chocolate ganache,  fresh strawberries, and vanilla cake.  I mean, it's gonna taste delicious.  -Buddy? -What?  I have an Alison here. She's getting married tomorrow,  and she wanted to come in and check on her cake.  Are you serious? She wants to check on her cake?  LISA G.: Yeah.  Okay. Send her up.  LISA G.: Okay, hon, you could go right up.  BUDD Y: This isn't something that happens often,  but when it does, I'm happy to have my brides come see my work.  Hi. I just want to see my wedding cake.  You getting excited? You're here the day before your wedding.  -Can I see it? -Of course.  I'm gonna get it. Let me pull it out for you.  Come check it out.  Oh, my God. It's so ugly.  -[ Scoffs .] -Are you serious?  Yeah. This is  This is kind of what we said.  I said, "" I'm gonna do the calla lilies.  I'm gonna do the draping down it. ""  It looks just really traditional.  I'm not sure if I came across as like super-traditional  or if you got the wrong idea or if my mom paid you extra money  to make it extra boring or what was going on.  But this wasn't really what I had in mind.  And the cake was actually one of the very important parts to me.  l-I mean, I  All right, so do you just want to, like, make a whole new cake?  -For tomorrow? -There's really no color here.  I told you I was wearing purple shoes, like, blue soles.  No, I know, I know. But you're gonna have to give me a second.  Let me go talk to my team and see what I can do.  I walk out of the room for a second, and what's going on?  She goes, she grabs the piping bags  and starts squirting my cake.  I don't appreciate what you just did.  You come into my bakery, you squirt icing all over this cake.  I mean, I don't know.  I don't even know what to say.  I don't know how else to spell color.  Listen, I know that, but that's not what we agreed on.  It's inspiration.  So you want me to bring this to your wedding tomorrow?  -Do you want to show this -- -No, I want a new one.  You want a new one?  I should bring you this, because you ruined this.  I was giving you an art lesson.  You know what? I'm gonna be nice now.  Just do me a favor and go, okay?  ALISON: I look forward to the cake. It's gonna be awesome.  -I think you get it now. -Yeah, I get it.  -ALISON: Bye. Bye. -All right. Bye.  BUDD Y: M y first thought is, I ain't making this cake.  I'm so aggravated.  Aggravated? We have a lot of work, too.  We ain't nowhere near finished today.  BUDD Y: After I thought about it,  I'm like, "" I at least owe it to the mother  and let her know why there wasn't gonna be a cake  at her daughter's wedding tomorrow. ""  This is Buddy from Carlo's Bakery.  I'm like, ""You don't even know what your daughter just did. ""  She totally, totally ruined the cake.  I don't think I'm gonna be able to do a cake for you.  The next thing I know, the mother's bawling her eyes out  over the phone to me saying how sorry she was  and how she'd pay for another cake.  You're a good customer,  and I want to do the right thing for you.  Take care.  All right. Listen.  -Danny. -DANN Y: Yeah?  Come on. We got to do this cake.  -What cake? -For this pain in the ass.  Unh-unh. I'm not doing it.  She can have that cake over there. I'm not doing it.  You should have been like, ""All right, you need to stop. ""  -I did! I did! -Who acts like that?  We ain't doing another cake, so let him handle it.  You should deliver that cake to her.  She has a little tantrum because she didn't get what she wants,  so now we have to be here all night long.  All right, listen. I gave the mother my word.  All right, if I say we're making a cake,  we're gonna make the cake whether we like it or not.  At that point, I felt like I had something to prove to her.  I wanted to prove to that girl that I was a better person.  Sunshine, we're gonna cut some colorful flowers.  So, yeah, I get it now. She wants something different.  This new wedding care is gonna be a five-tier square cake,  offset tiers, tiny little quilt pattern on it  with little silver pearls in between each quilt.  And I'm gonna cover the cake in bright sugar flowers.  Let's do peonies, orange and pink.  Let's do hydrangeas,  -like a limy, sage green. -Okay.  BUDD Y: So I got the girls working on the flowers.  They're painting all the flowers.  -WOMAN: All that work. -We're gonna be here all night.  BUDD Y: Me and Danny are working on the quilting.  Quilting is something that I figured out  a long, long time ago.  Basically, what you go to do is do a crisscross.  You lay the ruler across it, and you make these lines.  And then you go the other way,  and you get, like, a quilt pattern on top.  The crazy bride's wedding is tomorrow,  so we really got to crank this cake out.  I got to go back and check on the biplane cake,  because that's coming up.  Let me ask you a question.  Where are you gonna put ""St. Joseph's Hospital""?  Right here. Right here.  BUDD Y: Should have came up higher.  This is exactly not what I wanted.  I told you, Maur. I told you it was too low.  I wanted to make it high. You told me stay lower.  BUDD Y: Looking at this, if you want to stand it up,  the thing's got to be this tall.  You got to bend it.  Now, the only other thing we can do  is use this as a resting place for the banner.  But this should be more chopped.  I thought I was crystal clear on what I wanted.  I guess I got to be on top of everything.  Everybody's busy.  We're multitasking, filling out these orders like crazy.  What about this order?  And Frankie -- He's got a simple cupcake order to fill,  the customer's waiting, and he's not done yet!  They're waiting for this freaking order!  -The order's done! -Frankie, I mean, everything --  It's busy!  I mean, I got to worry about everything?  You got to put cannolis in this box.  I know! I was gonna fill them downstairs!  -I don't have a bag up here! -Where are you gonna stuff them?  Look. Where are you gonna put cannolis in this box?  -We got to be on top of things! -They're here an hour early.  -What do you want from me? -BUDD Y: What do you want?!  I want to know where I'm going next.  You don't know where you're going yet?!  You are that dumb that you don't know where you're going yet?  I don't feel like getting yelled at after last week.  -But everything you do! -There was something last week  that wasn't supposed to be there,  so I thought I should double-check with you.  BUDD Y: Oh, Stretch  And I got Stretch in my ear.  I'm like, ""Are you kidding me, Stretch?  I'm gonna throw you out the window. ""  You are the epitome of bad delivery guys.  STRETCH: Bad delivery guys? You sure about that?  I've been around for an awful long time  to be a bad delivery guy.  Get out of here. I don't want to see you two.  FRANKI E: I'll go do your consultations, too.  Go!  -I'm gonna stand right here. -Okay.  -Get him to stand right there. -Okay.  As soon as he's there, open the door and just move.  He's gonna get whacked.  [ Chuckles .] All right. Sounds good.  -FRANKI E: All right? -All right.  -Make sure you move. -I'm going to get him now?  Right now. I don't want to sit back here long.  I know.  I really want to get Buddy back just 'cause the past few weeks,  he's just been dumping stuff on me.  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: Stretch, you're driving me crazy.  -[ Laughs .] -STRETCH: [Bleep.]  Don't mess around!  [ Laughter .]  What's up now, Stretch?  You think that you're gonna get my people on me? I  What's wrong with you?!  And then boo-yah-ka! He got it.  You got nerve coming after me.  What happened was, Stretch went to Frankie and was like,  ""Hey, let's try to get Buddy back. ""  You think Frankie's not gonna tell me what's going on?  You mess with the bull, and you get the horns.  Okay. Playtime is over.  I got to finish up this biplane cake.  This cake has got to be perfect.  After I cut the cake and then we put the fondant banner on,  the cake actually looked really good,  but we still had a lot of work to do on it.  Remy carved pound cake for the plane's body and wings,  iced it, then covered it in bright-yellow fondant.  Let's go. Stick it on.  Once we put the plane on,  I was like, ""Wow, what a freaking cake!""  I mean, it was great. Where's the tail?  We made almost everything else out of modeling chocolate.  That's the top wing, the wheels, and the cartoon face.  We used royal icing to make everything stick together.  I think that looks good. The nose, the eyes are on.  It really came together great at the end.  You guys did a great job. I know I'm tired.  We're all tired. It's for a good cause.  I think it looks cool. I think it looks like a cartoon.  MAURO: Looks like the logo to me.  BUDD Y: At the end of the day, we did a great job.  M y team is great. We rock.  [ I mitates biplane whirring .]  Today is a big day.  It's bridezilla's wedding day  and the children's hospital charity event,  so we got two major cake deliveries.  And I'm not even done with bridezilla's cake yet.  She might have been a bridezilla,  but I want to make her happy.  So after I put the flowers on,  we had to add the little silver edible pearls  where the quilts met.  Come on, ladies. Let's go.  So I called everybody over. ""All right, come on. ""  Wherever there's a dot, you put a ball.  Those little silver pearls  actually really made that cake pop.  I n the end, the cake was great.  Listen, I know this was a real, real pain in the ass,  and I know she drove us crazy.  I appreciate all your hard work. It looks great.  It looks really nice.  Easy.  I got to make this delivery to this bridezilla  because I really want to see her reaction,  so I'm delivering it personally.  Nice and easy.  SUELLEN: Oh, my God. [ Gasps .]  Oh. Hi, Buddy.  BUDD Y: Hi, how you doing, M rs. Freeman? How are you?  Oh, good. Oh, this is beautiful.  Do you like it? Congratulations.  Thank you. I love it.  I love the bright colors. Can we eat the flowers?  BUDD Y: Of course. They're all sugar.  She was so appreciative that I even made another cake.  Especially after what happened with her coming in --  -I am so, so, so sorry. -I just hope that --  -Are you okay? -I'm totally okay.  I just want her to be happy on her day.  Ali, you want to see your cake? Alison.  -Oh, my god. -SUELLEN: Ali.  Mom kept calling Alison over to come look at the cake.  SUELLEN: Ali, you just have to take a look.  ALISON: Oh, it's beautiful.  She didn't, I think, want to give me the satisfaction.  It's so stressful.  I understand. I'm not worried.  Bridezilla's reaction was not what I hoped for,  but all the bridesmaids, the mom -- Everybody loved it.  SUELLEN: Can you believe this is all edible?  -That's amazing. -It's a work of art.  -It is. -It's a total work of art.  WOMAN: I totally thought they were real.  -I can't believe that. -BUDD Y: Thank you.  At the end of the day, I did my job.  I made her a beautiful cake.  I got to say to her fiance, good luck, brother.  [ Chuckles .] You got your work cut out for you.  Do your stuff.  -Thank you. -M y pleasure. Enjoy your day.  But you know what?  At this point, I got to deliver this biplane cake.  So, we get to the venue. It's go time. We go to go.  We got to present this cake.  Got it?  MAURO: Want to spin it, Buddy?  BUDD Y: This way, nose first.  [ Cheers and applause .]  M y God!  BUDD Y: This cake was awesome.  JOEY: There you are. Enjoy.  The cake tasted delicious.  BUDD Y: I feel that this cake was a really big success.  I was so happy with it.  What a good event. What a good cake.  Hey, come on. Fuhgeddaboudit. It was great.  -BUDD Y JR.: Hi, Daddy! -Hello! Daddy's home.  -What are you guys doing? -Hello!  BUDD Y: I've been working so hard the last couple weeks,  I feel my kids -- I haven't seen them in so long.  I miss them so much.  Ah! Give me a hug. Oh, I love you.  [ Smooches .] How's my big boy?  -Are you hungry? -BUDD Y: Oh, I am hungry.  -LISA V.: Is everyone hungry? -SOPH IA: Yeah.  LISA V.: Yes?  BUDD Y: Nothing like a home-cooked meal.  'Cause after a long day's work I look forward to this.  Hey, you know, this is what life's all about --  famiglia, you know?  That's what it's all about.  Thank you, baby.  -Love you. -I love you, too.  Bellissimo.  What does Mommy do, and what does Daddy do?  -Daddy makes cakes. -Okay.  -And Mommy cooks. -And Mommy does nothing!  -[ Laughs .] Hey! -Hey! What?!  -You do nothing! -Really?!"
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Aah!  [ Laughter .]  No way, no how!  Those cakes are not allowed in this place.  Erotic, exotic. Whatever you call them.  No way, no how!  So, what's the occasion? A wedding?  It's gonna be prom night of the living dead.  What about something like rotting flesh or anything else?  Could we have, like, pieces of limbs or anything?  I'm so far out of my element.  It's time to unveil.  [ Laughter .]  Oh, my God!  BUDD Y: This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   I just put the finishing touches on.  I think it looks cool.  You know, over the years,  we here at Carlo's Bakery have become famous  for our specialty cakes.  Your specialty cake ain't your grocery-store cake.  It's got to be to the nines detailed.  It's got to really be like, "" Is that a cake?  Is that for real?""  -You like it? -Very sexy.  BUDD Y: It's a certain breed of cakes  that you just can't go to anywhere and get.  You got to come to me to get that specialty cake.  So, we need a cake, right?  JASON: Yeah, we're looking for a cake.  We've heard that you're the man to talk to.  Best cakes around.  Yes, I am. Thank you.  So, what's the occasion? A wedding?  -Not exactly. -Not exactly.  JASON: It's a little different from a wedding, though.  It's called a zombie walk.  A gathering of people that are zombie lovers,  zombie-movie lovers.  Everybody gets together in Asbury Park, New Jersey,  and we have everyone's makeup get done  so that they look like real zombies,  and we walk through the center of town.  We'd like to have a cake,  'cause we're having a zombie prom  as our afterparty.  [ All groaning .]  It's gonna be prom night of the living dead.  We want it to really be a gruesome cake.  Really over-the-top kind of blood and guts.  Almost kind of rotting-looking, if you will.  BUDD Y: I'm so far out of my element.  I mean, I usually make these pretty things.  But they were like, ""The bloodier, the better, baby.  Bring it on. ""  All right, guys. Listen.  I just got this order for the zombie cake.  I was actually thinking of trying to rig something up  where blood could kind of like ooze out of this brain.  They're gonna eat it.  If they're dressed up as zombies  and they just had one big brain as a cake,  and they could just all go and eat the brain.  That's a little freaky, Daniella.  -It's a little freaky. -[ Laughs .]  BUDD Y: Let me ask a question.  What about something like rotting flesh or anything else?  Could we have, like, pieces of limbs or anything?  We could put all the pieces of, like, a heart  and the piece of arm on the floor, yeah.  If we had, like, half of his head open,  and then he's, like, eating his own brain.  No, they don't eat zombie brains.  They were crystal clear on that.  [ Laughs .]  BUDD Y: M y idea for the zombie cake  is to have a tombstone and then a cake that was like dirt,  and the zombie's hands and forearms and shoulders and head  is coming out like he's trying to [groans.] come out like that.  And then, you know, I wanted to have a brain in his hand  and then flesh body parts all over the cake.  Then I'm gonna build the tombstone in the back, okay?  And I'm gonna put doweling rods  and screw them in from the bottom  so that the tombstone can't fall back and forth.  Then I'm gonna do a rectangle cake for the bottom.  And go 1, 2, 3.  So, we chose red-velvet cake,  'cause it's kind of a creepy red color  that goes perfect with the blood, guts, and gore.  All right, one more layer.  We decided to go with three layers of red-velvet cake  for the ground  and 10 layers of shaped pound cake for the tombstone.  Then we dirty-iced the whole thing,  smoothed it out nice and even.  Then before we do anything else,  we got to put it in the fridge downstairs  so the icing will harden.  Who's next?  Are you being helped?  What can I get you?  -Hi. -Hi.  What kind of a consultation is it? For a wedding?  No, for a bachelorette-party cake.  Oh, fun!  I got this bachelorette cake for Tone-Tone's cousin.  That's Tone-Tone. He's my assistant.  He's a very talented cake decorator/artist.  He went to culinary school, and then I took him under my wing,  and I'm teaching him the ropes.  He's a great guy.  So, what do we think about doing something  We're not sure yet. We're gonna --  What do you call those things?  -Erotic? -Yeah. None of it!  All right, Mother. Come on.  -None of those! -I'll keep it clean.  I want to get to Heaven when I go.  Bachelorette cakes have been going on a long time  at Carlo's Bakery,  but we had to put a stop to it.  No sexy cakes. What do you call those things?  -Exotic. -Exotic.  Now, my mother's, like, one of the holiest people I know.  We will not make those cakes, no how.  That's it. I'm not making any.  None. None, none, none.  BUDD Y: So, Mama has a rule.  We don't make any sort of erotic cakes.  The only thing is, sometimes a friend asks for it,  you know, here and there,  so I got to kind of do it on the sneak.  So, what can I do for you guys?  We're here for a bachelorette-party cake.  -Ooh! -M m-hmm.  Don't let my mother hear.  -She heard. -Yeah, she heard.  -No. Really? -She said nothing erotic.  Anything I do has got to be on the sneak, like big-time.  JACLYN: The bachelorette is a little crazy.  BUDD Y: All right.  I think she's gonna like a crazy cake.  We think we want to do like a strip-club kind of scene.  All right.  -Money. -Right. Yeah, money.  You know, some G-strings, dollar bills.  I don't even know if we need G-strings.  Maybe him twirling around a G-string.  -Nude. -One of the figures.  [ Laughs .]  I really think I got the hint from these girls  of what they wanted.  They were pretty graphic. They want a raunchy cake.  Well  JACLYN: It needs to be something like --  You're gonna make me blush.  You are blushing already. Rosy cheeks.  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: So, just give me a little bit more specifics  of what we're gonna do here.  -Naked strippers. -Like this.  BUDD Y: Yeah.  Like, the strippers might be little,  but other things can't be little.  [ Laughs .]  Size matters.  Size definitely -- That's what I hear.  -Okay. -All right.  And remember, don't tell Mama, all right?  Don't worry about her.  M y vision for this bachelorette cake  is to do a stage  -Take care. -Nice to see you.   and then have some strippers,  you know, kind of like standing there, dancing around.  And, you know, make it look pretty cool.  Guess what kind of cake she wants.  It's a bachelorette-party cake,  and she wants some ""Eh, eh, eh!""  Strippers and this and that.  We got four girls up here.  I think maybe each girl should mold a guy.  And then I see Tone-Tone standing there.  And I'm like, ""You know what?""  Tone-Tone's gay, number one,  so he's probably been to a male strip club.  I'm like, number two, it's for his family.  I want him to be involved.  We're gonna change it up, okay?  Each girl's gonna get a stripper and Tone-Tone.  Tone-Tone's getting his own stripper.  It's five.  You know, they want them to be well-endowed, okay,  and they want them to be good-looking dudes, okay?  I think they should all have abs, six-packs.  Six-packs?  No kegs, then?  [ Laughter .]  So then me, Mauro, Remy --  we'll worry about the stage and how it goes.  You guys worry about the strippers.  Okay.  Give me two sheets vanilla,  and then the stage'll probably be  maybe like an eight-inch round.  I'm thinking that the back stage should be a little taller,  then it should go into a catwalk or like a step down,  then back up into a round stage.  Tone-Tone, vanilla or chocolate?  The cake is basically a vanilla cake  with a truffle-fudge filling.  All right. Cool. Give me a turntable.  I'll dirty-ice this, and then we'll cover this cake up.  I get it the way I want it.  I put the buttercream on it. I dirty-ice it.  -Is it up to par, Tone-Tone? -Yeah.  All right, Danny, then let's get the black ready,  and let's ice this up.  And then we cover it in fondant.  Uh-huh. Yeah!  While we're in fondant mode, me and Remy decide to go ahead  and take care of the zombie cake.  Let's go, Remy.  We don't usually use dull-gray fondant,  but it's gonna make this tombstone  look like the real deal.  Easy. Don't pull.  The male strippers for the bachelorette cake  are made out of modeling chocolate.  This is gonna be a little challenging,  because a lot of times when you do them,  you can put clothes on them.  So even if the body's a little lumpy,  you can put, you know, a shirt or a jacket,  and you don't even see it.  But you are gonna see the abs. You're gonna see the chest.  You're gonna see the biceps, the muscles, the package --  the whole nine.  So it all had to look pretty good.  I had the girls doing their sculptures.  I'm looking around the room, and I'm like, ""This one's good,  and that one's great, and, wow, this one. ""  Then I get to Tone-Tone's.  I'm like, ""Holy schnike.  What the hell is that, Tone-Tone?  Hey, now. How you doing?""  You're using a little bit too much modeling chocolate, man.  That stuff is expensive, bro.  If my mother-in-law ever gets a view of this stuff,  dude, you guys are gonna be -- Ooh, man!  BUDD Y: So I told Tone-Tone and the girls,  ""Work on the strippers,  but if my mother comes in, make sure you hide them. ""  VIOLET: I'm scared of Mama right now,  because she's gonna freak out,  and then she's probably gonna like look at us funny,  like, ""Why are you making an exotic --""  MAMA: What did I say?  What did I say?  That is not acceptable at Carlo's Bakery, okay?  I don't care who told you that.  Buddy's not the boss.  He may the cake boss, but he ain't the boss.  And that is not acceptable.  -No way in my place. -All right.  That's not gonna be shown.  You want to put some clothes on him?  I don't care about the muscles,  but the other stuff is not gonna be shown.  No way, no how!  It's not gonna happen, 'cause I'll come in.  I'll break it myself, all right?  WOMAN: Don't worry. She'll get over it.  Holy [bleep.]  I told him that those cakes are not allowed in this place.  Erotic, exotic. Whatever you call them.  No way, no how!  I have a bone to pick with you.  You know there are certain things that I don't want.  And I saw them make an erotic cake.  Now, that is a no-no in this place.  Youse know how I feel about those cakes!  The only reason I did it was for Tone-Tone's sister.  I don't care if it's Tone-Tone's sister,  if it's your sister,  it is not being made at Carlo's Bakery!  You are gonna respect my wishes.  What if we just make dancing guys?  Yeah. What don't you understand?  I n bathing suits.  Okay, I don't want -- Right.  -Nothing exposed. -MAMA: Nothing exposed!  Nothing.  Am I the boss?!  Who writes the checks at the end of the week?!  You.  Okay. Go ahead.  What the hell did you guys do?  You were supposed to be hiding things.  She was really mad.  She's from the old school.  She doesn't understand these kind of jokes.  She was really, genuinely offended,  and I felt horrible.  Here's what we're gonna do. Here's the plan.  -We're gonna make them -With clothes.  I put shorts on mine already.  Shorts, but they got to have something underneath.  [ Laughs .]  All right, all right, listen. That's the game plan.  Let's get back to work.  The strippers are looking great.  I mean, they're cut. They're ripped, muscles.  It looks good.  Since the strippers are in good hands with the girls,  I can get back to the zombie cake.  The challenge is to make a zombie cake, okay,  and make the head, the arms, everything edible, no Styrofoam.  That's a big challenge.  M y trick is using pound cake.  It's easier to sculpt. It holds up better.  After the pound cake is dirty-iced,  me and Remy put some greenish-gray fondant  on the head and arms to look like zombie skin,  and I get Tone-Tone making some creepy zombie hands  out of modeling chocolate.  So, my mother goes to check out a wedding cake.  She opens the door.  And boof!  Tone-Tone leaves his stripper there  with his thing sticking out.  Aah!  [ Laughter .]  What did I tell youse?!  You were supposed to cover it!  You better get him covered!  I promise. They're gonna cover him up.  They're gonna remove half of him to cover him up.  [ Laughter .]  That's it. I can't believe this.  BUDD Y: I was like, "" Mom, I didn't cover it yet.  I'm gonna cover it. ""  So I came up with an ingenious thing.  I said, ""How about we put an apron on this guy,  and then when I get there, I could take the apron off  so the girls will still be happy and get their raunchiness,  and my mother's not gonna flip out on me?""  So, while Tone-Tone puts the finishing touches  on the stripper,  I'm gonna twist together white and gray fondant  to make the stage look really glitzy.  I want to do a marbled catwalk.  So I take the twisted fondant  and run it through the sheeter a couple times.  Go from the edge.  After I do the marble on the catwalk,  I figure for the stage,  I'm gonna do, like, a checkerboard design.  Me, Christine, and Danny put water on these squares,  and we dipped them into sugar that had some sparkly effect.  So we had this white and, like, hot-pink disco color  that looked awesome.  Let's put some dollar bills on this.  You know, if I was a stripper, this is where I'd want to strip.  Look at this cake, and I tell you,  it was one of the best cakes we ever made.  I mean, it was hilarious.  I love all the money. That's the perfect ending touch.  Okay, let me see.  I like the colors,  and, I mean, the muscle guys, I have no problem with.  The stage is the best part of it!  BUDD Y: The strippers were all covered up,  and to get Mama's approval really makes me happy.  It's go time.  I want to deliver this cake personally  because I met with the girls and it's Tone-Tone's family  and I really want to see the reaction to this cake.  Watch your step.  [ Screaming .]  [ Cheering .]  It's time to unveil the main attraction.  [ Cheering .]  This cake really went over the edge.  This cake lit these girls up.  You would have thought that I'd brought strippers in there live.  [ Cheering .]  I thought my cake was awesome, and I enjoyed all the strippers.  I think Buddy did a phenomenal job.  I couldn't have asked for a better cake.  Congratulations. Lots of love to you.  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you very much.  WOMAN: Thank you.  I got to get back.  [ Cheering .]  That bachelorette cake was a total success.  The next day, I had to kick it into high gear  and finish the zombie cake.  It looks good.  I mean, and this covers up a lot of the underneath, anyway.  The next thing to do was the face.  We made the skin out of modeling chocolate  with some green food coloring added.  As we're doing it, I'm like, ""You know what?  It's a freaking zombie.  Let's tear it. Let's rip it.  Let's mold it. Let's scratch it. ""  ""Let it look authentic. ""  Are the brains ready?  So, Tone-Tone sculpted a brain.  We put the brain in his hand.  Let's put his teeth in  to make it look like there's blood in his mouth.  We added some rotten teeth made out of modeling chocolate.  He's getting dirt.  I wanted the zombie to look like  he was clawing his way out of this grave,  so I put a layer of chocolate fudge  and covered that with some chocolate crumbs.  Then we airbrush it with some black food coloring  to make all the features really pop.  Should we do, like, a blood splatter?  So, I want this thing to have blood everywhere.  Corn syrup and food coloring makes awesome blood.  -A rat. -A rat?  All right. Put the rat on.  We made it like a buffet of flesh and rotting things  for the zombie to eat.  And I was like, ""Yeah!"" And it just came together.  All right. That's it.  That's how you do a zombie, okay?  That's how it's done.  Let's get it in the car, and then we'll see.  Nice and easy, my friend.  Wait.  -Got it? -Yeah.  Go and put my end in.  To deliver the zombie cake, I need to take Danny,  because I need my mule.  He's my big, strong guy.  And Tone-Tone and Toni really wanted to come,  because they were intrigued to what's a zombie fest.  You know, I'm used to delivering a cake to a wedding,  where you see people in tuxedos and dresses  and, you know, it's very formal.  I go to this place,  and you got people dressed up like zombies.  Things coming out of their head, you know?  I'm like, ""Really, I'm at zombie fest. ""  I'm like, ""Wait, it's funny. This is great. ""  Hard times for zombies, man, you know?  The organizers, Jason and Christina --  they were the zombie king and queen.  [ Cheers and applause .]  Who's ready for a fun night?  It's just getting started, right?  [ Cheers and applause .]  Oh, my God.  [ Cheering .]  BUDD Y: We get the cake.  We finally get it to the table,  and the zombies start freaking out.  [ All grunting .]  They started ripping and eating. [ Growls .]  I was like It was a little crazy for me.  What Buddy actually made was incredible.  JASON: It was disgusting and way more disgusting  than we thought it was gonna be, which is awesome.  BUDD Y: I'm like a zombie today.  WOMAN: Whoo!  BUDD Y: It was great.  They loved it. I was so happy with it.  This was actually one of the funniest weeks.  I mean, I had a blast."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  I'd love to put the birds in the cake.  Like, real birds?  Like real birds. The old-fashioned way.  I don't need excuses. I don't need this. I need doves.  If I can't find you doves,  we're gonna have to settle for pigeons.  -Make the noise. -Aah!  I don't think those are doves, bro.  Grease it up! Come on!  This lady is pregnant.  I want to make it a big kahuna.  -Oh, my -[ Gasps .]  [ Laughing .] Oh, my God!  BUDD Y: This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   We're one of the few bakeries  that still do things the old-fashioned, Italian way.  That's what makes Carlo's Bakery what we are today.  We've been using these original recipes for years.  Cream puffs, eclairs, Napoleons,  the famous cannoli,  the lobster tails,  all these different Italian pastries.  You know, I just didn't open this bakery  three or four years ago, five years ago.  We're almost 100 years old.  We got to be doing something right.  So, this week, I was excited to get an order  for something really old-school.  So, we're getting married, right?  We're getting married on what would have been  his parents' exact 50th wedding anniversary.  Oh, awesome.  M y grandfather was a chef,  and he baked the cake for my parents' wedding.  Oh, wow.  Now, I wanted to put a dove,  if you can put a dove on the side of the cake.  And the significance of the dove is,  back then, they used to put doves somewhere.  I know those kind of cakes.  M y dad used to make those kind of cakes with the birds inside.  Yeah. So, to be more symbolic  about it being what would have been my parents' 50th,  I thought maybe it would be nice  if we put a dove somewhere on the cake.  Hell, I'd love to put the birds in the cake.  Like, real birds?  Like real birds. Like doves.  Like the old-fashioned way.  I mean, I only did two of those cakes in my whole lifetime,  but my father used to make those cakes all the time.  The birds just kind of sit in this little cage.  But it's, you know, sealed  except for some air holes at the top.  It's not like they're walking on top of the cake.  They're walking in the cake, you know.  And then when you guys cut it,  you open the doors and the birds fly out.  You know, it's one of those things that people --  you just don't see anymore.  Oh, no. You don't see that.  You know, this is gonna be  like a little remembrance of your father  but also mine.  And you know where to get the birds and everything, right?  [ Laughter .]  I will not let you down. Okay?  ALESIA: Oh, we have all the faith in the world.  It was a pleasure meeting with you.  Absolutely.  -Thank you so much. -Thank you, Buddy.  Congratulations. Congratulations.  So, this bird cake is gonna be four tiers --  really old-school Italian style.  It's gonna have a statuette in between some of the tiers.  It's gonna have lots of ivy leaves and grapes.  Very Tuscan feel.  We're gonna do ivory-colored roses all over it.  And then we'll have a Plexiglas cage in there  where the birds will be in.  I'm very particular about my roses.  Okay?  I'm known for my rose.  You got to make me look good.  It's very important to me to teach all my employees  how to do flowers my way.  Every flower should look different.  One should be more open. One should be more closed.  You got to think every flower is unique and different  in its own way, and it is.  This is really gonna tie in an old-fashioned cake  with some modern techniques.  Everything I know I was taught. It was passed down to me.  WOMAN: So, where do you get the birds from?  We used to go chicken store.  We used to go chicken store or pet store.  What's a chicken store?  What's a chicken store?  BUDD Y: That's Sal.  Sal has been working at Carlo's Bakery  since my father bought it in 1964.  He's my most trusted baker.  What is a chicken store? Explain.  Chicken store is where they kill the chicken.  Live.  -WOMAN: You buy them live? -Yeah.  You go pick your birds.  [ Laughter .]  And you eat fresh.  Yeah, you pluck the -- The guy does it.  He made a lot of bird cakes.  All these old-school designs, him and my dad did together.  We used to do, like, maybe 10 of them a year.  Remember who had a cake with the birds in it?  I think it was Danny.  I ate the birds on my honeymoon.  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: That's Danny.  He's been working at the bakery since he was 14 years old --  over 40 years.  We call him ""The M ule"" because he's a jack-of-all-trades.  He can go downstairs and bake.  He can come upstairs and decorate.  He does it all.  The only thing is,  is where the hell are we gonna get the birds from?  I don't know, man.  After we fill this cake, you got to go find me birds.  I want lovebirds, doves.  [ Cooing .]  BUDD Y: They're not pigeons. They're doves.  Yeah, but if I can't find you doves,  we're gonna have to settle for pigeons.  [ Laughs .]  You and Danny.  I need white birds.  We'll find it. Don't worry about it.  Guarantee, we'll find doves.  [ Cooing .]  BUDD Y: And the bird cake  is not the only big-deal, old-school thing  I got going on this week.  Your wife's pregnant?  She is.  And she has been craving, dreaming,  and thinking Carlo's Bakery.  [ Laughs .]  She'll wake me up in the middle of the night  to tell me about your stuff.  ""Go get doughnuts. Go get cake. ""  Mostly all about the lobster-tail pastry.  The lobster tail is one of my favorite pastries.  As hers, as well.  Listen, I think we'll make this giant lobster tail,  and then we'll stuff it with the lobster-tail cream dyed pink  because she's having a baby girl.  Yeah, work your magic.  -Awesome. -I'm in your hands.  BUDD Y: The lobster tail is the American cousin  of the Italian pastry called sfogliatelle.  It's a flaky pastry shell shaped like a lobster tail  that's filled with this delicious ice-creamy-like cream.  When you bite into it, you hear, ""Kkkkkk!""  I mean, it's to die for.  The lobster tail is one of the hardest pastries to make.  We take dough, and we roll it out to be paper-paper-thin.  We put it on a rolling pin,  and we bring it along the whole length of a bench.  Danny starts putting the vegetable shortening on,  and I got to start stretching this.  I mean, stretching this is a workout.  This is a real physical job,  because you really got to pull on this dough,  and it's hard.  What Danny is doing now, I used to do for my dad.  Danny used to do it for my dad, too. Grease it up!  It's getting a little dry in the corner here.  Come on!  So, the vegetable shortening keeps the layers of dough  from sticking together.  And the thinner you pull it, the flakier the pastry becomes.  Man, those are big.  Yeah, is this the pet shop?  I'm looking for white doves.  Do you guys carry white doves?  I'm looking for white doves.  Is there any way you can get them for me?  You got any ideas where I can find one of these?  Do you know where I can get them around here?  All right. Thank you.  I can't find these things over the phone, online.  Nobody's got them.  So, what do you want to do? Catch some pigeons?  Or are we gonna get some doves?  -I'll meet you in the alley. -All right.  What are you gonna do with that?  How we gonna bring them back?  I nside there?  We'll close the top. They can breathe.  All right.  -Let's go. -Where you want to go, though?  -We got to go to the park. -You want to go to the park?  -Where do they hang out? -I n the park?  I guess.  BUDD Y: This is variegated ivy.  So, for this bird cake,  I need hundreds and hundreds of ivy leaves.  You don't really need cornstarch for this.  Okay, cut it.  All these ivy leaves are made out of gum paste.  Each one is hand-rolled out on a board.  And then we put the veiner, and we vein it a little bit.  We soften the edges, and we let it dry on top of aluminum foil.  Crinkled aluminum foil works great,  because it just gives it a natural, curvy feel to it.  Wait till you see what we do when we paint these, Violet.  Painting these are fun.  We have to color this ivy in two shades of green.  So, what you do is you paint it in chartreuse first.  Then, you just put a little bit of forest green on the top  but not on the edges.  Just more in the middle.  This is a very, very long process.  Each leaf could take, like, two minutes to do.  You got to make like 300, 400, 500 leaves.  That's a lot of ivy, man.  So I got Tone-Tone and Violet working on the ivy.  And me and Sal got to get going on the lobster tail.  After the dough is all stretched and rolled,  we cut it into individual slices.  These are gonna be the big, big ones.  I usually make these pastries about this big.  We make small lobster tails.  But this lady is pregnant. I want to make it a big kahuna.  You take the individual slices  and you open them with your fingers,  so it's almost like making a funnel shape.  This is hard, Sal, doing a big one like this.  Once you got it shaped, you fill it with cream-puff mix.  When it bakes, the cream-puff mix expands like crazy,  which puffs up the lobster tail  and leaves a big air pocket for the cream filling.  Sal, where are those cookies?  We're on a mission.  Okay.  Look. Are those sea gulls?  Oh, there they are.  Those are sea gulls, though.  I don't think we can pass a sea gull off for a pigeon.  Hey! That's a pigeon!  Throw a couple crumbs in the water.  See if we can come close.  -Make the noise. -Aah!  Danny, make the noise.  One is coming now. Look.  Danny, make the noise.  Aah, aah, aah!  Whoa!  I don't think those are doves, bro.  That's all right.  As long as we catch something to bring back.  I don't know if this is gonna work, Danny.  BUDD Y: So, I called Frankie.  I'm like, ""Yo, what the hell are you doing?""  Hello?  And he goes, ""Oh, we're getting birds, boss. ""  -Dude, we can't find -- -He called us dummies.  You said you needed pigeons.  Dummies?  I think, at that point, Frankie was just frustrated  and he just wanted to get the hell  out of the bakery for a while.  -You didn't get no birds? -I've called everybody.  I don't know what else you want me to do.  You're telling me that you can't find a pair of doves  between here and New York?  There's no white doves, dude.  I don't think you're trying hard enough.  I called like 15 places.  I don't need excuses. I don't need this. I need doves.  I don't know what you want, man.  BUDD Y: Go find me doves.  [ Dialing .]  [ Ringing .]  MAN: Can I help you?  Yes, I'm looking for white doves --  you know, like lovebirds.  MAN: White ducks?  No, not ducks, doves.  MAN: Doves.  Oh, no, we don't got doves. We have cockatiels.  No, I need something a little bigger.  I hear Frankie in the background going,  ""They got cockatoos, they got ducks, but no doves. ""  -WOMAN: Pet shop. -FRANKI E: Yes, hi.  Do you guys carry white doves?  WOMAN: We do have some all-white ones.  FRANKI E: Okay.  Actually, I found them. What time you want these for?  I want them today.  -What time? -Anytime you can get them.  FRANKI E: Anytime today.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Your doves are on their way.  Man, those suckers are crispy,  just like Grandma used to make in Italy.  So, once the lobster tails have been in the oven  for about 20, 25 minutes,  they come out all nice and golden and crunchy.  So, you have this crispy, flaky shell  that we're gonna fill  with this delicious ice-creamy-like cream  which is made with custard cream and whipped cream.  Hold it like this and like this.  So, the guy told me they're having this baby girl,  so I'm like, ""Great.  Let's take the cream that we're gonna fill the lobster tail with  and dye it pink  so that when she cracks it open,  there's the pink cream inside for a girl. ""  Did it go to the bottom?  [ Chuckles .]  That's a little added touch that's really gonna get her.  We got the lobster tails full.  I'm gonna start cutting this.  I n addition to our lobster tails, this mother-to-be  is a big fan of other traditional, Italian pastries,  so what I decided to do was create a big platter  of all our best stuff.  I put the lobster tail as a centerpiece,  and then I added all kinds of cream puffs,  cannolis,  even some chocolate-covered strawberries.  All right, I'm gonna make a pregnant woman very happy.  Should be at the end.  Hope so. M y arms are killing me.  I'd help you, but I slept wrong last night.  How you doing? How are you?  Thanks for coming.  She's gonna be surprised, huh?  -Oh, absolutely. -All right.  -Hey, D. -Yeah?  There's somebody here to see you.  We got a special delivery for somebody who's expecting.  Get out of here! What is this?  -How you doing? -Good!  Your hubby came to the bakery  and told me that you've been craving some goodies  from the bakery.  -So -[ Gasps .]  [ Laughs .]  [ Laughing .] Oh, my God!  BUDD Y: The baby will definitely be kicking after this.  N ICK: Oh, man. You've outdone yourself.  DEN ISE: This is dangerous.  -Salute! -Salute!  [ Laughter .]  This is so cool.  I'm loving this. Oh, my God, this is so good.  I got to have a strawberry.  M mm!  [ ""Bridal Chorus"" plays .]  BUDD Y: We got to get back to making this bird cake,  'cause this wedding is coming up.  It's a 4-tier cake, but it's a big, big cake.  Yeah!  BUDD Y: We got a bottom tier.  Then we have a Plexiglas bird cage.  Then we have another two tiers,  a statuette, and then we have a top tier.  When the whole thing is assembled,  this cake is gonna be about 5 feet tall.  -Oh, you got the birds? -Yes.  Oh, let me call.  Guys, the birds are here.  Yo, Bud!  What's up, cuz?  The birds are here.  Ooh!  Put it right here. Let me see.  Watch they don't get free, man.  I just want to take a peek.  Just peek. Don't go too big.  BUDD Y: We got to open the box.  What the --  [ Laughter .]  No!  I said ""doves, "" and you brought me ducks!  As funny as it was  having two ducks pop out of the box when I opened it,  the bottom line is I got no doves.  And I'm like, ""Frankie, please find me some doves.  I really need you to get me doves,  because I promised these people they would have lovebirds,  and I got to have doves. ""  [ Grunts .]  So, after the ducks left, I get back to working on this cake,  and I'm starting to put all the ivy vines kind of draping down,  and I'm putting the flowers and the grapes.  And the more I look at it, the more it's coming into play.  It's like, wow.  This cake is coming together very well.  I'm excited about doing something  that's old-school like this.  Two doves.  Not ducks. Doves.  Are you sure? Did you look?  I'm sure. I went to go get them.  All right, come here.  I made sure that she put them in the box.  Danny, come see the birds.  Oh, let me see.  Aww!  And we got doves.  And we're in business, and now I'm happy.  -Beautiful. -Oh, he's okay.  -They come out pretty white. -These are beautiful.  [ Smooching .]  Go ahead, Danny, stick him back inside.  Well, I got you a male and a female.  All right, let's get back to work.  Frankie, put these in my office.  Give them some bird feed or something.  I don't know.  Back to work.  Let's go with some grapes.  So, I finished the bird cake.  I called my staff over.  All right, guys.  Everybody come over and check out what we got here.  WOMAN: Beautiful.  BUDD Y: Everybody likes it?  WOMAN: Beautiful.  BUDD Y: When they go to cut the cake,  they're gonna open the doors and the birds are gonna fly.  Look at Danny. Look at Danny.  Aww!  I'm crying?  It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  BUDD Y: This cake reminds me of cakes my dad used to do --  you know, old-school Italian --  things that I learned when I was a little kid.  This is cool. This is something different.  When the hell do you see a cake that's got live birds inside?  A blast from the past, Danny.  So, we had to take the cake apart into separate pieces  and put it in the truck.  And we put the birds in the back of the truck.  Make sure you watch the birds.  Oh, you want me to stay in here?  BUDD Y: Yeah. Put the birds by your feet over there.  Be nice to the birds.  We'll be there shortly.  All right, see you later.  Youse okay?  Are you sure?  Okay. Be good, okay?  Good birdies.  They alive?  -Yeah. -All right.  Watch. There's steps.  Once we get to the venue, we got a lot to do.  I mean, I got to actually assemble this cake there.  Think it looks great.  They're really gonna like this.  Now, usually, at this point, we leave,  but we got to stay here because of the birds.  Aww!  Oh, my goodness!  [ Laughs .] We got a little surprise.  Now, you know, this is the big event.  We open the doors, and we put the doves inside the cake.  You can't eat the birds!  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: And then it was time for them to release the doves.  [ Drumroll .]  Come on, little guys.  Come on!  I can't get them out.  [ Laughter .]  They're perfectly happy!  That's all right.  BUDD Y: You need help?  So, me and Danny go over  and we help the bride and groom release the doves.  Get out of there!  [ Laughter .]  They don't want to listen.  Come on.  Nice and easy.  [ Cheers and applause .]  One, two, three, go!  [ Cheers and applause .]  And what a great thing to watch those birds fly into the air.  [ Cheers and applause .]  You know, it was very symbolic of my parents.  [ Crowd cheering .]  ALESIA: It was fabulous. I mean, it really was.  It was totally unexpected and great --  you know, the reaction on everybody.  The cake was exactly what I wanted, plus birds.  BUDD Y: At the end of the day, it was a very happy ending.  The couple lived happily ever after,  and so did our other lovebirds -- the doves --  as they went back home to the pet shop."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Field trip to the museum.  They found this fossil of this mammal,  so they wanted me to re-create it out of cake.  Dinosaur there, tree there, tree there.  I want it like ""Rrr!""  I told you this morning to take the stuff out,  because now I got to wait for the stuff to thaw out!  It's frozen solid! How am I gonna cut it?  -So, what's the occasion? -M y Sweet 16.  This thing is heavy, man.  -Put it right here. -All right, no problem.  Danny. Danny! [Bleep.]  BUDD Y: This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   So I get a phone call  from the M useum of Natural History in New York,  and he's like, ""We need a cake. ""  Wow!  That's crazy, man.  WOMAN: That's awesome.  BUDD Y: So, it turns out  they found this fossil of this mammal.  It's like 50 million years old,  and it was actually the biggest mammal to ever walk the Earth.  It's three times the size of an elephant,  and they made this big replica of it,  so they wanted me to re-create it out of cake  for the opening of the exhibit.  "" I ndricotherium. ""  BUDD Y: Listen, don't --  Listen, don't even start.  They pronounce it something like ""indiradrinium. ""  "" I ndricastherium. ""  "" I ndrogatheria. ""  It's like an indricotherium.  That's what they call it. I ndricotherium.  Look at the detail on this thing.  We got to really make this thing really big.  It's gonna be pretty amazing.  You'll have underneath here cereal treats, this cereal.  The rest will all be cake on top,  which is the majority of the cake.  I n order to achieve this skin,  we're gonna use fondant and modeling chocolate together.  And we're gonna scratch it and scuff it  so that it gets this rough look.  So, my vision was seeing this big mammal on top of a cake  with two trees and a little caveman standing next to it  because I really wanted to show the size proportion  of the caveman to the indricotherium.  It was very important to show that.  Dinosaur there, tree there, tree there.  I wanted it to look like a scene right out of the museum.  I really wanted to feel like in the wild.  We had to build some hills and make some dips and valleys.  We're gonna cover it in white fondant  just to keep the structure together.  Okay.  BUDD Y: Once we get the landscape the shape that we want,  then we dirty-ice it and cover it with fondant,  which helps keep everything together.  Next step -- get somebody cutting leaves.  The leaves we're cutting out of green fondant,  and for the trees themselves,  we're doing something a little different.  Are you sure it's in?  Are you sure it's in?  This ain't going no place, man.  BUDD Y: We're covering PVC pipe with modeling chocolate.  More of a pretty decoration.  Come on, what else, Mauro?  We got to get the green.  Get some green here.  Maybe we'll get a big bag with a big, green leaf tip.  BUDD Y: To get the look of a prehistoric swamp,  we started roughing in the cake with green buttercream.  And then Remy comes through  with the clear, bluish-green piping gel  to make the rivers.  While this was all happening,  Daniella was finishing the caveman.  It's completely made out of modeling chocolate,  and, I mean, it came together nice.  Very nice.  M y other big project this week  is a birthday cake for this girl Lexi's Sweet 16.  Just tell me a little bit about yourself.  What's your favorite things?  The beach.  Anything that, like, goes along with the beach.  Surfboards, flip-flops.  LEXI: Yeah, I like colors that, like, stand out.  BUDD Y: Yeah, a lime green.  LEXI: I like the hot pink a lot.  BUDD Y: Okay, so we're gonna definitely use hot pink, teal.  It's gonna be funky. It's gonna have some flair to it.  -Are you a city girl? -Yeah, I like the city a lot.  We're definitely gonna do some cityscapes in there,  I think.  Lexi's a New York City girl  who loves the California beaches,  so I got to get a lot of both into this cake.  I'm thinking the square cake with the tiers off-kilter  because I think that that's fun.  You know, I think for a Sweet 16,  it doesn't look like a wedding cake.  Mauro, Remy, could you guys come here for a second?  I want to make them a mammal that's huge  and it looks like it's lifelike.  I want it like ""Rrr!""  The hardest thing to do on the mammal cake  is to figure out a way to get the underbelly to stay  and then sculpt on top of it.  We're gonna do circles.  We're gonna cut the bottom and just -- [Trills.] -- fan it.  -Pound cake? -Nine pound cakes.  What I did was I made a frame of the body,  then I screwed down some wooden dowels  so that it was square and then, you know, it was stability.  Then, on top of this structure, we sculpt pound cake.  The problem is, I'm looking around,  and there's no pound cake.  Danny, where's the pound cake?  What? You talking to me?  BUDD Y: I know that I told him to take the stuff out,  but he was trying to play stupid with me.  So now it's been in the freezer.  Now how am I supposed to cut it and get it ready?  I told you this morning to take the stuff out,  because now I got to wait for the stuff to thaw out!  Danny, you know better.  You know how many cakes we got to do.  I mean, it's always something.  How am I supposed to cut these, huh?  It's frozen solid. How am I gonna cut it?  I wanted to kill Danny. This is a huge setback.  I mean, now I got to wait an extra two, three hours  for these cakes to thaw out.  This is always -- It's always --  It's always a problem. It's always a problem.  I need to use cereal treats to get the underbelly to stay  because cake would just fall.  And I got to glue them up with royal icing  so that it would stay in place.  And then once the pound cake had thawed a little   I cut a little end off so that I could stack them  because he's kind of round.  Then, I need to put more royal icing around the dowels  so the cereal treats will stick and look like legs.  I do the same process for the indricotherium's head,  and then I start sculpting.  So, we're cruising on this thing.  We've got it dirty-iced. We've got the fondant going.  I mean, we're in the zone.  You busy?  I need you.  I need you for about five minutes.  Buddy and I are very close.  We grew up three houses away from each other,  so I was always over at the house.  Buddy and I went to school together.  He didn't have any brothers, so we were kind of --  He was the brother I never had,  and I was the brother he never had.  So, what's on your mind, cuz? Talk to me.  It's -- Every day, I do the same thing.  I come in, I put up the whipped cream,  we set up the store, we do the birthday cakes.  It's just I'm stuck in my routine every day.  A lot of people don't know this about me,  but I used to work on Wall Street for 10 years  on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  After I lost my job in the city,  Buddy and I had a talk, and he was like, you know --  He was looking for help and I was available  and he's kind of taken me under his wing  and has really taught me the trade.  You know, I've learned a lot,  and I think I'm ready to start decorating  some of the more elaborate cakes.  There is one cake that is this weekend.  It's for a client that very, very hard for me to please  all the time.  It's my niece's dance recital,  which means you'd be making Mary's cake.  Mary looks at me as some kind of, like, just an assistant,  an apprentice upstairs.  This is my opportunity to really show Mary what I can do.  BUDD Y: Listen, got a little situation.  M y cousin actually said  that he really wanted to make your daughter's cake.  You got to give the guy a shot. You don't trust him?  He's not the best decorator.  Well, he's up-and-coming. He's learning.  Not on my daughter he's not learning.  Come on, you don't think he can do it?  Cuz, I love you,  but I consider you just, like, his bitch here.  I'm just saying.  Absolutely not.  I'm just saying.  No, he's got a lot more in him.  If he needs it, I will help him.  I nevitably, if he screws it up a little bit,  it's still the family cake,  so, you know, it's not the worst thing.  It's not like it's a paying customer.  But at the end of the day,  he's gonna learn how to deal with a pain in the ass.  MARY: I think I want, like, ballet shoes  sculpted on the top.  Okay.  And then, like, the ribbons, you know?  The ribbons coming down like this?  Yeah, maybe we could do some stars because she's the star.  Okay.  She was being Mary.  She was definitely a tough customer.  Just have a little faith.  This is the first specialty cake you're making.  FRANKI E: Mary wants this three-tier cake  and specifically asked for chocolate and vanilla  because her daughter likes both.  -How you doing, cuzino? -What's up, B.?  -You want any help? -I'm good right now.  I think the cake itself I'll be able to handle.  It's the detailed decorating -- you know, the artistic stuff --  that I'm a little concerned about.  [ Sighs .] Ballerina.  So, Mary wants pictures of ballerinas  around one of the tiers of the cake.  And drawing is definitely not my forte.  And it kind of looked like a man, not a little girl.  What do you think of my ballerina?  What is it?  I mean, nice try.  -lf you could help me out -I would love to help you out.  I don't think that she wants this on her cake.  I know.  That's why I figured I'd come to you.  Okay.  I'm sure she ain't gonna like no matter what you do  'cause that's just the way she is.  All right, we got to go.  We got to bang out this Sweet 16 cake.  Lexi's Sweet 16 cake is gonna be very personalized.  This cake is gonna tell a story about her.  The bottom tier is gonna be more beach.  You know, I'm thinking the bottom should be very beachy,  with sand, and that'll be the California tier.  WOMAN: Put the ball up here on the corner.  BUDD Y: The next tier, I'm gonna go into a cityscape.  That's okay.  I like the different variations in height.  And then, as we go up the cake,  there's gonna be, like, a contemporary, fun gift box  with some stripes, polka dots, and a bow.  This cake is literally gonna scream ""Lexi. ""  I mean, I'm gonna have it in, like, a bright neon sign.  Done.  Cousin Anthony.  Get your ass upstairs. Come on, you got to go.  That's my cousin Anthony.  He does a little of this, a little of that,  including deliveries.  He's a good kid. Very reliable.  What's up?  -Danny. -What's up?  Come on, you and him got to go, all right?  Take this cake. Let's go.  Let's go.  [ Grunting .]  I got it.  Watch the door.  I got it. I got it.  This thing is heavy, man.  -Put it right here. -All right, no problem.  Danny. Danny! [Bleep.]  WOMAN: Aah!  -What the hell happened? -[ Gasps .]  M y brother is gonna kill you.  You're telling me.  Buddy!  Are you all right?  What did youse do?!  It was [bleep.] Danny's fault.  This is for today!  I told him I had to reposition my hand,  and he pushes the cake towards me.  Bring the thing inside!  This cake took us days to do,  and these two morons dropped it down the stairs!  All right, everybody over here. Come on.  I don't want to hear it. Just let's work.  -Where's the rest of it? -What the hell happened?  It fell. Let's not talk about it, okay?  Let's get the sponge.  Come on, start cutting buildings, mixing colors.  We got to go. This cake is for today.  Come on. Come on.  There, there.  It's not a joke.  We cut the sheets and we start filling the cake,  and we got to move, man.  You got the fondant colors mixed?  Come on, move it.  I better have all that fondant ready to go.  Let me tell you, when we got a group effort like this  and my team works this way,  I mean, it's like we work miracles.  Wait. It's got to go around there.  All right, Christine, you work on the buildings.  I'll work on the bottom tier then.  All right, guys, come on. We got to move it.  We got to get done. We're almost home.  All right, give me the shopping bag, Remy.  Got to set back.  We put this cake together in an hour and a half.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Cousin Anthony's out. He's not making this delivery.  I got to make this delivery myself.  Come on, pull.  Thank God that we got there and it was okay.  All the guests haven't gotten there yet,  so we made it in the nick of time.  Careful.  Watch, watch, watch. Easy does it.  [ Gasps .] Oh, my God!  YOUNG WOMAN: It's so cool. It's amazing.  LEXI: [ Gasps .]  Oh, Buddy, thank you so much!  M y pleasure. Congratulations.  YOUNG WOMAN: Look at the sand. It's like real.  So pretty!  He put in so many different things about me personally  that it was just amazing.  The cake was great.  To see how happy that girl was made my day.  Hey, Frankie, I just finished this picture.  FRANKI E: That is perfect.  I mean, you didn't have to make my drawing look that bad.  I have to take this drawing and I scan it into the computer  and it prints out on edible paper using food coloring.  So then, I mount the pictures on gum paste  and let them dry a bit.  Buddy always talks about getting into the zone when he decorates.  I couldn't get into my zone  because the entire time I'm doing this cake,  everybody's watching me.  I want to go into the corner  and just take my cake and work on it.  I don't want to have everybody watching me.  It's definitely putting me on the spot.  -Bye! -Bye!  Good night.  Make sure you shut the lights.  [ Sighs .]  BUDD Y: Why don't we get a piece to go from here to here?  Then we're gonna wrap it down.  So, the skin of the mammal cake was coming really cool.  What I did was, I mixed together fondant and modeling chocolate,  and we laid it over the cake.  And then I took this tool, and I scratched it and scuffed it,  and, I mean, I was forming it with my fingers.  And it was just coming to life,  and it looked exactly like the mammal skin at the museum.  Don't go nuts.  I'll do like this and then you add a couple thicker things,  because this is a little bit more detailed lines.  The skin's starting to look good,  but we got to add a lot of details to this guy.  We got to put some green.  Have a little too much black in there.  To make the skin look real, I knew I had to use luster dust  in all different colors.  We're gonna hit the legs good with this  so that it blends more with that.  So, like, all those little lines that I scored out,  just by going over it like that, it kind of makes it pop.  That looks pretty cool.  Let's get the mammal on top.  Your end's first.  I got it.  All right, let's get a couple sheets,  'cause we got to fill the cake in over here.  We finished putting the last of the cake into the landscape,  then the finishing touches.  We're gonna make his toenails here.  Gum-paste toenails.  Brown and green buttercream icing for the ground.  Little plants and bushes made out of modeling chocolate.  Chocolate rocks.  And crushed-up cookies for dirt.  WOMAN: Wow! It looks real.  BUDD Y: All done.  She looks great.  We were just, I mean, flabbergasted.  This was actually one of the nicest cakes I ever did.  I had one problem.  This cake had to weigh close to 400 pounds.  It's go time! Let's go!  One, two, three.  Wait, wait, wait. You got to --  Are we on, Remy?  It's really a behemoth.  Watch. Wait, wait, wait.  Nice and easy.  Easy.  Let it go.  Okay, wait, wait.  Twist it, twist it.  Come on, twist it, twist it.  I got the bottom.  You got to come back more.  Watch.  [ I ndistinct shouting .]  Watch!  Okay, it's in.  All right, we're good.  Look at my arms!  We got it in the truck, and I was like, ""Thank God. ""  I got it.  All right, got to go up.  That cake was heavy, man, and we had to carry it up steps.  I was like, ""God, please be on my side. ""  Down, down.  Down more, more.  [ Gasping .]  [ Cheers and applause .]  People in the audience for the mammal cake dug this guy up.  These guys know their mammals.  So, I don't know what's harder.  Pronouncing its name or making it.  [ Laughter .]  We worked really hard on making this indricotherium.  Is that good?  They really did their research on this,  because it matches the model that's on display.  I think the cake is spectacular.  BUDD Y: They were impressed.  I know I did good.  [ I ndistinct conversations .]  [ Cheers and applause .]  Tonight's the dinner for Lucia's dance recital,  and the whole family's there.  I mean, Lucia looked so cute in her dance-recital outfit,  in her little tutu.  I mean, she's adorable.  I hope Frankie pulled through with the cake.  Uncle Frankie made your cake, not Uncle Buddy.  This is one of the first cakes he did all by himself,  so we have to see what it looks like.  I'm really starting to get nervous.  What are they gonna say about my cake?  Are they gonna like it?  All right, here comes your cake.  [ Exclaiming .]  [ Cheers and applause .]  She smiled, which meant she liked the cake.  MARY: Well, do you like it?  It looks good.  You did a good job.  BUDD Y: Come on, he did a good job. I'm really happy.  I'm proud of you. You did a great job.  -Thank you. -Very good job.  Very good job.  At the end of the day, what I'm most proud of  is that my cousin did what he said he was gonna do.  He stepped up and he did a good job and I'm happy.  The first cake he ever made."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  So, we have two boys, they're twins,  and they're having their birthday at FAO Schwarz.  [ Laughs .]  First time for Violet and Danny in a toy store.  [ Cheering .]  Life's a beach.  Tone-Tone, you got that tiki bar?  Whoever loses more weight wins.  Game on!  No more pizza, no more chicken wings!  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   Aah!  [ Laughs .]  BUDD Y: So, what are a bunch of New Jersey bakers  doing at FAO Schwarz,  one of the largest toy stores in the world?  See, Danny, this is a toy store. You never been.  This is what a toy store looks like.  -Now, that's a piano. -That's a piano.  So, I had this couple come to the bakery  and tell me they want this cake for their two twin boys.  We're actually having it at a pretty unique place.  We're having it at FAO Schwarz, the toy store.  When we find out they did birthdays there,  we were like, ""Oh, what the heck?  We got to do it there. ""  That's a cool place to have a birthday.  I didn't even know they did. That's awesome.  Yeah, so, we were thinking of something toy-themed  or FAO Schwarz themed, at least.  Maybe a toy-soldier cake.  Of course, there's the big piano.  Yeah, everybody knows the big piano.  We can do a big piano cake  and then maybe have, like, two wooden soldiers.  One of the soldiers,  maybe we could put one of your son's names.  -That's a great idea. -I like that.  And then we could add all different things  that are FAO Schwarz --  classic toys, you know, blocks, teddy bears,  and just kind of make it fun and whimsical  with all kinds of toys sticking out.  Good ideas. I'm glad we came here.  [ Laughs .]  BUDD Y: So, we're here.  We're having fun,  and we're getting some ideas on how to build this birthday cake.  Guys, you got enough candy.  That's it. Stop filling your bags.  Choo-choo!  Oh, look at the big toy soldier.  I really love to incorporate the wooden soldier  because, number one, they're all over the store.  I think this looks awesome.  You know, and it's pretty square.  He's pretty straight.  It's gonna be not so bad to make him out of cake.  I think this is one of the main focal points of the store.  What kid's not gonna like this?  Look at the robots.  MAN: We got to look at a lot of toys.  BUDD Y: This is a pretty simple piano, in a sense,  where the cake is just gonna be black,  and then we're gonna lay the keys over the top.  I think it should be awesome. But you know what?  Everybody's gonna understand the piano because of the store.  -Brrrrr! -[ Laughs .]  Ding, ding, ding!  Danny doesn't want to take his shoes off.  Guys, was this inspiration? Good field trip?  Come on, good field trip.  First time for Violet and Danny in a toy store.  [ Cheering .]  All right, team, let's go. Back to work.  So my idea for this FAO Schwarz cake,  the first thing that pops in my head  is the big piano that you can go and play on,  because that's, like, the funnest thing in the world.  The second thing that comes to mind is the toy soldiers.  Then I'm gonna add different toys  which are FAO Schwarz-themed --  old-fashioned toys,  cool toys that you can't just get at any toy store.  So the first thing I'm gonna do for this FAO Schwarz cake  is start sculpting the soldiers.  Whenever you make a figure standing up,  you need a support system.  So Frankie and Mauro constructed two frames,  one for each soldier.  And then we started filling them.  Rice Krispies treats here,  and we're gonna cut the sponge to fit here.  Yes. Let's cut this 6 inches.  So, what I do to fill this cake is for his legs,  I just wrap cereal treats around his legs  and then fill pound cake up his waist.  And then I got to do his head.  When you first see it, you're like, ""What the hell is that?""  But it's really gonna look like a toy soldier when I'm done.  And the next thing I had to do was carve it,  so I had to shape it and get it the shape that I wanted.  All right, I'm gonna dirty-ice him.  Okay, let's see what I can do with this.  So, I dirty-ice this sucker,  and I'm like, ""Let me put it in a fridge  so that it can cool down a little bit.  You make a rocket ship?  That's good enough.  Hi, how you doing?  -Hi, how are you? -Good.  We're here for a consultation for a cake with Buddy.  Okay, you can have a seat, and I'm gonna go get Buddy.  Okay. Thank you.  Hi, how you doing? I'm Buddy.  Nice to meet you. How are you?  Pleasure. How are you doing, guys?  How's everything going?  We heard about your cakes and we need a cake for a big thing  and we figured you're the guy.  We run a beach club on the Jersey shore.  And it's our 10th anniversary.  That's why you guys look nice and tan.  See that? [ Laughs .]  We'd like to have some kind of a beach-scene type thing  with bathing suits, surfboards.  J. T.: Sand, surf, that kind of thing.  Beach.  I'm thinking maybe, you know, big cake with sand  and then, like, water coming up,  almost looking like waves coming on the beach.  Maybe like a lifeguard stand, maybe some surfboards.  A couple of umbrellas here and there.  Umbrellas here and there.  Don't worry about it, guys. I'll make you a beautiful cake.  It was a pleasure meeting with you.  Oh, let's go. Lunch is here.  -What is it? -I don't know.  It smells like pizza.  Buffalo wings?  Nice and greasy.  This is what you're eating for lunch?  What are you, the salad god?  Listen, you should be eating a little bit healthier.  BUDD Y: If we didn't want to eat it, we could.  We could eat salads every day, us up here.  We got a lot of willpower.  Youse are the ones without willpower, not us.  That's my sister Mary.  Her and my other sisters are always giving us a hard time  about what we eat.  Why don't we see who is gonna lose weight --  you and your chubby sisters or us?  -We're gonna make a deal -All right, go ahead.  that us four could lose more weight  than you and your sisters any day of the week.  Game on!  BUDD Y: So I tell Mary, ""Go get your sisters,  and we're gonna throw down. We're gonna have a competition. ""  One week, whoever loses the most weight wins.  It's me, Mauro, Danny, Frankie  versus Lisa, Madeline, Mary, and Grace.  Listen, these are the rules, okay?  If youse win, we'll work in the storefront for youse.  And they got to come up here  -I would throw up! -Listen!  Can you shut up and listen?  Okay, if we win, youse wash the sinks,  and you're gonna wash the dishes.  I'm like, ""Danny, go get a scale. ""  Tone-Tone, you're gonna be the official weight keeper.  Percentage of what you lost, right?  Like, it's the percentage, not the amount, the number.  Percentage of your body.  Okay, Tone, don't say the weights, just put it on.  Little Cuz, come on, step on there.  WOMAN: You guys are almost a ton!  [ Laughs .]  No doubt, we girls are gonna win this thing  no matter what it takes.  Does she got any weights on her?  What's in her pocket?  Yeah, she does!  Look! I see it!  Automatic disqualification!  One weight!  BUDD Y: Go ahead, step on the scale.  -I have no extra weight. -Make sure.  LISA: Oh, Tony, write it down!  Let's go! I want to get off!  BUDD Y: Okay, get off.  Next week when we weigh in, whoever loses more weight wins.  We better -- You know, we got to step it up, men.  No more pizza, no more chicken wings, all right?  Okay, let's get back to work.  We got to get back to making this FAO Schwarz cake  for these birthday boys.  The boys wanted vanilla and chocolate cake  because one liked vanilla and one wanted chocolate.  So I did vanilla and chocolate,  and then I iced it in vanilla buttercream.  Let's go. Let's ice this. We got to get going, man.  It's go time. It's go time!  After I iced it, we had to do the piano design.  So, we got 32 keys.  BUDD Y: Let's cut strips.  [ Ragtime piano music plays .]  What do you think?  Very nice.  So I cut out all these keys and I line them up  and I put them on top and they looked great.  Just lift them up. I'll put a little buttercream,  and then you can jiggle them in place.  Next thing I got to do is screw and glue these toy soldiers  to the cake.  She ain't going nowhere now.  Let's put his pants on.  So we did black pants.  We took black fondant and put it around.  You got to go up to here.  Yeah, 91/2, 10.  The next thing we did was put his coat on.  Maybe the modeling chocolate for the flesh tone, just straight.  MAURO: Whatever you want.  BUDD Y: And as I put layer by layer on the toy soldier,  it started to look better and better.  Let's do black.  We had to make little feet for him.  We did the hat, and everything was just coming together,  and it really was starting to look like a toy soldier.  We had to do the detail work.  We had to cut out eyes, a nose, a mustache.  We really wanted to make it look  like the FAO Schwarz toy soldier,  and it was starting to look awesome.  It looks good.  This seems like a good time to sneak out  and get in a workout.  All right, now, nice and easy.  I don't want anybody to have a heart attack.  What my sisters don't know  is that the guys have a secret weapon  Easy. I don't want to go too fast.  BUDD Y: Exercise, baby.  I got the blood flowing.  Let's do some weights.  Out of the four of us,  I would say probably I work out the most.   Not bad -- 10.  -All right, who's next? -Not me.  Even though a few of them look like  they've never seen the inside of a gym,  we want to get those boys into shape.  Look at cugino.  Come on, you wimp. Two.  Come on, one more!  BUDD Y: We'll be ready for swimsuit season in no time.  Which reminds me,  we got to get started on this beach-club cake.  This beach-club cake is a great cake  for me to get my whole team involved in  because there's so many different little elements,  and we can all make little pieces  and then put them together on one cake.  And it's great when we do that  because you got other people's ideas  and other people's imaginations,  and you can't go wrong.  So, I got Sunshine doing beach balls.  I got Tone-Tone doing the tiki hut.  I got Daniella and Toni and Christine  making modeling-chocolate figures.  Me, Mauro, and Remy are filling and icing the cake.  We used a vanilla cake, and we used a chocolate buttercream.  As I filled the cake, I cut some round cakes, thin layers  and made, like, little dunes and bumps kind of  so it didn't look like a flat beach.  It had a look like a little duney  and kind of like the way a beach does.  See, Mauro, it's lumpy now.  MAURO: Ohh.  Now you capiche.  Let's start dirty-icing this thing.  The sand is actually just brown sugar, which is pretty simple.  Brown sugar really looks like sand.  Life's a beach.  The water for the beach-club cake is actually piping gel  We'll use the blue and the green.  BUDD Y: which we color,  and then we kind of just put it on with a knife  on top of buttercream.  Oh, M iss Health herself.  We found out the guys were gonna join this gym to lose weight,  so we thought we'd join the gym as well.  We wanted to know if you have any trainers available for us?  Yeah.  -Somebody motivating. -Motivating.  I need someone cute.  Hey, ladies. How you doing?  I'm M ike.  Hi, M ike. How are you?  BUDD Y: How many more you got?  All right. The rocks look good.  What else do we got done?  The challenging part of this beach-club cake  is just the size of it.  I mean, it's a big, big cake.  It's gonna be tough seeing strategically  where you're gonna place all the people.  You don't want to make the beach look, like, so crowded,  and you don't want it to look empty.  It's got to look just right.  We had a girl in a bikini who was really cute,  but she looked like she had a little bit of work done.  We had some kids that looked adorable.  Chubby guy laying down with a little bit of hair and a sunburn  was hilarious.  I think it really made the cake.  MAURO: Tone-Tone, you got that tiki bar?  BUDD Y: I think my staff really nailed  all the figures and elements for this beach-club cake.  I think that everybody worked hard.  Everybody pushed and we got the job done  and I'm happy with the end result.  It looked great.  All right, I think it looks cool.  I think it looks like a beach.  MAURO: You did a good job, chef.  [ Groans .]  Okay.  Watch your back.  So, we drive 30 miles south, we get to the beach club.  The cake is intact.  It's not sweating, and we didn't hit no traffic.  So, so far, so good.  Holy sh  [ Laughs .]  [ Cheering .]  Wow!  That's the ""wow"" factor we were looking for.  You got it?  Wow!  This is incredible!  You got the girls in the bathing suits.  Do you like it?  J. T.: The cake was amazing.  JAM ES: He nailed the bikini models, the shells.  He nailed the lifeguards.  You know, just what we asked for,  and he got it perfect.  J. T.: It's so realistic.  [ Cheering .]  And it's gonna taste better than it looks,  so you got a good part coming.  Getting receptions like that, it's the payoff.  It's the money shot.  It's what we strive for.  Congratulations on your 10 years and hopefully another 100 years.  MAN: Thank you very much.  Enjoy. Good luck with the season.  -Bye, guys. -Take care.  I wanted to go hang out there.  I wanted to have a frozen margarita on the beach  and chill out,  but I was like, ""We got to go back to work. ""  Being that close to the beach  makes me even more determined to get into shape.  We decided to stick to much lighter pastries  and cut down on our serving sizes.  Men lose weight faster than women,  so we can eat the biscotti.  Spend an extra half-hour on the elliptical tonight  and make up for it.  Just one.  Look, what the heck could be inside this?  Low-carb.  BUDD Y: Here's to my sisters.  Try to bend your knees first.  Okay, push your hips out.  Slowly bend your knees all the way down.  I mean, my sisters don't know how to exercise.  I mean, it must be a joke to see them at the gym.  Keep your legs straight. Stand up nice and tall.  I could lift you, M ike, if I had to.  Come on, this is easy.  Oh, my God! This guy is strong!  M I KE: Very nice.  Oh, I forgot the hands.  There's that white chocolate.  I got to mold their little hands.  After we had the toy soldiers up and the piano was done,  the cake was starting to look spectacular.  We're gonna have to decorate this board up little bit.  Let's put the toys on.  So we got the drum.  Teddy bear maybe on top of the snare drum.  Well, what else do we got?  We got the blocks, the train.  -WOMAN: The marbles. -BUDD Y: The robot.  WOMAN: He's cute.  BUDD Y: I think the train should go on top, too.  M y little army of misfit toys here.  Steam it up, baby.  We made so many different things,  it started to look great.  I need something back here.  I'm a little obsessive/compulsive.  All right, I ain't gonna lie.  And Christine put a little bit of poppy seeds  on top of the train,  'cause it was like a coal cart.  So a couple of those poppy seeds were on the piano key,  and it was, like, driving me crazy.  Tone-Tone, I hate the fact that there's poppy seeds on my piano.  Blow them off.  BUDD Y: Pick off the poppy seeds with a needle.  Seeing these poppy seeds are driving me crazy.  Every one better be off. I see one over there.  DAN I ELLA: I don't care if it takes you all night!  Get those poppy seeds off!  All right, this is ridiculous.  It's like I love poppy-seed bagels,  but these things are so annoying.  That's why I don't eat them.  All right, I think it's starting to look fun.  Daniella and Tone-Tone got all the poppy seeds off the cake,  and it was really starting to come together.  Let's maybe just get a tag.  We're just gonna write ""Happy Birthday. ""  All right, cool.  All right, guys. What do we think?  How do we like it?  WOMAN: I like the robot. This cake is really cute.  What's your favorite part, Mauro?  I got to admit, it's the soldiers.  I think they came out nice.  The piano is nice, too, but the soldiers came out nice.  -BUDD Y: Come on, Fluffy. -What now?  We got to go deliver this. We're going to New York.  Say goodbye.  Geronimo.  Have fun at the toy store.  All right, everybody got a corner?  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, guys. Follow the toy soldier.  Okay, Mauro, hold your hands. Two hands.  Watch out.  Stay out of the way of that dummy.  Oh, we're flat already. We're good.  All right. Whew!  Oh, here it comes.  -[ Fanfare plays .] -Whoa!  [ Chuckling .] Oh, my God!  Geez!  Wow! Look at that!  Oh, my God!  What a reaction.  Everybody went berserk.  The boys came over, they saw the cake, and they were loving it.  Oh, it was beyond what I ever thought it could be.  So, guys, first off,  I want to wish Harrison and Christopher a happy birthday.  And I had so much fun making your birthday cake.  Did you say thank you to Buddy for making you a cake?  Thank you.  BUDD Y: Anytime!  Thank you very much. It's absolutely amazing.  Thank you.  See you later, Harrison. Give me five!  All right! And, Christopher.  Thank you so much. I appreciate it.  Enjoy your day, guys.  Have a good day. Thanks again.  Who wants a G-flat? There you go.  BUDD Y: Come on up for the weigh-in.  Come on, girls!  All right, Tone-Tone, let's get ready.  Let's get the scale.  The final weigh-in.  We're gonna see who lost the most weight --  me and my boys or my sisters.  Just to remind everyone, if the girls win,  the guys are gonna work downstairs for a day.  If the guys win, the girls are gonna do the dishes for a day.  This week we all tried to exercise,  we all tried to eat less.  Tony, you just say how much weight the person lost.  TON Y: Buddy lost 4. 4 pounds.  4. 4-- 41/2 pounds.  Team leader!  TON Y: Mauro lost 6. 4 pounds.  Yeah! Mauro!  TON Y: Danny lost 6. 4 pounds.  BUDD Y: Yeah!  All right. Frankie lost 15. 8 pounds.  BUDD Y: Yeah!  The anchor! That's the anchor!  I told you!  I think the boys definitely won.  Whoo-hoo!  -I lost -4 pounds.  Yeah!  4. 4 pounds for Mary.  That's 8!  You lost 7. 2 pounds.  7. 2!  7. 2 pounds! Whoo-hoo!  Grace lost 7. 6 pounds.  The girls, at the end of the day, lost a lot of weight, too,  but it's done by percentages,  so I didn't know how the outcome was gonna come.  I just hope it was in our favor.  The guys' total weight loss was 33.2 pounds,  which was 2.76%.  The girls lost 24.5 pounds,  which equaled a percentage of 3.4%,  which makes them the winners.  [ Screaming .]  We're going to the spa!  BUDD Y: Even though we didn't win,  I'm happy that we all lost weight.  Tony, now burn that paper. [ Laughs .]  So you know, customers come first.  You got to help the customers.  BUDD Y: Yeah, we know.  You guys ready? How can I help you, sir?  This week was a crazy fun week.  I mean, there was yelling, screaming, laughter.  A great reaction from everybody.  God bless. I love it!"
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  25-cent cannolis!  Every year at Carlo's, we do a cannoli throwback event.  Hey, Danny, you mixed the cannoli cream?  Yeah.  It's 90 degrees in the back. The thing is out.  What were you thinking? It's sour.  I got like 1, 000 cannoli shells ready,  and now I got, like, nothing to fill them with.  These guys wanted to kick off the dragon-boat season.  Where's the other ones?  He told me just to make one.  He's got to make a cake.  What is he gonna do? When do we ever say, "" Make one""?  I only heard you once.  So, are you the liar, or are you the liar?  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   I just don't want to do a freaking boat  on top of a sheet cake.  What if we do it round?  No, I totally see what you're saying.  I think even the dragons could kind of like wrap  over the edge of the cake.  I had this consultation today with these two captains  of a dragon-boat-racing team.  These guys wanted to kick off the dragon-boat season.  We are having a fund-raiser.  We thought it would be a great thing  to have a centerpiece of a cake.  I don't want to sound stupid,  but I don't know too much about dragon-boat racing.  You're not stupid.  A little uneducated about dragon-boat racing.  It's mostly wooden boats that's in a shape of a dragon.  KEITH: Generally, there's about 20 paddlers on each boat.  There's a guy in the front drumming  and the guy in the back steering the whole boat.  It kind of started off as a traditional thing.  And nowadays it's evolved more into an actual sport.  We race all across North America.  Actually, we've gone internationally, too.  Awesome.  We understand you have a lot of ideas,  but we want to make sure that the Chinese culture  is definitely in everything that this cake's gonna turn out.  So we want to tie the culture  and the whole idea of dragon boat all together.  I am going to make you guys a fantastic dragon-themed cake.  We're gonna respect the culture.  I won't let you down.  TITIA: Awesome.  BUDD Y: The idea behind a dragon-boat cake  is to make this really big bottom, like a 24-inch round.  And around the bottom of that cake,  I was gonna have two dragon heads  with bodies kind of racing around the bottom tier.  And then I was gonna make another two tiers on top of it,  and we were going to do some hand painting  of some dragon boats  and then Chinese houses  and really bring in the culture in the hand painting.  Listen, authentic, authentic, authentic.  Let's do what we got to do. Let's go.  You guys start making the dragon heads.  The focal point of this dragon-boat cake  is the dragons' heads.  The heads are made  out of cereal treats and modeling chocolate.  DAN I ELLA: We should make them the same size.  BUDD Y: They're gonna mold and shape the cereal treats  to get the basic shape and size.  So that they'll fit on top of the cake,  those heads need to be about the size of a softball.  Do this in two parts.  How we doing?  Okay.  I want to do 30 pounds of cannolis.  All right, I'll make the mix.  Let's get cracking.  Every year at Carlo's, we do a cannoli throwback event.  For one day, we have a stand outside,  and we sell cannolis for what we sold them for in 1964.  25-cent cannolis!  WOMAN: All right, who's next?  Just a little way to give back to the community,  to let them know that we're here  and we love them and we appreciate them.  We got to make lots of cannolis,  and we got to make one giant cannoli.  I want to use that as a display.  I think it'll be cool.  The cannoli recipe we use  is the same recipe that my father brought over with him  from Sicily.  I mean, that's been around for a long, long time.  To make the dough for the cannoli shells,  we start with sugar and shortening.  Then we add the vinegar to that  to make the shell flaky and tender.  Next, flour, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Now that I got the cannoli dough mixing,  I'm ready to stack the dragon cake.  Joey!  Send me up that sponge!  Huh?  Please, for the big 24-inch round.  The plan is to do vanilla and chocolate layers  with chocolate-fudge filling.  This is what we're doing, right?  BUDD Y: Where's the other ones?  Just got the one.  Who said one?  One cake.  I need three pieces for this.  They only made the one.  The other two, I got to put in the oven now.  I said to make three pieces.  What happened?  This is a 24-inch round. It's not a cupcake.  By the time they take this cake mix, put it in the oven,  bake it, and let it cool down,  you're talking four or five hours.  He told me just to make one.  Frankie, you told me to make one.  He's got to make a cake. When do we ever say, "" Make one""?  I said, ""Sal, Buddy wants three  of the biggest form we have, round. ""  I only heard you once.  -You screwed up. -I screwed up?  No. Frankie's fault.  -It's my fault? -Yeah, your fault.  So, are you the liar, or are you the liar?  You don't want to be responsible.  You don't want to be responsible.  You don't want to be responsible.  I was busy.  I said, ""Frankie, just go down.  Tell Sal to throw three 24s in the oven --  one vanilla, two chocolate. ""  Between Frankie and Sal -- they've been here long enough  where they should be able to make three 24-inch sponge  without me having to get aggravated.  Put the sponge in the oven.  Get it to me as fast as you can.  At this time, there's nothing else we can do.  We got it all under control. Don't worry about it.  You're gonna have the sponge. Don't worry.  Let's go. Let's go.  Yeah, black and white.  Let's roll out the giant cannoli.  Every year for the cannoli event,  I make this giant cannoli.  -You got the pipe? -Yeah.  I take the cannoli dough,  and I wrap it around a piece of pipe.  This is the centerpiece  of our whole little cannoli stand outside.  People get such a kick out of seeing this.  This giant cannoli is, like, 26 inches long, okay?  And it's 6-inch-diameter hole.  I'm gonna sink it.  And I deep-fry it.  Frying this giant cannoli is really a one-shot deal,  because the oil could, like, just bubble and come out  and make the cannoli crack.  SAL: It's hot.  We got it, we got it, we got it.  Whoo-hoo!  Good job.  A lot of cannolis are gonna go in there.  It looks good.  Here's your cake.  Finally, I get the chocolate sponge brought up by Joey,  and I can start this dragon cake.  So, the first thing I do is fill it.  I'm doing a black-and-white cake  with lots of chocolate fudge between the layers.  One, two, three.  Now, after I fill this black-and-white cake,  I'm gonna dirty-ice it to get it set up to put the fondant on.  And I'm like, ""Let me put it in the fridge  so that it can cool down a little bit. ""  I was shopping with your wife yesterday.  Your anniversary is coming up.  This week is me and my wife Lisa's  8-year wedding anniversary,  and I really want to do something special.  I feel really bad.  I mean, I've been working so much.  It's 12, 18 hours a day.  If you've been busy, it'll mean a lot.  Take a little time.  Plan something. Do something special with her.  Put some consideration in it, and it means a lot to women.  I agree. I won't let her down.  -Good luck. -Thanks.  It's a special anniversary, cousin.  It's going to be eight years.  Eight years.  Talking with Grace got me thinking.  I want to do something really nice for Lisa --  something unique.  I mean, I need to show her how much she really means to me.  I decided to replicate the top tier of our wedding cake.  I also wanted to do the special filling I made for Lisa.  It's checkerboard. This is how you do it.  What you have to do is take layers of vanilla cake  and layers of chocolate cake,  and you cut even circles of each cake.  And you take out one of the chocolate rings  and you put the vanilla ring.  And then the chocolate ring and then a vanilla ring.  It's kind of like black, white, black, white in a line.  Checkerboard cake is all about when you cut it.  When you cut into a slice of checkerboard cake,  it looks like a checkerboard --  black, white, black, white, black, white.  I n between each layer of checkerboard sponge,  I spread some chocolate ganache,  chocolate mousse, fresh raspberries.  This is a special cake.  Once the cake is dirty-iced and covered in white fondant,  it's flower time.  For this cake, I used some roses, some hydrangeas,  and some eucalyptus.  It looks good. All done.  It looks like the top tier of your wedding cake.  I should know. I was there.  I think my wife's gonna like it.  -She's gonna love it. -Beautiful.  -Hey, Danny. -Yes, sir?  M ix me a batch of cannoli cream -- about 150 pounds.  I got to do that cannoli-fest thing.  -All right. Get it done. -Okay.  BUDD Y: To make cannoli cream, you start with impastata,  which is ricotta cheese that has a very smooth texture.  Then we add fresh ricotta,  sugar, vanilla,  cinnamon oil, diced melon,  and chocolate chips.  All right. Come on, man.  I want to get these cannolis done.  I got to do 60 pounds of cannoli dough.  Come on, man, we got a lot of cannolis!  We got to move it!  We roll out the cannoli on the sheeter,  and then we roll it back up on a rolling pin.  We have a cutting board that we lay it out on,  and we lay it in layers.  So it's layer and layer and layer and layer and layer.  We have a cutter, and we have to cut through.  'Cause it's layered and you cut through,  out of every cut, you can get three, four, five cannolis.  MAURO: Holy cannoli.  BUDD Y: Somebody takes those cannolis  and lay them out on a board.  After it's lined up on the boards,  then it goes to the sticking process.  You take your cannoli shell, which is oval shaped,  you take the wooden stick, put it inside.  You flop one side over and then the other side.  The two sides are held together with a little bit of egg wash.  Then it goes into the deep fryer, man.  Fry our cannoli shells in lard.  That's the trick, okay?  Not vegetable shortening. Lard.  That's the best-tasting cannoli you can get.  Nice and crispy.  Once we get a batch of shells fried up,  we got to take them upstairs and fill them with cream.  Hey, Danny, you mixed the cannoli cream?  Yeah.  It's 90 degrees in the back. The thing is out.  It's sitting on the floor.  You don't leave cannoli cream out in the oven room.  It's gonna spoil!  You're telling me that you left the cannoli cream in the back  in 90 degrees  and you didn't put it in the refrigerator?  Whoa, whoa, whoa. You called me upstairs.  But you should have told me you weren't finished with it!  That's what I said to you.  You didn't tell me that you weren't finished with it!  You said, "" I'm gonna finish the cream. ""  Danny, it's 100 degrees.  You got to do something, you got to finish it!  -You need help? -Flip it.  Okay, tablecloth?  BUDD Y: What were you thinking?  It's sour.  DANN Y: How can it be sour?  I only left it outside for two minutes.  Come on, man!  You know better than this!  DANN Y: I only left it two minutes.  That's all I did. Two minutes.  Cannolis!  We don't have the cannoli cream yet, Grace.  BUDD Y: I can't believe it. Just get out of here.  I can't believe I got to throw this whole batch out.  It's all spoiled.  I got this cannoli event in a few minutes.  M y sisters are setting up outside.  People are already lining up.  I've got like 1, 000 cannoli shells ready,  and I got nothing to fill them with.  Scale out the sugar. I'm gonna get the cheese.  We got to get it done. This cannoli thing is happening.  Come on.  So, Sal and I, we got to bust our butts  making a whole nother batch of cannoli cream  because Danny left it out.  All right.  You know what, Sal?  If you fill them, I can just stuff them.  Yeah. All right.  BUDD Y: The giant cannoli is the centerpiece  for the cannoli event.  This thing took like 150 cannolis  to stuff this giant cannoli.  There was cannolis falling out this thing.  MAMA: The best cannolis you're ever gonna taste.  They're the real thing -- here at Carlo's.  -Look at that cannoli! -Wow.  MAMA: Let's hear it for him. That's the cake boss.  [ Cheering .]  BUDD Y: People really love to see the giant cannoli  with the little cannolis coming out.  I mean, it's like you just want to dig into it.  GRACE: Holy cannoli!  It is cannoli day at Carlo's!  At Carlo's, what we do is fill the cannolis fresh.  Right there. You take a bite of it,  you can feel the shell crisp in your mouth.  It's just like, ""Forget about it. ""  -Keep filling, Lisa. -I'm filling, Grace.  BUDD Y: I got a line going up the block, around the corner.  I got to stand there and pump out cannolis like a machine.  I got boxes of shells.  I got somebody just filling the bag up,  and I'm just filling cannolis like a maniac.  But my customers really appreciate it,  so it was awesome.  Maddy, pass the powdered sugar.  COOKI E: It's great that they're doing this.  I love the cannolis because of the filling.  The filling's the best.  BUDD Y: I mean, we definitely sold over 1, 000 cannolis.  At 25 cents a pop, what do you think?  How could you go wrong?  While I was outside at the cannoli event,  Toni and Daniella were inside working on the heads  of the dragon-boat cake.  They put red and white modeling chocolate  on top of the cereal-treat base  so that they could really sculpt it.  Toni and Daniella are two of my most talented artists.  They're not really cake people. They're more artists.  So they sculpt, they paint. They do more of that.  I usually give them assignments where it's intricate detail.  Once the heads are sculpted into the shape that we want,  we add a little luster dust to add texture and shine.  Then come extra details like edible beads and teeth  and eyes made out of chocolate.  So, the dragon-boat cake is a three-tiered cake  that I'm stacking off-centered  so to have a little room around the bottom tier  so the dragons could kind of coil their way around.  One, two, three.  How are the heads? They done?  We're done, yeah.  They look awesome.  But I got to tell you, guys,  you really, really screwed me with the size of these heads.  I look at these dragon heads, and they were freaking big.  I said ""softball, "" and they made bowling balls.  That affects things.  As good as they look, it's really, really a setback,  because now I have to change the whole design of the cake.  Now I got these huge dragon heads.  It changes everything, because I only have about this much room  to fit a dragon head that's this big.  So, I mean, I'm in trouble.  I know it's a different idea,  but I think it might end up looking  better.  You don't think that these heads are too big for this cake?  Honestly?  It can fit, like, on the front of it.  It doesn't have to sit on the center.  The head can be coming off a little bit.  It could?  Right?  No, 'cause it's got to be supported.  This doesn't fit.  This monster is bigger than the 10-inch.  This thing barely fits on here -- the whole thing.  Put one up here, on top of the 10-inch, facing this way.  BUDD Y: Alls I got to say is,  ""Thank God I got Mauro watching my back. ""  It barely fits on there -- just the small one.  BUDD Y: Because we put our heads together,  we came up with a new direction for this cake.  I guess we could kind of wrap his body here  and then his body comes around here.  Crisscrossing in the back.  I wasn't happy that I had to change it,  but you got to do what you got to do.  I scrapped the water painting on it,  and I figured we'll just do bigger dragon bodies  and make the dragons a more predominant part of the cake.  I'm like, "" Mauro, let's get the cereal treats,  and let's make the bodies. ""  We kind of rolled them up and made the bodies  like a coily, dragony, snake type of thing.  Give me the buttercream bag.  -Hey, Danny. -Yes, sir?  Make me red. Add a little modeling chocolate to it.  It's got to be, like, you know, red to go with this.  I got a great idea for the scales.  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a textured rolling pin  that's like a cobblestone.  We took that, and we kind of wrapped it around the cake.  And then what we'll do is where the seam is,  we'll cut, like, a gold strip.  To decorate them a little bit.  BUDD Y: Then I called over Christine,  who's actually really, really innovative and talented,  and she cut me out some different wavy patterns  that we put on the side  so it kind of represents the water and the dragons.  And then I used airbrush to add gold highlights  to the entire cake.  And, I mean, it looked hot.  She looks all done.  I think that even though we had a mishap  with the heads being too big,  it turned out to be awesome.  I think it looks better than the original design.  I think it worked out.  We had to change the design a little bit.  We had a little mishap here and there,  but, in the long run, we made everything work  and it looks good.  They're going to be happy.  Good job, team.  Let's pack this puppy up, and let's go.  It's a heavy dragon.  Whoo!  [ Cheering .]  -Thank you. Thank you. -Thank you.  It's an amazing cake.  -You guys like it? -Yeah.  Everybody say thank you!  ALL: Thank you!  [ Cheering .]  Thank you, Buddy.  BUDD Y: I mean, they went nuts. They totally loved it.  It was awesome.  -It was our pleasure. -Thank you.  Can we eat this? We can eat this, right?  Of course you can eat it! This is yours.  Hi. Good evening.  -How are you? -How you doing?  BUDD Y: Tonight I'm taking my wife, Lisa,  to Le Cirque in the city.  And we're gonna celebrate our wedding anniversary.  I know I've been working a lot.  12, 18 hours a day.  I understand.  But tonight's our anniversary,  and I really wanted tonight to be special.  I feel like we're dating again.  [ Laughter .]  I'll never forget when we got married --  how beautiful you looked that day.  I have a little something for you.  LISA: Really?  -Close your eyes. -Okay.  Close them. Keep them closed.  Open.  Oh, my God!  It's the top tier of our wedding cake!  See, lots of guy could cheat and buy flowers.  You hand-made these all by yourself.  BUDD Y: Every one of them.  I didn't let nobody help me with it.  It means even more.  And she was just floored,  because she remembers our wedding cake.  And then when she cut into it and got a slice of it,  she was even more happy,  because it was her favorite filling.  Checkerboard.  -That's for you. -Thank you.  I mean, it was really a spectacular evening."
"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  What I want to do is to have fire.  That's really pushing the envelope.  I mean, I don't make cakes that spit fire.  Children, do not try this at home.  No. I don't like this cake.  Yeah, but I already started it.  The last place I want to be is in the doghouse  for my wife and my mother-in-law.  -You think you could do better? -I could do it blindfolded.  This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   -How's that? -Perfect.

Bye.  All right. Bye-bye.  Hey, Luis. How are you, man?  How's everything? Good to see you.  -It's that time of year. -[ Laughs .]  -So I figured I'd come in. -Big birthday bash.  I have a client  who gets his birthday cake from me every year.  And every year, he wants me to up the ante.  He wants me to do something crazier, something different.  One year, he did, like, a '50s-themed thing.  He did a black-tie party.  He did a casino theme.  You know, he really wants the cakes  to be the crowning jewel of his party.  So the theme this year is gonna be tiki.  -Tiki? -Yeah. Tiki party.  Everyone's gonna be in, like, luau gear.  Floral. There's gonna be fire dancers.  So the big thing, the big finale, is gonna be,  after the fire dancers and everything,  you put the cake down.  And then when everybody sees it, all of a sudden,  like, this big flame comes out.  So we got incorporate fire somehow in this cake?  -[ Laughs .] -And then, you know, that's  That's really pushing the envelope.  I know you can do it. That's why I come here.  BUDD Y: So when Luis said tiki theme,  I already got a picture in my mind of, like,  erupting volcanoes and tiki heads all around.  For the fire,  I'll start with burning tiki torches in each corner.  But for the real wow factor that Luis is looking for,  I'm gonna do a giant tiki god  with real fire shooting out of its mouth.  I mean this cake is gonna be hot -- smoking hot!  MAN: Is that long enough, you think?  MAURO: Yeah. This is gonna go  It's going to go even like that.  It'll be like three inches long.  And I'll put a pipe through there.  And you stand behind it, and you just -- poof! --  put a puff through.  And it'll come out the thing's mouth.  The way I'm gonna make this cake spit fire  is make the tiki god like a big mask.  And then we're gonna get an actual fire-breather  to stand behind the cake and do his thing  through a hole in the tiki god's mouth.  You've heard of putting a lady in a cake.  I'm putting a fire-breather!  All right. Take it easy, brother.  Bye-bye.  All right, so let's fill this cake up.  MAURO: You filling it once or twice?  DANN Y: Three.  MAURO: You're filling it three?  DANN Y: Black and white.  BUDD Y: This cake has got to feed 125 people.  The big base is gonna be black-and-white cake,  which is alternating layers of chocolate and vanilla sponge.  And we're doing like a truffle filling in between the layers.  Hey! Look who's here.  What's up? It's my cousin Vinny.  What's up, cuz?  -How you doing? -Doing good. Doing good.  BUDD Y: Cousin Vinny's my first cousin on my mother's side.  And he's marrying my wife's sister, Daniela.  Carlo's Bakery has found a lot of love over these years.  Of course, it starts with my mom and dad.  And in this generation, you got Mauro and Madeline,  you got Grace and Joey, you got Lisa and Remy.  you got me and my wife.  We got so many people who actually met through the bakery.  Now we got cousin Vinny and my sister-in-law Daniela.  And I promised to do a cake for their bridal shower.  This is the luggage.  This is the gift box.  This is kind of like another type of luggage --  like a little more fun.  I don't know. Maybe mix it up a little.  I kind of like the colors more on this cake.  She does like pinks. Maybe this style.  Maybe bring in some of these colors.  We can do that. That's very good, cuz.  You got the creative gene in you. [ Laughs .]  All right, cuz. I'll make you a beautiful cake.  I love you.  All right, cuz. I'll see you later, man.  Take it easy, brother.  Let's cut the sponge.  So I got Danny started on the shower cake.  It's gonna be nice. Three tiers.  It's gonna be done in shades of pink fondant, stacked,  so it looks like a stack of luggages.  It's one of our most popular cakes.  Gonna put up the whipped cream?  DANN Y: I'm gonna put a pot up.  Since 1925, this machine.  She still runs, every day.  DANN Y: So this cake is for your sister-in-law --  She's getting hitched?  Another dummy, Danny.  Heh. I'm on your side.  BUDD Y: Things are going good. The tiki cake is happening.  The luggage cake is coming together.  Everybody's just rocking and rolling.  Then Mauro's got like a puss on.  What's wrong?  I heard you're crying about something with cakes.  There's a lot of work to be done.  Everything still has to get iced.  You want this thing to shoot out fire, do this, do that.  There's still a lot of stuff that's got to get done on it.  You're icing the friggin' cake. That's the easiest part.  It should be going like lightning.  You think you could do better?  Icing the cake? I could do it blindfolded.  I will ice the cake, put a flower on the cake, blindfolded.  Buddy's always talking smack.  But I thought it was about time  that he would put his money where his mouth is.  Blindfolded and fast. That's how I do.  I don't want to know what the bet is.  I just want to see you do it.  How about you in a grass skirt and coconut bra  in front of the bakery handing out cupcakes?  -lf I win, what do I get? -I'll do the same thing.  I'll be outside in a grass skirt, in my coconuts.  Guaranteed that you're gonna be in the skirt.  I'll get the sponge. No problem.  Here.  I'm gonna get the blindfold, 'cause you ain't cheating.  You blindfold me. I want you to.  Okay.  BUDD Y: So you know what? Me and my big mouth.  I go and I'm like, ""Hey, Mauro, I could do this blindfolded. ""  He's like, ""Oh, yeah, bigmouth? Let's see it. ""  FRANKI E: He can't see what the hell he's doing.  [ Laughter .]  That's the easy part.  All right.  -Ooh, chef! -Yeah.  Beautiful.  Oh, my. Oh!  [ Laughs .]  Yeah!  Who's your daddy?!  For blindfolded, I'll give it to you.  Tiki outfit.  I don't want to sound cocky, but I did it.  And I can't wait to see Mauro in a tiki outfit.  Now, this is nice! Look at this thing.  Who wants to see Mauro in a grass skirt? Anybody?  Yeah, but not with the chef coat.  -No, it looks funny. -Let me take this off.  I can't believe I got to do this, but  BUDD Y: Listen, it's tiki. It's tiki time.  No. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

""  We got such a reaction.  It was so much fun. It was hilarious.  He's got a Hawaiian shirt on. You got to lei him. Come on.  You want to get lei'd. You know you do.  -You like purple? -Yes.  Goes good with your pink, right? Aloha. All right.  Come on! She's going to Hawaii too.  M y favorite customer. Every day she's here. Every day.  All right? Aloha.  BUDD Y: M y decorators were laughing their butts off.  I mean, they had so much fun with it.  And I was like, ""All right. Let's get back to work. ""  'Cause we really got to get moving on the shower cake  for my sister-in-law.  She's kind of a chocoholic.  So we're doing chocolate cake and hazelnut filling  and chocolate ganache.  That's ganache!  So I'm making progress.  I'm getting things done with this luggage cake.  I got Danny, who filled it, and I iced it.  Now I'm rolling out fondant to knock it out.  And who strolls in?  -Hi, guys. -Hello.  M y wife and my mother-in-law.  -Hey, Bud. -Hey.  -Hi, Buddy. -Hi, Mom. How you are?  I'm good. I'm good. Everything is good.  We wanted to know how the cake was gonna be for Sunday.  Oh, it's all set. Vinny came in.  Look. He picked out an awesome cake.  I thought he was coming in today with us.  BUDD Y: He came in yesterday. He picked out the luggage cake.  He says he likes that cake but in these colors.  -What is this? -LISA: It's a suitcase.  Oh, no. I don't want a suitcase. I want a jewelry box.  No, this cake is not gonna be happening.  I don't like this cake.  I mean, how the hell is it my luck  that Vinny comes here yesterday and orders the cake, okay,  then my mother-in-law and wife  come the next day to change the order?  Don't these people communicate?  Don't they know that they should have spoke  and came to me together?  But, Danny, what did Vinny say yesterday?  He wants the luggage.  It's not our theme. Our theme is jewelry.  Yeah, but I already started it.  I understand, but you restart cakes  all the time for everybody, and this is for us.  I know you can pull this off. So we got to change this.  BUDD Y: The last place I want to be  is in the doghouse for my wife and my mother-in-law.  So I got to do what I got to do.  All right, Danny. We got to make another cake.  Thank you, ladies.  GLOR IA: With a big smile, Danny, will you, please?  BUDD Y: We are so lucky we didn't get very this far on the cake.  Despite the changes, we can still use the same tiers.  So the theme for this wedding shower is jewelry.  We found this vintage jewelry holder.  And as soon as I saw that, the light clicked off in my head.  I knew exactly what I was gonna do.  The first thing I got to do is put Daniella  to make the mannequin out of modeling chocolate.  So Daniella started here about a year ago,  and she's got a lot of talent.  She's been doing good.  So I want to challenge her a little bit  and see what she can do with a little bit harder project.  DAN I ELLA: I think my skills  and strengths as an artist are sculpture.  I went to school for fine arts. I have a bachelor in fine arts.  I always liked sculpting out of clay when I was in art school.  So now it's been nice because I can use the modeling chocolate.  Or like this. And I printed six of these.  BUDD Y: Meanwhile, I had Sunshine print me out some edible decals,  and I started putting them on the tiers of the cake.  The idea here is that the tiers are jewelry boxes,  and on top of them we'll put the jewelry stand.  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna pipe a royal-icing border  in white here and here.  And we're gonna paint it in gold.  Think that'll look nice.  Done.  BUDD Y: Get the buttercream. Let's put the volcano on top.  So the centerpiece of this tiki cake is gonna be a volcano,  the giant, fire-breathing tiki head on top of that.  Now, this thing is huge. I mean, it's gonna be heavy.  So, what we got to do is build a support structure  out of wooden dowels.  And then on that  we put pound cake for the base of the volcano.  Personal opinion is we should screw the head on right now.  That's my opinion. If you ask me.  BUDD Y: You know, the mask looks great.  It's proportionate. Everything is right.  But I just wasn't happy with the way the thing was wiggling.  Let's put the screws in.  I mean, that thing was probably like 31/2 foot tall.  And that mask was heavy.  And I was afraid that it was gonna go down.  That ain't going no place.  I don't think it's going anywhere.  You just got to keep filling it in.  We added a bunch of cereal treats  to fill up the structure.  Then we dirty-iced it  and wrapped the volcano with fondant.  All these things keep that head stable.  So I was just like, you know, let it be up to the tiki gods.  If this cake's going down, it's going down.  I'm like, this is the best I can do.  -How is this, ""D""? -DAN I ELLA: It's done.  Wow.  You did an excellent job. I really love it.  The first time I saw Daniella's mannequin,  I was floored.  I held the real mannequin next to the cake one,  and everybody couldn't even believe how close it was.  I mean, it looked exactly like it.  That was really phenomenal.  Really, really love it. Give me five.  Thank you.  BUDD Y: She's doing an awesome job.  I mean, this is probably the best work she ever did here.  And I'm really proud of what she's doing.  And I know it's gonna really make the cake.  All right, now, pass the jewels.  So I had Sunshine, Christine, and Liz making me the jewels,  and I started sticking them on the cakes.  And the more I put, the better the cake looked.  I added a couple other elements, like a purse and a shoe.  Everything made out of fondant and modeling chocolate.  All right, ladies and gentlemen. What do you think?  -Looks awesome. -Amazing.  -MAN: Daniella did amazing. -WOMAN: She so did.  Just great that we were able to pull this off  in modeling chocolate and sugar.  I love the jewels. I love the patterns.  Every little detail really, really looks awesome.  I mean, look at the end result.  And everybody worked hard on it,  and together we did an awesome job.  I really -- I'm really happy with the end result.  So they got an actual fire-breather over there?  Yeah, he's gonna go in and go [Exhales loudly.]  through the mask.  The biggest challenge with this tiki cake  is making this thing spit fire.  I mean, I don't make cakes that spit fire.  Things could melt. Things could go wrong.  I don't want the fondant to get burnt.  So we're gonna test it out now.  'Cause I don't want to look like no chooch later.  You got the torch? All right.  Let me see.  ""Danger -- flammable. ""  WOMAN: I'll stay away.  We got to do this as a test run, okay?  Children, do not try this at home.  All right. Lights off.  Let's do it with the lights off.  It's do or die.  When it bring it there, if this thing melts or goes down,  I'm in trouble.  -Ready, chef? -MAURO: Ready.  More, more, more.  Oh, man.  DANN Y: Yeah!  Yeah, man.  That's it. Yeah.  -That looked good. -Ha ha!  BUDD Y: So it looks like this thing  is gonna be able to breathe fire after all.  All right, let's finish this bamboo.  Now I got to finish this cake  and deliver it to the tiki party.  So I'm putting the last finishing touches on this cake.  Around the bottom over here.  I covered the mouth with a little bit of fondant  so that it looks like you don't really see the pipe inside.  Is the lava ready? All right. Let's put the lava on.  And it's starting to come together.  The tiki torches are there. The mask is there.  -Let it fall. -WOMAN: It looks good.  BUDD Y: We put embellishments on the mask  to look it a little more tribal.  And it really looked awesome.  Maybe we'll lay some bamboo on the top  if we have any extra bamboo.  And lastly, I put some bright tropical-colored flowers on it.  It really set the tone and the mood for the cake.  It needed some color, and now we have some color.  At the end, everybody was passing flowers,  we were all working together,  and the cake was coming awesome.  WOMAN: Buddy, it's go time. Come on.  You know it. It's time to do this.  Do we have any more tiger lilies?  Very tropicale.  End result was killer.  We nailed it.  All right. I think he's gonna love it.  Come over and check it out.  Everything looks awesome.  I like the tiki torches. I feel good.  I can't wait tonight to see this thing spit fire.  WOMAN: I definitely came together.  BUDD Y: I think it looks awesome.  All right, everybody put their hands in for the tiki.  One, two, three.  -Tiki! -Tiki!  [ Cheering .]  -Okay. -We're off.  -Wait. -You guys good?  -Yeah, I'm good. -Let's go.  [ Cheering .]  Cool!  Hey, Luis. How are you?  Happy birthday. Happy birthday.  I couldn't be happier for you.  We make your birthday cake every year.  This one, I think, is tops, bud.  I think this one really looks awesome.  And I'm thinking to myself,  ""These people don't even know what they got coming for them.  They think that they like the cake now?  Can you imagine when it spits fire?""  All right, ladies and gentlemen. The show is about to begin.  Okay, this cake does more than just have the tiki torches.  So I find the fire-breather. He comes over.  This guy looks like a fire-breather.  I'm like, ""Dude, you're loco. You're a little crazy.

"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  We want something different for our wedding, and unique.  I had the idea to have the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Ooh, interesting.  She's a-shaking, but she ain't going.  Happy birthday.  [ Laughter .]  -The party's tonight. -Tonight?  He needs it tonight!  Start doing it. You're on your own.  There's your lobster.  You got me live lobsters?  Whoa-oh!  -Oh, my God. -KEVI N: Oh, my God.  BUDD Y: This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   All right, guys. Team meeting.  I got a cake for the bride and groom,  and they're really big on traveling to Italy,  so they thought, ""Why not the Leaning Tower of Pisa?""  We want something different for our wedding, and unique.  I had the idea to have the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Ooh, interesting.  And I just thought, only if it would be realistic.  Listen, that's not gonna be a boring, everyday wedding cake.  It's gonna be the Leaning Tower of Pisa, leaning.  -It's got to lean. -It's got to lean.  We want a Leaning Tower of Pisa.  We don't want a Fall-Over Tower of Pisa.  Well, I mean, listen. It's not gonna be easy.  Being Italian, I take that to, like, my pride, my heritage.  It's got to be a certain way.  It's gonna look like the tower,  and it's gonna lean like the tower, all righty?  Thank you. It was a pleasure meeting you today.  -Congratulations. -Thank you very much.  BUDD Y: For the Leaning Tower of Pisa,  I'm imagining this tall, tall cake.  It's gonna be like eight layers of cake.  We're gonna make every little column, every little detail.  We're gonna have a little bride and groom on a Vespa  that's actually gonna look like them.  I'm gonna take their pictures and make it look just like them.  So, the idea of making this cake lean  is we're gonna make this cake all nice and straight.  -That good? -It's not gonna go no place,  once this thing is bolted in here.  BUDD Y: Then I'm gonna take a shim  and put the shim in between two boards.  It's gonna make the cake lean a little bit.  MAURO: Just 1/4 of an inch -- Look how crooked it is already.  BUDD Y: And then I'm gonna screw her down so she can't tip over.  She's a-gonna lean, but she's a-not gonna fall.  Let's pull out all the sponge.  At this point, I got to ice and stack this cake.  We'll use 14s. 14s will work.  So, I immediately take Danny.  I start filling and icing, and he's cutting and trimming.  Don't try to cut too, too much off it.  And we're stacking it up. We're putting the supports in.  What do you think? Nice?  The inside of this cake is gonna be a pound cake,  and we're gonna use a buttercream filling.  And it's got to be perfect.  [ Exhales deeply .]  Give me the pegs.  We're lining up all the boards,  making sure that all the columns match up.  For the most part, they're pretty straight.  When you put the icing on, and I go with the cardboard,  what I'm doing is smoothing it out.  I'm trying to get every tier to be level  and have the same amount of buttercream around it  so that when I put the bricks on, number one, it sticks,  and, number two, that it all looks like it's even.  Two more.  This cake is gonna stand over 4' tall.  She's a-shaking, but she ain't going.  -WOMAN: Hi. -Hi. Is Buddy here?  You have an appointment with Buddy? Sure.  Come over here and have a seat.  Thanks so much. I appreciate it.  Hey, how you doing? I'm Buddy.  Buddy. M ichael. How are you?  How are you? How's everything going?  Great, man. Thanks for meeting me.  Oh, my pleasure. Anytime.  So, I've got this thing going on.  I'm the best man in a wedding for the first time in my life.  It's my best friend, Rob, okay?  I'm throwing a party for him on Friday.  -This is their engagement party? -Yep.  The party is a clam- and a lobster-bake on a roof-deck bar.  You know, I want, you know, something   you know, like  So, this guy kind of just didn't have an idea  of exactly what he wanted.  [ Laughs .]  So, tell me a little bit about the couple.  Rob is my main guy.  I've known Rob for probably 20 years.  Rob's been going out with Kim for 10 years.  -All right. -10 years?  10 years.  M inchia. They're not married yet?  It's kind of like they're taking the plunge.  Finally, after 10 years, they're taking the plunge.  I think we got to, like,  make that predominant on the cake somehow.  Clambake. I mean, I don't know.  When I think of a clambake, I think, like, a big pot.  You said lobsters, right?  Yep. Lobsters and clams, and I think  So, maybe we could do, like, a lobster bride and groom  on top of the pot, ready to make the plunge into the pot.  You can actually make that as a cake?  Yeah!  I think that could look really cool.  I mean, if you could actually pull that off  Come on! Of course.  You know I'm from Hoboken, brother.  You know I can do this for you.  Let's see how she leans.  MAURO: Sayonara.  [ Grunts .]  MAURO: Yeah, that's good. But it's still shaking.  BUDD Y: Stop!  All right, that's it. I don't want to lean no more.  Let's rock 'n' roll.  Let's work on this first. Let's mix the color.  So, the first thing we got to do is start putting bricks  around the inside layers of Pisa.  So we take the fondant, we roll it out thin,  and we have this little brick rolling pin.  We roll it out, we cut strips,  and we kind of blanket it around each tier.  I got it, I got it.  It's not leaning.  Not yet. It will lean.  Okay, I'm gonna start putting the sticks in.  Next thing we got to do is stick all the columns through.  Give me another stick.  After we stick all the columns through, we got to cover 'em.  Let's see what we have, arcs and edges,  so that we can maybe do something in there.  We wrap each column  with a piece of modeling chocolate and fondant.  As I look at the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the photographs,  I noticed that each little column  has, like, little columns on the top and bottom.  So what I do is I roll fondant out really thick,  and I cut a square.  And then I cut a circle out of the square  to make the room for the column in the inside,  and then I cut it with a scissor so I can wrap it around,  and it looks just like a column base.  MAURO: Starting to take shape. Starting to look good.  GRACE: Hello.  Hey, is Buddy around? It's kind of an emergency.  GRACE: Buddy, there's a M ichael here  to see you in regards to his cake.  Please come down. M ichael's here to see you.  Come down, please.  M ICHAEL: What's up, man? How are you?  What's up?  Remember I told you the party was on Friday?  Yeah.  Um, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but, uh  I kind of mixed up the dates, here.  The party's tonight.  -Tonight? -Yeah.  -Dude, I can't help you. -Did you make the cake yet?  Did I make the cake yet? Of course not!  It's for Friday. You're telling me tonight.  I mixed up the dates. I don't know what to do here.  You got to understand something.  I already have other work to do. This is, like  I didn't prep anything. I didn't start anything.  I mean  I can't tell you how awful I feel about this.  If I wasn't such a nice guy, I would have told him  to take his head and stuff it in a pot.  I'll do the best I can.  -I appreciate that. -No problem, man.  All right. I'll see you tonight.  All right. Thank you!  BUDD Y: You got it.  Frigging stupid guy with that clambake cake.  He needs it tonight!  -The pot and the lobster? -The pot and the lobster.  -For tonight? -Tonight, he wants it.  What am I gonna say to the guy?  He came in. He needed a cake for tonight.  N-O. No!  But you told him Y-E-S, yes?  Well, get on your high horse and start lobstering away.  BUDD Y: We're all busy.  Go ahead. Start doing it. You're on your own.  Go ahead. It's all yours, babe.  BUDD Y: What I did for the pot is I took 10-inch round cakes  and I just stacked them up and filled them.  And I covered the cake in fondant  and then making it look like it was silver,  like a silver pot -- We're gonna paint it silver  and then stick a lid on top.  Go get me some brown sugar, please.  So, I'm thinking about all the elements of a lobster-bake.  I'm thinking, if you're at the beach,  you got sand, you got boiling water.  And I'm like, ""Boiling water. What am I gonna do?""  Tone-Tone, I want you to go get me some ice.  A bag of ice?  BUDD Y: I immediately have this idea.  I'm gonna take ice, put it on a sheet pan,  and I'm gonna melt Isomalt.  And I'm gonna pour the burning-hot Isomalt  over the ice,  which, what's gonna happen is it'll melt the ice,  but it'll dry the Isomalt  to look like bubbling, boiling water.  While the Isomalt is drying,  I got a little time to add details to the Pisa cake.  The more we layer the details on, the nicer it's becoming.  You got to imagine, this is the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  This was done brick by brick.  That's kind of how we have to make it --  detail by detail by detail.  But the more details we're putting,  the better she's a-Iooking.  How's it look?  WOMAN: Beautiful.  BUDD Y: So, the Isomalt is dry, and it looks awesome.  I mean, it really looked like boiling water.  The next thing I had to do was mold the clamshells.  You need clams at a clambake, right?  So I took fondant, stuck them into a mold,  popped them out, let them dry a little bit.  Then I went back and painted them  with edible black petal dust.  The clams really looked like real clamshells.  It was beautiful.  What's up?  BUDD Y: I called Cousin Anthony.  I'm like, ""Go get me some lobsters. ""  I need some 3-D. I need some inspiration.  Go get me lobsters. I need lobsters.  -Get me lobsters. -All right. Whatever.  Hello? Guys!  We're busy!  You got to understand something. We have an intercom system.  Sometimes they say something,  and then we answer, and they don't hear us,  and it's like they think that we're doing it purposely,  and they take it offensively.  Guys! Guys.  Wha-a-a-t?!  LISA: Listen.  A gaming cake. What's the smallest one?  MAURO: Lisa, take a message, Lisa.  MAN: Somebody disconnect the phones.  LISA: A buddy box.  What?!  A buddy box.  MAURO: Take a message!  Lisa, I'm busy!  LISA: How many people?  I'm busy!  I can't hear with everybody screaming,  so if one person can pick up the phone and answer my question.  What?!  [ Telephone rings .]  I mean, seriously!  GRACE: Hello?  Why is she calling upstairs? We're busy up here.  Give them an hour. Take a message.  We'll call everybody back later.  Why don't you just tell them to do that?  I tell them all the time. I tell them all the time.  But they got to keep up here, breaking chops.  We have all this stuff to do.  BUDD Y: Every day, I got to come in.  I got to get my balls broken at work.  I got to hear this.  I tell you, when I drop dead, I'm gonna go right to heaven.  I'm gonna go to, like, sainthood.  Every day. [ M imicking nagging .]  So, for the Leaning Tower of Pisa cake,  I take Daniella, and I put her on making the Vespa  and the bride and groom.  She's a really good sculptor,  so I think it's a good job for her.  You got to understand something. I'm a perfectionist.  I mean, it's looking sharp, but I'm looking at it,  and it just doesn't look rustic enough.  Where's the brown?  So I'm like, ""Let's get some brown petal dust  and make it look a little antique. ""  You know, let's start painting some details on,  shadowing it a little bit.  And as we're doing it, it's really starting to come to life.  I mean, it's just looking great.  There's your lobster.  You got me live lobsters?  You wanted lobsters. I got you lobsters.  BUDD Y: Cousin Anthony comes back,  and he's holding two live lobsters.  Whoa-oh! No, no, no, no, no.  Oh, look. He even opened up his claw.  BUDD Y: [ Laughs .]  And I'm like, ""You know what? Let me look at it, ""  because seeing the lobsters actually wasn't a bad idea,  because it kind of helped me make my own.  There's nothing like having a live model in front of you.  It wasn't a bad idea.  Buddy! All right, listen.  I don't know what you think. You guys are --  You're playing with lobsters,  and I don't know what I got to do first downstairs.  We're busy!  And they start in [M imicking nagging.]  If I call the store and I have a couple questions,  just answer the question -- That's it!  -BUDD Y: I'm busy. -I know.  You're so busy, you're playing with lobsters.  GRACE: You're so busy.  I n this situation, I think my sisters had some valid points,  but for the most part, they had a lot of invalid points.  I didn't want to deal with them, so I just yes'd them to death.  You're absolutely right.  When we call upstairs to ask you about a cake,  I don't want to bust your balls.  But if I have a question, I want it answered.  You're absolutely right.  We have to run the front with your help.  [ Distorted .] So you need to help us run the front  so we can run it smoothly.  I do help youse run the front.  [ Distorted .] I want a couple answers when I call.  I agree.  [ Distorted .] I don't know what I got to do first downstairs.  Yeah.  Hello? Do you even  Are you even listening?  BUDD Y: I was like, ""Look, let's just make up.  Let's just whatever.  Let's work together and do what we got to do. ""  [ Mauro singing in Italian .]  So now I got to make these lobsters.  First thing I do is make red modeling chocolate.  So I start making the claws,  and I start doing all the little details on it.  I shape the head.  I make the tail. I do some veins in it.  I make all the little legs.  And then I put a little top hat on the groom,  and I'm gonna put a little veil on the bride.  It looks cool.  I went back with a little orange petal dust,  just to bring it down a shade  so it didn't look so red and black.  I wanted it to have some variations of orange in it.  The flames -- What I did is I took fondant.  And I rolled out different colors --  yellow, orange, and red --  and I kind of streaked it together.  And then I cut out little leaf patterns  that kind of looked like flames.  Then I just stuck them around.  I stick these two lobsters on.  I make their claws interlock, like they're holding claws.  I think that's really cute.  I lay all the clams around the base of the cake,  and the cake looked great.  I mean, it was awesome.  All right, guys. Come on over.  I love those lobsters.  Very impressed!  BUDD Y: The little lobsters looked good,  the Isomalt for the boiling water, the flames, the shells.  Everything looked great on this cake.  I can't believe I got this cake done  in about three, four hours.  I really knocked it out.  I want to eat one of these suckers.  MAN: That's a good idea.  All right, guys. See you later.  WOMAN: Have fun.  BUDD Y: Now I got to hurry up, get this cake in the car,  and get it over to the event,  'cause this thing's happening now.  [ Cheers and applause .]  Congratulations. I'm Buddy.  Thank you so much, Buddy.  I saved your you-know-what.  M ICHAEL: Exactly.  -KI M: Thank you. -You did a great job.  M y pleasure. Anytime.  I'm happy you guys like it. Enjoy it.  And it tastes as good as it looks.  Have a great day. Thanks!  [ Applause .]  Guys, I need someone to fix this flower, because, um  I smashed it by accident.  Who has the pink buttercream there?  Tone, do you know how to fix the flower?  They haven't showed me how to make buttercream flowers.  -They haven't? -No.  Isn't that, like, first day of school?  Kind of.  -Tone? -What?  I love you.  Happy birthday.  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: Here at Carlo's Bakery, we got a little tradition.  When it's your birthday,  we smash a little cake in your face.  I love you, though, Tone! That's with love.  It's with love!  BUDD Y: You don't know where it's coming from,  and all of a sudden, bada-boom!  TON Y: I know every year, they throw a cake in someone's face  when they're not expecting it for their birthday.  And I figured I was gonna get initiated.  But I thought, actually, Buddy would do it.  I didn't think it was gonna come from Mary.  She really got me.  That was good.  All right, listen.  We got to be really careful. Wait a second.  Let me see something.  Right there. That's the back.  We're gonna We're gonna lean it that way.  All right, we got to be really careful with this.  We don't want this to drop.  So, I finish this beautiful cake,  and now I got to make it lean, and my heart's racing,  because I'm like, ""What if this cake falls over?""  Let's get the screws.  MAURO: It's definitely leaning.  Okay.  [ Drill whirring .]  Be careful screwing it in, it don't tip over.  It's leaning towards you now.  BUDD Y: So, I take the bride and groom.  -MAURO: Turn it, turn it. -BUDD Y: That's it.  That's it, like that.  BUDD Y: I put them on the cake.  I step back, and I was like, ""Oh, my God.

"BUDD Y: On this episode of ""Cake Boss""  Oh!  When you think of fireworks, you think of the Grucci family.  This is the biggest cake we've ever done.  We got to go, man. This cake is sweating.  MAURO: The fondant's getting soft.  The walls are starting to turn.  BUDD Y: I know, I know, I know.  I want to do a little test with the fireworks.  We never put fireworks in cakes before.  WOMAN: Oh, my God, run! Run!  [ Explosion .]  BUDD Y: This is Carlo's Bakery.  Sugar   Every week, thousands of cakes and pastries go out these doors.  Oh, sugar, sugar   This is the crew. Mia famiglia.  Sugar   We're gonna take this bakery to the top.  They call me Buddy. I'm the boss.  Sugar   Oh, sugar, sugar   Hello.  FELIX: Hey, Buddy. How are you?  -I'm Buddy. -Hi. I'm Donna Grucci.  -Pleasure to meet you. -Nice to meet you.  Me and Mauro get this phone call.  We got to go out to Long Island to meet with the Grucci family.  When you think of fireworks, you think of the Grucci family.  They've done some of the biggest firework shows in the world,  like the Statue of Liberty centennial,  Times Square New Year's Eve, Brooklyn Bridge centennial,  presidential inaugurations, and the Olympics.  They, like, set the bar, the standard,  of what fireworks should be.  So, guys, you need a cake. What's the occasion?  M y dad's birthday.  And our dad was our founder and our inspiration.  And we would love to have a cake made in his honor.  Wow.  That's funny, because just a couple weeks ago,  I made a cake for my dad, and it was his memorial.  We honor him because he was our founder.  And now, because of the fireworks,  the families, the fathers, I got to make this cake crazy.  This is it. This has got to be the big one.  FELIX: The Grucci family has always been noted  for some fireworks shows in New York Harbor,  the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge.  So we were kind of hoping  that those types of landmarks might be incorporated  as well as fireworks.  We can provide you with some pyrotechnics,  and you can incorporate it into the piece.  That would be great.  Maybe what we could do is have the Statue of Liberty,  and then maybe we could have your dad  sitting at the base of it,  looking like he's gonna light a firework, like, to show.  We're all on the same page, and they're like,  ""Wait a second. We got a surprise for you. ""  You want to see a little fireworks?  Hopefully it'll get the juices pumping.  You got some fireworks for us?  FELIX: Want to give them the fire cue?  Aimfire!  Oh!  I love it!  Never been this close to fireworks.  I felt like I was a little kid. I had my own fireworks show.  How much better does it get than that  to inspire me to do the cake?  So, my idea is to do Hoboken, Manhattan,  and Brooklyn -- do the three landmasses.  Statue of Liberty in the harbor,  sitting between Hoboken and Manhattan.  Brooklyn Bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn.  I'm thinking these skyscrapers  are gonna be like 4, 5 foot tall.  And every structure on this cake  is gonna have fireworks shooting out the top.  It's gonna be nuts.  All right. Let's go, team.  The first thing I started doing was delegating.  I got Frankie, Christine, and Violet  cutting and filling the pound cake for the buildings.  How's it holding up with whatever we said? All right?  It's good with the skewers. It's easier.  It's easier? One, two, three.  The structure part of every building is a pipe.  And we're gonna run wires through there.  Then the Gruccis will attach the fireworks to the top.  I got Sunshine to start making the fondant.  I got Toni sculpting a modeling chocolate figure  that's gonna be M r. Grucci.  I got Daniella going on the structure  for the Statue of Liberty.  DAN I ELLA: Good, perfect. Okay.  To make the Statue of Liberty,  what we did is we started with a PVC pipe.  That's our frame.  We put a little ""T"" to act as her arm with her torch,  and we were gonna set fireworks out her torch.  The statue's gonna be all cereal treats.  Then we're gonna put modeling chocolate  wrapped around it to make the statue look like the Statue.  So I'm working like a maniac at the bakery,  and I get a phone call from my wife.  Hi, sweetheart.  And she's like, "" I just want to remind you that tomorrow,  for Buddy's school, it's Bring Your Dad to School Day. ""  Yeah. No, I know. I'm excited about it.  I think we should make little cakes.  We should make little individual cakes,  and then each father and son can maybe decorate them together.  Family comes first. This is my son.  This is important to me.  I got to do a thing at my son's school.  So I want to do, like, maybe mini cakes for each kid  -to do with their dad. -M ini cakes?  Yeah, like a little cake that each kid  could maybe put some polka dots and a bow on with their dad.  -How many? -15? 17?  Do 17 in case. A couple extra.  -17? -BUDD Y: 17 little cakes.  No problem.  BUDD Y: I try to spend time with my kids any way I can.  I love when my kids come to see me  because Daddy's always working real hard,  and they really love coming here.  Reminds me of when I was a little boy  and I used to come and see my dad.  He was always so busy,  but he always had the time to spend a little time with me.  I want the same for my kids.  Wow. You're a good baker, son.  M m, I love you.  All right, I want to do a little test with the fireworks.  We never put fireworks in cakes before.  I want to see how it melts, how it reacts, and this and that.  So this is kind of like a test run.  So, I told Frankie to go into the city  and get a couple fountains.  Fountains are kind of like a sparkler type of thing.  What I'm gonna do is I'll stick this puppy inside here.  Let's take this sucker out back. Let's go.  All right, Mauro, bring the half rack!  The whole bakery wants to come out  and see this firework happen.  Everybody back. I got this feeling we got to stand back.  BUDD Y: Maybe he's got a good idea.  Maybe I'm gonna light it and run.  All right, go ahead.  BUDD Y: It's a dud! It's a dud!  [ Explosion .]  MAN: That's a little too strong!  [ Laughter .]  BUDD Y: What the hell did you buy?!  The guy barely spoke English!  BUDD Y: I don't know what the hell Frankie bought.  There's friggin' cake everywhere!  It's all over the building. It's in Danny's hair.  Oh, my God!  BUDD Y: The rack was, like, all bent and discombobulated.  I was like, ""Are you kidding me?""  Frankie's cleaning this mess.  Frankie bought the wrong thing. He's cleaning it.  BUDD Y: Frankie, I can't believe you.  What I learned from this experience  is never send Frankie to go buy fireworks.  I got to leave the fireworks to the Gruccis,  and I got to leave the cake-making to the Valastros.  So that's what we got to do.  I remember when we used to get the fireworks,  'cause we used to have lots of fun.  I still remember that. The Roman candles.  Now the only thing you can buy are those little snapping things  that you throw at somebody's feet and they pop.  BUDD Y: Go get some.  Snaps are these little paper things that are --  I don't even know what they're filled with,  but when you throw it on the ground, they pop.  Go get some of those snaps.  Let's have a little fun with it.  All our buildings are done?  All right. Next.  We're gonna roll our fondant, okay?  And we're gonna use screens.  We go with a roller, and we color the windows  so that when you take the screen off,  only certain parts are colored.  Looks awesome, really not a hard technique,  but really shows up well on buildings.  The brick -- the same thing.  You lay the bricks out. You make the sheets.  You cut it and put the walls up.  Use the bricks as your guide.  Let's get the rectangle cutters,  and then we can put some windows on this one.  For the tar roofs on the buildings,  we take a piece of black fondant and cover that with poppy seeds.  It's a really quick technique  that makes the roof look like the real thing.  We're making the stadium  and using thousands of little candies  for the people in the stands.  We're making the flags and banners  out of modeling chocolate.  All right, give me all the buildings.  For Manhattan, my idea is to do the Empire State Building,  you got to do the Chrysler Building,  and I made generic buildings that just look like skyscrapers.  We're gonna do the Goldman Sachs building,  got to do Carlo's Bakery,  and we're gonna do a generic stadium.  So that's what's gonna be New Jersey.  Brooklyn's gonna have a little fireworks factory.  It's gonna have another generic building in the back,  and it's gonna have the Brooklyn Bridge.  That's nine buildings, a stadium, the bridge,  the Statue of Liberty -- I mean, this cake is huge!  Go ahead, pull.  Okay.  The Statue of Liberty's base on the bottom is gonna be cake.  Whoa.  The details on that friggin' thing was amazing.  It looked just like the Statue of Liberty.  Working on this fireworks cake --  really reminiscent of the good times,  and I want to have some fun with it.  So I'm like, ""Frankie, go get me some snaps. ""  [ Snaps popping .]  [ Snaps popping .]  -MARY: What is it?! -[ Laughs .]  -What's wrong? -You scared your aunt!  You gave her a heart attack!  I love to bother Mary because she always bothers me.  [ Snaps popping .]  [ Laughs .]  Buddy, you're not a kid! I'm telling Mama!  [ Laughs .]  I'm doing my work, Mom,  and he's throwing, like, fireworks at my feet.  He's burning my feet.  -Who?! -Your stupid son.  Why would he drop fireworks?  Don't you shoot any fire--  -[ Snaps popping .] -[ Screaming .]  Get out of here!  No, no. No, no, no, no, no!  [ Laughing .]  MAMA: Get up there! Go back to work!  All right, Mary? He's done! He's done!  He's done!  Let's take out the big one that's in there.  We'll put it right over here.  BUDD Y: We got all three landmasses  basically finished last night.  So it's time to pull them out of the refrigerators,  get them on the board, and get them wired for fireworks.  Now, Walt, she's done, so let's get her in the hole.  Put the wire through.  So what we do is run wires through each of the buildings  and down through the base of the cake.  Then, when we get to the event,  the Grucci family will hook up all the fireworks to the wires  at the top of the buildings.  And then the other end of the wire  is gonna be rigged up to some sort of electrical detonator.  MAURO: This is already through.  I already stuck them through. That's done.  We got to go, man. This cake is sweating.  MAURO: The fondant's getting soft.  The walls are starting to turn.  I know, I know, I know.  This fireworks cake is like a Catch-22.  I mean, the only place big enough  where we can build the fireworks cake is the oven room,  but it's hot as hell in there.  It's an oven room.  Heat and cakes don't mix.  What happens is you take something  that's in the refrigerator  and you take it out into a room that's 80 degrees.  The condensation -- The fondant starts to sweat.  As it sweats, things could peel off.  Okay.  We got to watch with the fondant, all right?  We got to see if any buildings, if any walls got to be replaced.  The Empire State Building --  The fondant's starting to peel off it because it's sweating.  If this happens, this could be a real disaster.  Whoa, whoa. Whoa.  Unh-unh-unh.  All right, we'll get another wall for there, Maur.  Empire State. Yeah.  The fondant problem was starting to get solved  because the fondant was drying.  We had the fans going, and it was drying it up.  So I repaired all the walls  on the Empire State Building that were peeling off.  And I told the guys to bring in  the rest of the buildings right away.  MAURO: Ready? One, two, three.  Put it down and slide it right over.  -That's the last building? -All the wires are in.  Let's put the water on now, guys.  We got to go thick with it, Maur.  On all the landmasses, we're gonna do streets.  We're gonna do lights, stop signs, little cars, boats.  We're gonna do grass, everything -- You name it.  Okay, ready?  Putting him right in front of the statue.  To honor M r. Grucci, I thought, what better than him sitting  at the base of the Statue of Liberty,  and he's gonna be holding, like, a fuse,  and looking like he's gonna light it up and let it go.  All right, guys. Come on down and check it out.  You got to see. It's totally awesome.  God, it's so beautiful!  Wow.  WOMAN: Oh, look at Grucci! [ Laughs .]  DAN I ELLA: Oh, my God. It looks so good!  -You like it? -I love it.  BUDD Y: There's so much detail, from huge buildings detailed  to the Statue of Liberty to tiny little taxicabs.  We just took everything you could possibly do on a cake  and molded it into one.  Good job, team! This is -- Listen.  This was a team effort.  Everybody put in. Everybody threw down.  We did a good job. I'm proud of all of youse.  Let's do this! Let's go!  Ready?  -MAN: Wait, wait, wait! -BUDD Y: Go in the car!  Watch your arms. Go straight.  Danny, get your arms straight. Watch your hands.  Grab the sides a little bit. Easy, Frankie.  Go up front!
