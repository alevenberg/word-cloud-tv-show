piping what i'm doing is taking black royal icing squeezing it through a tiny tiny tip and drawing designs on it when you're piping black onto white it's a one-shot deal there's no room for mistakes you put it it stays otherwise you have to take the fondant off and put a new fondant on any slip of the hands could cost you hours of work you really got to be on your a game all this stuff that i got on my plate i go to get a cup of coffee grace says to me there's an e-mail who could that be and the whole mary fiasco begins i get the e-mail and it basically says that you your big-mouthed sister

there budd y listen listen listen i don't want to hear anything i'm in the zone right now maria mcbride says i want some piping detail on the cake you know that's me i'm old-school i was born and bred on piping what i'm doing is taking black royal icing squeezing it through a tiny tiny tip and drawing designs on it when you're piping black onto white it's a one-shot deal there's no room for mistakes you put it it stays otherwise you have to take the fondant off and put a new fondant on any slip of the hands could cost you hours of work you really got to be on your a game all this stuff that i got on my plate i go to get a cup of coffee grace says to me there's an e-mail who could that be and the whole mary fiasco begins i get the e-mail and it basically says that you your

it aloud last week when i came into the store some rude big-mouthed blonde jumped down my throat for no reason i really don't even remember having an argument yeah but you're downstairs now grace tells me you're being rude to people buddy grace strolls in at whatever time she strolls in i'm helping customers she's answering e-mails it's not my fault i helped like 40 people listen okay and made every single one of them very happy enough mary enough listen i get this e-mail from a customer complaining about mary i confront her about it and she's mad at me just because she's my sister and i love her and i do and i feel that she does a lot of good she can't get away with being that way i got to get back to work the number-one target to me was the brides magazine cake and i started piping my heart out you know i'm piping like a madman and then things start to change i forget everything everything gets quiet i don't hear nothing you know exhales deeply i'm in my zone i could feel the stress coming off of my body just coming off me i was doing good mary earlier buddy called me into his office and accused me of being rude to a customer and i just wanted to end it because i thought it was so stupid if i did i would tell you promise me you're gonna make a conscious effort to be nicer i promise you but i don't remember being mean you know i love you we did hug each other and it's done it's over with aah laughs budd y i got all these cakes going on things are starting to fall in place and then there they go they got to stick me they said oh what about the boat cake i'm like oh my god i actually forgot about the boat cake all right remy get the boat all hands on deck let's go to the boat cake think boat buddy think sighs i kind of thought what would i like for a fishing boat and you know boom it popped in my head i see white blue and it's got some chrome on it a little fisherman guy fishing maybe we even put some fish on it i think some fish will look cool and i know what i got to do and i can nail this down so the first thing we had to do was carve the cake and we iced it in the fondant we got to start adding detail to it we had to make the doorway to the little cabin underneath the rails around the front and i had to put water and i used piping gel where i made it really crystal blue and i kind of did like a wavy pattern all over the cake we had a little bait box we had a tackle box a little cooler we had a fisherman all made out of modeling chocolate which means it's all edible and the more we put on it the nicer it looked it was coming awesome i love it makes us want to go fishing no woman it looks amazing oh my god it's thursday and i still got a lot a lot of cakes to finish but the number one on the list is the brides cake by far looks pretty good right this will be the back the big photo shoot's tomorrow i was skeptical about using the anemones as a topper cause they're more of a flat flower but to tell you the truth this actually worked beautiful buddy you outdid yourself man how do you do that budd y i finished i stepped back and i started to admire my work grace buddy have you a call on line one maria mcbride from brides magazine's
